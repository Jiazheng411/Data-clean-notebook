Now place a bunch of villains with super powers, plus one mighty pissed off innocent hero in the pot and you get Terry L. Vinson'sDesolation Island.The book begins with our main and lovable character Ben Thomason reminiscing with an old friend about the good ol' days when ass kicking and chasing villains was an 'honorable' job to have. As the conversation progresses, you experience his views on how the system has changed...but more than that you find out Ben is hiding out, framed for a murder he didn't commit.Immediately within several pages, a reader is thrust into a super fight...and I mean super strength fight with an unsuspecting foe for Ben.Defeated, enraged, and yet framed for another murder, he is now facing life at Desolation Island, the government's top secret 'Alcatrez' for super villains. This enclosure meets every single possible counter measure to fight the gifts these prisoners possess...but does it?Desolation Island was built on a secret plan to host a very mysterious entity, which only a few handpicked were privy to. Determined to unravel and discover the secret of this entity, a small squad of specialists enter this fortress. In a strange turn of events, Ben will be thrust for the fight of his life alongside some of his past friends and foes but more importantly, beside the gal he shunned not long ago.Terry bringsDesolation Islandto life with his individual character profiles, and one can't help but fall in love with Ben's egotistical, macho and sarcastic personae.

Believing Yucatan chicle’s rubber-like qualities could launch a rubber tire industry, the ambitious Santa Anna struck a deal with inventor Thomas Adams. Failing to concoct a rubber substitute from the springy sap, Adams instead succeeded with his licorice-flavored Black Jack gum. Consumers went wild, and other entrepreneurs leaped in, including, in 1893, William Wrigley. With free gum samples mailed to millions, Wrigley’s innovative ad campaigns made him one of America’s 10 wealthiest men. His factories produced 280 million sticks of gum weekly, which had far-reaching implications in the Yucatan jungles: \"The production and sale of chicle on the part of rebel Mayas Indians... was allowing them to buy arms to fight the Mexican government.\" American gum manufacturers were dependent on supplies from land controlled by the Mayan rebels, and since \"the geopolitics of hemispheric relations lies at the heart of the story of chewing gum,\" the book has 75 pages on military conflicts, impoverished forest workers, the chicle economy and international harvesting and production methods. With gum added to WWII service rations, 150 billion sticks were shipped overseas, but bubble gum synthetics brought the era of Mayan-harvested chicle to a close. While some readers may be interested in the book’s concluding chapters (which cover abandoned chicle camps, tourism possibilities and renewed interest in chicle for natural organic products), the omission of Bazooka’s contribution to the chewing gum world, as well as the book’s overall dry tone, take away from this book’s general appeal.

Daisy does all the really clever sleuthing, but she kindly allows her hubby to think he's putting things together himself. Things get tricky when one of the chief suspects, who may also be a blackmailer, disappears. And then there's the curious matter of the manner of death: the autopsy concludes that the Yeoman Warder died of a broken neck, so why was there also a partizan, or Yeoman Warder's halberd, sticking out of his back?

Following an extensive introduction on the formation of modern art theory, the Companion is organized chronologically so that readers can trace developments of visual art theory, from Classical and Medieval sources and modern conceptions of art as they have been theorized since the Renaissance, through to some current theoretical preoccupations.  In addition to outlining and describing various theoretical positions, the book's chapters articulate some assumptions that underpin them and raise more general questions about the nature of theorizing about art. In this way the Companion provides both an introduction to main themes of Western art theory and a source for critical enquiry into the purposes, possibilities and limitations of theory in the context of artistic practice.  The work can also be used alongside the three Art in Theory anthologies published by Blackwell, as a further art theory resource.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When April ends up on the wrong end of some nasty phone calls, a drive-by shooting and a boat explosion, Luke whisks her off in his luxurious pontoon boat where the inevitable love affair begins. Their idyllic respite is short-lived when they are discovered; soon, April is forced to draw upon her own resources to save herself.

Written partly to remind the world of the existence of Sir Winston Churchill's younger brother, Jack, and partly to clear away the myths shrouding the family's history, the narrative describes the impact of the boys' politician-father, Lord Randolph Churchill, and their mother, the beautiful and self-centered American-born Jennie Jerome Churchill, on Britain's society, politics and legacy. While Winston and Jack's parents were often unable to see beyond their own needs and ambitions, the boys absorbed a strong sense of family duty. Winston, by far the more flamboyant of the two, quickly captures the reader's attention, though Jack could accurately be described as the steadier, more serious sibling. The death of Lord Randolph Churchill, Jennie's multiple affairs and massive debts, the service of Winston and Jack in the Boer War and WWI, and Winston's rise to power in WWII provide a sometimes repetitive tale but one worthy of classical drama.

Rojcewicz shows how the issue of technology is situated at the very heart of Heidegger’s philosophical enterprise; especially for the late Heidegger, the philosophy of technology is a philosophy of Being, or of the gods.For Heidegger, technology is not applied knowledge, but the most basic knowledge, of which science, for example, is an application. The ultimate goal of this study, and, as Rojcewicz writes, of Heidegger’s thought, is practical: to find the appropriate response to the challenges of the modern age, to learn to live in a technological world without falling victim to the thrall of technological things.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When a local man is found beheaded, Eleanor realizes she's dealing with a human killer, not an otherworldly spirit. Meanwhile, a thief may be trying to steal a valuable illuminated manuscript from the priory. In a fascinating subplot, a handsome young monk, Thomas, hunts down the manuscript thief. Though committed to celibacy, 22-year-old Eleanor develops quite a crush on Thomas, who struggles with homosexual longings. The author subtly treats the erotic charge surrounding Eleanor and Thomas while shedding light on 13th-century understandings of sexuality.

He strongly sympathizes with Mary Surratt, who became the first woman executed by the U.S. government; although many female spies were caught, their gender saved them (it was not considered moral to hang women). Winkler argues that Surratt \"was not a spy and played no role on the night of Lincoln's assassination,\" but was hanged, along with three male collaborators of John Wilkes Booth, \"primarily because of the dogged determination, vindictiveness, and unforgiving actions of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.\" Winkler also includes an account of Harriet Tubman's services organizing slaves into a guerilla force behind enemy lines, but most of his stories are in a lighter vein, showing women using their charms to wheedle secrets from officers and soldiers. Although Winkler could have delved more deeply into gender issues in the 19th century, this effort entertains.(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

The authors, four Jesus Seminar Fellows, combine their brilliant scholarship with a clear and readable prose to present Paul s thought to our day with a vibrant freshness. In the process they free Paul from the creeds and doctrines that have for so long distorted his message. This is the best book on Paul I have ever read. --John Shelby Spong, Episcopal Bishop Emeritus of Newark, New JerseyWere the 13 letters in the New Testament ascribed to Paul s hand really written by Paul? Even in the letters that can be considered his, are there interpolations from a later hand that changed them significantly? In this brilliant new translation and introduction to Paul and his writings, the translators all fellows of the Jesus Seminar of scholars concerned with biblical authenticity attempt to answer these questions and to provide a dynamic rendering of Paul s letters that takes account of the mythic register of his language and the rhetorical flourishes of his style. They conclude that the extant authentic Pauline letters are 1 Thessalonians, Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Philemon, Philippians, and Romans, and these letters were likely written around the middle of the first century. In addition, the translators point out interpolations from later hands in the authentic letters, such as 1 Corinthians 13 (the famous love chapter). The translators arrange the letters in the chronological order in which they were most likely written. Given the exalted status of Paul and his writings, this exceptional new translation is sure to shatter some views of Paul s letters. --Publishers WeeklyIn The Authentic Letters of Paul, Dewey, Hoover, McGaughy, and Schmidt have given us one of the most deeply satisfying Christian reads of recent time. Paul and Pauline literature have rarely been so accessibly, judiciously, and cordially presented as they are here, much less so beneficially. This is a work to be savored and pondered, employed, shared and, ultimately, praised. --Phyllis Tickle, Publishers Weekly", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's a book of healing and remembrance, a book that refuses to ignore the history below our feet and the human beings who gave their lives so that we might live. Like Shearer, we are drawn into Cassy's life, like Shearer we imagine how it could have been, how it should have been, and how we hope it may never be again. (Rebecca Walker)It takes equal amounts of passion, talent and nerve to try to fathom a forgotten life. Through her determined efforts to unearth the history of a slave named Cassy, Judith Shearer brings to light difficult truths about race in America, and about the invisible bonds that make us who we are. (Cathleen Medwick)Shearer's bookAll Bones Be Whitebrings Cassy back to life, and we learn about the extenuating circumstances of what happened that day long ago. Shearer above all shows us Cassy's humanity. We feel as if we're right there with her in her jail cell as Cassy tells us her story, in her simple affecting way. It's a story of a human spirit standing up to power. Even in defeat, the dignity of that spirit remains. Cassy will haunt you, as she has me.

When he solves his problem by plagiarizing from a manuscript by a brilliant foreign colleague, he finds himself trapped in an impossible dilemma after the colleague unexpectedly decides to attend the conference. Mercier draws his readers into this dilemma in a narrative taut with lethal intentions, rich with literary and linguistic implications. The implications intensify as Perlmann weighs every syllable exchanged with his now-threatening but still naive and trusting colleague, striving to keep his scholarly theft hidden, his reputation unscathed, yet hating his own deviousness. As they share agonizing days with the protagonist, readers plumb the depths of a mind endowed with rare power, a heart lacerated by tempestuous emotions. On the tightrope Perlmann walks—balancing guilt with self-justification, perilous dangers with desperate hopes—readers gain a perspective on how words unite and divide their speakers, how meanings and motives metamorphose in crossing the boundary of translation. That Mercier’s own acclaimed novel has itself traversed the boundary from German to English—thanks to the gifts of translator Whiteside—will occasion considerable gratitude among American readers. --Bryce Christensen", "related": ["B00F1IGYQK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was during her time in college that she decided to begin her first novel, \"I had these stories stored away in my head and had even sketched out some ideas during my studio time.  One day it dawned upon me that if I didn't write these stories down, then I would be the only one ever to enjoy them.  Furthermore, reading such works as Beowulf, The Mabinogi and The Second Battle of Maige Tuired in my Scandinavian and Celtic Studies courses only added fuel to the fire.\" Having a degree in art has also aided her in the creation of the world of Ethöes.  The cover images, the map of Oescienne and all of the artwork found on her website, www.oescienne.com, was done by the author. \"Having a picture, especially a map, helps me to visualize the story more completely.  I hope that the images I have placed on my site will help my readers get a better idea of what my world looks like.  Of course, you are always welcome to disregard them if the images you have in your head are better than the ones I offer.\"  Besides writing and drawing, Miss Johnson enjoys reading, gardening, camping and hiking.

Rather than being raised on a steady diet of carrots and peas, baby Jeremy was forced to learn facts from textbooks. His first word was, “Uzbekistan.” Throughout his childhood, Jeremy had a hard time making friends. When other kids wanted to play baseball, he wanted to instruct them about Henry VIII’s six wives. After a failed career as a standup comic and broadcaster, in 2000 Jeremy fittingly became a Social Studies teacher.

It continues the tradition of the Milan group and later systemic thinkers to examine the way a therapist's own thinking can block the process of therapy and lead to feeling stuck. The authors define and demonstrate the use of a concept in the therapeutic field: Irreverence, which allows therapists to free themselves from the limitations of their own theoretical schools of thought and the familiar hypotheses they apply to their client families. They illustrate their ideas with some very challenging family therapy cases, such as violence and incest, and include an interesting consultation with the staff caring for a hospitalized patient. The book also extends the notion of irreverence beyond therapy to the fields of training and research where its application is both fresh and profound.", "related": [], "rank": 2593378, "title": "Irreverence: A Strategy for Therapists' Survival (The Systemic Thinking and Practice Series)", "author": "Gianfranco Cecchin", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Smooth, affluent and charming his attitude towards\nhis \"roster\" girls, and his cynical pick-up routine initially made me\ndespise him; but his honesty and \"I am what I am\" philosophy was both\nengaging and endearing.   Bethany, Adam's love interest, is the voice\nof convention. She falls in love with Adam and tries to persuade him to adopt a\nlife of monogamy. Bethany's main concern is that she not appear\n\"judgmental\". Adam tries to show her that being judgmental is a\nnatural part of being human, but this minor difference foreshadows much greater\ndivisions to come. In the first half of the book Mike depicts Bethany as\nsomeone who is extremely beautiful and intelligent, a paragon of female beauty.\nIn the second half he deconstructs that image, showing Bethany to be as flawed\nas many of the characters she tries-and fails- not to judge.All in all, a wonderful, funny, challenging exploration of the rules of romantic\nrelationships.  I loved this book, 5/5", "related": [], "rank": 1432356, "title": "Secrets of The Elusive Lover - Books 1 & 2: The Personal Journal of a Playboy", "author": "Mike Wells", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.625, "rating_total": 37.0}

He grew up in the city of Wellington, renown for its high winds and the almost magical ability of rain and sleet to be lifted off the street and blasted into one's face. After eighteen years of suffering the cold and wet, he was finally blown away in a particularly bad storm to settle far away as a student, for more years then most would ever admit to. Then finally when the universities pronounced him done he became an overqualified and underpaid worker in the health sector, (aren't we all). He has lived in the city of Rotorua, one of the very few places in the world where people have actually chosen to reside beside active geysers and breath air that reeks of sulphur, for the past fifteen years. He works by day for his daily bread by speaking to people about their various diarrhoeal illnesses. While at night he toils away on his books. When not engaged in his great passions of reading and writing science fiction and fantasy, drinking strong black coffee (some call it tar), and consuming copious amounts of chocolate (dark naturally), he lives a quiet life of contemplation as the high priest to his two cats. His duties include worshipping them with regular gifts of food, the occasional grooming and providing them with a warm dry place to sleep. They in turn look down upon him with typical feline disdain, but occasionally deign to bring him gifts of headless vermin, - as a warning. In a desperate bid to understand the meaning of his life, he has recently started studying philosophy, particularly metaphysics, and come to a startling conclusion.

Maybe if we punished them, it would never happen again.I mulled over this situation for a couple of years, and then I decided to see if I could write the story.  My feeling is that Maricela and Matthew both exhibit reactions that I would have.  One would be to escape and leave and try to imagine that it never happened.  The other would be to stay and try to go on.  Try to live. Hold on tight.

Most enjoyable it is -- as if listening to it all over a beer at a bar in Bangkok, Saigon, or Phnom Penh. A great read, a great experience. It takes you there -- you won't want to come back.

They also contain some marvelously inventive writing, reflecting the editor’s belief that “the goal of writing or reading fiction is to imagine something not already known.” Beth Tashery Shannon’s story sings the praises of the sowbug (“There it gos. Withall its toes, look at em wiggle like a narmadillo”) in an enchanting, made-up language. In “Downwind,” a reticent black housekeeper recounts her employer’s protracted death from cancer, describing the slow, sad march with a searing lyricism. And in “Love in a Changing Neighborhood,” two lonely, asocial people find within each other the wherewithal to make a wonderful life together despite what outward appearances might suggest. The collection includes stories by well-known writers such as Alice McDermott and Lydia Davis as well as talented newcomers such as Anthony Varallo and Ellen Papazian MacBain. It also puts on rich display a wide variety of writing styles, from tender realism to disturbing metafiction. A real treat for language lovers. --Joanne Wilkinson", "related": [], "rank": 1469500, "title": "The Long Meanwhile: Stories of Arrival and Departure", "author": "Shelley Jackson", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Reverend Catherine holds a Masters in Specialized Ministry and a Masters in Alcohol and Drug Ministry.  Rev. Catherine was ordained as a community minister by the Delaware Unitarian Universalist Fellowship.

Barnett’s teacher, Rabbi Chaim Kreuzer, recommended him, but Barnett turned down the match. He could not understand how his rabbi, a lover of Zion who had always encouraged his students to settle in the Land of Israel, could send him to London. Ultimately, with the rabbi’s blessing, Barnett in 1865 agreed to go to London, on condition that it would be only a temporary way station en route to aliyah. And indeed, after seven years in London, during which time Barnett received British citizenship (October 1871), he took his wife and their one-year-old daughter, Hannah, and moved to Jerusalem (December 1871).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Horrors come for kids, too\" is a lesson Lucretia \"Loochie\" Gardner learns the hard way in this gripping novella. Loochie is a plucky 12-year-old from Queens living in an apartment complex rife with rumored creatures from the underworld. She struggles to come to terms with her best friend Sunny's ongoing battle with cancer, as the two have been inseparable for years. When Sunny returns home from her latest round of treatment, the girls make a plan to hang out at Loochie's--without parental supervision. But Sunny doesn't show, and Loochie dives into twisted waters in her quest to find her best friend. This fantastical tale by widely-praised novelist Victor LaValle is about children, but markedly for grownups. The author writes as though he too has faced the sobering horrors that childhood can contain. LaValle allows Loochie's heroism real complexity. Encounters with demented crackheads, winged rats and haunted playgrounds push Loochie to confront her many fears, but none are quite as scary as knowing she may lose Sunny forever.--Raya Jalabi", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 21, "rating_average": 3.619, "rating_total": 76.0}

These foods, which are often linked to health disorders such as candida and irritable bowel syndrome, can also be an underlying factor in more serious health problems.The book encourages you to build health by eating enough of the right kind of food at regular intervals.

Nolan, a retired thief, is 50-ish and legit now, owner of a successful shopping-mall restaurant in the Quad Cities on the Iowa-Illinois border. He even has a young, beautiful live-in assistant whom he'll probably marry soon. (For the taciturn Nolan, Sherry's \"in the top two\"; money will always be number one for him.) Nolan's new identity is threatened when Coleman Comfort, ex-crime confederate, reenters his life. Bearing a crazy grudge, Comfort is also after a big score: he kidnaps Sherry and forces Nolan to mastermind the heist of the whole shopping mall. Nolan suspects what we know from the start: that Comfort is a ruthless psychotic who does not leave living witnesses. As Nolan plans the heist he must also try and find Sherry. The end is bloody, if a bit pat, but readers will love the snappy pace, wonderful color (a shopping mall at its Christmas apogee) and rich cast of characters. Cole Comfort, handsome, paternal good ole boy with a disarming smle, is a terrific villain.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His own way included being a helicopter pilot, flying out to oil rigs in the North Sea during the mid nineteen seventies, an exciting time as new operating techniques were being evolved. After some eighteen months based in the Shetland Islands, the urge to wander surfaced (not to be confused with any urges connected with the lack of female company in the Shetlands) and a change of company found him based on the Claymore 'A' platform, flying a shuttle service around the Claymore and Piper fields. In 1979 an opportunity arose to work in the Far East occurred, which meant a move to Singapore. After four years of living in Singapore and working in Borneo (East Kalimantan) he was moved to Nigeria, taking wife and small daughter Pauline with him. A few years of Nigeria was enough and the family brought a pub in Peter's hometown of Winchester. The purchase was nicely timed to coincide with an economic downturn. This necessitated a return to flying, now with a small airline based in Alderney. Following the collapse of that airline, Peter joined an airline based in Guernsey and happily flew for them for several years. Marriage break-up led to a reevaluation of life, and Peter took a sabbatical and went sailing to the Caribbean for a couple of years. With no suitable work available there, he returned to helicopter flying (and Nigeria) for a year before joining another airline, based in Southampton. This led to him joining a British Airways offshoot company and an MSc in Aviation management led to a job as an air safety investigator. Ever-restless Peter trained as a hypnotherapist and started a practice in the Salisbury area with two partners. Following the decision to buy another boat and sail off into the sunset, Peter returned to flying for a final two years to 'top up' the cruising kitty. In May 2008 he left Guernsey, and after various adventures and misadventures, washed up on a reef in Fiji in May 2011. The boat (Troutbridge, a Broadblue 385 catamaran) has taken a year to rebuild and at the time of writing (July 2012) Peter and Troutbridge are getting ready to leave Fiji for more adventures. Peter has several manuscripts with a literary agent, including an illustrated childrens' book and 'Kittie Cracks Case' is his first venture into the world of self-publishing.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There are mermaids,giants, witches, along with creatures of the author's creation: Book Brownies - a special kind of Brownies who live in the Library and serve as guardians of the book of wisdom, Epistemon, Aerolis - tiny human-like creatures with wings, and many more. And there is the evil Carnelion and his cohorts who aid him in weaving a web of lies and deceit in his attempt to usurp power over Transadonians.An imaginative and endearing read.

Taggart is disgusted at being forced to give Cruikshank immunity for the rapes in exchange for the chance to end a cold-blooded murder-for-profit spree going back almost a decade, but he sees no reasonable alternative. Trusting fellow police in Vancouver to catch Virgil without his direct help, Taggart heads to Asia to offer himself up as live bait to the insurance-scam killers. What begins as a Coventry-esque fable about the conflict between worthy goals—stopping one rapist versus stopping a gang of ruthless killers—and the subsequent uncomfortable moral decisions forced on law enforcement develops into a standard action-film plot, complete with snappy Bond-like one-liners from Taggart. Having set up a potentially interesting conundrum in the seventh book in this series, Easton proves unequal to the task of actually exploring it, turning instead to the comforts of thrilling action and familiar clichés.

Kristin,\na teenaged girl of partly native American descent (Ute), leaves the home of her\nbrother and alcoholic father to search for her beloved mother, Christine, who\nhas left the family to answer her true calling as a healer to the Ute people.\nThis story so clearly portrays the adolescent longing for an estranged mother,\nthe loneliness of separation from family, and the desperation of a search that\nat times feels near to hopeless. But Kristin has a strong spirit and\nunquenchable determination to find her mother and her true heritage as a native\nAmerican. The hardships and obstacles she encounters every day of the journey\nhardens and also matures Kristin as she stands at the threshold of adulthood,\nbut what will she do when she meets the love of her life and must learn to\ntrust and surrender her heart again? Leigh Podgorski paints a scenic picture of\nthe Colorado mountain country and the Indian reservation in this beautiful,\nmemorable, coming of age story, which I consider excellent for young and older\nreaders alike. I applaud her unique storytelling talent and look forward to\nmore from this author.

I was discretely looking at them from far and according to their attitude, was imagining their conversations and was bursting out laughing!!! Later on, building self-confidence thanks to theater and tennis playing, I developed one of my aptitudes: my sense of humor! Sense of humor is very powerful but you need to learn to control it. It helped me gain friends, protect myself from my enemies, and understand that the world can be looked at from a different angle. My sens of humor taught me to put things into perspective and to stay positive. Today I am a fulfilled adult, loving my wife and our two beautiful boys. My children are immersed in my sense of humor which I use to make them respect the rules at home more smoothly but as well to show them they can look at things differently.

One ghost who believed they only belonged in the shadows. \"Memories faded. Ghosts laid to rest. One life, over. A darkphoenix has risen from the ashes of a fresh grave.\" With \"in a Valley... A Writer's New Beginning\", A new book and story has begun. How it will be written, I have no idea. No person knows what will happen from one moment to the next. I wrote all this for one reason: I want to know that what you see with me is real. The person in the photos is who you would see on the street. The words written are who you would talk to. I know professionalism sells books and everything. My style, to a point. Realism, the moment as it happens, is more believable and is never repeated. One last thing, a quote I live by and is great advice to everyone: \"Life is not about what we do. It's about who we are. Never losing sight of our dreams. Having the courage to go after them, not matter what the odds. Believing in our dreams and ourselves, even when no one else does.\" Be safe in the night and always, Michael Phoenix Almost forgot: mandatory trational bio part: Hobbies: walking, reading, rock music, trying new things and ideas, writing, etc. Current projects: Vampire novel, tarot deck, reviews, movie in the 2nd half of year, another novel, recording and performing live 2 songs I wrote, learing a few instruments, for starters.

After some time working in Taiwan, it wasn't until the Spring of 2010 that he returned to Japan. Initially staying in Tokyo, he accepted a teaching position in the town of Tsuchiura in Ibaraki, about 50 miles north of the capital.At the time of the earthquake on 11 March 2011, Clive was in Central Tokyo. In the days following the disaster he managed to travel back into Ibaraki where there was a far greater level of destruction. His experiences and those of others he knew and met at that time, formed the inspiration for his debut novel 'Flowers From Fukushima'.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fiona Bruce  'A fascinating and beautifully written corrective to the many myths and false legends surrounding the issues of crime and punishment, from fraud to paedophilia. Nick Ross's book is an evidence-rich zone which our policy-makers  -  and we the citizens  -  would do well to spend some time in.' David Aaronovitch  'And I thought I'd never see it: a TV presenter developing a deep and thoughtful interest in his subject. Diving beneath the surface where cameras and autocue cannot follow, Nick Ross explores a theory of crime so simple and universal  -  and in its way obvious  -  that it's shocking. He has turned my assumptions upside down.' Matthew Parris This extraordinary book confronts assumptions that crime is caused by poverty or moral decay and instead reveals the true drivers of theft, violence and anti-social behaviour. It explains why crime rocketed and why it has fallen so precipitously. Most importantly 'Crime' sets out a wide-ranging strategy for revolutionising criminal and policing policy.

Later he was shown there the picture «The One and Only» which he described in his second book before the picture was revealed to the world.Vladimir started an independent life early and left the parents' house at the age of 16. Since 1974 he lived in Novosibirsk and worked as a photographer with Novosibirskoblfoto, a service company.At the beginning of Perestroika (reforms of the late 1980s) he was the president of the Inter-Regional Association of Siberian Entrepreneurs. In 1994-5 he organized two large-scale trade expeditions with a fleet of river steamers along the River Ob along the route Novosibirsk -- Salekhard -- Novosibirsk at his own expense. On this trip, an encounter with Anastasia in the Siberian taiga changed his entire life.It had been a secret for a long time for relatives and friends what made him, an entrepreneur with ten years experience, to pledge his property and spend his savings on unprofitable trading trips. The mystery was revealed in his books with Anastasia as the main character. Vladimir Megre brought something really invaluable from the trips.Throughout 1996-2006 nine books were written by Vladimir Megre (The Ringing Cedars of Russia Series: Anastasia, The Ringing Cedars of Russia, The Space of Love, Co-Creation, Who Are We?, Book of Kin, The Energy of Life, The New Civilization, Rites of Love).In 2011 the author became Laureate of Gusi Peace Prize.", "related": ["B00C7Q72IS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Who doyou know that doesn't get into the conversation of didMarilyn Monroe kill herself or was she murdered? No matterwhat side of that question you're on, the debate is always agood one. In that light, we decided to see if a book could bewritten about her and 'what she knew' about politics, themafia, and Hollywood. What inner workings and connectionsdid they have in common? The question was so intriguingthat we decided to carry it to its logical conclusion. Eventhough it was well known that she'd had an affair with JohnKennedy, no one really understood the depth of thatrelationship or where it could have eventually lead themboth.She knew too much and was far from being the \"dumbblonde\" she portrayed in her films. After all, in her ownwords she could hardly play an intelligent role and be takenseriously with her looks. So she did what any woman with ahundred and sixty IQ would do - she played a lifetime roleand played it well. Until one fateful night when she revealedthat she knew something she shouldn't to someone whoneeded that information kept secret.It has lately been revealed that she was murdered and inthat light we've written our own version of \"What She Knew.\"", "related": [], "rank": 1164086, "title": "Fateful Night: What She Knew Book 1 (What She Knew Trilogy)", "author": "K.

Last summer he introduced Dick Allen, Connecticut’s Poet Laureate, at the Sunken Garden Poetry Festival, presenting a lecture and discussion session prior to the reading.

For Ann Birstein, she had no choice: it was simply time \"to see for myself those terrible places.\" In this raw and mesmerizing account of her incongruously named \"European Discovery Tour,\" Birstein learns the awful mathematics of the Holocaust--how Poland, for example, is home to just a few thousand Jews, down from three and a half million before World War II. As such \"terrible population statistics\" add up, the numbers become \"impossible to assimilate.\" At one point the tour group stands at the edge of a mass grave in which ten thousand Jews were buried. \"How had they all fit in here?\" Birstein asks. \"Who had counted?\" Birstein feels disconnected from modern Poland and Hungary--\"A busful of Jews in a hostile, gentile universe\"--and the beautiful cities of Eastern Europe all seem tainted and unlovable. Even a sunset cruise down the Danube turns somber when the tour guide points out the beautiful homes once owned by Jewish families, and explains that they were all shot and thrown into the river. \"Were they still down there, clothes and all?\" Birstein wonders. Yet, by the end of the soul-wrenching journey, she finally realizes that after the death camps, cemeteries, and cities of slaughter, what she's ultimately discovered is a glimpse into lives once lived, and a comforting sense that the long-deceased victims existed, and mattered--\"real people with real houses, real clothes, real food, real families...and I loved them more and more, not for what had been done to them but for who they were.\"--Neal Thompson", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Aside from reading, a favourite past time, she spent most of her time legging it to the beach, swimming, and exploring some of the many outer islands. She was an imaginative child who enjoyed writing and making up fantasy worlds. When she was twelve, she was told to write an original fairy story. Her teacher graded this piece of creative writing with a zero, because she didn't believe that Sulin had actually written it herself. After challenging the teacher to find a story similar to what she had written, the teacher finally acquiesced and gave her an A+. Sulin graduated from university with a BA in Computing Science and Information Systems and began travelling the world. In 2000, she travelled to England for work, moving onto Ireland before returning to her beloved Fiji in 2008. She was struck by the travel bug once more and moved to the Czech Republic, where she is currently living. During her time in England, she indulged her passion for writing by creating manga-influenced science fiction stories for her own pleasure. Those stories were the genesis of her first novel, Ice Phoenix. \"I write for myself, creating worlds which I would like to see in my lifetime. That will probably not happen!\" Sulin Young.

Pat hated reading as a kid, but to pass her grades, she had to read one book and do a story on it.  “The Good Earth” was the very first novel that sparked her interest in reading and got her through high school, English Honors 101 (no less).  Pat published her first poem “Kelly” in 1985 in the local newspapers and the Legislative Gazette in Albany, New York.  To her credit, going back to college at forty-five years of age, she won second place in the College Literature yearly playwriting contest for “The Receptionist” (Naturally, about her jolly, loveable friend, Rosie Piti-Moscella).  Pat loves John Grisham, Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, Mary Higgins Clark, Patricia Cornwell and so many other mystery writers. This book is special for Pat.  It’s sending a message that she always wanted to teach her kids to remember, especially long after she’s gone, “If they see that I can complete something, then they can do it, too—no matter what the challenge is.  They just have to know the difference between what is do-able and what is impossible; and this book was one of the do-ables.”", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dak Pek served as a base for U.S. border operations into Laos; thus, the North Vietnamese and local Vietcong targeted it, eventually taking over the camp but perishing in a B-52 carpet bombing strike. Bendell's stories of combat and life at Dak Pek are dramatic, but several lack transitions--one tale of his being taken prisoner is never even resolved. Moreover, liberal use of verbatim dialogue and interior monologue is suspect. Vietnam buffs, however, may overlook these faults and glean some insights into the brave, fierce Montagnards, many of whom fought with the Americans. Bendell describes the history of the Montagnard resistance movement and confesses to childhood dreams \"about being the white man taken in by a proud tribe of warriors\"; he took a Montagnard lover and now serves as an adviser to the movement.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 1573631, "title": "The B-52 Overture (Vietnam War Book 2)", "author": "Don Bendell", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Especially history that occurred in areas such as my hometown. A Revolutionary War Battle took place near where I grew up. From a very early age, I visited the National Park occasionally, where I could walk the trails, see the monuments and grave sites, and let my imagination run wild. As I got a little older, my fascination with the Revolutionary War only increased. When I was taught in school about the Civil War, I quickly developed the same fascination. I would converse with anyone who would listen to my ramblings, and it didn’t matter to me which war we talked about.         At the age of fourteen, I met a man, a teacher, who seemed to have the same inherent interest and I guess you would say obsession with the Revolutionary War. I would sit and talk with Richard for hours. It took another fifty years for the seed to sprout, grow, and come to fruition, but better late than never. I fulfilled a life-long dream of writing a book.        The seed had been planted, but remained dormant for so many years. Being a teen, some things got pushed aside. I didn’t abandon my passion for history, just let it fall aside. Even though I began to replace some of the activities, with typical youth activities, I was still received an award from the Daughters of the American Revolution, for involvement in history, and promoting the historical facts of the Battle of Kings Mountain.      After finishing my education, I did as most everyone does, and entered the workforce. I was married to my lovely wife and we were blessed with three children. I was working a public job, struggling to get along. We moved away from Kings Mountain. I never lost my fascination for the Revolutionary War or the history of the United States.  Always in the back of my mind, I could still hear Richard say, “you need to write a book.”  In December of 2012, illness forced me to take some time off work. As I sat at home, recovering, I thought, maybe this would be a good time to make my dream come true. I began to write my first book, writing about things I knew and loved. “King of the Mountain” was released September 16, 2013. I have continued with my interest, launching my second book in November 2013 and now releasing my third, \"A Season of Revenge\" the first of the series 'The Mound City Serial Murder Files.'", "related": ["B00CBJXM1M"], "rank": 3379467, "title": "A Season of Revenge (The Mound City Serial murder File Book 1)", "author": "PJ Dunn", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He graduated from Rider University in neighboring Lawrenceville. While he moved to Orlando, Florida more than a decade ago; Darren still considers himself a Jersey boy.  He jokes he can’t get the sarcasm out of his blood.        The diverse and abruptly-honest culture of his upbringing has undeniably influenced Mr. Vanmorter’s writing.  His style depends more on dialogue to progress the story than narration. The self-discoveries made while conversing are far more revealing than a narrator’s narrow perspective. The dynamic interplay between individuals is enlightening, unexpected and often humorous. These are the aspects which draw the reader into the characters’ lives.      His first novel, The Better Boys and the Legend of the Loyalists’ Lode, is set mostly in Southern New Jersey.  The vast wilderness that is the Pine Barrens isn’t widely known by those outside of the state.  Like most forests, the Barrens can be both beautiful and frightening.  The history of the area is the foundation for the mystery elements of the book.  With its abundance of wood and sand, the Pine Barrens were the epicenter of glassmaking during America’s colonial times.  Many of the historical battles of the American Revolutionary War occurred nearby.  This rich tapestry is woven with the exuberance of modern day teenagers to create a thrilling murder mystery and classic treasure hunt. The contemporary addition of fantastical super powers accidentally activated by two boys attending summer camp enhances the entertainment value.  But it is the budding friendship of the two insecure 14 year old boys, and how they change, that is the heart of the novel.", "related": [], "rank": 2065386, "title": "The Better Boys and the Legend of the Loyalists' Lode", "author": "DK Vanmorter", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This insightful book walks you through your journey to awareness, and your power to create. An artist can create anything. She can paint the beauty of a sunset or the horror of a scream. From a rock, she can bring forth a \"Pieta\" or \"The Thinker\". She can write the music for a single violin or an entire orchestra. She can dance the night away. There are no limits to what an artist can create.You are the artist. Yes, you! You are the creator of your own life. You create the horror, the pain, and the misery. You also create the beauty and the joy. You create most of it subconsciously. However, like the artist, you can take charge of your creation and decide, consciously, what you want in your life. We all have the ability to be self-aware. It is a conscious exercise, not a metaphysical gift. Using the right side of your brain, you can consciously activate the power of the artist inside of you, and create your life as you want it to be.Specific exercises, and the personal story of the author, guide your own process. Just keep in mind that it is indeed a process. Have patience with yourself, and compassion.Welcome to a journey of discovery--of your true self and your power!", "related": [], "rank": 2741706, "title": "Access Your Power - Learn to Use It to Re-Create Your Life", "author": "Sophia von Wrangell", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I thank you all for having the courage and willingness to share our history and heritage. I hope you pass it on for generations to come -never forgetting how we all became a strong andunited family - forever! -- Barbara Post-AskinInterview fromReal Answers - Real Authors:\"Reflections of Liberty: a Memoir\"by Barbara Post-AskinBarbara Post-Askin was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. She married the love of her life, David Askin, and their lasting love brought them three beautiful children, to carry on their legacy. After the birth of their children, Marc, Shelley and Lawrence, Barbara became an accomplished estate planner in the state of New York. She currently resides in Tampa, Florida.RARA:Why did you decide to publish your book?Barbara:I wanted to showcase the brave and resilient America our relatives immigrated and assimilated into. Their sacrifices and accomplishments became part of the dreams that served as a magnet for freedom seekers throughout the world.I recently retired at age of 82 years young and I have always wanted to write this book. While I still have my wits, my hope is that my story of growing up during the depression and World War II only one generation ago, will never be forgotten!RARA:What titles have you published to date?Barbara:This is the only self-published book I have written so far,\"Reflections of Liberty\"memoir by Barbara Post-Askin.RARA:How are you currently marketing your book?Barbara:I have just started a Social Media campaign by partnering with Bluehost, Social Media Guys for my Facebook and Twitter. My EBook distribution is through Book Baby and my outlets are in Amazon, Barnes&Noble;, Apple iBook, Kobo, Copia, Gardners, Baker & Taylor, ESentral, Scrbd, Page PusherPrint platform is with Mira digital Publishing.  I will be on many social bookmark sites to cross promote Reflections of Liberty. In addition, PR Web will be useful for my media distribution.RARA:Are there any books or websites that you have found the most useful?Barbara:The most useful, was my education and life experiences in the course of my 82 years.The internet allowed me to verify my sources and provide me with a great sense of.... I'm not so old after all! This confirmed that my memory IS a computer chip!The world of tech has offered an outreach like no other. This IS the only thing I like in the tech world! Where one voice can make a difference -just in the click of a button! Most useful: Facebook, Twitter and most social media platforms.RARA:What has been your greatest challenge in self-publishing?Barbara:Not knowing the industry and how much it has changed, was my greatest challenge. Because the author doesn't have to sign up with a big publishing company to self- publish, a whole new world opens up for the reader and the writer. The ability to share your voice couldn't be easier, but its also harder because you have to stand out from others and the content must drive the audiences desire to listen.RARA:What is the best advice or tip you can give a new and aspiring author?Never say: \"I wish I could'a, should'a would'a\".... just do It!!!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
