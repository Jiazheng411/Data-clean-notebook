From her trips to the Caribbean, Sikes has written many feature articles and taken numerous photographs that have been published in newspapers and magazines. Some of her thousands of photographs and slides were source materials for the Tropical Fantasies series of large acrylic paintings. In the mid-1980s, thirteen paintings from this series were purchased by the Marriott Hotel in Richmond, Virginia for display in public areas.

During the early 1990s, I marketed an outdoors product I invented and that I formed a small corporation to patent, manufacture and sell called the \"Rod Floater\" (now a registered Trademark). I traveled the U.S. making presentations to groups of Wal-Mart zone and district managers and received authorization to sell the product in two regions of Wal-Mart stores for five years. I also sold the product to Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's and Academy Stores, all of which still carry the product and I landed a national promotion for the product with Kerr-McGee Oil Company who began using the product to promote their outboard motor oil in 1992. In 1996 I licensed the product to TTI-Blakemore, a major fishing tackle conglomerate, from which I am still paid royalties from sales of the product. I invented and marketed five additional outdoors products, also getting these into Wal-Mart stores and afterward sold them outright rather than licensing them. I learned a great deal about invention marketing during those years and was privileged to meet the CEOs of many well-known companies. I was also invited for television and radio appearances and met with the T.V. hosts of many fishing shows and was featured in the May 2001 issue of Inventors digest magazine. I received a diploma from Liberty University for completion of theological studies in 1996. I served as a youth minister, Bible teacher and guest speaker in fundamental, evangelical Christian churches, from 1983 to 2001. In 2003 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism; \"Hashimoto's thyroiditis\" being the cause. This autoimmune form of thyroid disease that causes destruction of the thyroid gland resulted in my also developing \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\", due to a compromised immune system with severe co-morbid \"Adrenal Fatigue\". I also suffered severe anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks early into the onset of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Hashitoxicosis). Writing became a therapy to help me cope with my health issues and has since also become a profession for me. These types of issues were also inspiration for me to become proactive in my own health care and to self-educate myself on these health disorders, which I have done extensively since 2003. I now enjoy sharing this information with other patients through books and audios I have published.  I also enjoy occasionally delving into short story and science fiction writing.", "related": [], "rank": 3227062, "title": "Big Mo and Spotted Wolf", "author": "James M.

At school the kids are told that those who can earn or collect $20 or more for the new children's wing of the community hospital will have their choice of all the strawberry treats they can eat or be in the parade. The kids begin projects on their own but learn that they can earn more money working together in a car-wash business. Bullies down the street are upset by the competition, but the dispute is resolved by a water-balloon fight and more business.

Hanlon ably demonstrates how to apply useful methodologies to the study of contemporary metropolitan geography.\" David L. Phillips, Professor Urban and Environmental Planning, University of Virginia \"[Hanlon] offer[s] a detailed analysis of the inner-ring suburbs of the 100 largest urban areas and a comprehensive overview of the research to date on the forces shaping these communities...She provides detailed case studies of Dundulk, Maryland, and Cleveland Heights, Ohio, which exemplify some of the problems facing these vulnerable inner-ring communities... This book serves as the most comprehensive view to date of the state of the inner-ring suburbs.\" City and Community \"Hanlon's book...is well researched and clear in focus. It's also very timely, given the state of the housing market in the United States, and the evolving sense of place that is changing for aging suburbs as well as certain neighborhoods in certain cities - especially the aging, industrial urban areas of the Northeast and, to a lesser degree, the upper Midwest.\" Plan Philly \"This book will be useful for courses covering metropolitan or suburban development, courses that are increasingly offered in urban studies programs. In compact form, it synthesizes much of what we know about patterns of development and decline in U.S. urban regions. It provides a useful summary of much of the literature on older suburbs. A particularly helpful feature for students and other newcomers to the topic is a full-page table summarizing the results of over a dozen important studies on the topic. Hanlon makes skillful use of concrete examples found in specific suburbs around the United States to illustrate points she is making.\" Contemporary Sociology, January 2012 \"Hanlon's study is theoretically informed, empirically rich, and carefully assesses its findings. In fact, the book may set a new standard in research on contemporary suburban developments in North America... Once the American Dream is an extremely welcome addition to the existing stock of literature on the suburbs. Moreover, it offers a new understanding of the contemporary role and status of U.S. Suburbs...which has scarcely been addressed before. In just under 200 pages, it concisely presents dense and carefully developed content.

Yoga practice takes an individual on an inward journey, and through Yoga, one enters a rarefied state of consciousness, a transparency and luminosity described by its great philosopher Patañjali as being \"like a clear jewel.\" Exploring Yoga through the prism of practice, Chapple begins with a historical overview of the many Yogic traditions in Indian religions. He continues with Yoga practice and the philosophy of Samkhya and then, in step-by-step fashion, he brings the reader to an understanding of the ethics of Yoga, the role of movement and breath, and the processes of concentration and meditation. Finally, building on the root metaphor of luminosity and light, Chapple explains the applications of Yoga in daily life.Yoga and the Luminousalso includes a word-by-word translation of Patañjali's Yoga Sutra, the foundational text of Yoga philosophy and a system of ethical practice and bodily purification. The translation is accompanied by an analysis that traces key ideas through the text, such as the reversal of mental and sensory outflows and the theme of spiritual discernment. Chapple also gives special attention to the feminine in the description of Yoga practices.\"Yoga and the Luminousis a welcome addition to the growing literature on Yoga. This excellent book will be of great value to scholars, practitioners of Yoga, and those interested in how Yoga can be applied to some of the important issues of our time.\" -- Gerald James Larson, Tagore Professor Emeritus, Indiana University at Bloomington, and Professor Emeritus, University of California at Santa Barbara\"This book is based not only on a deep understanding of the Yoga Sutra in its Jaina and Buddhist intellectual context but also on a lifetime of practicing the text. The result is a combination of intellectual insight and practical understanding written in clear English that communicates effectively to a wide range of readers.\" -- Harold Coward author ofThe Perfectibility of Human Nature in Eastern and Western Thought", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She is a self-taught programmer and was the first student at SJSU to complete her thesis as an interactive work of fiction. After meeting her husband and frequent co-author, John E. Miller, she began role-playing. Many of their story ideas and characters emerge during a game of Dungeons and Dragons, Call of Cthulhu, or World of Darkness. However, the mythos of their world is their own. Rachelle writes fantasy, paranormal urban fantasy, and a bit of horror. She and John are the authors of two short story collections: Bones of the Woods and Mind of a Mad Man. They are also the authors of the Dime Store Novel urban fantasy series. Rachelle has published several short stories in anthologies. Her latest was \"The Rescue,\" published in The Bitter End: Tales of Nautical Terror. Rachelle also writes training courses and certification prep materials for programmers, network administrators, and computer support professionals. Rachelle lives with her husband in rural Missouri. They raise cattle and donkeys. They are devoted to their dogs...who pretty much run the household. She enjoys a good dry wine, immersing herself in a book, dancing, and long walks in the woods. She has recently taken up quilting. She blogs at http://rachelleandjohn.blogspot.com.

Present-day New York City is entwined with 3rd century Ireland by their respective inhabitants, Michaela Sommers and Maecha Ruadh Mac Art, heiress to the throne of Tara. Michaela is involved in a search for the drug lord who killed her father, Police Narcotics Officer Jack Sommers, while Maecha is about to embark on a voyage to Alba (ancient Scotland) to free her father, King Cormac, who had been kidnapped by the Picts. The two worlds are connected by the dream travel of Michaela, the chief druid Finnius Amergin, and Natalie, a child who exists in NYC but is destined to save ancient Ireland from ruin. Cammarata's keen knowledge of Celtic lore and skill in martial arts combine to create an exciting story of ancient battles, gods and magic, honor, loyalty and love. Young adults who love a good adventure story will certainly love this one. While Eyes of the Goddess can be read as a stand-alone, readers will want to start with Warriors Within to experience the full epic tale. --Joan Weiskotten, Young Adult Librarian, Clifton Park-Halfmoon Public LibraryCammarata's action packed storytelling never lets up. The urgency of the pacing draws the reader into Maecha's world quickly, but it is the fierceness of her loyalty and love that defines the narrative. Well-developed details ground the magical elements and make a world where people time travel in their dreams and are friends with gods believable. Jumping from the ancient past to modern day is at first jarring, but as the characters' lives weave together, their complicated relationships deepen the meaning of the story and give it a powerful sense of destiny fulfilled. ----The US Review of BooksJanine De Tillio Cammarata dreams us back into an age of wars and intrigues among gods, mortals and faerie folk in old Ireland, and reminds us that ancient dramas can interplay with modern lives. Her wild ride across time and dimensions is well-shod by good research. ---- Robert Moss, bestselling author of The Secret History of Dreaming and The Firekeeper", "related": [], "rank": 3200835, "title": "Eyes of the Goddess (Book Two of the Fianna Cycle)", "author": "Janine De Tillio Cammarata", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was a professional guest at the first World Science Fiction Convention in 1939. Despite his numerous appearances and solid writing, Rocklynne never quite achieved the fame of his contemporaries Robert A. Heinlein, L. Sprague DeCamp, and Isaac Asimov. His well known stories include 1938's \"The Men and the Mirror,\" which was part of his Colbie and Deverel series, and 1941's \"Time Wants a Skeleton\", which has been reprinted in several anthologies, including Asimov's Mammoth Book of Golden Age Science Fiction. Rocklynne partially retired from writing in the late 1950s, but made a notable return in the 1970s when his novelette \"Ching Witch!\" was included in Harlan Ellison's original anthology, Again, Dangerous Visions (1972). \"Ching Witch!\" was later nominated for a Nebula award.", "related": ["B004Z8S442"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I can see teachers wanting to share this one with their classes because its themes are simultaneously diverse and universal, but I also think it's a book for all ages to savour at home. Highly recommended.\"  --Jill Murphy (www.thebookbag.co.uk http://www.thebookbag.co.uk)\"From the first page I was drawn into this very real novel which has at its heart an ecological message.  The characters are truly believable and the language of this novel is poetic and beautiful.  For anyone with an interest in wildlife and conservation issues, I would strongly suggest they buy this debut novel by emerging writer Gill Lewis.  I hope it won't be her last book!\"  --Charlotte Westwood, 13, First News, The Weekly Newspaper for Kids", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Then, during a procession of monotonous, physically laborious day-jobs, his imagination leaped into motion, bringing together characters and locations of a world that would someday come to life on the pages of a book. In late 1998, Jason made his first attempt at writing, managing to complete a whole scene before returning once again to reality. A year and a half later, a spontaneous night-time conversation with his wife encouraged him to take his writing seriously and to keep on dreaming. Over the next seven years, Jason carved time out of the real world to live in an imaginary one of epic fantasy, science-fiction, and military/political conflict. The fruits of this labor would later become the first three books of the bestselling AWAKENED series. Due to the overwhelming support of readers around the world, Jason has continued his trajectory into make-believe, recently jumping from stable employment in the micro-electronics industry into the mysterious abyss of full-time writing. Living in Colorado with his beautiful wife and two children, Jason now spends the majority of his time fusing the best parts of his favorite genres into stories of internal struggle and triumph, friendship, betrayal, political alliances, and military conflict. If you'd like to follow along on Jason's journey or get behind the scenes info on the AWAKENED or WANDERING STARS series, you can find him on Facebook (jasontesar.com), Twitter (@jasontesar), on his blog (jasontesar.com), or send him an email at jasontesar@yahoo.com.", "related": ["B00I9E5G3U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 44, "rating_average": 4.3409, "rating_total": 191.0}

In a change of pace, this book is written by a public relations director, the man hired in 1965 to run the San Diego Zoo's TV show,Zoorama.He was also to write news releases, send photos, answer letters, and put on promotions. After one of his initial meetings with the zoo's director, in which author Seaton told the director that the zoo's brochure \"stunk\"--and then found out that the director had helped design it--he hit the ground running. After meeting an escaped gray kangaroo on a pathway, being told that the apes needed a shower (with Lifebuoy, no less), introducing Lassie to the sea lions, watching a keeper pick hay from a hippo's teeth, and arranging to ship reindeer droppings to a woman (she made jewelry from them), he felt like he belonged. Seaton's narrative is lighthearted, and all zoo-loving readers will appreciate his book.Nancy BentCopyright © American Library Association.

Trayectoría Desde niña siempre soñó con escribir grandes historias. No se animó a hacerlo hasta hace pocos años. Normalmente escribía para sus amigos y familiares, pero un día animada por ellos, principalmente por su abuelo, y por el sentimiento que tenía hacía lo que este le sugirió en su infancia al leer sus escritos, decidió compartir con todos nosotros lo que siempre le había gustado: su afición a la escritura. Su primera novela comenzó a ser escrita en julio de 2008 y terminada a mediados de noviembre de 2010, días más tarde, el 30 de noviembre de 2010, \"Abrazando el Olvido\" salió a la luz. Ante el tan complicado mundo editorial tradicional, Raquel tuvo que autopublicarse y seguir enviando su manuscrito a los certámenes y a las editoriales para poder ver cumplido algún día su gran sueño.  En la actualidad se encuentra trabajando en varios proyectos, aunque su próximo lanzamiento está previsto para el año 2013.

In fact, he asks her out to a carnival and\nshe agrees to go.For a time, life seems pretty good. She and\nDesmond are back together and she's friends with Roddai. Everything is\nfine until Desmond decides to get even with the guys who jumped him at\nthe Winter Carnival. This time, things don't go so well and Desmond is\nseriously hurt. Audrey's life falls apart. Desmond's death reveals\nsecrets he'd been keeping, even from her.Hag is an intense, real\nlife drama for teens. Gritty and hard hitting, Hag closely examines\nAudrey's situation and asks the question, \"What would you do if...?\"The characters in Hag are well fleshed out and seem authentic to the\nreader. Audrey is an especially good, three dimensional character. Her\ngrief and anger are very real. While we might not agree with her\nactions, we can see why she reacts in the way she does. She is tough,\nindependent, self-sufficient and doesn't rely on others to fight her\nbattles for her.I really enjoyed Hag is a great coming of age story for young adult readers 16+ and adults.

I could never have created such exquisite arguments between Angels and demons in all my wildest imagination.The body of work in this book is truly 100% non-fiction. I've written fiction and poetry my whole life so this was a new experience for me and one that I enjoyed.Going through this experience led me through many days of angel research, initially right with the Archangels themselves.

Skorczewski’s explorations touch upon very fundamental questions of identity and creativity.\"–PsycCRITIQUES\"Dawn Skorczewski explores this explosive material with delicacy and a sensitive hand. WhileAn Accident of Hopelimns the contours of Anne Sexton's deep-seated emotions – both the joy and the anguish – and the intertwined roots of her poetry, it simultaneously gives us a compelling read that never, ever, disappoints.\"- Linda Gray Sexton, author of Half in Love: Surviving the Legacy of SuicideandSearching for Mercy Street: My Journey Back to My Mother: Anne Sexton\"By combining close readings of Anne Sexton's poems, mid-20th-century cultural history, and reflections on the development of psychoanalytic theory and technique, Dawn Skorczewski has produced a richly contextualized interpretive account of the audio recordings of the last six months of the poet's treatment with psychiatrist Martin Orne.An Accident of Hopeamply demonstrates the mutually generative potential of literary and psychoanalytic texts and methodologies, while also reinforcing our sense of the propriety of Freud's oft-cited avowal that, wherever he went, he found that a poet had gotten there before him. Toggling back and forth between Sexton's poems and her taped conversations with Orne, Skorczewski reveals that, in certain ways, Sexton had a more forward-looking understanding than her doctor did of the psychotherapeutic relationship as a creative partnership.\"- Max Cavitch, University of Pennsylvania, USA \"InAn Accident of Hope, worlds creatively collide. Skorczewski composes a contrapuntal work of great force that resonates on several levels at once. Poems comment on intimate therapy encounters, and the encounters themselves reveal a patient trying to teach her beloved therapist how to listen to her and a therapist teetering between sexist and rigid theoretical analytic paradigms and a desire to nurture the creative human being in his care. Masterfully—and lyrically—connecting Sexton's poems, therapy sessions, and the therapeutic and cultural norms of the time, Skorczewski tells the tale of a great poet, a traumatized and traumatizing woman, and a patient whose challenges to her therapist foreshadow relational understandings of what harms and what heals.\"- Lynne Layton, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts, USA\"Dawn Skorczewski's responsiveness to the psychoanalytic narrative invites readers into an affecting study of the inner lives of men and women. With sophistication, care, and a literary style that makes for compelling reading, she draws readers into Dr. Martin Orne's tape recorded clinical treatment of the poet Anne Sexton. It is an unusual record of poetry and life woven from the fragility of creativity between the poet and the analyst. Nested in this commentary are the erotic tensions between North American psychoanalysis and the arts in the 1960s. Through the painful complications of childhood, adulthood, and illness, Skorczewski writes of love, hate, and sexuality; there is rare attunement to the backstage of lives in search of meaning. And new questions follow: Must one choose between art and life or between poetry and therapy? This book promises to open significant debate on the emotional conflicts of the imagination.\"- Deborah P. Britzman, York University, UK, and author of Freud and Education\"An Accident of Hopeoffers the reader insight into the workings of the mind of a patient who is fully aware of the importance of her relationship with her therapist, not only to free her from her demons but to give birth to her poetic creativity. Dawn Skorczewski succeeded in writing a book that is instructive, entertaining, and a captivating read. It is instructive because of the author's appreciation of how psychoanalytic theory of the 1960s had affected this treatment, and because in interpreting Sexton's poems she was able to establish the connection between Sexton's increasing insights into her turbulent inner world and what her poetry was successfully communicating. The easy, conversational style of writing is experienced as if the reader were a third person in Dr. Orne's consulting room. This is an extraordinary book that psychoanalysts and literary critics will find equally rewarding.\"- Anna Ornstein, University of Cincinnati, USA", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Then, when you turn around,\na figure in a hat and trench coat would suddenly appear and snap off some line,\nbefore it tried to wring the life out of you.Your feet would thrash as you were lifted off the ground.\nUnable to move or escape, desperation would kick in. Yet, it would be unable to\nprevent you from blacking out. The darkness would consume you.Now, imagine my surprise when that very scene was being\nplayed out in the distance. Some woman had the unfortunate luck to be wandering\naround at night--apparently she ignored the rumors that women had been vanishing\nfor the last few days--when a Ghoul began to hunt her down.It started off by making the street lamps flicker, which\nplaced her on edge. Ghouls loved flesh, but fear was a good appetizer. Next it\nwalked across her path on the opposite side of the street, dressed in a trench\ncoat that it probably took from one of its previous victims.She had her eyes on it--her hand was in her purse and ready\nto draw out some kind of weapon--but she figured it meant her no harm, just some\nguy walking down a road that minded his own business. She let out a sigh of\nrelief; the building fear began to settle.Then it made its move. Inhumane speed allowed it to appear\nbehind her soundlessly, until it was close enough to whisper in her ears. \"A\nlovely evening isn't it?\"She turned and caught a glimpse of its malevolent eyes. Her\nheart skipped a beat, and she stumbled back in a panic until she fell down. Her\nfear had skyrocketed, and the Ghoul had relished the sudden spike. It had been\nat this for sometime judging by its experience.Still, I had to give her credit when she pulled out a stun\ngun and shot the Ghoul in the face--the dead center of the forehead.The prongs embedded themselves in the decayed flesh and sparked. The clicking that sounded and the bolt\nthat danced between the prongs showed that it functioned perfectly. On a normal\ncreature, with a thin layer of flesh, it would have sent it into shock.But that's the thing about Ghouls--you needed a lot more\nelectricity than that to do anything to them. It shrugged them off and grabbed\nher by the throat, with its claw-like fingers.Her fear climaxed once she caught a glimpse of its whole\nface beneath the hat. Imagine seeing green eyes that held black irises, on a\nwrinkled face with no lips or nose, and yellow teeth...while decaying. When it\nran its tongue across the sulfur colored teeth, and she caught a whiff of its\nghastly breath, she vomited and tears fell from her eyes from the putridity.The Ghoul savored her terror sadistically, while she\nthrashed to regain her breath and the ability to scream. She was helpless and\ndying slowly. It didn't take a genius to guess that it would devour her.There wouldn't be much of a body left behind, if there was\nanything at all. It would be as if she just vanished.It was really something would have fitted right in at a\nhorror movie that weighed heavily on the cynical side. Unfortunately for the\nGhoul--and fortunately for her--I had seen enough.\"Undine Code: Frigid Spears.\"A female computerized voice announced\nthe spell in a low tone from my touch phone, as a neon blue magic square\nappeared in front of the device.The HUD screen changed from long distance observation mode,\nto one that stated the range and effective area of the soon-to-be-launched\nspell. I lined up the target personally, instead of relying on the auto-lock\nfeature to avoid a misfired shot.The center of the square was the alchemic symbol of water.\nIt was an upside down triangle that was decorated with an undine's silhouette\nwithin its center.\"Spell Setup.\" Four crystalline spears of jagged ice formed at the\npoints of the square, with a larger translucent spear at the center.The manual lock was fixed. My finger slid towards the button\non the bottom of the screen. Without hesitance I pressed it and the phone\nbucked in my hands.The spear at the center was released like a missile that\ncruised through the air. In less than the space of three seconds the Ghoul\ndropped the woman in shock. It fixated its eyes on the crystalline spear that\npenetrated its chest, and howled as the freed woman fled clumsily.The rest of the frozen spears were fired and rained down. Each\none gouged out huge chunks and scraps of flesh, which hung messily at the exit\npoints, as it punctured the torso and thighs. The tips of the minor spears\nended up embedded in the concrete sidewalk, while covered in visceral fluids.And it was still alive after all that. Ghouls were\nnotoriously hard to kill. To be thorough in killing it, I chose to use that\nparticular spellbecauseit had two\nphases.The viscera coated frozen spears crackled, while they\nremained erect in the ground for another second. After that, they erupted into blossoms\nof spikes. Branching out like sadistic skewers, they perforated the Ghoul until\nit looked like a pin cushion.I had seen that scenario countless time during my front on\nthe war. It was definitely dead now. What was left behind after going through\nthat couldn't be counted as a body anymore--it was little more than a pile of\nrotten meat that even stray dogs wouldn't eat.I closed the app and returned it to the virtual spell book.\nSwitching back to the phone's regular functions, I opened the text messenger to\nsend my report in. The message read:11: 47 PM, October 18th, 2012.One Ghoul--the suspected perpetrator of the recent killings--was caught\nin the act of attempting to kill a young woman, and was destroyed through the\nuse of an Anti-Unit spell. Requesting a standard cleanup at a protocol level of\n2.Signed,Leonardo Kouno.Overseer of Desmond City. The protocol level was only superficial damage, and maybe\nsome minor memory alterations for the victim at that number. Tracking her\nthrough the cameras stationed around the neighborhood, and subsequently\ndeleting the footage, would be child's play. I could finish that up tonight,\nwhile someone else dealt with the repairs to the sidewalk.I'd rather not tamper with her memories, but it would be\nbest for now. Better to make her think she was nearly mugged than eaten;\nespecially since the Ghoul's body had dried out and crumbled into a fine green\npowder--typical of the undead.I shuddered when the wind blew a chill, as I holstered the\nphone to my belt. The blue track suit I wore was made out of light fabric,\ndesigned so that it would breathe better. It may have been a bad idea to wear\nit in the fall season at night. If the network I had spread over this\nneighborhood hadn't gone off at the Ghoul's presence, I would have stayed in my\nhome where it was warm.Being a magus was tough sometimes. Sure, you get to use\nmagic, face monsters, and participate in a bloody and pointless war. But the\nhours were terrible.Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Leonardo Kouno. I'm\nanAveriusmagus, who uses magic from\ntechnology.Welcome to the new age.", "related": ["B00F7V28VG"], "rank": 3129572, "title": "Novum Aevum", "author": "R.

He spent ten years teaching in the inner city in Houston, and his last nine years in rural and suburban schools. He has grown uneasy by the continual downward trend in educational excellence in America.  He has noticed the sad tendancy of our social studies education to make kids think and act like socialists.  College professors have observed that the high school kids get to college knowing very little.  They know to recycle and to not smoke.  One college Humanities professor commented that he surveyed high school students who thought the most important job of the government was to \"create jobs.\"  This is the tragedy that the author laments.  The US government was given three important functions at its inception: first of all to protect citizens rights, secondly to protect our borders, thirdly to sign treaties to secure the prosperity of this great land and its people.  The author sees the results of a tragic-shift in our thinking propagated in our government schools. This is his first book.  He has had the opportunity to collect his thoughts and focus his classroom experience into this answer to the public educational program.  He has written this book for anyone who is disatisfied with our educational system, the deplorable state of our civic understanding, and the bankrupcy of our political discource.  He also has a special concern for kids leaving the churches, and the public schools for colleges and universities.  They are unequipped for the mental labyrinth they are entering.  This book is the trail of string to help them keep in touch with their faith, their identity, and their common sense.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Two years ago, just nine months after my wedding, I was diagnosed with cancer. Eight months after that, (and fifteen pounds lighter) I emerged from a chemotherapy haze and counted up the books I had read on my e-reader during recovery. Ninety-seven. I am a television addict and live by my DVR. I think Sherlock Holmes on Masterpiece Classics is the best show no one is watching and I have not missed any episodes of  Downton Abbey, Mad Men, True Blood or Mob Wives (like a hundred percent!).  I am also completely obsessed with anything royal and challenge anyone reading this to tell me something I don’t already know about the Tudor family. I recently discovered that my gazillion times great-grandfather was the constable of the Tower of London during Henry VIII’s reign.  But I am also not totally positive that I tracked the right predecessor on Ancestry.com.  My family, to whom I owe all my strength and courage, live in fifteen different cities. You can imagine what my phone bill must look like. My handsome hubby Kirk and I were married on California’s Central Coast, where my first books, The Edges Series, are set. During our wedding ceremony he promised to always love and take care of me, our golden retriever, Sam, and our seventeen year old collie mix, Jessy.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lisa lives in a small coastal town in Florida and enjoys kayaking in the Everglades. When Lisa is not writing, she is a flight attendant traveling all over the globe.

In fact, she created the cover and all the illustrations for \"The Underwear Dare\", using her married name, Gina Christoffel. As a child, her favorite books were: \"Where The Red Fern Grows\" and \"The Summer of The Monkeys\" by Wilson Rawls and all the books by Laura Ingalls Wilder. She loves dogs, especially beagles.

According to Gina, Lisa got all the good wall space and shelves! \"The Underwear Dare\" is their first novel.

A professor of Persian literature at the University of Chicago, he overstates the strengths of the authors he presents, most of whom are interesting for the view they afford of an evolving Iran rather than for their literary techniques. The first Persian short stories, according to Moayyad, were written in 1921 in Berlin; the grafting of traditions to produce social critiques sparked controversy in Iran but may seem heavy-handed or even cliched to contemporary American readers. Often, predictable or melodramatic endings mar otherwise intriguing works. On the other hand, four densely imaginative sketches by Gholam-Hosayn Nazari (b. 1933) and a portrait of a young woman uneasily embracing modernity, by Shahrnush Parsipur (b. 1947), stand out for their originality and well-modulated feeling.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Writing with dry wit, self-deprecating insight, and a readily accessible voice, Hatcher shares the discoveries he made as a relatively cloistered, postgrad American who found himself challenged intellectually and emotionally by material poverty and by believers who held an array of religious truths different from his own. The trope of mountain climbing as an irresistible call—and the presence of Mount Kilimanjaro as a proving ground—is fit smoothly into his social and political awakenings. Like Howard Thurman (With Head and Heart, 1979) and Gretel Ehrlich (A Match to the Heart, 1994), Hatcher not only illuminates his own life but the life of the reader as well.

InThe Era, Roger Kahn argues for 1947-57, no doubt the majority view, but Williams makes a strong case for the 1930s, when the Yankees, with Ruth and Gehrig, dominated the American League, and the Giants, led by Bill Terry, had their way in the National. Whether or not Williams wins the golden age argument, he does a tremendous job of resuscitating the reputation of the unfairly maligned Terry, whose .341 lifetime batting average as a player and multiple pennants as a manager weren't enough to overcome the ire of a group of angry writers (including Williams' father) who kept the Giant star out of the Hall of Fame for 11 years after his retirement. In Williams' full-bodied, anecdotal portrait, Terry emerges as the prototypical modern player--savvy about money, unwilling to accept the patriarchal approach of team owners to their employees, utterly frank in his dealings with reporters. \"Terry,\" Williams says, \"was the first important baseball figure to rebel against a star system created by and for reporters, and they responded by trying to make an example of him.\" This is excellent baseball history: judicious use of game accounts mixed with appropriate dollops of period ambience and authorial interpretation.Bill Ott", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When I was preparing the original Bible study series upon which this is based, I went to a local Christian bookstore and asked if they had any books about Agape love. The clerk took me to the marriage and family section. I tried to explain that I was referring to the type of unconditional love that Christians should have for everyone. He just stared at me and said, \"I don't think we have anything like that.\"On a whim, I asked him if he had anything about demons and the occult. He brightened up and took me to an entire bookcase full of materials on the subject. I found it sad that the store had no books on the love Christ commanded of us, but had so many books about dealing with demons.

I left the navy\nin 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I\nstarted and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to\nAntigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we\nmanage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in\nParadise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I\nwas 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by\nthen so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole\nfamily fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": ["B00JRGJL4Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I also dreamt of heroes and villains and the women that inspired the best and worst in them.It seemed like every book I read as a teen was a classic bodice-ripper. Wimpy-virgin-heroine always making bad choices and getting herself in trouble, cue the macho hero, yadda yadda yadda. Those books are what inspired me to write my own stories, not because I loved them, but because I constantly found myself tossing them aside and fuming. I would think of all the ways the story would have been better: if she had just picked up the sword and stabbed the bad guy when she had the chance...I LOVE writing, and I love the new direction that fiction has taken over the last decade. So many amazing, strong female leads now! And so many new writers that finally have a voice in the indie publishing community.I was blessed with a wonderful husband who supports my passion for writing and reading, and who really helped me focus my desire to publish my work. When I'm not busy enjoying my daughter and husband, I'm usually developing a new story idea, or sneaking in a bit of free time with my favorite authors.I'm a bit of a hermit, they called it being \"shy\" when I was a kid, but I love hearing from fans. I also love ferrets, hiking, chili dark chocolate, strong coffee, nursing mamas, and rain.​", "related": ["B00DLFP48Y"], "rank": 700770, "title": "A Taste For Moonlight (Beneath the Veil Book 2)", "author": "Aimee Roseland", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 35, "rating_average": 3.8, "rating_total": 133.0}

Of course you don’t! My hair is shorter now and no one who knows me would call me shy. My interest in writing piqued considerably when my eighth-grade English teacher read a student’s work aloud and then announced it was mine, and a fellow student looked at me wide-eyed and exclaimed, “YOU wrote that?” It didn’t hurt that he was cute and had never noticed me before.  I still get a thrill when I see my writing published. After years of writing programming code and technical documentation I quit my job and turned to what I call “early childhood education”: raising children. Now the children are older and I've found the time to write for fun, and it is fun or I wouldn’t be doing it, because I keep myself busy. I'm on the board of a non-profit, belong to the world's best writing group, play tennis, practice yoga, and travel when I can. I'm interested in cooking, gardening, the environment, and nutrition, and I'm an NPR podcast junkie. There are three signs tacked to my desk: “Stop Me Before I Volunteer Again”, “Ginger Rogers Did Everything Fred Astaire Did Only Backwards And In High Heels”, and “I’ll Try Being Nicer If You Try Being Smarter”. I have two completed novels and ideas for four more. Surprisingly, no agents have come to my door asking if I have any books I’d like published, so I'm doing it on my own.", "related": ["B00DD89CI2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I could\neasily picture someone reading it along with their child, or by herself with a\nnice cup of tea. Or coffee, whichever you prefer. The book is divided into the different topics, and going\ninto the Friendship poems, I was enjoying it more and more...Memory Scale I found very funny, something I (and I'm a ton\nof others) can definitely equate to! I loved the end--really made me laugh. I\nthink it's my favorite funny one!A Time of Love I really liked, as it spoke of those who go\nthrough the husband being away, serving his country, and returning, showing how\ntheir marriage endured through the years. It's something that I think about\noften. I have a great respect for those who serve our country.But what I found the most special was The Same. By far I\nthink this is the best poem in the book. It speaks about over the course of\ntime standing in the other's shoes, realizing the promise they made in their\nvows, and the pain that goes with truly bearing the worry and care of another\nthat you love. But the blessedness too, of knowing that now both completely\nunderstand what it is being as strong as the other needs you to be. It was very\nhonest, and true. Overall, this is a worthwhile book. I would certainly\nsuggest it to you. It doesn't pretend to be great literature, with polished\n\"mumbo jumbo\"--just shows that it's an honest work of heart from another human\nbeing, with its simple words. That is something we all relate to, respect. We\ncan take encouragement from that. So if you are interested in this book, and\nyou like poetry that is good for sitting in the lawn chair and reading, I\nsuggest you buy this. It is worthwhile.\" -Elora Shore, Pendragon blog", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His mind was foggy in those first few\nmoments he hovered between sleep and awareness, but he soon saw mental\npictures of all the sex acts he'd been instructed to perform by the\nduke.  Adam had made his way around the table, pleasuring guest after\nguest until the duke had been pleased.  And then his new master had\nbrought him upstairs to the duke's bedchamber to bathe, and there the\nduke had taken Adam's body for the third time that night.Adam's body was sore from overuse, but he felt more alive in that moment\n than he had in weeks.  His eyes flew open, and he gazed about the room,\n but saw he was alone.  The duke must have left him not long ago.  When\nAdam pressed his hand to the pillow beside him, he still felt warmth.He rose from the bed just as a liveried servant came in with a platter of food, followed by Sebastian, the duke's steward.\"Good, you're awake.  His Grace wants to take a morning ride.  You're to\n be dressed to the duke's request and then follow me down to the\nstables.  You may eat as I dress you.\"Dressed to the duke's request?  Adam's mind swirled as he thought back\nto the night before when the duke had demanded he dress like a woman in\nstays and stockings under a gown, wig, and makeup.  The duke was\ndepraved, and Adam had railed against it, but had soon learned he rather\n liked the change in appearance.  He wasn't the type of fop to flounce\naround and act foolish, but behind the walls of the duke's manor, he\nfelt safe to do as his new master requested.  Would the Duke of\nCollingsworth ask for him to don female apparel once more?Adam allowed the sheets to fall from his nude body as he stood and\nwalked to the small table with the food upon it.  He took the first bite\n of food as the steward brought the tight stays out of the armoire, and\nAdam lifted his arms through the holes.  Sebastian tightened the laces\nin the back, once again making it harder for Adam to breathe.  As Adam\nlifted a slice of ham to his lips, the servant rolled a pair of\nstockings up one leg and fastened them with silk ties sewn into the top.\n  The other was added before Adam was urged to sit at the vanity.The steward quickly shaved Adam's face to make it smooth for the makeup\nto be applied.  Heavy white powder was then placed all over, then rouge\nadded to his lips and cheeks and black kohl around his eyes.  Another\nsmaller white wig was pulled tight over his scalp just before the\nsteward placed shorter length female riding boots over his feet.\nSebastian moved to the door and paused, turning to look at Adam.\"No gown?  Am I to go out half dressed, Sebastian?\"Sebastian showed no emotion, only looked ahead as he spoke soberly.  \"This is what the duke requested you be adorned in.\"", "related": ["B00HOXVREY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Steve Yates s well-drawn cast of characters tracks love into its darkest corners with astonishing results. This wildly imagined, wise book surprises in the best way possible until the very last page. --Sabina Murray, author of The Caprices and Tales of the New WorldSome Kinds of Love is nothing short of masterful. You would think this was the work of not one but a dozen writers, so impressive is Yates s range of subject, setting, mood, and effect, from the quiet, ghastly intrigue of Hunter, Seeker to the blowout hilarity of the Green Tomato Marquesa s triumph. In Steve Yates s stories, pigs really do fly. He is a brilliant, and brilliantly inventive, writer, and this book is sheer delight from beginning to end. --Ben Fountain, author of Billy Lynn s Long Halftime WalkSteve Yates s stories have that far-underrated quality: range. Yates writes across genres, cultures, sexual borders, and always brings it home. The stories are funny, sad, sometimes wonderfully odd, always inventive and intelligent. Yates is a truly fresh and interesting voice in a time when too often we seem to celebrate the flashy fiction of me, me, me. --Brad Watson, author of Aliens in the Prime of Their LivesThe language is totally unlike anything used by myself or any other writer of Ozarks fiction. [Yates's] new style is magic realism at its best. --Donald Harington, author of The The Architecture of the Arkansas OzarksIn this new collection, Steve Yates exhibits the best kind of ambition in other words, he s willing to take some big risks. Just when you think you know what s coming, he throws you for yet another loop. I admire his work wholeheartedly, and I hope this book gets all the attention that it and the author deserve. Yates is one tremendous writer. --Steve Yarbrough, author of Safe from the NeighborsYou only have to read one of these stories to know you're in the hands of a master. But I recommend reading them all. --Tom Franklin, Author of Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter and Hell at the BreechIn this new collection, Steve Yates exhibits the best kind of ambition in other words, he s willing to take some big risks. Just when you think you know what s coming, he throws you for yet another loop. I admire his work wholeheartedly, and I hope this book gets all the attention that it and the author deserve. Yates is one tremendous writer. --Steve Yarbrough, author of Safe from the NeighborsYates surprises often with his range of subjects and moods, with fresh voices and writing styles to complement them all. Some kinds of love and some kinds of work--regular work, job-keeping work--link these generous, thoughtful and inventive tales for the taking. --Shelf AwarenessIn this new collection, Steve Yates exhibits the best kind of ambition in other words, he s willing to take some big risks. Just when you think you know what s coming, he throws you for yet another loop. I admire his work wholeheartedly, and I hope this book gets all the attention that it and the author deserve. Yates is one tremendous writer. --Steve Yarbrough, author of Safe from the NeighborsIn this sturdy story collection, Yates (Morkan's Quarry) parades a cast of characters who, as diverse as they appear on the surface, have in common an underlying ignorance and mistrust of others. . . . Contrary to what the title suggests, the stories are more about what love is not: misdirected lust and other complex, confounding desires; but also personal and professional ennui and a sort of general angst. Instead of getting their comeuppance though, Yates's clueless characters get laid, get back together, or get a new SUV, which somehow rings true: good things happen to bad people, or more accurately in t --Steve Yarbrough, author of Safe from the NeighborsSome Kinds of Love features short stories set on the edge of unbelief. --Portico JacksonIn this new collection, Steve Yates exhibits the best kind of ambition in other words, he s willing to take some big risks.

She didn't look back but moved to the side of the narrow road so it could pass, But the car didn't move and a prickle of fear spread over her shoulders and into her stomach,'Wonderful, Now I'm to be murdered on the side of the road, What a fabulous start to my holiday,' she muttered into the wind, Hopefully the killer would change his mind, Still, searching for an escape route seemed a sensible idea, so she anxiously swivelled her eyes to the sides of the road, The car crept up behind her again, Blood rushed to her head and burned her temples, She didn't know what she was going to do, One thing shedidknow, though, was that when she found Edward Winchester she would kick him in his forgetful shins; then slap his inconsiderate face, If he'd picked her up from the airportfour hours agoshe'd not be here, on a deserted road, in a foreign country, freezing and wondering how long it would take the authorities to find her dead, frozen corpse in the English countryside, The car bleated another loud honk, which made her feet slip on the icy road, What did this bloke want? For her to turn around, plonk herself in his car and ask which way she should turn her head for the knife to slit best?The tyres of the car crunched as it crawled up behind her and the heat of the lights warmed the backs of her thighs, Blood pumped furiously through her veins and her chest heaved violently, She stopped and turned slowly, desperately trying to channel her fear into anger, She screwed up her face as fiercely as possible and balled her fists, determined she wasn't going down without a fight, The car stopped and a figure stepped out from the driver's seat, The tall man was draped in a grey coat and on his head sat a newsboy cap, Wrapped around his neck was a red plaid scarf, tied jauntily in a knot, He looked elegant and wealthy, and his car was an expensive sports-modeltype, Butnot all murderers drive pick-up trucks,she reminded herself as her nails dug into her palms,'Get in,' His voice was loud over the sound of the wind and it was gruff—angry, even, He sounded like a man who was used to being obeyed, Well, not this time, Olivia turned swiftly and started to walk again, as fast as she was able with her tower of bags and her stupid high-heeled boots making her ankles groan, She heard the car door slam and the engine rev before it sidled up next to her, She kept her eyes defiantly on the road ahead, The car was keeping up with her, with the driver's side window now next to her, It came down a crack, Her heart felt as if it was about to explode in her chest,'Olivia Matthews, Get in the car,'She turned at the use of her name and peered at the window, It was covered with ice, It came down another two inches,'It's cold and we're late, Get in,' The voice was deep and very English and she didn't recognise it at all, Not that she knew anyone here besides Will and Fiona,'Who are you?''The Easter Bunny, Who do you think I am? I'm Edward, Get in,'Edward, Edward Winchester, Who was supposed to have picked her up from the airport, Who had made her take the tube, then a bus, and then walk for an hour along a muddy country road looking for a house she'd never seen before,'About time,' She let go of her bag and lifted both her arms, letting them slap down on her thighs in exasperation and relief, The boot opened with a pop and she hurried round to the back of the car, Her tired arms heaved the suitcase and two overnight bags into the boot, She moved round to the passenger side and put her hand on the slick silver handle, but right at that moment—to her horror—her five-hundred-dollar boots came out from underneath her and she landed with a thud right on her aching butt, A smart bang followed by squelching footsteps meant Olivia was no longer alone, Trying to get a grip on the icy road, she put her hands down and pushed, but the pointed heels kept slipping,'Those are the most ridiculous shoes I've ever seen,' A strong male hand reached under her upper arm and hauled her ungracefully and immediately to her feet, She felt unbalanced, but his arm held her steady and she leaned onto his tall, thick frame, grasping at the lapels of his grey overcoat to stay upright, His grip on her arm tightened and she felt his long fingers biting into her skin through her coat, She tried to look up, but her precarious position meant all she could do was stare into his chest, 'I didn't dress for a hike in the country, I was expecting to be picked up from the airport,''This is Britain…in December, those boots are inappropriate and ridiculous no matter what you're doing,'His hand was holding her steady but his other arm suddenly snaked around her waist and she found herself pushed hard up against his coat, her nose level with his neck, His breath warmed the skin on her forehead, Looking up, she found herself staring into chocolaty dark eyes set perfectly each side of a long, straight nose and a set of high, angular cheekbones, He looked like Will, only…better,Heat flew to her cheeks and neck and to other more intimate places she refused to acknowledge, She would not be turned on by another inconsiderate bastard, no matter how big or how strong or how handsome…His eyes gazed coolly at her from a height, She couldn't move, His arm pulled her in tighter and she tried to hide the surprise on her face when she felt something long and hard press against her belly, So she wasn't the only one turned on? A small smile tugged at her mouth and an uncontrollable urge to flirt bubbled inside her,'Perhaps I need a lesson in English dressing?' She flashed a smile and looked up at him through lowered lashes, But his angry gaze didn't move, A muscle in his cleanshaven jaw twitched,'Perhaps what you need…' his deep voice had lowered an octave and was now grumbling against her chest '…is a lesson in etiquette, If you're going to change your flight you should let someone know,'He let go of her waist and she slipped and slid, grabbing for the sturdiness of his lapels again, Looking up, she realised any seductiveness on her face had evaporated in the embarrassing awkwardness of the moment, A clump of long damp blonde hair was strewn across her eyes and her gloved fingers were slipping from his coat, She felt desperately needy, and her cheeks burned indignantly, so she let go of him and steeled her leg muscles to get a grip on the icy road and move towards the car door,'I can manage from here…thank you,' Her tone was as icy as the road, and she managed to make her way to the door even though her legs splayed inelegantly with each measured step, Her stomach clenched as his gloved hands gently pushed her rear, guiding her into the seat, He gave her one last push before his irritating head popped in next to her, 'Would you like me to do up your seatbelt for you as well?'She threw him her most haughty stare—the one reserved for her sister's best friend and every slimeball who approached her in a bar, He huffed out a chuckle, flashing white teeth and a set of deep dimples, before clicking the door shut and walking to the other side to regain his position in the driver's seat,'We're late,'Edward realised he was being unforgivably rude, but he was in no mood to be picking up Will's friends from the airport, Well, technically it was Fiona's friend, Fiona—who was nothing to him, Yet they thought it perfectly acceptable to interrupt his day to make the two-hour round trip to the airport and on to his parents' house, And then the girl wasn't there, His normally calm demeanour was in danger of cracking,'If you had checked with Fiona you would have known about the new flight time,'Her voice was cool and steady and somehow it irritated him even more, She could at least have the decency to sound shaken, Or guilty, How about guilty?'I do apologise, You're right, I should have checked with Fiona, Would that have been before or after my two o'clock meeting with the Prime Minister?'It had been the Minister for Trade, actually, but she was annoying him, He flicked her a glance, She seemed the sort not to give a toss about anyone else, Self-centred, vain, and with an over-inflated idea of her own attractiveness if her unsuccessful attempts at flirting were anything to go by, Although, he grudgingly admitted she had a sort of innate sexiness he couldn't put his finger on, She was wearing too much make-up, and her long, dead straight blonde hair, obscene fur jacket and tight leather pants were a little too Chelsea for his taste, but something about the curvy figure he'd held against his chest made his trousers feel a little tighter, And when she'd fallen she'd looked up at him, hair strewn across her face, her sexy light-coloured eyes looking at him so trustingly, Was it any wonder his groin had reacted so violently?An unconscious smile lifted the corner of his mouth, Those perfect pouty pink lips had formed a little 'o' as he'd pushed her pert ass into the car and he...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This story will have you, by turns, smiling and mourning. I enjoyed this book immensely because the characters seemed so real you could almost picture them beside you and the events they survive are not only intriguing but incredibly well written as well. After Midnight by Henriette Daulton is definitely a love story and one that will not fade quietly into the night just like the women who created this story and the men they love. This is perfect for any lover of adventure and romance, with a realistic plot line that keeps you guessing at every turn.***** Reviewed by Mamta Madhavan for Readers' FavoriteAfter Midnight is a love story that is meant to be on the big screen. The story is very much like a screenplay. Simone's character transformation, as she goes through the many relationships in her life, has been captured beautifully by the author. Simone evokes love, sympathy, and affection from readers. The other characters in the book like Ahmed and Lucien also add to the depth of the story line. A captivating love story with many twists and triumphs.-------------------**** Reviewed by Katelyn Hensel for Readers' Favorite Henriette Daulton is an author you should keep your eye on.

Under the pseudonym Albertine Strong, Johnson published Deluge (Crown/Harmony).   Among Johnson’s public accolades have been a listing as a London Times bestseller for The Snake Game; three Pulitzer nominations (for Deluge, Don’t Think Twice, and The Devil You Know); New York Times Notable Book citations (for Deluge and Don’t Think Twice); inclusion in the Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers Series (for Deluge); recognition as a Minnesota Book Award Finalist (for Six Crooked Highways); recognition as a Great Lakes Book Association Finalist (for Deluge); and a Kansas City Star Book of the Year citation (for Six Crooked Highways).   Johnson has garnered excellent reviews (in addition to those from NYT) from Kirkus, Publishers Weekly, The Washington Post, ALA, Booklist, Forbes, The Chicago Tribune, and other journals. He has been a Chesterfield Writers’ Film Project Fellow in Hollywood and has received recognition from the Sundance Film Festival for his screenplays.   His first non-fiction title, White Heat: the Extreme Skiing Life, was published by Atria in December 2007 and sold 10,000 copies in the first month. The paperback edition of White Heat was released in 2008, and the book has recently come out with Simon & Schuster UK and Pocket Books.  Live to Ride, a non-fiction work on motorcycles, was published in hardback Simon & Schuster, June 2010, and in paperback 2011 to broad critical acclaim.   Johnson grew up in the Twin Cities and studied microbiology at the University of Minnesota before discovering the pleasures of hang gliding near Bozeman, Montana, where he finished his undergraduate degrees in English and Philosophy. A Teaching-Writing Fellow of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop and a former Wallace Stegner Fellow at Stanford, Johnson lives and skis in Utah, where he does emergency outdoor medical rescue for the Park City Ski Patrol.

The boy knows only that his father had knowledge of \"Star Wars\" plans. It soon becomes plain that the major was kidnapped by enemy spies, who try to get young Guy Willis in their clutches as a way to make the major talk. Chambrun guards Guy, resisting even Air Force officials who want to use him as a decoy. Then Chambrun's assistant Betsy Ruysdale also vanishes, there's a bomb scare in the hotel and Chambrun must use some extraordinary outside help in solving the case.

Caleb and Nico are a wonderful young couple who have had to hide their love for each other for nearly six years. When Caleb slips up and pecks Nico on the lips at school and a teacher can't keep his mouth shut, it leads to danger for Nico and Caleb has to admit the truth to his father when he doesn't feel ready. One of the best things...about this story was the way that it drew us into both Caleb and Nico's lives. We see them as they grow up together at pivotal moments of their lives; as their relationship progresses and as they grow and explore their... relationship. This story is really well written and gives us a wonderful experience of high school sweethearts who have to hide what they really are from everyone, to the struggles they face when they are outed and the ramifications of the actions of a careless adult. Nico and Caleb show how they stand together against anything thrown at them, but also how they support each other in a traumatic time... Even though this story is about teenage boys, that doesn't mean... rampant sex.  Yes, there is some experimenting, but they never go all the way... I recommend this to young adults and adults who love true romance and true love, being there for someone you love through the good times and bad, to being brave enough to face your demons and a happy ending for two wonderful young adults that is also a new beginning for them.\"", "related": ["B00JDXTNGC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 27.0}

From Bombay, the exquisitely courteous, ever persistent police detective, Inspector Ghote, travels to the holy city of Banaras to find the murderer of the much loved Mrs. Popatkar, \"veteran freedom fighter, former Minister, upholder of a hundred good causes.\" In Banaras, H.K. Verma, respected political leader, frees himself from the sin of that murder (and its consequences) by bathing in the Ganges. The story continues with alternating points of view-Ghote gradually uncovering pieces of the puzzle and Verma longing to confess while simultaneously hatching schemes to foil the investigation. In spite of a leisurely pace befitting a country where foot-sore pilgrims, sacred cattle and auto rickshaws clog the roads, this is an absorbing tale and an illuminating tour of Banaras, its religious sites and ceremonies (and its brothels), with a distinctly Hindu denouement.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After studying journalism, she continued her gypsy ways, working at community newspapers in Gravenhurst, Milton, Port Perry, Peterborough, Haliburton, Huntsville and Bracebridge. She also worked for a national medical newspaper, Family Practice, in downtown Toronto. After 20+ years of award-winning reporting, she decided she'd had enough of covering bowling banquets and curling bonspiels and turned to the graphic design side of the business. As outsourcing and the internet took a toll on traditional newspaper publishing, she retired and decided to do what she'd always dreamed of doing: write a novel.", "related": ["B00GOWRE6G"], "rank": 3826432, "title": "Friday Girls", "author": "Cathy Olliffe-Webster", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When his two boys were young and his eyes were tired from a long day of work, he found it easier to tell bedtime stories than to read them. The stories blended the challenges the children had faced that day with his own concerns for the natural environment he was manipulating. The boys loved the stories, especially the ones about Frisky the Wondercat, who always managed to overcome familiar problems and send everyone to sleep with a smile. When other children visited the house and when the Duprees camped out with other families, the Wondercat met a wider audience. After years of encouragement, Dupree found the time to weave a few stories into a novel. The writing of the book made the stories more complex and more interesting to the growing boys. Dupree wrote \"Frisky the Wondercat\" as a love letter to his children and to anyone else who might read it. The book offers suspense, excitement, humor, and insight into the different ways people regard their natural surroundings. The Wondercat is in love with his world. Through the book, Dupree encourages everyone to share that regard as they share that same world.", "related": [], "rank": 5074452, "title": "Frisky The Wondercat", "author": "James Dupree", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As well as romantic novels, she wrote historical biographies, 6 autobiographies, theatrical plays and books of advice on life, love, vitamins and cookery. She wrote her first book at the age of 21 and it was called Jigsaw.   It became an immediate bestseller and sold 100,000 copies in hardback in England and all over Europe in translation. Between the ages of 77 and 97 she increased her output and wrote an incredible 400 romances as the demand for her romances was so strong all over the world.She wrote her last book at the age of 97 and it was entitled perhaps prophetically The Way to Heaven.  Her books have always been immensely popular in the United States where in 1976 her current books were at numbers 1 & 2 in the B. Dalton bestsellers list, a feat never achieved before or since by any author. Barbara Cartland became a legend in her own lifetime and will be best remembered for her wonderful romantic novels so loved by her millions of readers throughout the world, who have always collected her books to read again and again, especially when they feel miserable or depressed. Her books will always be treasured for their moral message, her pure and innocent heroines, her handsome and dashing heroes, her blissful happy endings and above all for her belief that the power of love is more important than anything else in everyone’s life.", "related": ["B00JDNI4QC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book is the second in the Places To See Collection, following Jennifer Conner's short story Empress of Ireland.This is a life changing short story!A bit about writing the Island Bride:There is nothing more fun than exploring new countries and interviewing people who have been a part of the culture. As a former archeologist, I loved the idea of digging into the experience that is New Zealand. It was my goal in writing this book to leave you, the reader, with a country and a story that would be added to your bucket list!When you read this story, please take time to pay attention to the theme of touching. I'm sure you are aware, but more can be told in a simple touch than in a thousand spoken words.Like my other works, you will find a strong theme, great quirky characters, and a love story that will make you want more!Please feel free to leave a review or start a conversation about your experience while reading this book. How does the element of touch play into your life? Has a simple touch changed your life?Thank you for your support in reading and loving my books!Danica Winters", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.4286, "rating_total": 31.0}
