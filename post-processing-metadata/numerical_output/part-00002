He put down his case notes and took the call.\"If you're about to read from a script, you can save your breath by hanging up,\" Jack growled into the receiver, his throat tight and dry from too many hours without sleep or food.He glanced at the clock over his kitchen table. Eight-fifteen in the morning. He'd been working nonstop since he got home from the precinct the night before.The caller hesitated before speaking, and for a split second Jack thought he might get lucky and avoid conversation completely. He thought wrong.\"I wondered if you'd seen the latest blog at Don't Say a Word?\"Don't Say a Word? The name rang a bell, but Jack couldn't pry a connection loose from the jumble of facts and evidence his current case had planted in his mind.\"The confession site?\" the caller continued.The caller's voice indicated he was male, older, and either a heavy smoker or someone with a serious bronchial condition.\"Buddy,\" Jack said, \"I think you've got the wrong number.\"The caller began to cough—a sputtering, choking sound that made Jack feel as though he was violating the man's privacy by listening.He thought about asking if the man was all right, but that would indicate concern on his part, and concern was something Jack offered to no one, not if he could avoid it. Concern indicated vulnerability, and vulnerability indicated weakness.Jack hated weakness.He held the phone away from his ear until the sound of coughing subsided.\"It's about Melinda,\" the caller ground out as if struggling for air between choking spasms.Melinda.Jack had no doubt there were millions of Melindas in the world, but the combination of the caller's voice and the name Melinda shifted Jack's thoughts from the present to the past—eleven years past, to be exact.\"How have you been, Mr. Simmons?\"\"Have you seen it?\" the man asked, ignoring Jack's question.Melinda Simmons had gone missing from a New Mexico university campus not long after Jack's sister, Emma, had vanished from a college fifty miles to the east.Unlike Emma, Melinda's body had never been found.Her case had joined a handful of others—unsolved, their connection suspected, but never proved. The man Jack had thought responsible for the rash of college coed abductions and murders had been a self-proclaimed photographer who'd been in possession of photos of Emma, as well as of Melinda and the others upon his arrest.Boone Shaw had walked free after a trial that had blown up in the prosecution's face. The press had blamed the acquittal on a lack of evidence and an airtight alibi the defense attorney had presented immediately before closing arguments.Life for Jack had tilted on its axis the day his sister's lifeless body had been found.Life for the Simmons family hadn't fared much better.Melinda Simmons's mother had succumbed to her lung cancer not long after the trial.Her father, Herb, had dropped out of society instead of facing his daughter's tragic disappearance and presumed death alone.Jack had figured him dead years ago. But here the man was on the other end of the phone, resurrected like the heartache Jack had denied since the day he'd buried Emma, since the day Boone Shaw had walked free.\"Are you near a computer?\" Simmons asked.\"Give me a second.\" Jack settled in front of his PC, clicking the icon to gain Internet access.He waited for the entry page to open, cursing the cable connection under his breath. He initiated a search for the Don't Say a Word Web site, then clicked onto the site via the list generated by the search engine.As the site's entry page came into focus, Jack's chest tightened.Apparently Herb Simmons wasn't the only family member back from the dead. Anyone looking at the modeling shot of Melinda would never guess the young woman had allegedly been strangled and left in the desert eleven years earlier.\"Is he back?\" Herb Simmons asked, his voice faltering, his emotion palpable across the phone line.Jack winced.Damn Boone Shaw for causing so many families so much pain.\"Could be,\" Jack answered as he skimmed the site for an indication of just who was responsible for posting the girl's photograph.Jack remembered now where he'd heard the confession site's name. The Web site and its cofounders had been profiled a few weeks back inPeoplemagazine.The site promised an anonymous means for the public to air their most personal secrets, the thought being that confession was good for the soul.According to the feature story, the public visited the site in droves, their morbid curiosity no doubt driving them to salivate over the suffering of others.So much for keeping a secret.Broken promises. Broken marriages. Broken dreams.As if any of the bull the confessor spouted was true.Each Saturday the site's blog featured a sampling of handmade postcards received during the previous week.Today was Thursday. That meant the posted blog had gone up five days ago, and apparently the selected \"confession\" had been strong enough to carry the site alone.The faded black-and-white modeling shot of Melanie Simmons filled the majority of the visible page, and included only a one-line caption.I didn't mean to kill her.Jack raked a hand through his close-cropped hair and winced. \"Sonofa—\"\"I thought you'd want to know.\"\"You thought right.\"\"Don't let him get away this time.\" Simmons's tone dropped soft, yet suddenly clear.\"I didn't let him—\"But the line had gone dead in Jack's ear.\"—get away the first time,\" Jack said for the benefit of no one but himself.He'd always thought that if he uttered the statement often enough, one day he'd believe the Shaw acquittal to be no fault of his own.That theory hadn't paid off yet.Jack might have been a rookie detective at the time, and the powers that be might have kept him as far away from the actual casework as they could, but still, the thought that he might have done something—anything—differently haunted his every moment.He'd failed to keep his baby sister safe, and he'd failed ever since to find a way to bring her killer to justice.Jack woke each morning, wondering how he might have saved Emma from the monster that had taken her life. He went to bed each night determined to find a way to make Boone Shaw pay for what Jack knew he did.He'd never doubted the man's guilt. He never would. And he'd never stop trying to bring the brutal killer to justice, not while there was a breath of life left inside him.Jack dropped the now silent phone to his lap and pulled his chair close to his desk, studying the blog entry—the reproduced photo postcard, the card's typewritten message, and the weekly editorial.Apparently the site owner responsible for writing the weekly comments had deemed the postcard a crank.Jack scrubbed a hand across his tired face and laughed.What an idiot.Had the woman even thought to touch base with the local police or the FBI?No matter. Abby Conroy had just given Jack the first new lead he'd had in years. Maybe he'd have to say thanks… in person.Jack's gaze shifted from the monitor screen to the calendar tacked haphazardly to the wall. Nine days until Christmas.The calendar illustration consisted of a holiday wreath draped over a cactus, no doubt someone in the Southwest's idea of holiday cheer.But the timing of the Don't Say a Word posting gnawed at Jack.Melinda, Emma and the other coeds had vanished during a ten-day period leading up to Christmas.Had Boone Shaw decided to resurrect his own special brand of holiday cheer? And if so, why now? Why wait eleven years?Granted, the man's trial had dragged out over the course of two years, but after Shaw had gone free, he'd never so much as been pulled over for a speeding ticket again.And Jack would know. He'd kept tabs on the man's every move.As crazy as the thought of Shaw sending a postcard to a secret confession site seemed, Jack had seen far stranger things during his years on the force.He'd seen killers tire with getting away with their own crimes. He'd seen men who might never have been caught, commit purposeful acts to gain notoriety.Who was to say something—or someone—hadn't motivated Shaw to come forward now?Jack rocked back in his chair, lifting the hand-carved front legs from the floor as the possibilities wound through his brain.Truth was he wouldn't sleep again until he'd held that postcard in his own hand.He blew out a slow breath.Christmas.On the East Coast.In the cold.He supposed there were worse things in life.

The novel opens with Will in a coma, with his niece Annie, who just returned from an eight-month excursion in search of her sister, by his side. Narrated by Will and Annie, the story backtracks to tell of Will's fight to keep his bush-country Indian life alive and protected while he suppresses painful childhood memories (and befriends an old bear). Annie, a skillful hunter and animal trapper, dictates her escapades after rushing off to New York City in pursuit of her sister, Suzanne, a model who has shacked up with a member of the narcotics-smuggling Netmakers family. As Will struggles to survive and Annie reintegrates into the isolated bush, the two stories dovetail as the Netmakers cross paths with Will. Though the incongruously melodramatic denouement doesn't fit with the richly textured narrative preceding it, the novel as a whole is an intelligent, multilayered accomplishment, and well worth reading.(Mar.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tao adds a fourth rule—honesty—that they both find hard to hold to.

Student Success in Community Colleges offers education leaders, administrators, faculty, and staff an essential resource for helping these students succeed and advance in college.By applying the book's self-assessment instrument, colleges can pinpoint how their current activities align with the most effective proven practices. Once the gaps are identified, community college leaders can determine the best strategic direction for improvement. Drawing on a broad knowledge base and illustrative examples from the most current literature, the authors cover organizational, administrative, and instructional practices; program components; student support services and strategies; and professional learning and development.Designed to help engage community college leadership and practitioners in addressing the practices, structures, and obstacles that enhance or impede the success of basic skills students, the book's strategies can be tailored to various institutional levels, showing how to unite faculty, staff, and administrators in a cooperative effort to effect institutional change.Finally, Student Success in Community Colleges reveals how investing in a comprehensive basic skills infrastructure can be a financially sustainable model for the institution as well as substantially beneficial to students and society.\"This is a most unusual and valuable book; it is packed with careful analysis and practical suggestions for improving basic skills programs in community colleges. Compiled by a team of practicing professionals in teaching, administration, and research, it is knowledgeable about what has been done and imaginative and practical about what can be done to improve the access and success of community college students.\"—K. Patricia Cross, professor of higher education, emerita, University of California, Berkeley\"For its first hundred years the community college was committed primarily to access; in its second hundred years the commitment has changed dramatically to success. This book provides the best road map to date on how community colleges can reach that goal.\"—Terry O'Banion, president emeritus, League for Innovation, and director, Community College Leadership Program, Walden University\"This guide is the most comprehensive source of information about all facets of basic skills or developmental education. It will be invaluable not just to community college educators across the nation, but also to those in high schools and four-year colleges who share similar problems.\"—W.

They shared their stories of persecution in their homelands and their arduous journeys to safety in Australia.Mahtab's Story, a work of fiction, is based on the experiences of an Afghani teenager. When readers first meet Mahtab, her family has been torn apart by the Taliban and she, along with her father, mother, and younger siblings, is preparing to make a dangerous escape by way of Pakistan. Her father eventually separates from the group and treks ahead, leaving the rest of the family to live in a one-room hideaway where they depend on the kindness of a stranger they refer to as \"Hairy Man.\" Eventually, the family tires of waiting and decides to continue on to Australia, though they've not heard from Mahtab's father in months. The journey is both sad and inspiring. Gleeson has created a protagonist with the strength of a woman yet the naïveté of a child. Her writing style is fluid, and it captures readers' attention from the very beginning. This is a striking piece of literature.—Kelly McGorray, Glenbard South High School, Glen Ellyn, ILCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It's a classic Cinderella story. Stuck at home in Clarksville, Tennessee, in the 1940s, Wilma Rudolph couldn't attend school. Her leg was in a brace, twisted from polio. The kids called her cripple. But she grew up to become a runner who broke world records. This title in the popular Childhood of Famous Americans series is fictionalized, but it works because it never pretends to be documented biography. The made-up details and conversations seem true to the time, as is the picture of the African American girl who fought not only illness but also poverty, racism (including then-word), and gender barriers. Sports fans will enjoy the details of training and technique as well as the honesty about Rudolph's close, and sometimes tense, relationships with her coaches and teammates. Occasional black-and-white pictures capture the drama, from the kid in the hospital to the Olympic winner to the handshake with President Kennedy.Hazel RochmanCopyright © American Library Association.

Now music journalist and culture critic Sullivan, a contributor toRolling Stoneand theSan Francisco Chronicle, offers an overview, starting with the young Carlin in 1950s New York. The Air Force sent him off to Louisiana, where he began as a Shreveport radio personality. As a DJ in Fort Worth, Tex., he polished a comedy act with Jack Burns, and the two left for the West Coast, performing together for two years before they split in 1962. Going solo, Carlin's taboo topics and subversive attitude took center stage. In this linear summary of Carlin's career, Sullivan dissects the comedian's classic iconoclastic routines, probes his working methods and successfully captures his rocketlike ascent to fame from night clubs and the 1960s comedic cauldron of Greenwich Village to television acclaim, controversy, and creative conflicts. However, those who want to experience a full explosion of the cynical and caustic Carlin blasting off minus the heat shields should instead seek out the finely tuned and wit-saturatedLast Words.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His father, John Boston, and his mother, Alison Trotter, were both Covenanters. He was educated at Edinburgh, and licensed in 1697 by the presbytery of Chirnside. In 1699 he became minister of the small parish of Simprin, where there were only 90 examinable persons. In 1704 he found, while visiting a member of his flock, a book brought into Scotland by a commonwealth soldier. This was the famous Marrow of Modern Divinity, by Edward Fisher, a compendium of the opinions of leading Reformation divines on the doctrine of grace and the offer of the Gospel, which set off the Marrow Controversy. Its object was to demonstrate the unconditional freeness of the Gospel. It cleared away such conditions as repentance, or some degree of outward or inward reformation, and argued that where Christ is heartily received, full repentance and a new life follow. On Boston's recommendation, James Hog of Carnock reprinted The Marrow in 1718; and Boston also published an edition with notes of his own. The book, being attacked from the standpoint of high Calvinism, became the standard of a far-reaching movement in Scottish Presbyterians. The Marrow men were marked by the zeal of their service and the effect of their preaching. As they remained Calvinists they could not preach a universal atonement; rather they were particular redemptionists. In 1707 Boston was transferred to Ettrick, Scotland. He distinguished himself by being the only member of the assembly who entered a protest against what he deemed the inadequate sentence passed on John Simson, professor of divinity at Glasgow, who was accused of heterodox teaching on the Incarnation. Boston, if unduly introspective, was a man of singular piety and amiability. His autobiography is an interesting record of Scottish life, full of sincerity and tenderness, and not devoid of humorous touches, intentional and otherwise. His books, The Fourfold State, The Crook in the Lot, and his Body of Divinityand Miscellanies, had a powerful influence over the Scottish peasantry. His Memoirswere published in 1776. An edition of his works in 12 volumes appeared in 1849.", "related": ["B00AVYSUQQ"], "rank": 176347, "title": "Human Nature In Its Fourfold State", "author": "Thomas Boston", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fortunately, she's very good with a needle--and at disguising the scandalous fact that she's unchaperoned. Enter Edward Tremayne, earl of Ketrick, who can't take his eyes off Claire. Of course, Edward and Claire don't hit it off, but, improbably, he proposes and she says yes within the first couple of chapters. What follows is the peculiar story of why on earth Edward fights his desire for his wife. Lake provides other plot lines, but none of them are interesting enough or end satisfactorily enough to take the heat off poor Edward, who is by far the novel's most engaging character.Maria HattonCopyright © American Library Association.

The bag he leaves behind contains a vital smart card. Terrorists wanting the smart card kidnap Mari and take her to Algeria, where she struggles to escape while Alan searches for her. Lucia (Run Among Thorns) pens some laughable prose (œShe was pretty and she was afraid. Was she still afraid?... Was she still pretty?) and scants the real world details that should bolster a tale of international intrigue, but her solid romantic plotting mostly manages to carry the book.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We first met Chancellor Shanahan and Tucker McBride in Heat, Ms. Temple's sparkling debut, and followed them as they shared their jobs, their lust and their sparks.In Flashover we pick up their story a year and a half after their first spine-melting encounter. They seem happy enough, and they certainly haven't lost their ability to turn on the heat, each other or the reader. But under the surface, not unlike Chance's beloved ocean, there's turmoil. What starts with a physical headache for Tucker ends up a tangled mess of emotions, something neither of them is particularly adept at dealing with. Lucky for us, Ms. Temple is, however. She draws the relationship so clearly, so tightly, that when circumstances pull Tucker back to his home state, we ache for them both.A change in lifestyle that is as shocking to Chance's system as the change in the weather is, and the real struggle of the story begins. How do two headstrong men reconcile love, duty, commitment and loyalty with the demands of family and land?Passion. Conflict. Incendiary sex scenes. Duty, booze, and trouble that reaches back more than two decades. Some things are worth fighting for and about. In Ms. Temple's hands the story is unwrapped like a gift, layers of tissue peeling away to the heart of the matter, and the one thing that both Chance and Tucker need more than anything else. But is it enough?Flashover is a must read, not only for those who read Heat, but for anyone who adores stories with strong, imperfect men and sexual intensity that will make you turn up the air conditioner.", "related": ["B00LCA8612"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ivan Goldstein’s fate, his captivity over before it had really begun, on the orders of the German major interrogating Goldstein and his Sherman tank crewmates. It was not the first time Goldstein narrowly escaped death at the hands of the Nazis in World War II, and it would not be the last. From the moment Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, seventeen-year-old Ivan Goldstein had been ready to enlist. Devoted to his young widowed mother, however, he acquiesced when she urged him to attend college instead of risking his life in the war. His time at the University of Denver only delayed the inevitable, and his draft notice soon arrived. Entering the army, he was eventually assigned to Company B, 41st Tank Battalion, 11th Armored Division. Private Goldstein first faced a threat close to home: the anti-Semitism of his own company commander. Nevertheless, he got through training in the States and England, and late in 1944 he was on his way to what would become known as the Battle of the Bulge, the bloodiest battle in U.S. history, with more than nineteen thousand American deaths over the course of a month. Goldstein and his fellow crewmates of the M4 Sherman namedBarracudawould not see those weeks of brutal warfare through frozen fields and snow-covered towns, however.Barracudawas hit their first day in combat, caught fire, and became mired in a frozen pond. Lucky to escape the burning tank alive, Goldstein was captured and then interrogated by a German major who ordered his execution. Ivan was lucky again that in the face of an American attack the order was forgotten by the Germans. He was even luckier to still be alive in the stalag when the liberating Americans arrived in the spring. With faith, friends, and class-clown humor, Goldstein survived the ordeal. Decades later, through the efforts of French historians, and at the urging of his grandson, he would return to claim his piece of history alongsideBarracuda, which proudly stands in McAuliffe Square, Bastogne, Belgium, to this day.", "related": [], "rank": 1230296, "title": "Surviving the Reich eBook", "author": "Ivan L.

He'd learned it hard and solid on the battlefields of Iraq: stay one step ahead of your enemies, or two steps back for a clear shot.His heart rate notched up.The door of Potter's Drugstore swept open just as Nick made the curb half a block to the east.Funny. His target didn't look like much of a threat. The observation gelled in his brain as he watched her step out into the early afternoon sunlight. She casually looped her arm in her purse strap and deposited it on her shoulder. She turned to her right and moved along the sidewalk, her blond ponytail swaying back and forth between her shoulder blades as she moved away from him.Nick increased his rate of follow, backing off only when she paused in front of the Talk of the Town Cafe to study something in the window before proceeding due north again.He knew her beat-up silver Toyota Camry was sucked up next to the curb half a block away.Tension braided his muscles into a knot. Had he pegged her correctly? Or was he headed for an ambush? He wrestled the questions to the back of his mind and looked at his watch.C 'mon, c 'mon,he thought. He had to get to Grace Marshall now. Another minute and she'd make it to her car and escape.Focused on her alone, he narrowed the distance.On his left, a man wearing a black hoodie, black sweatpants and running shoes brushed past him and broke into a sprint.Time slowed as Nick listened to the jogger's pounding footsteps echo off the sidewalk and ping against the brick-and-mortar storefronts that lined the quaint main street of Freedom, Texas.Grace Marshall's high-pitched shriek slammed against his eardrums. The man in the black hoodie and Grace were engaged in a tug of war over the purse.\"Hey! Leave her alone!\" Nick took aim at the would-be purse-snatcher and charged.Stressed, the metal ring anchoring the strap to the purse broke.Grace still clutched the handbag, but the force of the sudden release sent the bag flopping across the sidewalk as the strap slipped through the purse-snatcher's fingers.He took off down the street at a dead run and vanished around the corner at 4th and Main.Car keys, pill bottles, a hairbrush and a wallet were scattered across the sidewalk next to her. She went to her knees on the concrete.Nick shuffled to a stop and knelt beside her.\"I saw what happened. Are you okay?\"She turned wide blue eyes on him for a second before reaching for the contents of her purse. \"Yeah.\"He reached out and picked up one of the prescription pill bottles, glanced at the name on it, then handed it to her. \"I'll call the police. I got a good look at him. I think I can give them a description—\"\"No! I mean…\" Grace tried to force the lump in her throat to go down, but it wouldn't budge. The last thing she needed was local law enforcement poking around in her business. \"I still have my purse and its contents. There's no reason to involve the police. He's probably halfway to the next county by now.\" She shoved the last item into her handbag and pulled the zipper closed before staring eye to eye with the handsome stranger who'd come to her rescue.His irises were electric blue, his stare leveled on her with pulse-zapping heat that made her cheeks light up. \"But thank you for offering. I'm not sure I could have held on much longer. If you hadn't spooked him, he might have gotten away with this.\" She squeezed the brown leather bag she gripped like a lifeline and realized her hands were shaking uncontrollably. \"Oh. I don't feel so good.\"Concern crossed his features and settled around his mouth in the granite-hard line of his lips. She was suddenly sure this man, if asked, could and would trail the thug to hell and back.\"Come on. Let's get you inside somewhere.\" He stood up and helped her stand by putting his arm around her waist. Pulling free from him wasn't as option, she realized as her stomach roiled, roiled again and settled down with several deep gulps of air.Perhaps she should have eaten breakfast…or lunch for that matter, but her son Caleb's treatment days were always like this. Next time she'd be sure to put a banana or something in her purse.\"I've got somewhere I need to be.\" Her declaration seemed to fall on deaf ears as he steered her toward the door of the cafe.\"You're suffering from mild shock. It'll pass in the time it takes you to let me buy you a cup of coffee.\"She couldn't argue with his assessment. Her knees trembled, her feet tingled, and if his strong arm weren't wrapped tightly around her waist, she wasn't sure she'd be standing right now. She had half an hour before she had to pick Caleb up, and Holy Cross Hospital was only ten minutes away. She could make it in plenty of time.\"You're right. I suppose the surprise of almost having my arm jerked off by a stranger is a good reason to sit down for a minute.\"\"I knew you'd see it my way.\" He chuckled deep in his throat, a soothing male sound that made her smile as he reached out with his free hand and pulled open the door to Talk of the Town Cafe.She stepped inside, absorbing its cool retro 1950s interior, complete with red-and-white upholstered booth seats, and a black-and-white checkerboard tile floor. It was a novelty she could get used to—if the Help Wanted sign in the window managed to come down after she applied for the job. And maybe, if she were lucky, the man with his arm around her would come in every once in a while so she could buy him a cup of coffee as thanks.Nick zeroed in on a booth in the rear of the establishment, away from the noise of the regular afternoon crowd.This was his orchestrated break in his assignment, and he didn't plan to waste an iota of it. He might not get another chance at a one-on-one conversation with the target of his investigation.The cafe's owner, Faith Scott, waved to him from behind the counter and raised the steaming coffeepot in her hand.He nodded and grudgingly let go of Grace to help her into the booth's seat before taking a spot across from her with his back to the room.\"Coffee?\" Faith had already turned their cups upright in their saucers before Nick realized he was staring at the woman sitting across from him.\"Yes. Please. And for you?\"\"Just water, no ice,\" Grace said. \"I'm not sure my nerves could handle a shot of caffeine right now.\"He watched a tentative smile curve her full lips as she considered him through eyes tinted a shade-of-heaven blue. This wasn't the army way of conducting an interrogation, but he couldn't help enjoying the view.\"Would you like a piece of pie? I just took a cinnamon-apple-crumb out of the oven ten minutes ago,\" Faith said from next to their table.Nick broke eye contact with Grace Marshall and immediately felt his blood pressure drop a fraction. \"Not for me, but maybe…\" He glanced back at Grace, anxious to prompt her response. \"I'm sorry, I don't know your name.\"\"Grace.\"\"Maybe Grace would like a piece.\"She shook her head. \"No, thank you. I've got to run in a few minutes.\"\"I'll get your water.\" Faith turned and headed for the counter, leaving them alone in silence.Reaching across the table, he extended his hand to her. \"I'm Nick Cavanaugh.\" The moment she put her delicate palm into his, a jolt radiated through him. \"I don't believe I've seen you around Freedom before.\"Her gaze dropped for an instant. \"I spend most of my time at home, or at work.\"He released his grasp and leaned back into the booth seat just as Faith put a glass of water in front of Grace.\"Thanks,\" she whispered, locking her fingers around it for an instant before raising it to her mouth and taking several deep swallows.Nick sensed her caution, saw it in the way her nails blanched against the glass in her hand as she lowered it to the table.Trust. He needed to establish a level of trust between them, and fast. He was losing her with every tick of the second hand on his watch, and for some reason, that mattered to him.Rocking slightly to the left, he dug into his pants pocket and pulled out his wallet. \"I know you've got to leave soon, but I want you to have this just in case you need to contact me.\" He opened his billfold and pulled out a Corps Security and Investigations card with his name and cell number on it.\"If you change your mind and want me to describe the purse-snatcher to the police, just give me a call at this number.\" He slid the card across the table to her.She picked it up and stared at it for a moment before nonchalantly putting it in her sweater pocket. \"Thank you, but that won't be necessary. I'm fine. I have my purse, and its contents. It might be better if we drop the matter entirely.\"Curiosity jetted across Nick's mind and he focused his gaze on Grace's beautiful face. How was it she'd managed to avoid giving him anything more than her first name? Sure, he had an entire paper file amassed on her: he knew where she worked, where she lived, what she drove and damn near what she'd had for dinner last night, but his desire to glean it from her own lips was falling flat. The woman was playing it safe, a fact that intrigued him and bothered him at the same time. What was she hiding?\"I really need to get going.\" She took another quick swallow from her glass, put it down, snagged her purse and slid out of the booth.\"Thanks again for your help, Nick.\" She gave him a sweet smile, turned and walked to the cafe counter, wh...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This exploration into the complexity and behavioral dynamics of an ever-changing social group of chimpanzees leads us to think about new ways of studying sentient minds on the planet. For anyone interested in animal behavior and our closest relatives, this book is not to be missed!\"--Dr. Denise L Herzing, author ofDolphin Diaries“The field of ape language research for decades has asked whether we can teach them to speak our language. Andrew Halloran has approached the question from a more intriguing--and sensible--perspective that has received short shrift: How do chimpanzees communicate with each other? Working with groups of captive chimpanzees living on separate islands, Halloran decoded some of their communications and dialects, and, more importantly, showed that there's a complexity to their vocalizations that humans barely understand.” --Jon Cohen, author ofAlmost ChimpanzeeandShots in the Dark\"Halloran is a wonderful storyteller, and his gripping account of living among the apes alternates between thrills and chills, humor and tender moments..\" --Kirkus Reviews(starred)\"...the author’s detailed descriptions of the chimps themselves...make this book unique. Because of Halloran’s considerable skill at literary nonfiction, the chimps of his study are as fascinating as characters in a novel. Strongly recommended for general readers who enjoy Jane Goodall’s chimpanzee books.\" --Library Journal(starred)\"... an engrossing account of communication development among these intelligent animals, presented with genuine affection for them as individuals...With its intriguing mix of personalities and examination of complex primate social relationships, this book will captivate and, most importantly, provide valuable insight into these kindred creatures.\" --Publishers Weekly \"Halloran has written a fascinating book that easily spans the gap between scientific research and popular reading tastes.\" --Booklist\"This is a fascinating book that provides us with a better understanding of chimpanzees and how they communicate.\" --Tucson Citizen", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I was born in August 1957 - that should save me from having to alter my age on a regular basis (well, annually, at least). Oh, and I write. Nearly forgot that bit. \"Pike's Quest\" is my first published novel and it's intended to be fun. Broadly, it would be classified as \"Young Adult\", but at various readings I've had groups of adults laughing out loud - hopefully at the content! In the pipe-line I have a sequel to \"Pike's Quest\", and a more adult sci-fi thriller. I hope to achieve mainstream publication in the future.

He has sold over four million books, and is in demand as a team-building, life-changing, and leadership speaker and consultant for his Who Dares Wins: The Green Beret Way concept. He is also the Co-Creator of Cool Gus Publishing. Bob Mayer grew up in the Bronx. After high school, he entered West Point where he learned about the history of our military and our country. During his four years at the Academy and later in the Infantry, Mayer questioned the idea of \"mission over men.\" When he volunteered and passed selection for the Special Forces as a Green Beret, he felt more at ease where the men were more important than the mission. Mayer's obsession with mythology and his vast knowledge of the military and Special Forces, mixed with his strong desire to learn from history, is the foundation for his science fiction series Atlantis, Area 51 and Psychic Warrior. Mayer is a master at blending elements of truth into all of his thrillers, leaving the reader questioning what is real and what isn't. He took this same passion and created thrillers based in fact and riddled with possibilities. His unique background in the Special Forces gives the reader a sense of authenticity and creates a reality that makes the reader wonder where fact ends and fiction begins. In his historical fiction novels, Mayer blends actual events with fictional characters. He doesn't change history, but instead changes how history came into being. Mayer's military background, coupled with his deep desire to understand the past and how it affects our future, gives his writing a rich flavor not to be missed. Bob has presented for over a thousand organizations both in the United States and internationallys. He has taught organizations ranging from Maui Writers, to Whidbey Island Writers, to San Diego State University, to the University of Georgia, to the Romance Writers of America National Convention, to Boston SWAT, the CIA, Fortune-500, the Royal Danish Navy Frogman Corps, Microsoft, Rotary, IT Teams in Silicon Valley and many others. He has also served as a Visiting Writer for NILA MFA program in Creative Writing. He has done interviews for the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Sports Illustrated, PBS, NPR, the Discovery Channel, the SyFy channel and local cable shows.

With her \"armoury\" of mink coats, an oenophile's palate and her weakness for an occasional weekend at the Savoy, the widow Pargeter brings a distinct touch of class to the sleuthing scene. It is 18 months since the death of Mr. Pargeter (whose mysterious and lucrative business dealings left his wife with devoted contacts among such shady characters as \"Rewind\" Wilson, in the used car business, and Keyhole Crabbe), and Mrs. P. has just moved to a new home in a small development of upwardly mobile families in Surrey. But she quickly determines that something decidedly fishy has happened to the former mistress of the house, Theresa Cotton. Remaining quintessentially ladylike, Mrs. Pargeter--dare we say it?--snoops, uncovering clues that lead to Theresa's body and point the finger of guilt at any one of the other women of the houses in Smithy's Loam. Further investigation leads to a suspicious religious organization, The Church of Utter Simplicity, to the ruined career of Rod Cotton, and to real danger for Mrs. P. at the hands of a woman who has killed before. As with his Charles Paris stories, Brett here delivers solid mystery, deft characterization and delightful entertainment.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I named\nthemTheTemplers,who were a proud northern family that loved God, each\nother, the land, and the country where they called home.        I began the story with two brothers out squirrel hunting. Josh, the elder of the two boys is headstrong\nand confident, oblivious to the war that rages around him. And Henry, who like most younger brothers wanted\nto follow Josh everywhere, and with the blessing of their mother was allowed to\ndo so.        The day turned out idyllic for the hunting that Josh and\nHenry looked forward to doing. But as so\noften happens in one's life, the day took a sinister turn that started the\nbeginning of a new path in the Templers' lives.        If one only reads the first dozen pages he or she won't be\nable to comprehend the tragic sadness of war, and most of all, how a family\nduring these turbulent times stood together, and pulled together to survive.        As so often happens in tragic circumstances, it is the young\nthat suffer the most. But, it is also\nthe young that show us with will, determination, and perseverance, that we can\nall survive the most tragic of times if we set our minds to it.   R.Howard Trembly.", "related": [], "rank": 2395972, "title": "The Templers", "author": "R.

The traumas of war are intermingled with the everyday life of two generations of young women coming of age. In scenes reminiscent of Doctor Zhivago, the book powerfully depicts the effects of war on a wealthy family who became impoverished refugees. Plagued by constantly shifting borders, the family also moved from place to place as they fled the ever-changing enemy?sometimes German, sometimes Russian, sometimes their Belorussian neighbors.

In 1941, along with her parents, she was deported to the Lodz Ghetto, where within a year both her parents had died. At 15 she was left to fend for herself.   The Lodz Ghetto was the second-largest ghetto to Warsaw, and was established for Jews and Gypsies in German-occupied Poland. Situated in the town of Lodz in Poland and originally intended as a temporary gathering point for Jews, the ghetto was transformed into a major industrial centre, providing much needed supplies for Nazi Germany and especially for the German Army.    Because of its remarkable productivity, the ghetto managed to survive until August 1944, when the remaining population, including Edith, was transported to Auschwitz and Chełmno extermination camp in cattle trucks. It was the last ghetto in Poland to be liquidated due to the advancing Russian army. Edith was only 17, and one of the lucky ones. For the majority, it was their final journey. A small group of them were selected for work. With her hair shaved off and deprived of all her possessions, she travelled to Kristianstadt, a labour camp in Silesia, to work in an underground munitions factory.    In January 1945, aged 18 and with the Russians approaching again, she was sent off on a death march across snow-covered Germany to Bavaria. There cattle trucks were waiting. After spending a week in crowded conditions without food or water she and her companions arrived in Bergen Belsen on 15th March 1945. A month later they were liberated.   In 1946, after the liberation and destruction of the death camps, she came to England to study, eventually becoming a teacher in London.   Edith has written 2 books about her experiences, Unshed Tears, a novel and The Last Goodbye, a book of poems and pictures.    Edith now lives with her husband in Hereford, England.  She has three children and six grandchildren.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has worked for The Associated Press and a number of newspapers as writer, assistant city editor, state editor and wire editor. Reporters working for news organizations are under constant pressure to produce copy and meet deadlines.  The stories they cover often have serious ramifications that are dealt with only on a superficial basis.  Troubled by the lack of time to do serious in depth reporting on a number of stories, he conceived of the idea of a research institution that would have the funding and ability to cover stories that would otherwise not see the light of day. In 1987, he was a principle in the founding of Western Research Institute (WRI).  From its inception WRI set out to do in-depth reporting on a number of issues.  It has done reports and published books on technology, law, government, philosophy and communication.   For the past number of years he has been involved in the study of the prevalence of certain philosophical positions and how those positions affect society, human behavior and public policy.  He has completed a number of books on the results, the last involving precepts of dialogue and general principles of communication. The outcome of these studies, is the publication of Rules for Public Discourse, on how to hold lawmakers, candidates for public office and others accountable for what they say for public consumption. As part of WRI's commitment to public interest research, he has in collaboration with Jerry Fenning embarked on an in-depth research project involving reports on How America Can Stop Importing Foreign Oil and The Fight Over Using Natural Gas for Transportaion.. How America Can Stop Importing Foreign Oil is available in a print edition and an ebook edition.

A man!\"Eight-year-old Nancy Drew frowned. \"How do you know?\" she asked.\"That's him, \" Bess said. She pointed to a man in the school playground. He was standing beside their third-grade teacher, Ms. Spencer. The man had curly black hair and a dimple in his chin.Bess pushed her long blond hair out of her face. \"I don't want a new teacher. Not now -- not ever! Ms. Spencer is the best.\"Nancy was about to agree. But just then George Fayne ran up to join them. George's curly dark hair bounced as she ran. She was Bess's cousin and Nancy's other best friend.\"What's wrong with you two?\" George asked. \"You look upset.\"\"We're getting a new teacher,\" Bess repeated. \"A man.\"George put her hands on her hips. \"Who told you?\" she asked Bess.\"Well,\" Bess said slowly. \"It's just a rumor. Iguessit might not be true. . . .\"George pointed a finger at her cousin. \"Who told you?\" she asked again.Bess's cheeks turned a little pink. \"It was Brenda Carlton,\" she admitted.\"Brenda Carlton?\" Nancy asked. Her eyes opened wide. Brenda was the most gossipy girl in the third grade.\"I wouldn't believe anything Brenda says,\" George said with a laugh. \"She makes up stories all the time.\"\"I know,\" Bess said. \"But Brenda promises it's true. She heard Ms. Spencer talking to him. Ms. Spencer said, 'I haven't told the class yet.' And then she said something about leaving.\"Nancy turned to watch her teacher carefully. Ms. Spencer and the man were looking at a piece of paper. Nancy wasn't sure what the paper was. She thought it might be a list.\"Shehasbeen acting weird lately,\" George said. \"She whispers to the other teachers all the time.\"\"And she's been writing something secret,\" Bess said.\"You're right,\" Nancy said. \"Something is going on. I'm going to see if I can find out what.\"Nancy straightened her bright blue sweatshirt. Then she tightened the matching blue scrunchie in her hair. It held her reddish blond hair in a ponytail.I don't want my new teacher to see me looking sloppy, Nancy thought.\"Should we come with you?\" George asked.Nancy shook her head. \"Wait here.\"As soon as she neared Ms. Spencer and the man, Nancy slowed down.I can't just walk right up to them, Nancy thought. Maybe I can see what's on that paper if I stand on something.Nancy looked around. There was a tire swing nearby. She walked toward the swing. But just as she reached for it, Mike Minelli ran up and grabbed it by the chain.\"Ha, ha. Got here first,\" Mike called as he climbed on the tire.He started swinging as hard as he could. He came much too close to Nancy. She jumped out of the way.Nancy crossed her arms and turned around. She marched back toward George and Bess. They ran to meet her.\"I saw that,\" Bess said. \"What a creep!\"\"I don't care,\" Nancy said. \"I couldn't see the paper from there anyway. It was too far away. \"Just then the bell rang. Everyone started running toward the door.\"Come on,\" Nancy said, smiling. \"Let's go in. We have a mystery to solve.\"\"A mystery?\" a voice near Nancy said. Nancy looked over and saw Rebecca Ramirez. She was walking right behind Nancy, Bess, and George. \"What mystery?\"\"We're getting a new teacher,\" Bess answered .Instantly, Rebecca put her hands up to her face. \"Oh, no!\" Rebecca cried. \"How awful for you.\"Nancy smiled. Rebecca wanted to be an actress when she grew up. She always actedverydramatic.Veryhappy.Verysad.Veryupset. About everything.\"How can you stand it?\" Rebecca said, grabbing Nancy's arm.\"We don't know if it's true,\" Nancy said. \"It's just a rumor. But we're going to find out.\"\"Well, let me know after school,\" Rebecca said. Then she hurried to her own third-grade class.Nancy and her friends moved quickly through the hallway.\"I'm going to stand at the pencil sharpener by Ms. Spencer's desk,\" Bess announced. \"Maybe I can get a look at that paper when she puts it on her desk.\"\"Okay,\" Nancy agreed. \"George and I will try to get Ms. Spencer's attention.\"But as soon as Nancy took her seat, Ms. Spencer walked in. The paper was in her hand. Bess didn't have time to go to the pencil sharpener.\"Class, take your seats please,\" Ms. Spencer said. \"I have something to tell you all.\"Uh-oh, Nancy thought. Here it comes. Nancy felt her throat get tight. She didn't want a new teacher. Ms. Spencer was the best teacher Nancy had ever had.\"Please quiet down, everyone,\" Ms. Spencer said. She walked around to sit on the edge of her desk.The class got quiet very quickly. I know what you're going to say, Nancy thought .\"I have something very important to tell you, \" Ms. Spencer said, smiling. \"Something very nice. In a few weeks, I'm getting married.

Eleven of his 40 plays survive virtually complete. These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy, and they are used to define the genre. Also known as the Father of Comedy and the Prince of Ancient Comedy, Aristophanes has been said to recreate the life of ancient Athens more convincingly than any other author. His powers of ridicule were feared and acknowledged by influential contemporaries; Plato singled out Aristophanes' play The Clouds as slander contributing to the trial and execution of Socrates although other satirical playwrights had also caricatured the philosopher. His second play, The Babylonians (now lost), was denounced by the demagogue Cleon as a slander against the Athenian polis. It is possible that the case was argued in court but details of the trial are not recorded and Aristophanes caricatured Cleon mercilessly in his subsequent plays, especially The Knights, the first of many plays that he directed himself. \"In my opinion,\" he says through the Chorus in that play, \"the author-director of comedies has the hardest job of all.\"", "related": ["B0093M15D2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Each chapter includes a sidebar with a pertinent debate topic, such as \"How Important Was the Stonewall Riot?\" In addition, the book has a time line of key events from 1890 to 2005 and an extensive bibliography, which add to the usefulness of this source for reports or for serious older teens who simply want to learn more about GLBT history in the U.S.Queer Americawill complement well Alsenas'sGay America(Abrams, 2008), which is for younger students.—Betty S.

Cummins automatic writing was mainly of a spiritual nature and was witnessed by several theologians and scholars who later endorsed and edited her writings. Her first book, The Spirits of Cleophas (1928), claimed to supplement the biblical books of the Acts of the Apostles and the epistles of St. Paul. It was a historic narrative of the early church and the work of the apostles from immediately after the death of Jesus to St. Paul's departure from Berea for Athens.   In the production of the first two sections of the book, Cummins was associated with F. Bligh Bond, the noted English architect, illustrator, archaeologist, and psychical researcher, but later she received the scripts independently. Her second book, Paul in Athens (1930) is a continuation of  'Cleophas 'The third, The Great Days of Ephesus (1933), followed the same line of thought.   The trilogy offered new interpretations of several obscure passages in the Acts of the Apostles, which apparently are more in line with the early church. For example, it was claimed that only a profound student could have given the head of the Jewish community in Antioch the title \"Archon,\" because the usual title was \"ethnarch.\" In the chronicle of Cleophas, Cleophas was not the direct communicator.    The information came through an entity know as \"the messenger.\" The messenger was ostensibly lower down the spiritual food chain than Cleophas and therefore could communicate with Cummins on the earth plane.    Cummins's fourth book, The Road to Immortality (1932), a series of communications allegedly from F. W. H. Myers, gives a glorious vision of the progression of the human spirit through eternity. In the Introduction Beatrice Gibbes described the method of communication employed by Cummins.    She would sit at a table, cover her eyes with her left and hand on concentrate on \"stillness.\"  She would then fall into a light trance or dream state.  Her hand would then begin to write.  Usually, her \"control\" would make some introductory remarks and announce that another entity was waiting to speak.  Because of her semi-trance condition and also because of the speed at which the writing would come, Gibbes would sit beside her and remove each sheet of paper as it was filled. Cummins' hand was quickly lifted by Gibbes to the top of the new page, and the writing would continue without a break.  In one sitting, Gibbes stated, Cummins wrote 2,000 words in 75 minutes, whereas her normal compositions were much slower - perhaps 800 words in seven or eight hours.   Gibbes added that she witnessed the writing of about 50 different personalities, all claiming to be 'dead,' and all differing in character and style, coming through Cummins' hand. The noted physicist and psychical researcher Sir Oliver Lodge offered his observations of Cummins's genuineness in the book's preface:   \"I believe this to be a genuine attempt to convey approximately true ideas, through an amanuensis of reasonable education, characterized by ready willingness for devoted service, and of transparent honesty.\"   Cummins went on to author The Swan on a Black Sea: a Study in Automatic Writing: the Cummins-Willett Scripts (1970). The book is a detailed study of her automatic scripts received from the deceased \"Mrs. Willett\" a pseudonym of Winifred Coombe-Tennant, the British suffragette, politician, and philanthropist. This highly regarded work contains a foreword by parapsychologist Professor C. D.

Window, the first piece, sets the tone: a woman stands at the window wearing a garter belt and motions to her lover standing outside in the snow. Elsewhere, seductions occur in places like church, where a narrator waits to meet her neighbor; on the streets of San Francisco; within a community of Russian émigrés in Paris; or by the waiter in a Parisian cafe bathroom—scenes all depicted with a certain aloof obliqueness. Evocations rather than development are Berdeshevsky's forte, as in Cage, where a caged white female monkey in a Manhattan pet store becomes a metaphor for the protagonist, who is sexually assaulted in the store. In many of the pieces, accompanied by photographs of statues and nudes by the author, the protagonists wait for a beautiful thing to happen. These moody moments can be evanescent, but as stories they're not quite satisfying.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

True relevance and practical impact come from taking a stand based on what you know or can reasonably extrapolate, divorced from 'accepted' ideology and convention. The real players of the Program are its most truly and unabashedly individual participants, no matter the social stigmas they experience because of that. They're not just those propped up and empowered by their friends to represent a socially acceptable and respectable form of 'individual'. This work will appeal to individuals of that true, genuine sense.Impetus: I'd wanted to capture that open and honest insanity, vanity and credulity of those who'd surrounded me during my formative years. After a decade out of high school, I came to realise that the personalities from that time were far more truly reflective of the individuals behind them than what I now experience everyday as an 'adult'. A suitably epic setting was needed to enable people's grand insanities without distracting too much from the narrative, and history itself felt like the perfect vehicle to achieve that.Protagonist: I'd define a hero as someone who sticks to their own considered and honestly embraced ideals in any situation. Lex Ryerson might stand out militarily, but politically, his arc as protagonist has him sometimes embracing practicality over a pragmatic integration of ideals and circumstance, which could arguably disqualify him as my own sort of hero. Readers can argue, but one character each from the Black and Yellow factions could meet my criteria, but to say more might detract from the adventure.", "related": ["B004N62MC6"], "rank": 33910, "title": "Of Empires Vapid and Grand", "author": "Dean Marden", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Without reading it, she called it garbage, a waste of time and paper, then forced Sue to watch as she tore it up and threw it in the trash. Giving up writing until she had left home at 18, Sue started writing poetry, then wrote her first book, a memoir about her life after the kidnapping. Not stopping there, she wrote two other books in this series, and has a new poetry book out that exposes feelings never shared before. She is currently working on a series of short stories. Today she lives in Nevada with her husband, two dogs, a cat and a bird. She enjoys the outdoors, reading and writing. All of her books are available as e-books and on Kindle.

This lady has either seen it all or done it all. Born in Xenia, Ohio and later moved to California, then Ohio and eventually landing in Alabama to finally finish her schooling - she should be referred to as a survivor. Her family will tell you that no matter what the circumstances, or how high she falls from, she always ends up landing on her feet! Myka's work ethic constantly keeps her working with a full plate. While attending school and maintaining a 4.0 GPA, she still finds the time to volunteer at the local animal shelter, lead the Spanish club and participate in the psychology and law clubs' activities on campus. All of this and she still found time to write her book, a three part series called \"Memoirs of a New Age Feral Child\", AND publish it herself! Leaving little for spare time, when there is, she is constantly looking for avenues to outreach to community youth in whatever city she is in AND design her jewelry!

This volume offers an excellent overview of the kinds of scholarship currently being pursued and represents a significant contribution to our understanding of this intriguing figure and his times.' --Professor Carl R. TruemanJohn Owen is arguably one of the most important Reformed theologians to have written in the English language. His work demonstrates what is best about constructive theology: a deep and sympathetic engagement with the tradition, a broad understanding of human learning, and an incisive and nimble mind, able to zero in on the most fundamental theological questions. These characteristics are explored in the essays of this volume, which give a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in the recent resurgence of interest in his work. They offer an overview of Owen s thought, his intellectual context, and his ongoing significance for theology today that places beyond doubt his significance for the wider Church. This is a most welcome Companion to the study of one of the greatest Puritan minds. --Oliver D. Crisp, Fuller Theological Seminary, USAOwen's reputation as one of the most distinguished minds of the seventeenth century is by now well established. This collection of well-informed interpretative essays provides an excellent guide to the range of his thought. --John Webster, University of Aberdeen, UK", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Having left a busy practice in London, he opens a small law office in the hope of a quieter life.

Christopher Scott does an excellent job pacing and interpreting the story, making the most of its slowly evolving picture of small-town life. He also differentiates among the voices of characters, using a range of British accents effortlessly and to good effect. All in all, this is an entertaining, diverting and well-produced mystery.

I became interested in writing at an early age and started writing my first novel at the age of fourteen. However, the project was abandoned when I developed other interests such as girls, cars, and sports. I joined the Army during the height of the Vietnam War and after graduating from helicopter flight school, I served a tour in Viet Nam where I logged over a thousand combat flight hours and survived three helicopter crashes. After returning from Viet Nam, I started writing about my Vietnam experiences and over the course of several years, I finally completed my memoirs which I hope to publish someday.  I married my wife, Bonnie, shortly before leaving the service and after completing my military obligation, we returned to Colorado where I originally planned to pursue a career in law enforcement. However, after dabbling in law enforcement, I found my niche in retail sporting goods and spent twenty years with a Denver based national sporting goods company. After a very successful career with that company, I went to work for a second national sporting goods retailer. My job   responsibilities with both companies required a significant amount of policy and procedure writing, but I really didn’t have time to do any creative writing until about five years ago when travel became a much bigger part of my job. When I was away from home, rather than spend my evenings in the hotel bar or watching TV, I again took up the pen and started writing western novels which resulted in my first two published works.  My life-long interests and hobbies include western history, antique firearms, old cowboy junk, and Native American collectables. I think my hobbies and the expertise I gained as a result of those hobbies, has contributed significantly to the realism and detail correctness of my novels.   I recently retired and now spend most of my time writing and enjoying life with my wife, Bonnie, on our small Colorado ranch, where we keep a couple of mules, horses, and raise Black Angus cattle. “Life don’t get any better than that.”", "related": ["B00J1IN4B4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's difficult to explain the ending without it being\na big spoiler, but I ended this story using a technique that is often used in\nnovels and movies. Think of the ending of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\nThat movie ends in the middle of a gunfight and the viewers are not told if the\ntwo characters survive or not, but most know how it ends for the real-life bank\nrobbers, anyway. (The real-world records show the two bank robbers were surrounded\nby soldiers, who heard one man screaming until a gunshot ended it for him and\nthen another gunshot rang out. The next day, the house was entered and both\nrobbers were found dead. One had shot the other to end his suffering and then\nshot himself.) Any reader considering all the facts in the last scene of my\nstory and the main character's ability as a professional shooting competitor\ncan easily understand how the scene ends without being told. If it means\nanything, my editor liked the way I ended this story. :)", "related": ["B00L826G5W"], "rank": 1146902, "title": "Fierce Blood", "author": "John Grit", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 4.0833, "rating_total": 49.0}

She also had several of her writings published in an Anthology-- Soundings, by the Poetry Fellowship of Maine.

How did that happen? Medieval scholar Montanari explores all the factors of history, war, religion, politics, economics, and gastronomy that brought together the peoples who would eventually become Italian and the habits of day-to-day life that would construct their foods, customs, and overall culture. From the Roman encounter with “barbarians” to the role of Arab traders and later European encounters with the New World, Montanari traces the influences that came to define Italian identity. In the medieval period, he focuses on the uniquely Italian features of civic development and the dominance of cities over lordship territories, which gave rise to municipalities and regions that circulated merchandise and shared ideas about culture. He explores the evolution of pasta, tortes, and various sauces; the impact of travel and modes of food production and preservation; and how Palermo, Naples, Bologna, Florence, Venice, and other cities came to earn their reputations for cuisine. This slim volume is a delightful excursion into the cuisine and culture of Italy. --Vanessa Bush", "related": ["B00CV9QJ1M"], "rank": 684285, "title": "Italian Identity in the Kitchen, or Food and the Nation (Arts and Traditions of the Table: Perspectives on Culinary History)", "author": "Massimo Montanari", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All of his life Garth has enjoyed creating and has channeled those energies into art, music, prop making, and writing. In college he was told frequently that he should look at writing professionally though at that time his passions lay in music and drawing. After being put in a collaborative environment with other writers, working book covers and editing, Garth was bitten by the bug again and dove back into writing. Currently, Garth has his first book \"Awaken\" out and is working on two additional novels in the series. In addition he is preparing to write a fantasy series as well as writing stories for a soon to be released anthology with several other authors including his lovely wife, Heather. When Garth does find time to relax he enjoys reading, comic books, video games, music, going camping and off-roading, as well as putting a few hours in at the range to keep up his firearm skills.", "related": [], "rank": 2418603, "title": "Evolve (The Children of Divinity Book 2) eBook", "author": "Garth Reasby", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Besides, he also graduated with a diploma in hotel management from the American Hotel & Motel Association (formerly known as AHMA, now AHLA).

(Leila Tarazi Fawaz, author ofAn Occasion for War: Mount Lebanon and Damascus in 1860)Thompsonboldly tackles some of the thorniest issues in the making of the modern Middle East--constitutionalism, freedom, democracy, visions of justice from across the political spectrum--and lucidly demonstrates how they have been experienced and contested by a broad range of social actors. An urgent and accessible history of 'ideas in action,'Justice Interruptedis essential reading for anyone interested in the past, present, and possible futures of the entire region. (Max Weiss, author ofIn the Shadow of Sectarianism: Law, Shi'ism, and the Making of Modern Lebanon)Thompsonsees the thirst for justice and reform blossoming as long as 400 years ago, when the region was in the hands of the Ottoman Empire. In the generations since, bureaucrats, intellectuals, workers, and peasants have seized on the language of empire, law, and even Islam to agitate for rights and due process...Most intriguing, she finds elements of this constitutional liberalism even within fundamentalist Islamist movements that democratizers most worry about. These threads suggest a possible way forward, a way to build a constitutional, democratic consensus on indigenous if often overlooked traditions. Islamists and secular Arabs, it turns out, have found common ground in the past, even written constitutions together. The same could happen again now...It's easy to assume that religiously driven movements are all antidemocratic--and indeed, some have proven so in practice, like the ayatollahs in Iran or the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. But Thompson offers a more nuanced view, showing that many of these religious movements have internalized central elements of liberal discourse.(Thanassis CambanisBoston Globe2013-08-18)[This] study on the rise of constitutionalism in the Middle East swiftly dispenses with the facile explanations of the Arab uprisings, instead offering readers a comprehensive yet nuanced look at the lasting impact of efforts to enshrine and institutionalize the language of justice across the region during the last two centuries.(Abdullah Al-ArianH-Diplo2013-09-01)Thompson’s portraits are lively, accurate and informative--a highly readable primer for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of Middle Eastern political history.

It has been like this all my life, and if it hadn't been for the vast quantities of beer I consumed in my youth, I would probably have published more novels. Now, I have published one novel, and the funny thing is that I wrote this book at a point in my life where I have no time at all. I guess I've grown up at that point. I've become disciplined and even serious at times. Oh yes, it is astonishing what a few thousand dirty diapers will do to a man! I mean, one morning I woke up as an author, and found myself slightly bald - no wonder authors look the way the do. Besides writing, I love photography, astronomy and yelling at other motorists when driving. If I'm not working on my next novel, I try to keep the blog www.fkhansen.com more or less up to date.

If Jamestown had been annihilated, the United States might never have existed. The roots of our free society, in a country that touches two oceans, began in this little settlement on the James River. In that wooden fort, laws were passed in Jamestown before pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock.Rebelling against the pushy English culture and land-grabbing settlers, Powhatan Chief Opechancanough planned to destroy the entire British colony. However, Chanco, a brave Indian boy, who had been baptized into Christianity, refused to follow his tribe's orders to kill Richard Pace. Instead, he chose to warn his kind employer of the impending attack. In the middle of the night, Richard Pace became the Paul Revere of his century. He frantically paddled a canoe across the James River to warn the governor: \"The Indians are coming.\" Because of the bravery of Chanco and Richard Pace, no one died in Jamestown.Follow the story of Richard Pace who begins life in 16th century London, England, travels across the Atlantic Ocean to a New World, and makes his mark in the history of the United States of America. See how the diverse cultures of the English, Native Americans, and African slaves ultimately culminated in the bloodbath of March 22, 1622.A chapter on modern-day Jamestown includes a map that shows where these events happened. See the excavated ruins and the swampy ground of \"Historic Jamestowne.\" Tour the \"Jamestown Settlement\" with its re-created buildings and climb aboard the replica wooden ships. Take the ferry across the James River to read the plaques and monuments erected in memory of Chanco and of Richard Pace's frenzied canoe trip across the dark James River to warn the settlers.Janie Mae Jones McKinley holds degrees from Mars Hill College and Western Carolina University. In addition to her interests in history and sociology, she is a 14th-generation descendent of Richard Pace.", "related": [], "rank": 1461942, "title": "The Cultural Roots of the 1622 Indian Attack", "author": "Janie Mae Jones McKinley", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I'd certainly recommend this book both for McGilloway fans and if you just want a good crime book to read. thecrimewarp This a very well-paced story, which ratchets up a gear towards the end. Crime fiction and police procedural fans will enjoy this. Lucy Black is a welcome addition to the ranks of fictional detectives. randomthingsthroughmyletterbox", "related": ["B00JYEEBDU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The whole thing was a rain cloud over my acting career.   I grew tired and distant. I studied with several speech coaches, yet I often felt like I skipped a lesson somewhere,  because the way they sounded didn’t reflect what I heard in the media. After learning the basics of the phonetic alphabet, I turned the volume up on my television and analyzed how Americans truly pronounce their vowels and consonants.  This combination of book-learning and ruthless appraisal opened the doors to understanding the American accent. My own accent became a virtual non-issue.  I began coaching, then in the nineties I started as an instructor in the Los Angeles City College system.

Since I was a young American teen growing up in Mexico City, I got lost in the books I read and daydreamed of the stories I'd write. It was through the loving support of my hardworking wife of nearly thirty years that I realized my dream of becoming a writer.                School can teach us the basics of life. Sports can teach us loyalty, camaraderie, and hard work, but only experience can teach us the harsh realities, humor, and amiable personalities that make up a good story. My stories involve believable characters battling desperate odds in nonstop action to achieve personal goals. These characters struggle against their inner demons and faults as they learn to grow, to love, and to sacrifice for the good of all. Oh, and let's not forget the dogs. They're characters, too, and any good story has to involve man's best friend.  My goal is that my stories will help a weary reader relax, forget their troubles, and escape to a vivid, exotic world of adventure that's never without its humor. My hope is that readers will love and cheer for the good guys, boo and hiss at the bad ones, and maybe come away with something for themselves when it's over.        So please join me and meet characters like Jack Bucher, a teen struggling to grow up in a foreign land with the help of a spirit mentor. Meet Global Inspector Burt Campbell as he battles a corrupt military and science gone bad to save the futuristic world from destruction. Fight alongside Rex Bana as he combats serial killers and organized crime while confronting his own issues with morality.\"Children dream at any age.\" Join in these dreams and become a believer.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Readers are advised to peruse the series in order, or wrestle with the many names and relationships introduced here. Kit Marlowe, playwright and sometime Queen’s spy, uses his myriad connections and knowledge of London’s political and underworld dramatis personae to clear William Shakespeare’s name of a full-view, onstage killing and solve two possibly related murders. The leisurely pace and daily difficulties of Elizabethan life, evoked with an ornate style and the sometimes obscure vocabulary of the time (snaphaunce, deodand, catchpole), along with droll situational humor, focus attention on Marlowe’s creative wit and his opponents’ deceitful illusions more than on the puzzle’s solution. A few anachronisms mar the telling (“Cambridge was so six months ago”), but fans of the series and of Edward Marston’s amusing Elizabethan theater mysteries, featuring Nicholas Bracewell, will enjoy Kit Marlowe’s part in the drama at the Crimson Rose. --Jen Baker", "related": [], "rank": 871690, "title": "Crimson Rose (The Kit Marlowe Mysteries Book 5)", "author": "M.

The ABC's of Craps starts off with a a caution and disclaimer, stating that the book guarantees nothing beyond offering the basics of the game and a chance to play the game and understand what's going on.

My family was fairly apolitical, with Republican leanings. I graduated with a BA in political science from California State College, Bakersfield in 1974 (magna cum laude); earned a MA in political science from University of California, Davis in 1976; and finished everything but my PhD dissertation (ABD) in political science at University of California, Santa Barbara in 1980. I began political life as a typical McGovern liberal, moved left to become a card carrying member of the Socialist Party USA, and in the late 1990s evolved into a libertarian. During undergraduate and graduate studies I was active in-on campus politics. As a graduate student at UC Santa Barbara in the late 1970s I led the Graduate Students Association in joining the nationwide Coors beer boycott and several other political campaigns. In 1980 I was arrested, along with hundreds of others, for civil disobedience at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. From the early 1980s to the mid-1990s I was a hyper-active socialist: twice ran for Santa Barbara City Council openly as a socialist in the mid-1980s; worked with tenants (three city-wide rent control campaigns in seven years), and gays and lesbians (Deb, my wife, was the first heterosexual on the Gays and Lesbian Resource Center Board of Directors); and fought political cultists in California’s Peace and Freedom Party (the only socialist party with ballot status in California). During this period I also found time to work full-time as an editor (from 1982 to 2000) of a political science journal published in Santa Barbara. From the early 1980s to 2000, I published several political articles in publications such as Liberty magazine, the Santa Barbara News-Press, the Santa Barbara Independent, The Socialist, Left Out, and Tenants United. From 2000 to 2009, I mostly dropped out of politics and concentrate on my job (Real Property Appraiser for the Santa Barbara County Assessor’s Office); building a real estate “empire” (four rental condos); and exploring and hiking the southwestern United States with my wife, Deb, as often as we could get away. Since 2010 (as of December 2013) I have had more than 40 essays published in The Salt Lake Tribune, The Spectrum (local St. George daily newspaper), and the Los Alamos Daily Post. The majority are hiking/travel stories along with some political and humorous essays.", "related": [], "rank": 4194882, "title": "Challenge Authority", "author": "Tom Garrison", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has participated in reading events at primary schools in County Derry, Northern Ireland, Seeley Primary School, Sherwood, and has taught English to young children participating in the Spanish school system’s extracurricular activity programme.  She has been interviewed extensively by European and American bloggers, and her work has been featured in Indie Author News, British Indie Fiction, the Coleraine Times, and The Nottingham Post.

She is actively involved in fund raisers supporting not only local rescue centers, but also for international programs, such as saving the wild mustangs in the Pryor Mountain range in Montana.
