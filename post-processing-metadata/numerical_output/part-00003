As in his highly praised first novel (Sons of the City), the Philadelphia Daily News reporter plunges readers directly into Sgt. Eddie North's daily life as a cop in a city riven by racial tension. When Sonny Knight, a powerful African-American city councilman, is found beaten on the streets of West Philadelphia, he accuses the first two white police officers to arrive on the scene of inflicting the damage-and then adds Eddie's name to his list when North answers their call for backup. Eddie knows he's innocent, and neither of his cops appears to have been involved in any violence. But the city's police and political leaders, already under pressure from the controversial case of a radical black college professor charged with killing a white cop, seem less than eager to believe North and his men-especially when one of the accused cops appears to have a hidden history of mayhem. Under investigation by internal affairs, Eddie risks his beloved job and several police department friendships as he tries to come up with reasons for Councilman Knight to have lied about his beating. Flander is especially good at showing how decent people on both sides of a racial quagmire can be dangerously blinkered and how easily hard-won loyalties and friendships can be destroyed.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00FSPXGZS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

McRae tells about his heroes and also the town vagabonds who came and went through the landscape of his growing up and growing wise through a lifetime on a Montana ranch.This collection of tales weaves a tapestry of character sketches about people in a rather isolated, often insulated, rural community. The stories are genuine and honest, conversational and easy to read. At times humorous and poignant-and always engaging-this personal memoir from cowboy poetry's most beloved curmudgeon is a can't-put-it-down read.Wallace McRae is a third-generation cattle rancher in southeastern Montana, and a widely acclaimed writer and performer of cowboy poetry. He was the recipient of a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts and was appointed to the National Endowment for the Arts Council by President Clinton. McRae has been featured on Garrison Keillor's A Prairie Home Companion and has performed across the United States and been featured in cultural exchanges in Australia, Scotland and England. McRae's poems have appeared in numerous cowboy poetry anthologies. He is the author of The Cowboy Curmudgeon and lives on the family's Rocker Six Ranch.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Castro (Bossa Nova), a notable Brazilian essayist, meanders through Rio the way a long-time resident might take a visitor through favorite neighborhoods, telling charming anecdotes as they occur to him: a French viscount's lunatic plan to knock down the Sugar Loaf mountain that rises in the midst of Guanabara Bay; the quixotic efforts to move Carnival to the cooler month of June; the playboy Porfirio Rubirosa's loss of his wife in the middle of a dance floor. Historical fables are woven in with an account of contemporary Brazil and a strong dose of the legendary carioca humor. Castro takes us from Amerigo Vespucci's arrival in Brazil in 1502 to the 17th- and 18th-century battles for control of Rio, recounting colonial-era maneuvering with an ear for irony. His musical chronicles follow the Belle Époque and the first hit samba in the 1960s Carnival, \"The Girl from Ipanema.\" He also recounts the drug wars and the growth of the hillside favela slums. He conveys Rio'sjeito,or indefinable spirit, in a way that no traditional travel book could ever do.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

These two large-format paperbacks offer explanations and activities for children who don't understand or haven't mastered multiplication and division. By taking different approaches to explain the same concepts, Long increases the probability that something will click in the student's mind. Some chapters, such as the one on multiplying by one, are excellent for building solid understanding. Others, such as the chapter on dividing by erasing zeroes, are disappointing in this regard. The cheerful ink drawings help make the books more inviting. Overall, these will be useful supplemental resources for students who need some help with the fundamental skills of multiplication and division.Carolyn PhelanCopyright © American Library Association.

He was taken to Rome for his education with the idea of a public career and by the year 70 he had established himself as the leading barrister in Rome.  In the meantime his political career was well under way and he was elected praetor for the year 66.  One of the most permanent features of his political life was his attachment to Pompeii.  As a politician, his greatest failing was his consistent refusal to compromise; as a statesman his ideals were more honorable and unselfish than those of his contemporaries.  Cicero was the greatest of the roman orators, posessing a wide range of technique and an excpetional command of the  Latin tongue.  He followed the common practice of publishing his speeches, but he also produced a large number of works on the theory and practice of rhetoric, on religion,  and on moral and political philosophy.  He played a leading part in the development of the Latin hexameter.  Perhaps the most interesting of all his works is the collection fo 900 remarkably informative letters, published posthumously.  These not only contain a first-hand account of social and political life in the upper classes at Rome, but also reflect the changing personal feelings of an emotional and sensitive man.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was followed in sequence byAn Affair of the Heartand then byThe Look of Love, both of which have been published separately. All three have been on my website since then. The link between them all, apart from the fact that they are all set in Manchester, is that each one finishes where the next one starts. SoMind Gamesfinishes in the hospital which also features at the beginning ofAn Affair of the Heart, which in turn finishes in Debenhams Department Store whereThe Look of Lovebegins.In 2000 I revisitedMind Gamesand adapted it into a screenplay. This was because I wanted to expand the virtual reality parts of the story, particularly where events occurred in the mind of the heroine. I had also written several other stories during the intervening years and had experimented in dual personality characters in my science fiction and fantasy stories, so I was unhappy with this aspect in the original version. I was also interested in the idea of writing a screenplay to see if this was easier or harder than writing a story in the traditional narrative style. So rather than simply rewrite the story I modified it and then adapted it into a screenplay instead. Although it is the only screenplay I have written, as I prefer the traditional style, I do think that the story is better suited to this format due to its fast and frequent scene changes. But you can be the judge of that.Included in this volume are both the original narrative and updated screenplay versions of the story for your comparison and delectation. Because I happen to think the screenplay version is slightly better I have included it first, but you can read them in the order of your choice.", "related": [], "rank": 35901, "title": "Mind Games", "author": "David George Richards", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The U.S. was then rigidly segregated, particularly in the South and in southerner-heavy institutions, including the military, especially the Marine Corps. The marine commander established training for blacks at Montford Point, North Carolina, and from 1942 to 1949, when the camp closed after President Truman desegregated all the armed forces, it trained more than 20,000 men, most for the Pacific theater. McLaurin interviewed 61 veterans of Montford Point and relays their words on who they were, why they joined, how they trained, and the combat they saw (many served in Korea and Vietnam, too). They reflect never-ending struggles with the deliberate and unconscious bigotry of the time and place. The Marine Corps is fully integrated now, and the marines of Montford Point aren't familiar now to the general public. Several Point trainees wrote memoirs, and with them McLaurin adds invaluably to the literature on blacks in the military.Roland GreenCopyright © American Library Association.

With the onset of World War II, 11-year-old Ruth Glasberg changed from being a happy and prosperous child to becoming her family's lone survivor within a few months. As she grew and continued to survive in Nazi-controlled Europe, she began to believe the real punishment was to continue living. She describes existence in the concentration camps of Transnistria, rescue failures, and ultimately freedom in Palestine. She tells of how she felt as a child, and brings in what she, as an adult, now knows as truth regarding the events that overtook her young life. The author takes her story beyond the Holocaust, and includes her experiences in the newly formed nation of Israel.

Now here in the society pages of a London newspaper is a photo of his mystery lady: Miranda Granger. According to the article, Miranda will be celebrating the holiday season at the Grandview Hotel with her family. This, of course, means Troy will now be vacationing at the same resort. Once Troy arrives, though, he discovers Miranda is less than thrilled with his company, and if he is to have any hope of capturing her on canvas, he will have to find a way to win her trust.

Like a modern Ruth Benedict immersed in classical literature, Visser (Much Depends on Dinner) examines what it really means, in the course of human interaction, to be thankful. Her kindly book turns on itself in an exhaustive but continually engrossing fashion. Beginning with the assumption that [g]ratitude must be freely given; otherwise, it might be a polite show, but it is not gratitude, Visser asks many questions of cultures East and West and provides a plethora of answers. The obscured and deeper meaning of giving thanks is probed through such divergent cultural markers as the work of Georg Simmel and Dickens; the Bible and Proust; Japanesesumimasen, which is both a thanking and an apologizing, and C.C. Baxter in Bill Wilder'sThe Apartment; Plato's Laws and Seneca's massive treatise on gift giving and the slipperiness of saying you're welcome in today's U.K. What is tipping all about? What is the etymological relationship between votive, vow, favors, grace and gratitude? What might the gestures of courtesy—the curtsy for example—be? Overall, this is a delightful and graceful gift of a book, for which any fortunate recipient will be thankful.(Nov. 19)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their efforts bring them into contact with Chicago's weird underworld--including junkie/murderers and a deformed prostitute whose head grows out her chest--and their own true selves.

I live in the rolling hills of Kentucky with my husband and two children on a beautiful secluded farm of horses and hay fields. I have always wanted to be an author, ever since I was about five years old when my parents gave me a \"personalized\" children's book that featured me as the hero of the story. Seeing my full name in print was where the dream to become an author began. When I am not writing, I love to spend my time on the back of a horse, whether with my family or with my friends. There is nothing like feeling the sunlight on your face, the wind in your hair, and the power of the animal beneath you as you enjoy the beautiful scenery. Seeing the world from a saddle is, by far, the best view and the best therapy for a heavy heart or a troubled mind. My therapist's name, or my horse's, rather, is “Statues Suddenly Lucky”, a full-blooded Tennessee Walker, and of course, he goes by the name of Lucky for short. I am a sucker for a good cup of coffee (lots of cream and sugar...and whipped cream if I can get my hands on it), great conversation, and a lilting Irish accent. I love to read and I can't resist watching great epic historical movies. www.reneevincent.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.6, "rating_total": 23.0}

White was a woman of remarkable spiritual gifts who lived most of her life during the nineteenth century (1827-1915), yet through her writings she is still making a revolutionary impact on millions of people around the world.

She is the most translated woman writer in the entire history of literature, and the most translated American author of either gender. Her writings cover a broad range of subjects, including religion, education, social relationships, evangelism, prophecy, publishing, nutrition, and management. Her life-changing masterpiece on successful Christian living, Steps to Christ, has been published in more than 140 languages.  From the time she was 17 years old until she died 70 years later, God gave her approximately 2,000 visions and dreams. The visions varied in length from less than a minute to nearly four hours. The knowledge and counsel received through these revelations she wrote out to be shared with others. Thus her special writings are accepted by Seventh-day Adventists as inspired, and their exceptional quality is recognized even by casual readers. This remarkable woman, who met all the tests of a true prophet as set forth in the Holy Scriptures, helped found the Seventh-day Adventist church.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tucker, however, doubts Boehm, who worked as a private investigator, took her own life, as the police believe. Instead, Tucker suspects that Boehm's demise was connected with her probes into Alan Talmadge, a creep who targeted middle-aged women and killed them in a way that looked like accident or suicide. Relying on her wits, Tucker takes over the search for Talmadge. She looks into a number of people of interest who were in Newcastle at the time of Boehm's death, including a gangster's son and a prominent businessman. While the climax won't surprise every reader, Herron does a nice job of planting red herrings and making his heroine's amateur sleuthing plausible.(Apr.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

InThe Back Doctor, he advocated activity instead of bed rest. In place of braces and girdles, he suggested that patients follow a program of specific exercise. Most of all, he took the mystery out of back pain.Three out of four Canadian adults, and an increasing number of children, suffer some form of back discomfort. They make up a huge and lucrative market for unscrupulous practitioners. New treatments ? new drugs, new devices, and supposedly new, high-tech therapies ? are advertised daily. New controversies, such as a recent scare about chiropractic neck manipulation, find their way into newspaper headlines.A Consultation with the Back Doctoris Dr. Hall?s response to these and other developments.This is a completely new book. It is written, like its predecessors, in an informal, easy-to-understand question-and-answer format. Readers will come away with a sound understanding of their condition and a practical course of action to make it better.From the Hardcover edition.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So begins a truly great adventure that drags Broudy halfway around the world and through a whiplashing gauntlet of emotional crests and troughs, forcing him to play friend, protector, fixer, PR agent, and a host of other duties on Otis's behalf. Luckily for readers, Broudy maintains an intelligent open-mindedness--if not throughout, at least in the recall--in the face of lies, danger, and significant self-discovery. (He also assembles as rich a working definition of sainthood as any I've comes across outside of canonical hagiography.)The Saintsucceeds on all levels: as profile, as travelogue, as a tale of true adventure.

The debate now wrestles with some fourteen or so\nvolumes and counting, and mainly revolves around publication order versus\ninternal-chronological order. I favor internal chronological, with a few\ncaveats. I have always resisted numbering my volumes; partly because,\nin the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because\nif I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately\nwithCaptain Vorpatril's Alliance) it would upwhack the numbering\nsystem. Nevertheless, the books and stories do have a chronological order, if\nnot a strict one. It was always my intention to write each book as a\nstand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with\nthat book that's in your handright now, don't put it back on the shelf!\nWhile still somewhat true, as the series developed it acquired a number of\nsub-arcs, closely related tales that were richer for each other. I will list the\nsub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats. Shards of HonorandBarrayar.The first two\nbooks in the series proper, they detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of\nBeta Colony and Aral Vorkosigan of Barrayar.Shardswas my very first\nnovel ever;Barrayarwas actually my eighth, but continues the tale the\nnext day after the end ofShards. For readers who want to be sure of\nbeginning at the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these\ntwo. The Warrior's ApprenticeandThe Vor Game(with, perhaps, the novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" tucked in between.)The\nWarrior's Apprenticeintroduces the character who became the series' linchpin,\nMiles Vorkosigan; the first book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet\nby accident; the second how he fixed his mistakes from the first round. Space\nopera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things one can best\ndiscover for oneself),The Warrior's Apprenticemakes another good place\nto jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male protagonist. After that:Brothers in Armsshould be read beforeMirror\nDance, and both, ideally, beforeMemory. Komarrmakes another good alternate entry point for\nthe series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read\nbeforeA Civil Campaign. Borders of Infinity, a collection of three of the\nfive currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure\nsampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit\nthemselves to length. (But it may make more sense if read afterThe Warrior's\nApprentice.) Take care not to confuse the collection-as-a-whole with its\ntitle story, \"The Borders of Infinity\". Falling Freetakes place 200\nyears earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with\nthe main body of the series. Most readers recommend picking up this story\nlater. It should likely be read beforeDiplomatic Immunity, however,\nwhich revisits the \"quaddies\", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in\nMiles's time. The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear\nin italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words\nand 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.  Falling FreeShards of HonorBarrayarThe Warrior's Apprentice\"The Mountains of Mourning\"\"Weatherman\"The Vor GameCetagandaEthan of AthosBorders of Infinity\"Labyrinth\"\"The Borders of Infinity\"Brothers in ArmsMirror DanceMemoryKomarrA Civil Campaign\"Winterfair Gifts\"Diplomatic ImmunityCaptain Vorpatril's AllianceCryoBurn  Caveats: The novella \"Weatherman\" is an\nout-take from the beginning of the novelThe Vor Game. If you already\nhaveThe Vor Game, you likely don't need this. The original 'novel'Borders of\nInfinitywas a fix-up collection containing the three novellas \"The\nMountains of Mourning\", \"Labyrinth\", and \"The Borders of Infinity\", together\nwith a frame story to tie the pieces together. Again, beware duplication. The\nframe story does not stand alone, and mainly is of interest to completists.  The Fantasy Novels My fantasy novels are a bit easier\nto order. Easiest of all isThe Spirit Ring, which is a stand-alone, or\naquel, as some wag once dubbed books that for some obscure reason failed to\nspawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are the four volumes ofThe Sharing\nKnife--in order,Beguilement,Legacy,Passage, andHorizon--which\nI broke down and actually numbered, as this was one continuous tale divided\ninto non-wrist-breaking chunks. What have come to be called the\nChalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written,\nlike the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and\ncan in theory be read in any order. (The third book actually takes place a few\nhundred years prior to the more closely connected first two.) Some readers\nthink the world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in\npublication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the\nfirst (but not the third.) In any case, the publication order is: The Curse of ChalionPaladin of SoulsThe Hallowed Hunt  The short story collectionProto\nZoawas an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three\n(1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but\nnot in this handy format. The novelette \"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" may be of\ninterest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is the first story in which that proto-universe\nbegan, mentioning Beta Colony but before Barrayar was even thought of. My latest original e-edition isSidelines: Talks and Essays, which is\njust what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of my nonfiction\nwritings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions,\nand some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove an interesting companion\npiece to my fiction. Happy reading!  -- Lois McMaster Bujold.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I was born psychic. The\ntruth is, there is no learned technique to what I do. Being psychic is\nsimply a part of me, as natural as breathing. No, this book is not about\n learning a thing. Rather, this is a book about awakening, new\nawareness, and new understanding. It's a tragedy that unfolded into an\nepiphany that I've since lived by with more conviction than I ever had\npreviously. A conviction that I stand by to this day, and will until the\n day I go into the beyond.I never learned to be psychic. I was\n born knowing. But knowing doesn't mean I was always smart enough to\nlisten to my personal intuitive hits, to trust and to follow without\nquestion. Learning to trust and follow didn't come easily. But it would\nbecome paramount.There are times when life comes at us hard and\nfast, catching even the best of us off guard. None of us can ever truly\nwalk a perfect life. Although I have come to maintain my core balance\nand to trust my intuition implicitly, I'm like everyone else. I wobble\nsometimes. And when I wobble, I have to struggle to regain my center of\npeace. But that center of peace has become more important to me over the\n years, something I cherish, protect, even guard. Especially after what\nI've been through. Especially after my Seven Years of Surrender.This\n is a true story. It could happen to anyone. In the telling of this\nstory, I have changed the names of everyone involved, except, of course,\n for my own. This is the beginning of the Journey Series, the beginning\nof true wisdom, which I will share with you in the books that follow.\nBut not here. Not within these pages. These pages will take you through\nthe event that spun my life into oblivion and back again. Into the\nbeginning of knowledge.To fully understand, you must know where\nI've been, what I've experienced. And how hope became an elusive dream.When\n intuition is ignored, we become vulnerable to tragic events.

I received my theological training at McGill University's Faculty of Religious Studies in Montreal. I lived in Canada for six years and am forever nostalgic for that wonderful country and its civil people. I've been a Unitarian Universalist minister since 1977. Through 1983 I was minister of the First Unitarian Church of Youngstown, Ohio.    I favor back roads and small towns throughout America, urban strolls in Chicago neighborhoods, ethnic restaurants and country cafes, and vegetarian food. Influences include Emerson and Parker, Twain, Jung, Fromm and Frankl, Steinbech and Sinclair Lewis, J. W. Krutch and Hal Borland. I adore Debussy. The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca are my nominees for top movies, but in the right mood, I'll vote for Cinema Paradiso, and sometimes for Blade Runner.

Most recently, his published novels include the Downs-Lord trilogy concerning the establishment of empire in an alternative, monster-ridden England, and Frankenstein’s Legions, a sort-of steampunk sequel to Mary Shelley’s seminal science fiction work, in which the techniques of creating life from the dead are turned to political ends. A former archaeologist and British civil servant, he lives in at least one of the several parallel Binscombes, of which he says: “The scenery and backdrop to the stories may be seen and experienced, in Binscombe itself, and Farncombe and Compton and Godalming and Guildford and Epsom and elsewhere. The inspiration for them lives on, independent and blissfully ignorant of me.” John adds, “All that a reader need know about me is that I’m struggling up the shore of middle age, living with my wife, Liz, my son, Joseph and daughters, Rebecca and Esther, in a part of the south country where the graveyards and old records are littered, over the last four centuries or so, with strangers bearing my surname.

As Jackman continues to deny his symptoms and behaviors, she uncovers disturbing facts about him: women he is sleeping with, a jealous husband and a potential witness who ends up dead.  When Jackman gives his sleeping girlfriend Somnolux and she awakens, a series of fast-moving events accelerate the action to a startling climax.  Chapter narratives alternate between Jackman and Sirken, each replaying key events through the eyes of the other character and creating suspense.... An absorbing thriller based on a real-life issue, with depth, suspense and intriguing psychological twists and turns.", "related": ["B004TNIXYY"], "rank": 2625237, "title": "Come Out Tonight", "author": "Bonnie Rozanski", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.5, "rating_total": 21.0}

En Cartagena de Indias participó en expediciones, fundaciones, encomiendas gubernamentales y otros cargos, aunque su obra principal es la crónica y el ambicioso proyecto de una historia del Perú. Hacia 1548 Cieza se estableció en la Ciudad de los Reyes (actual Lima) y allí empezó a escribir sus crónicas del Nuevo Mundo. Durante los dos años siguientes recorrió el Perú y compiló cuantiosa información para su obra. Regresó a España en 1551 y se casó en Sevilla con una mujer llamada Isabel López. En esta ciudad publicó en 1553 la Primera parte de la crónica del Perú. Murió al año siguiente dejando una obra inédita que fue publicada en 1871, bajo el título de Segunda parte de la crónica del Perú, que trata del señorío de los incas yupangueis y de sus grandes hechos y gobernación. En 1909 se publicó la tercera parte de sus crónicas con el título de Tercer libro de las guerras civiles del Perú, el cual se llama la guerra de Quito. Aunque su obra es histórica, y narra los acontecimientos de la conquista, y de las guerras entre los españoles, su mayor interés radica en la profundidad con que describe la geografía, etnografía, flora y fauna autóctonas.", "related": ["B004SYNSR6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A natural storyteller who loves inventing characters and worlds for them to live in, Linda lives in Auckland with her husband and two daughters, and the rest of the time in the rich, fertile land of her imagination. Her first novel The Dragon's Apprentice, was a finalist in the Junior Ficion Category for the New Zealand Post Children's Book Awards in 2003.  Circle of Dreams Timeweaver is Linda's third title with Scholastic.  The idea for Circle of Dreams came to her one day when she was looking at an old leather-bound book in a second-hand shop and it seemed to have a character all of its own. She began to wonder 'what if' and 'maybe' as all writers do. The rest followed from there. Linda writes mostly children's fantasy but has, in the past, dabbled in adult book. None have been published yet. Her major influence in writing for children came when she was reading 'The Wednesday Wizard' by Sheryl Jordan.  It was written in a style that she admired and has since aimed to achieve. Linda's books do not deal with the 'serious' issue of life as so many books today do. Fantasy is all about visiting a different place for a while and she doesn not include any war, politics or religion in any of her children's stories.

Charlie was the rough-and-tumble American cowboy who was comfortable being gay and Lord Trevor was a reserved Brit in self-denial about being gay. I loved the scenes between them and wished their portion of the story could have been longer and more fleshed out. But perhaps the author will write their story--I know I'll read it! The setting of this book was pastoral England and was well written too. MASTERING LADY MACALISTER is a good historical novella featuring a sexy romance between likable characters who get their HEA after much heartache.\"-- J9,The Romance Reviews, 4 Stars Lady Macalister is a virgin, but once that title is gone, she enjoys sex to the max, learning all she can. Maybe the married couple can find some romance between the sheets, too. This book is as big on plot and romance as it is on sex.

The sheer heft of it, along with the sturdy slipcover; the fine, coated stock; and an unusually intoxicating new-book smell, commanded attention. And when a trailer truck packed with 1,300 copies was hijacked during a cross-country run, I was secretly thrilled that discerning thieves had thought40worthy of a heist—and that the book would soon be showing up on the street at people's prices.No such luck. The unloaded truck was eventually located on an interstate off-ramp, presumably abandoned in disgust. I've tried to imagine the reaction of the hijackers' supervisor when he broke into the trailer and discovered 13,000 pounds ofDoonesburywhere palettes of hi-def TVs should have been. Let us hope no one was hurt; it was an honest mistake.Still, after all that excitement, you'd think that the digital reimagining of40would be a letdown. Not so; we can now invite more people to the party. I've come to appreciate that many readers prefer to forego the risk of herniation while picking up a book—no matter that the risk is slight if you push up from your knees and have someone spot you. There was also the problem of where to display the book once consumed, as standard bookshelves could not accommodate it. We briefly considered shrink-wrapping it with four attachable legs, but then worried it might bump us into Amazon's Home and Kitchen category.Clearly the answer lay in rendering the collection in ones and zeros. And to further facilitate the reader experience, we divided the book into four easy pieces—each covering a full decade's worth of strips. Everyone has a favorite decade, although let's face it, it's never the '70s. Especially in my case. Not to wave the reader off, but my opening decade was filled with the uncertain stops and starts of a rank amateur learning his craft in full public view. I was wildly unready, but as the syndicate salesmen assured me, that was the point. The young had hijacked the culture, and with that standing, our voices—raw, impassioned, ungovernable—were in high demand.Besides, all journeys need a beginning, and the early wheel-spinning is part of the fun. To paraphrase the Dead, it's been a long, strange strip, and40comprises the long of it, it ought to retain the strange as well.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He dares to depict his own attachments and relationships to this very special community, while also staying true to his research. His insights further the reader’s understanding and appreciation of the culture and of the research process, thus expanding the boundaries of anthropology. Readers from budding anthropologists to aid workers to volunteers will identify with Elliot’s observations, experience, and deep connection to the culture he studied and the people he grew to love.(Kris Holloway, author of Monique and the Mango Rains: Two Years with a Midwife in Mali)A vivid, engaging account of Elliot Fratkin's apprenticeship into the mysteries of divination and healing by a prominent Samburulaibon. This book succeeds on many levels—as an unparalleled exploration of the secret meanings and methods of divination bylaibons; as a window into the experience of extended field research—the insights and challenges, the emotions and relationships; and as a compelling story about our shared humanity, a reminder that people everywhere experience love, loss and life in ways that will seem achingly familiar.(Dorothy L. Hodgson, Rutgers University)Fratkin’s book, a journal of personal as well as ethnographic exploration, is honest, funny, moving, empathetic, and respectful and, as an account of fieldwork, rings absolutely true. It is a superb introduction to Samburu, especially their prophets, and to the experience of field anthropology. It would make an engaging teaching text for engaged undergraduates and graduate preparation(Richard Waller, Bucknell University)Elliot Fratkin has written an insightful, enjoyable, and very readable book about his fieldwork and life-long friendship with a family of diviners (laibon) in northern Kenya. The work is strongly autobiographical, recounting how a young, rebellious American anthropologist in the 1970s found himself conducting dissertation research among Ariaal, a Samburu-related nomadic community of northern Kenya.(African Studies Review)This autoethnography is entertaining, provocative, and full of enduring truths about what fieldwork entails and offers. He sees his work as both an ethnography of thelaibons...and a memoir—a lifelong search for belonging. The book's chapters are divided into revelatory scenes of Fratkin's experiences living among Ariaal.(American Ethnologist)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has a passion for all things supernatural, spiced up with a good dollop of romance - as long as they include strong characters, alpha males and capable females, and worlds which although make-believe are really quite believable in the end. There's nothing better than getting caught up in a compelling, intriguing and romantic book. When she's not writing or reading, she's out on her family boat at Lake Taupo, teaching her young boys to fish, showing them the beauty that surrounds them in nature and catching some delicious trout for dinner. Kindred has been a joy to write, creating a rich world with dynamic characters and paranormal twists that shock and awe has been pure bliss for this author. And just as well, because there's a lot more story yet to tell...", "related": ["B00FJ4TTQI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 44.0}

Speakers Assoc. Auck) Bright Star winner 2012 (Nat. Speakers Assoc. Auck) Ex-international equestrian, Pete Taylor, is no stranger to challenges and crises that have thrust him into the leadership role. For 24 years he travelled the world as an equestrian rider, coach and team manager. Now working as a thought leader, key-note speaker, mentor and author Pete likes to promote his elite winning strategy honed through his years of experience Pete is a living example of his own strategy. Tragically at the Barcelona Olympics, he was infected by a sand fly, transmitted by a parasite after patting a dog and the subsequent infection destroyed his bone marrow and attacked the internal organs.  He has been told he would die four times and needs continual treatments of chemotherapy to manage the chronic illness.  So far he has received 870 doses of chemotherapy over the past fifteen years.  For Pete, managing his health has been his greatest test in life. Seeking a future during times of poor health is a perspective of discipline, understanding mortality and strategic planning to avoid becoming overwhelmed.  My greatest challenge after losing my sight overnight was to manage profound deafness, becoming deaf was the greatest isolation. Pete has subsequently had cochlear implants to restore some hearing but he says adapting to sight and hearing loss requires a multi-layered approach to avoid the emotional devastation of lost communication. He sees communication as the heart of relationships. In reality its pulling out your power of one, your self-belief. Having lived an extraordinary life captured in his book Dont Postpone Joy, Pete has the qualities of someone who has walked the talk, survived unimaginable challenges, and is always hungry for more. I offer authenticity, honesty, and a disciplined work ethic. By living my example of self belief, I inspire others to have confidence to accept what they cant change but to change their attitude and overcome the challenges to reach a victory.  He says if he could change one thing in the world it would be self awareness. My self-awareness is the most powerful tool to change using ones purpose and passion as the driver. I can't change the world, but I can change my world.", "related": ["B00CNJ5DBC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I have lived a life full of adventure and it shows in my work. There have been so many various facets of life inclusive of my encounters with many people from all walks of life but it has been a mutual comprimise of meeting each one that has produced my friendly attitude towards others and instilled the values and other characteristic traits that I have acquired. The only formal education I have to qualify for writing is just a high school diploma. However I have learned how to write well through being a people person and knowing how to speak to others and from my reading in my spare time several hundred books.

Carolyn's passion remains herbs. She is also a Registered Massage Therapist.  Carolyn first married in September 1967.  Her husband Garry was drafted in January 1968, he was sent to Vietnam in July, received injuries in November 1, was then flew to Brooks General Hospital at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio Texas the week of Thanksgiving.  There he spent 17 months in and out of the hospital until he received a medical discharge. Carolyn learned how to love through hard times and depend on  God  at the very beginning of her marriage. She also gave birth to a son in 1969 during this time.  If this  was a Hollywood movie you would think they then lived happily ever after. Not so.  Garry was killed in a construction accident when their son was 7 years old.   The Lord immediately blessed her with a new love in her life, her present husband Gerald.  Husband 1 and 2 were both wonderful men, but as different as night and day. Learning to be a good wife for Garry was entirely different than being a good wife for Gerald.

In the early part of our marriage, my wife Angie and I were in debt, and we found that that debt was a constant drag on our finances, our relationship, and on our happiness in general. When we finally decided to do something about it we took a popular “get out of debt” course where our perspectives about money started to change.  We began to come together as one financially, and to my surprise, in the middle of one session Angie unexpectedly cut up every single credit card we had in front of the entire group!  Our journey to debt freedom had begun. But even though we were starting to think alike financially, we didn’t fully commit to the process and fell back into some old habits that kept us from getting free from our debt and truly succeeding financially. After another year or two of having those nagging debts cause stress in our marriage, we finally decided to fully commit to the process.  We made a written plan to get out of debt and began putting together a written budget every single month, and that made all the difference. We finally began working with a plan instead of flying by the seat of our pants. We finally made a commitment to each other to never finance another car, open another credit card, or use any kind of credit whatsoever, and that is the moment when we began succeeding with money!", "related": ["B0088JAZO6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her auburn hair waved loosely about her bare shoulders, and a negligee of the barest silk and lace hugged her lithe curves, the hem shushing like molten liquid across her restless feet, which tapped a nervous staccato.  She paused before the mirror over the fireplace mantle and nervously smoothed her unbound hair, disengaging a few stray curls from the knots of ribbon on the bodice of her negligee. Her face stared back at her, pale and wide-eyed, and for one moment, Aline contemplated dousing the lights, covering the dinner, and fleeing to her bedroom, where she could pull the blankets tightly over her head.No, she said inwardly, her mirror image squaring her shoulders and lifting her chin--she would not be a coward. It was her thirty-fourth birthday, and after spending two lonely years in mourning, taking a lover of her choice was the best--perhaps the only--decent gift she could present to herself. Her eyes shifted to the ormolu clock ticking merrily on the mantelpiece, noting the late hour.He should have arrived by now. His tardiness increased the prickly quiver of anxiety coursing through her.She moved towards the window overlooking Charles Street and jumped back when she noticed a man pausing on the kerb to stare up at her narrow townhouse. She inched to the window again--the kerb was empty save the soft moonlight bleaching the pavement an opalescent white. She bit her lip as a faint sensation of disappointment washed over her--until she remembered the doorbell went directly to the empty servant's hall in the basement.Aline hurried to the mirror and pinched her cheeks for a bit of color, before rushing out of the sitting room, down the stairs and to the front door. Her heart beat triple time and she stopped herself at the door, running a cursory hand over her hair and negligee one last time. The knob was cold and smooth in her palm as she twisted it and pulled open the door, shivering at the whoosh of cool night air sweeping into the entrance hall. She looked up...and up...eyes widening at his immense height.He must be nearly six and a half feet tall!As she stared at him, her...lover (the word seemed so much more physical now that he had arrived) immediately removed his hat, but with the moonlight streaming behind him, she could see nothing but an outline of wide shoulders and rough-cut gilt-colored hair.However, she could smell him; a warm, pungent bouquet of masculinity and ocean breeze, and she flushed at the reaction the stranger's steady, quiet regard elicited within her.", "related": [], "rank": 1728397, "title": "Lady Myddelton's Lover (An Edwardian Romance Novella)", "author": "Gigi Tallis", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.5, "rating_total": 21.0}

Corral encountered the story of Reyna Angelica Marroquin, the Salvadoran immigrant discovered under a luxury home in Long Island, while he was a reporter for Newsday in New York. This novel was based on that case, which was featured in 48 Hours, Forensic Files, and an episode of Law and Order. After a successful career reporting for newspapers that include the Chicago Tribune, Newsday and The Miami Herald, Corral linked up with iconic American author Tom Wolfe in Miami while the master satirist researched his latest novel, Back to Blood. The result is Corral’s first full-length documentary film, Tom Wolfe Gets Back to Blood. Corral lives in Miami with his wife and fellow journalist Cecile, their two daughters, and their pound mutt Daisy Duke. Look for other books by Corral in the \"Keep Her\" series featuring not-so-smooth but determined journalist Michael Cervantes.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A romantic at heart with an avid interest in history, Doris has always loved a good love story. When intrigue and history combine with well-defined characters and a complex plot, she finds a story irresistible. The introduction of the inspirational genre to the fiction market presented a perfect opportunity to tell the wholesome stories of love, intrigue and adventure bubbling inside her. Convinced that somewhere within the heart of every woman is a deep longing for that special someone in whom she can safely invest her dreams, Doris creates stories incorporating love and romance as God intended it to be.  After forty years of marriage and more in love than ever, Doris recognizes that love is not a goal, but rather a journey with obstacles and temptations all along the way. From her heart she creates characters that live and breathe who face and overcome barriers that would destroy their happiness. Her multi faceted characters experience the joy of achievement, the pain of disappointment and the thrill of connecting against a backdrop of a fast moving tales consisting of intrigue and adventure, many times in historical settings. Her favorite time period is the mid 1800 s set in our great nation.  Realizing that serenity nurtures creativity, Doris and her husband Bob, along with their three daughters moved to a small farm just outside metro Atlanta. In this serene setting her delight is relaxing on the front porch of her modified French country home and watching the deer graze in the pasture in front of her house while visions of heroes and heroines dance through her head. Adding to these moments of inspiration is the extensive travel Doris and Bob have enjoyed where new settings and adventures set her mind ablaze. The have traveled from the Middle East to Europe, the British Isles, Canada, Alaska, Hawaii and visited the Caribbean many times but their favorite place is their own romantic cabin nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains on a bluff overlooking the Toccoa River where Doris spends her most productive hours writing. Although her marriage and the subsequent arrival of three daughters delayed her education, putting her dreams of writing on hold, she continued her education when he children entered school. Committed to the role of wife and mother as her first priority, she arranged her schedule to meet the needs of her family. Finally one year before her youngest daughter graduated from college, Doris graduated from West Georgia University with a 4.0 average and a B.A. in history and a minor in journalism. When she looks at the three mature, productive young women who are her daughters and experiences the encouragement of a loving husband to pursue her dream, she encounters no regrets. As a matter of fact she has learned that a dream delayed and nurtured is all the sweeter when realized.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Soc's answer will help a Japanese conglomerate decide if it wants to buy Oceanus. Intrigued by the question of whether the whale, with its social tendencies, could kill humans, Soc takes the case and immediately runs up against the Sentinels of the Sea, a group picketing Oceanus, which they call a \"whale jail.\" Soc hopes to learn more about Rocky from the mammal's previous trainer and from the former Oceanus public relations director, who was fired for not keeping the lid on Eddy's death. When Soc discovers the PR man has been murdered, Rocky's guilt doesn't seem so likely. Steering a clear course through the murky waters of animal rights and marine parks, Soc lands firmly on the shores of entertainment.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

On this journey, he was introduced to the concept of Oneness while studying books by Buddhist masters and Jon Kabat-Zinn.  Inspired by these works, he wrote the poetic lyrics to 'I Am a Mountain'. In time, Ken felt a desire to share the concept of Oneness with children.  He decided to simplify some parts of his original poem and created imagery to help illustrate this concept in a way that would reach children. Ken hopes that through this book, children will begin to see a reflection of their beautiful qualities in the world around them, enabling them to develop a deeper connection to that beauty and the spirit that unites us all. Ken has a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the University of Utah and a Master of Arts degree from the University of Hawai'i where he was a Fellow of the East West Center.  He was a Peace Corps Volunteer Teacher in Borneo and Samoa, an instructor assisting Betty Edwards in her international 'Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain' seminars, an art teacher in Connecticut public schools, and an architectural designer and concept rendering artist.  He also teaches privately.  Ken has exhibited in galleries internationally.

Phyllida Moon, an accomplished 38-year-old actress, lands the role of a TV detective, and, with time to spare before shooting begins, applies for work at a Seaminster detective agency. Turned down initially, she is hired after she poses convincingly as a potential client. She's assigned to investigate a widower whom a neighboring woman suspects of molesting his teenage daughter. Disguising herself as a parent interested in the daughter's school, Phyllida is at the school when a male student is strangled. In another disguise, she is present at the school when one of the daughter's friends seemingly falls to her death from a high window. Dewhurst skillfully connects these events, but Phyllida's myriad and rapid name and character changes become hard to credit in the end.Copyright 1995 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00BVC1SSE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Helping students acquire new skills. Making the learning process more efficient. That's how most people think about the role of new technologies in education. Marina Bers brings a refreshingly different perspective. Through a well-balanced mixture of insightful theory and compelling examples, Bers describes how new technologies, if appropriately designed, can help young people develop new ways of thinking about themselves, their place in the world, and their relationships with others. A century ago, John Dewey argued that education should help students learn not just how to make a living but how to make a life. Read this book to see how new technologies can help fulfill Dewey's vision.\" -- Mitchel Resnick, Ph.D., LEGO Papert Professor of Learning Research and Academic Head, Program in Media Arts and Sciences, MIT Media Lab\"To this neo-Luddite, Marina Bers' book is an eye-opening introduction to the technological opportunities from which a new generation of children are benefitting. Bers makes a powerful and convincing case that appropriate access to technology not only teaches cognitive and technological skills but can play a central role in promoting positive development, beginning in early childhood. Educators, developmentalists, and parents will be similarly engaged, enthralled, and informed by the evidence that creative exploring using new media plays a central role in psychosocial and intellectual development.\"-- Michael E.

Here is a guy who grew up in the slums of South Side Chicago; a guy who left school at 18 and started work in a steel mill; a guy who excelled in the Army winning huge acclaim for his  achievements. At the age of 32, within nine months of joining the Prudential Insurance Company as a  salesman, he had already passed the Million Dollar Sales mark. And so his story unfolds, as he and  his family enjoy the life of middle class Whites in Black skins. This is a motivational story for  everyone – no matter race, color or creed – full of history and energy, and yes, of racism but told  as fact without bitterness. Yet the story came to be written only because, at 77 years old he succumbed to peripheral artery disease and, as he puts it, “So I had a new status – I became a double amputee.  And what was I supposed to do with my every day if not write my story? Every living human being on  this earth has a story to tell that somebody somewhere might find interesting or even  inspirational. The exposure of your tale could possibly have the impact to positively change  someone’s life. You will never know what effect your life experiences will have on others.

She moved to America in her late teens where she attended college, primarily studying biology and psychology, eventually earning a Masters Degree in the life sciences. She worked in medical research for several years and then entered the business world where she taught programs in self awareness and personal growth and development at several American corporations before following her true calling to be a writer of historical romance novels and, with a keen interest in both the psychological and physiological aspects of submission and dominance, erotica. Ronda's Historical Romance novels are painstakingly researched for historical accuracy and while her characters remain true to their times, they also wrestle with and experience the same desires and frustrations that confound modern people. In spite of progress people's motivations in fulfilling their base wants and needs have remained unchanged over the centuries. These are also very much adult stories. Her Erotic works are either about, or have an underlying theme involving, submission and dominance. Ronda's women are strong and intelligent and few people would ever guess their inner passions and desire to be sexually submissive. These women often have highly skeptical natures which make it difficult for them to develop trust, the absolute prerequisite of true submission. Ronda's dominants are frequently found in positions of authority, highly successful at whatever they do, but frustrated by the conventions of their often too visible lives. They crave the conquest of seducing their intellectual equals into sexual submission.

There are books, TV shows, and movies everywhere featuring the popular antagonists in virtually every scenario possible. One might think the potential for new zombie stories would be exhausted. But that would be incorrect, as Clive Riddle has shown in his very enjoyable novel, The Burning Z. Riddle previously authored Dorris Bridge (2010), a supernatural thriller. For The Burning Z, Riddle strikes upon an ingenious idea an outbreak of zombies at the annual Burning Man music and art festival in the Nevada desert. The main protagonist, Conner, along with his friend Bruce and ladylove, Cassie, are the glue that hold the story together. But Riddle is adept at developing other characters throughout the book, even when they last only a few pages before succumbing to a zombie tide. There s also plenty of backstory provided for Conner and the others. Riddle s heroes are no cardboard cutouts. The isolated setting and anything-is-possible craziness of Burning Man provides a built-in explanation for how an outbreak might go relatively unnoticed, with many people dismissing the attacking zombies as normal, costumed attendees. It also creates a perfect setup for moments of humor, which Riddle uses to keep the book fun: zombies locked in Porta Potties in search of anything of human origin, and many ridiculously garbed zombies and victims. The local color Riddle s detailed descriptions of Burning Man campsites and the terrain provides vivid backdrops for the story s events. The book s pacing is another of its strengths; short sections, each separately titled with plenty of natural cliffhangers, make The Burning Z a compelling read that s tough to put down. There are a few missteps along the way some grammatical errors and an occasional clunky sentence but prove to be only a minor distraction. In an interesting twist, Riddle makes an otherworldy sphere the root cause of the fast-spreading zombie sickness, a form of alien attack whose true purpose is never completely revealed. But The Burning Z offers a satisfying ending, with just the right number of unanswered questions: one character s fate is left in doubt, and as Alan Gorman, an ex-military doctor caught up in the chaos, says, What makes you think they didn't send another somewhere? Or there isn't another one coming? Or a hundred? Readers will be eager to find out what happens next and hopeful that Riddle is already at work on a sequel.

It was there where I was given my own little easel and watercolors and allowed to paint pictures of pine trees, chipmunks, and deer for as long as I wanted in the arts and crafts cabin.  Little did I know that what was nurtured there would, in later years, become my profession.    I now live in Oklahoma where I have taught adult oil painting classes and workshops for over twenty five years.  I make a living selling my work in physical galleries and in my own, online gallery.  I also work with the Arts and Humanities Council as an artist in residence at a local hospital.   I have always had a love of the great outdoors and have been fortunate to be able to spend a great deal of time outside, observing and painting the beauty that I find there.   I confess, I had a little fear of flying and went kicking and screaming to France.  My husband has always wanted to go and lured me there with a promise of undisturbed painting time, and French cooking.  I am so happy to have gone and even happier to share that experience with you in this book.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Back then, there was no such \"Yoga of Jesus\" made manifest worldwide, in the arena of books. However, once the simpler version of the present one landed up at shores beyond my native land, slowly but surely, a plethora of similar sounding writings emerged, out of thin air. Yet are there.In the process of finding a literary agent to represent the previous and the present manuscript of this book, many a hand fondled it; some fondly so, others not so cuddling. A good-intended British agent, forgoing it, felt it was a bit pungent. Another, a major British publisher, got worked up (I presume) by a little humorous word in my subsequent communication with him. An odd publisher or two also whetted the work in U.S. In fact, two American heavyweight literary agents asked for a prompt 'exclusive' for it, but simultaneously. Being new to the game, I naively told each of the other. One slithered away, without so much as a wipe of the nose. The other read it, but let it go. Within a month or two of this, a book on Jesus, written in an identical vein, appeared under the name of a rather well-known Indo-American author. Turns out, this good fellow, the latter agent, was also the literary representative of this tele-spiritualist-cum-writer-guru. Coincidence? Well, your guess is as good as mine.Anyway, to cut matters short, it's deeply satisfying to know that now this book is finally available worldwide via Kindle. Hopefully, this demystification of the teachings of The Master shall find favour with open-minded readers, Christians and others alike.If it benefits a soul here or there, I will consider it a service well done.", "related": [], "rank": 1334479, "title": "Yoga of Jesus: Cracking The Code of the Mystic Teachings of Christ", "author": "Fakeer Ishavardas", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rose Bridger has produced such a book. -- John Stewart, Chair of Airport Watch Plane Truth is an essential read for all of us who care about the environment and future generations. Flying has become as natural to most people in countries like the UK and USA as having breakfast or listening to music. It is easy to forget that flying is helping through climate change emissions and other forms of pollution to destroy our world. The air industry is a huge lobby but Rose Bridger has produced a book that punctures their dangerous lies. -- Derek Wall, International coordinator of the Green Party of England and Wales Plane Truth is truly comprehensive in its global perspective and illustrates the stark reality of the impact of the rapid growth in aviation. It highlights the sustained and damaging effect that aviation has on our environment, the lives of individuals and whole communities. It is a fascinating and extremely insightful narrative. Rose Bridger's research is at the cutting edge of understanding new perspectives on Green economics. Plane Truth provides a valuable analysis of the role of the industry in the world economy that is second to none. This is a massively helpful contribution to the literature on aviation, and industry in general, giving valuable insight into how we all end up paying for the follies of large industrial concerns and networks. The cost of this industry to all of us is substantial and hitherto little understood. This ground breaking book shows how it really works, how we are all paying the cost, and a small minority are reaping the benefit. Bridger exposes the narratives used to justify airport expansion, which include \"greenwash\" and technological innovation which fails to address the real impacts. Don't miss this timely and vital book as climate extremes and instability start to impact all of us. Bridger exposes the truth - make sure you read it in this vital book! -- Miriam Kennet, Director of the Green Economics Institute", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

First, you are there with him tumbling from a mid-air collision, not knowing really what happened, experiencing time dilation, heightened awareness, and imminent mortality, followed immediately by the shock of transitioning from flying to painful, miserable, dirty escape and evasion conditions with injuries. Second, you get a firsthand account of the suffering of the Greeks in their land occupied by the Wehrmacht. Third, you get a real sense of the danger, intrigue, and long odds on escape aided by British Intelligence agents and the Greek underground. This is a first rate, true life war story, well worth any reader's time--and this is the unabridged version. I salute Jim Raley and all the bomber crews of World War II.

Negotiating contracts was part of the job, and he enjoyed the process.Phil found new-car buying to be quite a different endeavor. The necessary information that would make a fair playing field was just not available. So when he bought a new car in 2010, he developed a no-negotiation method based on the sealed bid process used by governments and major corporations, and used it successfully to buy his new car. He got a great deal, and a much improved dealership experience.Amazed at how a small chunk of information (the sealed bid), had transformed a usually distasteful experience, he made a decision to leave the corporate world in 2011, seek out such useful expert information, and bring it to the general public. Phil founded Requisite Press in 2012 to carry out this mission.Of course, there would be no question about the subject of his first project!

Heaven & Hell... they both come to realize that they can help save each other.  Through her sweetness and goodness, he can find a way out of the evil he's been living in; and through his power and physical strength, she can overcome all of the dangers and survive. As an author, when I write, I always put a lot of layers into my stories and if you look just beneath the surface, you'll see them.  There are themes and premises and things I want to say about life.  I firmly believe that fiction is a way to tell the truth, and in my own way, I will always try to tell the truth.  So if you do decide to read SIN & SAVAGE, I hope you have tons of fun with Tori & Savage's wild adventure through the dark streets of Las Vegas... but always remember to look for the hidden messages in my words.Anna Mara", "related": ["B00GU460T0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 44, "rating_average": 3.9545, "rating_total": 174.0}

Aus Praxiserfahrung und Recherche, aber vor allem aus Selbstversuchen resultieren die verfassten Erkenntnisse und Fakten. Als Mitbegründerin der Abnehmwerkstatt.de und von Neureuter-Training.de entwickelt sie aktuell praktische Coaching-Konzepte für den Alltag zum Thema Abnehmen, Fitness und Mentaltraining. Ralf Neureuter beendete seine wissenschaftliche Karriere in Geoökologie, Botanik, Urgeschichte und Geologie mit dem Diplom als Landschaftsökologe, als er selbst erleben musste wie käuflich die Forschung sein kann. Er wurde persönlich Spielball korrupter Strukturen in der Wissenschaft. Was er mitnahm, war eine tiefe Erfahrung in die Wirklichkeit der Einflussnahme durch die Ökonomie in die Wissenschaft. Zeitgleich setzte er seine 1994 begonnenen intensiven Studien bei großen Lehrern des tibetischen Buddhismus 2 Jahre in Zurückgezogenheit fort. Derzeit engagiert sich Ralf Neureuter leidenschaftlich als Mitbegründer von Neureuter-Training.de und der Abnehmwerkstatt.de für das Thema Abnehmen und Mentaltraining.

Mr. Christodoulou adeptly weaves anecdotal\nhumor into the novel, along with Greek mythology, history, rich and\nflavorful Greek culture and food--all without detracting from the\nseriousness of the events--while bringing the story to brilliant life.\nFor life is what continues to happen despite tragedy striking and\nheinous crimes ripping people's worlds apart.\" Author M.J.\"A journey of fast paced kills and sharp turns through the exotic Greek\nislands. The location descriptions were wonderful, descriptive and\naccurate. It is well written with intense action and superb\ncharacterization (foul mouth Ioli Cara and a couple of very Greek\ngrandmothers were highly enjoyable). As seductive as a Sudoku puzzle,\nthe writer has crafted an ingenious plot with nothing less than stunning\n revelations at the conclusion.

Marta is a certified Massage Therapist and a Wellness Coach. Her passion for wellness also led her to study Holistic Nutrition, Aroma Therapy, Herbal Remedies and Homeopathy. She believes that Natural Therapies are a life-long study and she never stops investigating. ''GLOBAL HOLISTIC WELLNESS COACHING FOR MODERN PEOPLE...'' After getting started on massage, she realized that it's not only about manual therapy. She wanted to expand her services and make them more holistic. She became fascinated with the power of the mind after following coaches like Tony Robbins. Even though she loves being a massage therapist she decided to combine it with coaching and as a result, her very own Holistic Wellness coaching for modern people was born. ''NATURAL THERAPY COACHING FOR BODY AND MIND BALANCE...'' Another ambition that Marta had was to create a global holistic health project- this is why she got involved in writing. She knew that her books could be the best tool to set up her global holistic wellness project so she could spread wellness all over the globe, not only in Barcelona area where she currently lives. Marta is now a full-time author dedicated to wellness, health, motivation and holistic therapy and healing. CREATE YOUR HOLISTIC WELLNESS SPA AT HOME...WELLNESS FOR EVERYONE! Marta is the author of the series: Create Your Holistic Wellness Spa At Home and other books dedicated to Wellness, Nutrition and Relaxation. She is also an avid blogger and is addicted to social media. HOLISTIC TRANSFORMATION... Now aged 31, Marta feels focused, happy and fulfilled. Of course she had her ups and downs on her way to discovering what she really wanted to do in this world but she also feels grateful for bad times. She recognizes the fact that it is thanks to obstacles that we grow and push ourselves to think outside of the box (yes, the famous BOX!). Even though Marta struggled with the lack of purpose and no zest for life for some time, those negative experiences finally led her to discover the world of Natural Therapies and WELLNESS. She was looking for the answers for herself and she found WELLNESS- The love of her life, haha! Wellness is her passion and she's always looking for more wellness for herself and others.
