She does that over and again in this collection of soul musings focused on healing. Whether she is reflecting on the surroundings of her backyard screen house or pondering a bad day with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms, Wolf is a master at converting the ordinary into the extraordinary. Drawing from a rich vocabulary to express herself, she explores each subject like a miner panning for gold, extracting the essence of a lesson or truth, then presenting it almost matter-of-factly. Whether she is writing about a personal betrayal, the aftermath of her abusive marriage or how a friend's life was shattered by the Oklahoma City bombing, Wolf invites self-reflection. Although she gazes inwardly, she does not stay there, always moving on to some new place in her spiritual journey. For example, in \"Scene from a Mall,\" Wolf gets lost in comparing her own interior muddle with the slick facades of the shoppers below as she ascends an escalator. By the time she reaches the top, she realizes envy has bitten her and she emerges from her reverie with a new esteem for those she is watching. Wolf's background is Christian, but readers of all faiths, especially those in tune with the spiritual path, will find her writings insightful.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Virgil's long-renowned narrative follows the Trojan warrior Aeneas as he carries his family from his besieged, fallen home, stops in Carthage for a doomed love affair, visits the underworld and founds in Italy, through difficult combat, the settlements that will become, first the Roman republic, and then the empire Virgil knew. Recent translators (such as Allen Mandelbaum) put Virgil's meters into English blank verse. Fagles chooses to forgo meter entirely, which lets him stay literal when he wishes, and grow eloquent when he wants: \"Aeneas flies ahead, spurring his dark ranks on and storming/ over the open fields like a cloudburst wiping out the sun.\" A substantial preface from the eminent classicist Bernard Knox discusses Virgil's place in history, while Fagles himself appends a postscript and notes. Scholars still debate whether Virgil supported or critiqued the empire's expansion; Aeneas' story might prompt new reflection now, when Americans are already thinking about international conflict and the unexpected costs of war.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

McCullough traces the evolution of the labyrinth form from its obvious starting place—the Cretan myth of the Minotaur—to its Christianized appearance in European cathedrals such as Chartres. Citing various interpreters of the Minotaur myth, from Homer to Robert Graves, McCullough suggests the original Cretan labyrinth may have owed its design to a whirling erotic dance performed on a specially marked floor. He races on to describe the crude outdoor labyrinths made of earth and stone that appear across northern Europe, outlining some of their folkloric associations. Turning his attention to the origins of the maze, McCullough evokes the 16th-century fashion for landscape gardening, with its craze for so-called \"knot gardens\" and hedged mazes. He ends with a rambling series of glimpses into the contemporary \"maze craze,\" profiling New Age enthusiasts who use labyrinths in prayer and some of the foremost commercial maze designers. Although he packs his story full of information, McCullough's historical and anthropological accounts can feel slight and simplistic.

Just tobein Paris was a heady invitation to recklessness.And Paris on Bastille Day was even more of an enticement to shed the shackles of convention and be bold, free-thinking and daring. Celebrating the spirit of rebellion, the entire city had been in a euphoric mood, the sweltering summer heatwave adding a sultry edge to the holiday atmosphere, tourists and residents alike thronging the streets and partying far into the steamy night. Behaving with reckless abandon and getting swept away in the passion of the moment had seemed to be an essential part of the whole experience.Oh, yes, Paris was definitely to blame. After all, what defence did a lone, inexperienced Kiwi traveller have against the sophisticated wiles of the most seductive city in the world?Veronica Bell slowly eased open the French doors that screened off the bedroom from the rest of the small apartment and tiptoed across the polished oak floorboards, clutching her strappy sandals and gossamer-fine crocheted wrap against her chest. At a shade under six foot, and of queenly proportions, she was acutely aware that she wasn't built for stealth. She could feel her heart skittering nervously beneath the thin silk of her camisole top as she paused to orientate herself and received her second major shock of the morning: her purse was no longer where she had left it.Or, rather, where shethoughtshe had put it down.Veronica had to admit that her exact recollection of events was somewhat scrambled by the mind-blowing climax to her last night in the French capital. She raked sleep-tangled mahogany locks away from her damp forehead, forcing down a fresh surge of panic at the thought of the outrageous risks she had taken.Right now she needed to focus on the most urgent problem— which was getting out of here with her dignity intact.It was barely dawn, faint streaks of pale light only just beginning to creep in around the edges of the heavy, cream-coloured drapes drawn across the row of double-glazed windows facing out over the street. She was starting to think that she might have to risk turning on a light when she suddenly caught a sight of a tell-tale glint in the thick pile of the shaggy floor rug. She crouched and fished out the slender, black-sequinned shoulder bag, which had fallen from the side arm of the low-slung couch and was half hidden behind the chunky square leg.Her anxious fingertips traced the reassuring shape of her passport and folded money-belt through the pliant exoskele-ton of overlapping sequins.Thank God! She banished the mortifying vision of trying to explain how she had come to lose all her travel documents and money to a cynicalgendarme,or some smirking official at the New Zealand Embassy.Rising to her feet, she added the bag to the top of the bundle in her arms and began tiptoeing the last few metres to the apartment door.A whispery rustle behind her, accompanied by a low, throaty sound, like the warning purr of a dangerous predator, made her freeze to the spot.She looked back with a thrill of apprehension.A gap in the curtains had thrown a long, pale yellow finger of light across the floor, pointing to the source of the sound. Through the square glass panes of the French doors she had left slightly ajar, Veronica had a slanting view of the king-sized bed and the big, rangy, suntanned male body sprawled face-up in a tangle of white cotton sheets.The throaty rumble sounded again and she watched with guilty fascination as lean, muscled limbs thrashed free of the entwining sheets, flashing rippling shoulders, bulging biceps and hard flanks, glistening with perspiration. No wonder he was hot—with no air-conditioning the apartment was sti-flingly warm—but temperature wasn't the only reason the word came to mind.Stripped, he really was incredibly gorgeous, she marvelled with a renewed sense of awe. Even more attractive than he had been in his stylishly scruffy jeans and white designer tee shirt.It was hard to believe that she had succeeded in snaring such a prime specimen for a starring role in her rosy, romantic fantasy of a love affair in Paris. Only it had been lust rather than love, she reminded herself sternly, which had directed the script. Her frothy romantic comedy had unexpectedly turned into an adrenalin-spiked action-adventure…and the hero had more than lived up to his billing!His dark head jerked on the pillow, and Veronica's pulse kicked into overdrive. Heat pumped through her veins, her body tightening with defensive tension, her mouth going dry as she tried to think of something to say that was in character with the woman she had pretended to be, something witty and insouciant, and appropriate to the occasion…But what?Unfortunately, all her former boldness had deserted her the moment she opened her eyes and reality sank in. She hadn't intended to fall asleep. Her private fantasising had always stopped short of the uncomfortable practicalities of the morning after.Her brief flare of panic faded as she realised his restless movements were only a prelude to him turning over in a long, shuddering, stretch and roll of the impressive body, which left her staring at his naked back, his sleepy grumble muffled into silence as he laced his arm under the empty pillow beside him—still bearing the blurred imprint of her head—and drew it to his chest, burying his face in its billowing softness. His thick mane of silky-straight jet-black hair fanned out across the top of his hunched shoulders, his powerful musculature rippling under tawny skin as he melted back into stillness like a lazy, well-satiated lion, totally secure in his innate supremacy.The animal comparison brought a flush of memory to Veronica's cheeks, an invisible souvenir to sigh over when she was old and grey, or even a month hence, when she was back in wintry-wet Auckland, struggling to make a success of her ideas, and in need of proof that she had the courage and audacity to make her dreams come true.She scurried to the deadlocked door, grimacing at the metallic clunk made by the weighty bolt as she finally wrenched it open.She couldn't resist a final, fleeting peek over her shoulder, however, and carried off a vivid image of bare, male buttocks erotically framed in a twisted skein of sheet, the superbly toned muscles pulled taut by his drawn-up knees, revealing a sexy hint of dark fluff on the underside of the smoothly sculpted globes where they curved into the tops of his strong, hair-roughened thighs.Distracted, she let the heavy door go too soon, and it shut with a bang that reverberated up and down the empty stairwell.The sound was magnified by her twanging nerves into a sonic boom and she plunged down the stairs, her bare feet slapping against the wooden treads. Reaching the second-floor landing, she dug blindly into her bundled-up purse and, miraculously, the small metal key with its numbered tag fell straight into her hand, but her fingers were shaking so much that she had difficulty trying to slot it into the door of her rented apartment. She cursed under her breath, her ears alert for prowling footsteps from above.She didn't want to risk him finding out where she was staying. He had no idea that the holiday rental she had referred to with deliberate vagueness at the start of the evening as being 'in the Marais' was literally right under his very nose.She had bubbled with secret amusement when he had swept her back to his lair in the early hours of the morning, but thankfully a tiny, remaining spark of common sense had kept her from blurting out her startled recognition as he had paused to punch in the keycode at the entrance to a graceful old building in the historic rue de Birague.Still on a champagne-fuelled high, and abuzz with excitement after their thrilling escape from the near-riot a few blocks away in the Place de la Bastille, she had embraced the fantastic coincidence as kismet…a serendipitous sign that they were fated to fulfil a passionate destiny.Of course, in the sober light of day, the coincidence seemed a great deal less karmic given the fact that they had first encountered each other in the tiny Latin American bar just across the street from the apartments—the kind of place that was more of a hang-out for local residents and workers than a magnet for the passing tourist trade.Once inside the apartment, her knees turned to water, and she slumped limply back against the door, biting back a giggle of semi-hysterical relief, her hand instinctively going to the small pendant of New Zealand jade, carved in the shape of a stylised Maori fishhook, that she always wore around her neck. To her dismay the reassuring touch of home was no longer there. Her fingers spread over her bare breastbone as she realised with a sharp pang that it must still be somewhere in Luc's apartment, lost to her for ever, for there was no way she was going back for it.She was certainly racking up a lot of memorable firsts in the first week of her trip: first time on a plane, first visit to London, first experience of being sick and alone in a country where she didn't speak the language…First time she had woken up with a sexy stranger.She quickly pushed the alarming notion aside. 'No regrets' was what she had decided in the heat of passion, and she intended to stick to her bargain.Besides, he wasn't acompletestranger, she corrected herself, instantly breaching her self-imposed ban. In spite of the language barrier they had worked out a way to communicate.Lucien.Luc.The intimate shortening of his name made her shiver. She remembered laughing it when he had first kissed her in the jam-packed Champs-de-Mars from where they had watched the elaborate fireworks display at the Trocadéro, and sighing it during their scorching embrace behind a pillar in the Place d...", "related": ["B0056HC9SI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He'd meant, with the help of his old friend Mick, to test the Territory's political waters. He needed support in his run for the presidency of the International Thoroughbred Racing Federation.At the moment, though, the political waters were icy cold.\"Listen, Yank,\" the big man, Francis Bleak said. \"Australian leadership should come from Oz. Reforms? We don't need none. We're doing fine as we are. Now I got work to do.\"The Thoroughbred breeder turned his broad back and walked into the stable. The three men who'd stood by him, listening stony-faced, cast cold glances at Andrew and silently followed Bleak inside.Andrew looked at Mick and Mick looked at Andrew.Straight-faced, Andrew said, \"This is starting out really well, eh?\"Mick, a breeder himself, ruddy and red-haired, shrugged.\"You told me to introduce you to some tough ones. I just did. It could have been worse. He could have shot you.\" Mick started toward his Jeep.\"Be quiet,\" Andrew cautioned. \"We're not out of range yet. I take it he'll vote for Bullock.\"\"Righto,\" Mick said with a nod. \"But I warned you about Bleak. Hey, I've known him all my life. He may raise horses, but he's an ass.\"Mick and Andrew, both thirty-five, had once been roommates in grad school in Kentucky. Mick, squarely built and freckled, had returned to Australia, where he now was president of the Northern Territory Thoroughbred Association.In Kentucky, Andrew had served two terms as executive director of the Thoroughbred Association of the Americas, Southern Region. He was a tall, lean and broad-shouldered man. His dark hair was thick and wavy, his features finely carved. For generations, his family had bred and raced Thoroughbreds, and he moved with an expert horseman's physical confidence.He loved the sport, but he had serious concerns about it. Serious enough to make him take action. When he'd been asked to run for the presidency of the International Thoroughbred Racing Federation, ITRF, he'd taken it as a great honor. But an even greater responsibility.When he spoke of reforms, hemeantreforms. Reforms in breeding, equine safety—and the ugly inroads crime had made into the sport. There were people, powerful people, who didn't like his ideas, especially about cleaning out the criminal element.Mick had kept company with him this week to personally introduce Andrew to the racing set in the Northern Territory. He believed passionately in Andrew's cause and wanted it clear that Andrew had solid connections to Australia—both family and friends.Both men knew that Andrew faced a grueling fight against Aussie candidate Jackson Bullock. Australia was the deciding contest. There would be other elections the same day in smaller Pacific countries, but Australia was where the presidency would be won or lost. Bullock was the favorite here, a native son with longtime ties to the racing community.Andrew's dark brows drew together. \"Bullock's going all out to beat me?\"Mick's good-natured face clouded. \"Right. He didn't expect you'd get so much support in Europe. He thought he'd win easy, and now he's pissed off. Here, he means to dominate you. On his airwaves. In his papers. Throughallhis media connections. He'll fight hard. And if he has to, he'll fight dirty.\"A deep voice called from behind them. \"Misters—can I speak with you?\"Andrew glanced over his shoulder and saw a dark-skinned man dressed in jeans, a bush shirt and cowboy hat. He was a burly fellow and carried a blacksmith's anvil as if it weighed but a few pounds. Mick stopped, and so did Andrew.\"Raddy.\" Mick grinned, \"I didn't see you.\"\"I was just inside the stable,\" the man said with a laugh. \"I came to borrow Barney's small anvil.\" He tucked the anvil under one brawny arm.\"Andrew, this is Conrad Nakumurrah, best blacksmith in the shire. Raddy, this is my Yank friend, Andrew Preston. He's running for prez for the ITRF.\"\"Pleased to meet,\" said Raddy. He shook Andrew's hand with a grip appropriately like iron. Andrew feared for his finger bones.\"Same here,\" he managed to say.\"I heard what you said to Bleak,\" Raddy told him. \"I like what I heard. You have sympathy for horses. That's good. You going to my boss's place?\"\"Dead cert,\" Mick answered. He started walking again, and the other two men fell in step on either side of him.\"My pickup's parked by your Jeep,\" Raddy said. He looked up at Andrew shrewdly. \"I heard the way you talk about the animals. Some people—\" he nodded back toward Bleak's stable \"—they don't care for the horses. Only the money. Breed 'em for the long legs until the long legs break. And so forth. You are against such things, right?\"\"Right,\" Andrew replied with a sideways smile.Raddy cocked his head and narrowed his eyes. \"You know about the Song Lines? The Dreaming Tracks?\"\"Only a little,\" said Andrew. \"I read a book about it.\"\"Ha! I hear you talk, I suspect you understand. Australia is part of a song the earth sings. Part of the dream the earth dreams.\"Andrew smiled and nodded. \"Yes. So is Kentucky. Where I come from.\"\"Ha!\" Raddy exclaimed again. He turned to Mick and pointed at Andrew. \"This is a good fellow, yes?\"\"Yes,\" Mick agreed. \"He is. But tell me, Raddy, how's your family.\"\"I have a new child. A beautiful boy child. It is odd you ask about my family.\"\"Why?\" asked Mick.\"Because last night, my wife had a feeling that today something special would happen. She made a charm. ‘Someone will need this,' she said. ‘You'll know him when you see him,' she said. Aha!\" Again he pointed at Andrew.Andrew blinked in surprise. Mick gave Raddy a dubious look. \"I can never tell about you. If you believe this stuff or if you're pulling my leg.\"\"Maybe I'm doing both at once,\" said Raddy, flashing a smile. But he reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a wooden charm. It was a beautifully carved bird with a beak painted yellow, its body black and white and red. It hung on a necklace of red string.\"Here,\" Raddy said, handing Andrew the charm. \"Wear this. It will bring you something important. My wife knows these things.\"\"It's—wonderful,\" murmured Andrew, touched, yet puzzled. \"What is it?\"\"Put it on, put it on. It will bring change to your life. Because you know the earth sings songs, it dreams dreams.\"Andrew put the string with the charm about his neck, feeling odd. Did he have the right to do this? But Raddy only smiled more broadly. He swung the anvil into the back of the truck, opened the door and got in. \"I will see you later?\"Mick nodded. Raddy grinned. \"Catch you then!\" He backed up, changed gears, and drove off.Andrew and Mick got into the Jeep. Andrew looked skeptically at the carved charm hanging from his neck. \"What's it mean?\"\"I don't know.\" He glanced at Andrew. \"Do you believe all that rigmarole? Song lines and charms and stuff?\"Andrew shrugged. \"What do you think of it? You understand it better than I do.\"\"I'm never sure. Sometimes I think the Aborigines see things we don't see. They know things we don't know. I'd treat that charm with respect, if I were you.\"Andrew fingered it uneasily, then dropped it inside his blue shirt. Beneath the painted wood, his heart tingled strangely.At that same moment in the Northern Territory, in the city of Darwin, Marie Lafayette had finished her day's classes at the university and fought the unusually heavy traffic.She weaved and darted on her secondhand bike, moving with surprising speed for one so small. She was barely five foot two, hardly more than a hundred pounds, and although she was petite, her body was toned and muscular.Legs pumping, she headed for the Royal Darwin Hospital where her mother lay in the critical care unit. A heart attack had felled Colette Lafayette, her third—and worst—attack in as many years.Although it was February and still \"the Wet,\" the rainy season, today the sun shone, and the clouds were distant. But Marie knew better than to trust the Northern Territory's fickle weather. She had a secondhand rain poncho in her secondhand backpack.In the hospital parking lot, she chained her bike to a rack, and headed for the main entrance. The building, one of the tallest in Darwin, was a miracle of engineering, designed to withstand the cyclones that were the curse of the city.Marie made her way to the elevator, pulling off her helmet and shaking her head. Her hair was thick and golden, and she trimmed it herself into a short, smooth bob. Her eyes were her most arresting feature; they were long-lashed and a pure crystalline light green, unmarked by even a touch of hazel.Her high cheekbones, straight little nose and full lips gave her a delicate femininity in spite of her boxy unisex clothes. She wore the university uniform for cookery classes, a white shirt and plain black trousers.She got off at the critical care facility. She no longer had to identify herself at the desk. The entire staff recognized her by now. She headed down the hall and quietly opened Colette's door.Colette lay with her eyes closed, and Marie's heart tightened in alarm. Her mother looked even frailer than she had yesterday. But her eyes immediately fluttered open, as if she sensed that Marie was there.\"My good girl,\" she said in a small voice.Marie caught Colette's hand in her own, as if she could pump some of her own strength and energy into her mother. \"Mama,\" she said softly and bent to kiss her.Colette smiled and stared up at her. \"My good girl,\" she repeated. \"This is a school day. Isn't it? How were classes?\"\"Good, Mama. And my job at the Scepter's going well. Last night they told me they wanted to train me for management when I finish this round of certification.\"Marie worked evenings waiting tables at the restaurant in the Scepter Hotel and Resort, one of Darwin's finest. The manager considered himself a perfectionist, but he'd said Marie had exceeded evenhisexpectations.Now the older woman sighed and smiled. \"Ah.

Miller is a life-long storyteller and the gatekeeper for The Mad Man. He is also the coauthor of Bones of the Woods and the Dime Store Novel series.

John is currently studying 3D animation and directing. Rachelle Reese has been making up stories for over 40 years. Her earliest stories were acted out by Barbie, Skipper, and Ken. Now her stories are acted out by the voices in her head. She has an MA in English from San Jose State University, where she wrote poetry and fiction. She ran the Art @ 8 open poetry readings and performed frequently at galleries and other venues. She is a self-taught programmer and was the first student at SJSU to complete her thesis as an interactive work of fiction. After meeting John, she began role-playing. Many of their story ideas and characters emerge during a game of Dungeons and Dragons, Call of Cthulhu, or World of Darkness. However, the mythos of their world is their own. Rachelle writes fantasy, paranormal urban fantasy, and a bit of horror. She and John are the authors of two short story collections: Bones of the Woods and Mind of a Mad Man. They are also the authors of the Dime Store Novel urban fantasy series. Rachelle has published several short stories in anthologies. Her latest was \"The Rescue,\" published in The Bitter End: Tales of Nautical Terror. Rachelle also writes training courses and certification prep materials for programmers, network administrators, and computer support professionals. John and Rachelle live in rural Missouri. They raise cattle and donkeys. They are devoted to their dogs...who pretty much run the household. She enjoys a good dry wine, immersing herself in a book, dancing, and long walks in the woods.

RMH was giving me trouble at the time, so I set it aside to write a novella for the anthology. It seemed logical to set it in the same world as RMH.The problem I'd been having with RMH concerned plotting. Characters and dialog I can do all day, but I always struggle with plots. That's why I was amazed at how easy it was to write Kiss and Kin. Once I had my characters, the story just sort of fell out of my head.So I wrote it and submitted it. Samhain published it, lots of people have bought it, and most reviews have been very positive. I'd love to think every book I write in the future will have such a painless birth and delivery, but I know they won't.As for Rocky Mountain Howl - Samhain bought it, but my editor didn't like the title. (I have more trouble with titles than I do with plots.) Inez Kelley (read her - she's awesome), who'd thought of the title Kiss and Kin, came up with Yours, Mine and Howls. It's the story of Ally, a woman with an alpha wolf foster son and a big secret, and Cade, a Pack Alpha with a horse ranch and a daughter who insists she's a cat. It will be published in February 2011.I'd like to thank everyone who's bought a copy of Kiss and Kin.

The protagonist is 9 when the book opens, but she  narrates the events from her 51st year looking back. Tragedy  strikes orphaned Frances Fogarty when her 10-year-old brother is  struck by a milk-float and dies. Then the boy appears at his own  funeral, and only Frances and her three-year-old brother, Harry,  can see him. Tom does his best to protect and to guide Frances  past her strict, often mean aunts and a bully at school.  However, after being punished for stealing, she runs away with  Harry in tow and ends up sinking in the canal. Tom saves her and  things improve at home. A few years later, Tom's dog dies and  the two of them disappear together. So much happens that it is  hard to cover all the bases. The writing is excellent, and the  characters and time period are nicely constructed and skillfully  evoked. However, the intended audience is difficult to define.  The story is very short, but the vocabulary is intense. It's a  ghost story that isn't scary and an affecting family tale that  centers on the supernatural.

Children are disappearing, taken by the wind, including 14-year-old Hanna's little brother and students from the Meer school where 16-year-old Miles is learning music and magic. At the same time, the waytrees that form the bond between Noor and Oth, the home of the dragons, have been dying. And the dragons, who have been waiting for more than 700 years to return to Oth, are frantic. The world building and tone are just right, and the themes of friendship, loyalty, responsibility, and protection of the planet are never intrusive. Hanna and Miles are realistic teens, affected by magical events in the past, unsure of their own abilities, and capable beyond their wildest imaginings. Most of the secondary characters are equally compelling, though Taunier, a young man who can control fire and the object of Hanna's very innocent interest, is disappointingly flat. The style is pure fairy tale and quite lovely. Only at the very end, when the characters are comparing the taste of a magical fruit to papayas and peaches, are readers jarred away from this magical place. Knowledge of the earlier book isn't required, but readers who missed it will want to catch up on the first adventure.–Mara Alpert, Los Angeles Public Libraryα(c) Copyright 2010.

(Jerald P. Fine, district-wide positive behavior intervention support coach)Providing our students time for mentoring was easy, however, providing our students and teachers with lesson plans was difficult. We have researched mentoring lesson plans to no avail. High school administrators and advisory mentors have been looking for simple, easy-to-implement lessons that provide students with topics of interest. This book will be a valuable tool for all high schools that have mentoring programs. (Donna Adduci Mik, High School Principal)What is remarkable about this handbook is that it is so easy to use in creating an efficacious and meaningful mentoring program. The policy impacts of school-based mentoring are all positive when implementation is facilitated through tools likeMentoring Matters.This handbook will help guarantee eager buy-in from all educators. (Thomas P. Gaffey, Connecticut state senator and senate chairman of the education committee)Mentoring Mattersis an excellent addition to the growing body of hands-on resources for student mentoring and student advisory programs. The ready-to-use lessons will help any school get their advisory program off the ground with meaningful and engaging activities in the first year, providing the school with time to flesh out their programming for ensuing years. The activities and scenarios are easy to execute and spot-on: respect, community-building, leadership skills, communicating, goal-setting, decision-making, adapting to change. Any school that wants to help its students negotiate the garmented and impersonal structure known as high school and help kids make meaning out of their school experience will find this book to be a valuable start-up tool. (Scott Brown, Ph.D, secondary school consultant)As a Board president, I believe thatMentoring Mattersis a must-have resource for any school system committed to providing their students the skills of school-based mentoring. As a high school social worker, I believe that every student needs to establish a strong connection to a positive adult role model. This book provides the actual lessons required to prepare staff to be that mentor while establishing methods that personalize the learning environment to ensure the fostering of positive relationships between students and staff. (Mark A. Hughes, MSW, board of education president and high school social worker)Mentoring Mattersis a practical guide for teachers that I would highly recommend. I have found myself using the easy-to-use lessons to initiate conversationswith students about a variety of topics. By providing students with an opportunity to meet in small mentoring groups they have developed meaningful relationships that are impacting their grades and willingness to seek support when needed. This is a tool that every teacher in every school should be using!

She compiles and collates information from a wide range of sources and encourages us to be creatively divergent in our thinking and approach to playing and teaching the clarinet....Highly recommended.(The Clarinet)More Clarinet Secretsappears, at first glance, to be a straightforward follow-up toClarinet Secrets, but it is more than that: In its emphasis on practical advice for the more prosaic daily challenges that clarinetists face, it is a very different book—and arguably a superior one. ... It is also a denser and more granular work. . . . As clarinetist Howard Klug mentions in his introduction,More Clarinet Secretscan be opened at random for 'instant gratification and motivation' (p. ix). There is not a single wasted word or self-indulgent digression to be found here. The sheer quantity of information in this slender volume is astounding. . . . Gingras’s advice is often simple yet strikingly original. ... Although there are countless pedagogical works on the clarinet, many written by acknowledged masters of the instrument, there is nothing that matches the sheer scope and utility ofMore Clarinet Secrets.Every music librarian would be well-advised to acquire a copy—perhaps even two or three.(Music Reference Services Quarterly)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He later went on to become a Seventh-day Adventist after accepting the Sabbath truth and studying about Biblical prophecy. He studied at Newbold College, Bracknell and received a BA in Theology and then an MA in Religion, accredited by Andrews University. Following that, he spent a year in South Korea teaching English as a foreign language and taught some Bible lessons. While he was in South Korea he got married and returned to England. He eventually found employment with the church and worked for a couple of years at the Adventist Discovery Centre office in the British Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists in Watford. He was then called by the church to work as a ministerial intern and then as a licensed minister for the South England Conference of Seventh-day Adventists in East Anglia and then Cornwall. He is currently serving as an elder of the Bodmin Seventh-day Adventist Church and as a full time self-employed colporteur (literature evangelist) selling church books on health, the Bible, and children's stories as well as writing church books.

partly because,\nin the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because\nif I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately\nwithCaptain Vorpatril's Alliance) it would upwhack the numbering\nsystem. Nevertheless, the books and\nstories do have a chronological order, if not a strict one. It was always my intention to write each book as a\nstand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with\nthat book that's in your handright now, don't put it back on the\nshelf! While still somewhat true, as the\nseries developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that\nwere richer for each other. I will list the\nsub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats. Shards of HonorandBarrayar. The first two books in the series proper,\nthey detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral\nVorkosigan of Barrayar. Shardswas my very first novel ever;Barrayarwas actually my eighth, but\ncontinues the tale the next day after the end ofShards. For readers who want to be sure of beginning\nat the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two. The Warrior's ApprenticeandThe Vor Game(with, perhaps, the novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" tucked in\nbetween.) The Warrior's Apprenticeintroduces the character who became the series' linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the\nfirst book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by accident; the second\nhow he fixed his mistakes from the first round.Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things\none can best discover for oneself),The Warrior's Apprenticemakes\nanother good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male\nprotagonist. After that:Brothers in Armsshould be read beforeMirror\nDance, and both, ideally, beforeMemory. Komarrmakes another good alternate entry point for\nthe series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read beforeA Civil Campaign. Borders of Infinity, a collection of three of the\nfive currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure\nsampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit\nthemselves to length. (But it may make\nmore sense if read afterThe Warrior's Apprentice.) Take care not to confuse the\ncollection-as-a-whole with its title story, \"The Borders of Infinity\". Falling Freetakes place 200\nyears earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with\nthe main body of the series. Most\nreaders recommend picking up this story later.It should likely be read beforeDiplomatic Immunity, however,\nwhich revisits the \"quaddies\", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in\nMiles's time. The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear\nin italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words\nand 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.  Falling FreeShards of HonorBarrayarThe Warrior's Apprentice\"The Mountains of Mourning\"\"Weatherman\"The Vor GameCetagandaEthan of AthosBorders of Infinity\"Labyrinth\"\"The Borders of Infinity\"Brothers in ArmsMirror DanceMemoryKomarrA Civil Campaign\"Winterfair Gifts\"Diplomatic ImmunityCaptain Vorpatril'sAlliance (upcoming in late 2012)CryoBurn                   Caveats: The novella \"Weatherman\" is an\nout-take from the beginning of the novelThe Vor Game. If you already haveThe Vor Game, you\nlikely don't need this. The original 'novel'Borders of\nInfinitywas a fix-up collection containing the three novellas \"The\nMountains of Mourning\", \"Labyrinth\", and \"The Borders of Infinity\", together\nwith a frame story to tie the pieces together.Again, beware duplication. The\nframe story does not stand alone, and generally is of interest only to\ncompletists.  The Fantasy Novels My fantasy novels are a bit easier\nto order. Easiest of all isThe\nSpirit Ring, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed\nbooks that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are the four volumes ofThe\nSharing Knife--in order,Beguilement,Legacy,Passage,\nandHorizon--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one\ncontinuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks. What have come to be called the\nChalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written,\nlike the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and\ncan in theory be read in any order. (The\nthird book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely\nconnected first two.) Some readers think\nthe world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in\npublication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the\nfirst (but not the third.) In any case,\nthe publication order is: The Curse of ChalionPaladin of SoulsThe Hallowed HuntThe short story collectionProto\nZoawas an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three\n(1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but\nnot in this handy format. The novelette \"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" may be of\ninterest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is the first story in which that proto-universe\nbegan, mentioning Beta Colony but before Barrayar was even thought of. My latest original e-edition isSidelines: Talks and Essays, which is\njust what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of my nonfiction\nwritings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions,\nand some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove an interesting companion\npiece to my fiction. Happy reading! -- Lois McMaster Bujold.", "related": [], "rank": 438985, "title": "Weatherman (Vorkosigan Saga)", "author": "Lois McMaster Bujold", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There's also a stack of signed first editions, and a motley assortment of tattered, dog-eared tomes that I consider to be some of my most prized possessions. Saskia de Rothschild'sThe Book Bindtells of a collective of dedicated poets, publishers, and laborers who see books as cultural artifacts and, as such, demonstrate what Saskia thinks is the ultimate passion for \"real words\" by continuing to print books by hand. Members \"share the subversive wish to create permanence in a world overrun by impermanence.\" They also share a general distaste for the e-reader--a device, they believe, that is only valuable in so much as it provides easy access to \"disposable texts\" penned by [insertNew York Timesbestselling author here]. De Rothschild kindles (ahem) the e-reader debate. \"When you read on a computer or so-called 'tablet,' you can't touch the words. I used to think that meant the words couldn't touch you.\" But what if they still can? Are words any less real or worthy whether they're on the printed page, a stone tablet, in e-ink, or on a napkin?

These essays circle around a common question: what other, invisible contests unfold as we regard a sporting event? And what desires, dreams, anxieties, and insecurities are encoded in our worship of (or disdain for) the high-performance athlete? (Hua Hsu, Vassar College)When are sports not \"just sports\"?  Always, argues Gerald Early, and this fine collection of essays demonstrates why he, perhaps more than anyone else, can make this point most persuasively and most elegantly.  Here, with pieces that range in topic from path breakers such as Jackie Robinson and Curt Flood to modern battles between figures such as Donovan McNabb and Rush Limbaugh, Early further solidifies his place as a founding voice in the cultural analysis of American sports. (Amy Bass, The College of New Rochelle)Gerald Early is not only the smartest person I know, he is also a constantly surprising thinker. This wonderful series of lectures and essays about the African American experience in sports teaches, challenges, and entertains--with Gerald, that's a given--but most of all, takes us places we never expected to go. There was a moment on every page when I found myself thinking: \"Wow, I never thought about it like that before.\" (Joe Posnanski, Sports Illustrated)The intersection of race and sports is one of the most dangerous in American culture...Perhaps only a steady, steely academic like Gerald L. Early can take the turn wide open, pencil to the metal, without spinning out. Early has tricky moves and a way of bouncing off the wall of other writers' theses. As a boxer, he'd be a counter­puncher. As a hockey player, he'd be a blind-side hip checker...A Level Playing Field: African American Athletes and the Republic of Sports[is] a provocative and lively collection of lectures and essays. It's a welcome addition to the elite sports shelf...[Early] displays the grandiosity of the critic and the passion of the fan. (Robert LipsyteNew York Times Book Review2011-07-10)[A] powerful book...Early illuminates in great detail the inner collisions of African-American athletes as they find their way in the (mostly white) public sphere. His is a valiant--and largely successful--attempt to explain what it's like to be an African-American athlete today...A Level Playing Fieldmakes an excellent template from which to work when we want to look beyond the platitudes that mark the dialogue about race and sport. But it also reminds us how far we've come. (Doug GlanvilleWall Street Journal2011-08-06)Early is still opening eyes with unexpected, edgy insights about race and sports. This happens on every page of his new collection of essays,A Level Playing Field: African-American Athletes and the Republic of Sports...What really unifies [these essays] is Early's piercing, unpredictable intelligence...Whether Early is writing about a recent racial flap, Jackie Robinson's testimony about Communism before Congress or the myths of the black quarterback, he offers up a neglected or forgotten fact--and an insightful way of conceptualizing race, sports and how they intersect that will leave you rethinking things. This book stretches the mind of a sports fan the way a brilliant coach expands the game of an athlete. (Chris KingSt. Louis American2011-08-01)Early examines the contradictions of the sporting world for African Americans: they are lauded for their athletic prowess but denied social honor for their accomplishments. He is especially concerned with understanding the invisible contests that unfold when people watch sports and how the public's fascination with sports heroes reflects desires and anxieties. The topics covered include integration, focusing on Jackie Robinson; the use of performance-enhancing drugs; the struggles of Curt Flood, whose lawsuit against the reserve clause ended up in the Supreme Court; and Rush Limbaugh's bashing of Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb...Early gives each topic his own unique twist.

Each of the brief chapters is like a Dolls' song in and of itself; discrete New York stories, which, taken together, flesh out with great energy what it meant to be a young and daring artist in the gritty Warhol-driven art scene of 1970s New York. As a former design student, Kane spills his passion for the band's unique and influential DIY fashion across nearly every chapter, unfortunately at the expense of any significant discussion of the Dolls' equally influential music. Kane's sense of humor is the book's greatest strength (he describes the experience of his pants splitting open during the Dolls' first concert as the dreaded banana-peeling feeling), expanding colloquial vocabulary with a Mel Brooks-on-LSD kind of timing suggesting the very spirit that infused the Dolls' New York milieu. At times, however, Kane's over-the-top prose renders his musings and recollections inchoate, particularly when his animosity toward the Dolls' early management degrades into near-incomprehensible rants. The foreword and epilogue, carefully and lovingly written by his widow, Barbara, fill in the space created by Kane's bombast.(Aug.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In doing that, the series carries out CCL's mission to advance the understanding, practice, and development of leadership for the benefit of society worldwide.David Baldwinis a CCL faculty member based at the San Diego campus. Since 1995, he has managed and delivered leadership initiatives, including global blended learning programs, for CCL clients.

There is so much history in this region of Spain, and if\nthoughts of sipping Cava don't entice you to leave Barcelona to discover its\nsurroundings, then maybe ancient Roman ruins or sun-drenched beaches will.\nMonserrat is absolutely not to be missed!

Rather like Larry Woiwode, Stark gets by on minimal plotting, instead allowing modulations in mood, and passionate exchanges between characters, to advance his story. The two main characters are a father, Addie, and his ``second'' son, Jack. Addie's suicidal wife and the son he loved best are suddenly, as the novel begins, dead. Though both took more than they gave, Addie is lost without them, as is young Jack. Father and son are propelled--sometimes violently--apart, as they deal with their grief and the fact that they've become strangers to each other. There is delight, and a kind of solace, in how well Stark knows working-class lives, in how his men talk, in how they redo a kitchen or overhaul an engine, in how they love their women. Stark's love scenes are magnificent in their power and subtlety, and particularly in how they lunge out of control. ... Stark is passionate, lyrical, even funny. He should sell a lot of books. -- Copyright ©1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

One can only imagine how she learned to cope and survive through manipulations and tantrums. The family that eventually adopted her must have a heart of gold and the patience of saints.This story is well-written, inspirational, sad, happy, funny, and just a delightful read. I can't imagine all of the other Nutmegs out there who don't get the chance to go to a place like the Children's Garden where they can thrive and learn to trust again.In the Prologue, the author introduces us to the setting and the social worker who was instrumental in creating the Children's Garden. I like how the author wove the stories of several staff members and children into this story. It is admirable that she wrote this book in order to increase awareness of the pain and suffering of many American children. It must be very difficult for the social workers and other healthcare providers to teach a child how to trust again and feel safe.This is a wonderful read for anyone, from the everyday person and the pastor, all the way to the psychologist.

I was born in Ohio, but grew up in Holyoke, MA in the 70's and half of the 80's, when computers were still in their infancy. As such, most my youthful free time was taken up reading, or using my imagination to go exploring. My first exposure to fantasy actually came from my chemistry teacher, who ran the school's \"Dungeon's and Dragons\" club. That exposure unlocked something inside me, creating a deeper passion for the art of writing. I have many passions. I explore game worlds such as those created by Sony Online Entertainment. I enjoy the challenge of board and thinking games like chess or Sudoku. I've own my own LARP, where my friends and I created a whole fantasy universe. The plots we created were complex and diverse enough to fill a bookcase of novels. It was that passion that finally forced me to put my ideas in print. As I go on, trying to get all my work published, I hope you can journey with me as we explore the worlds I intend to create for you.

Just as total academic and social detachment seem inevitable, the yearbook committee at his Vancouver high school offers Mike a job assembling a 50th anniversary feature. He accepts, but only because the assignment will free him from attending the soporific history class taught by the dreaded Mr. Dorfman. The plot takes a supernatural turn when an eighth-grade yearbook assistant, Sarah, turns up. Her persistent peppiness gradually defrosts Mike, and young love seems destined to run its course until he reports to his post one day to find Sarah bloodied and weeping in a corner. When she runs out, Mike notifies school officials who inform him that they have no record of her existence. Eventually, yearbooks reveal that she was a student there, but was slain in an unsolved murder dating back to 1982. In subsequent appearances, Sarah reveals the identity of her killer, and Mike sees that justice is done. Unfortunately, while the plot has some compelling ingredients, the third-person narrative relies so heavily on awkward chunks of bald exposition to prop up the tinny dialogue that any personal and spiritual epiphanies that the story's ambitious conclusion might hold are simply not realized.Jeffrey Hastings, Highlander Way Middle School, Howell, MICopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00HW4602Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hill vividly describes his rural Floridian home, from the caring neighbors and shopkeepers to the flora, fauna, foods, and the heat. The woods are filled with the smoky haze from area forest fires, thwarting plans for Fourth of July fireworks. To impress Elliot, who moved from the city and belittles country life, and others, Ben agrees to light one firecracker, an event that seems out of character for him but may spark discussion about peer pressure. The light and noise drive Elliot's new puppy into the woods, sending the boys on an exciting chase to retrieve him. As night falls they realize they are lost and that there is a fire nearby, likely started by the firecracker. Ben uses common sense in the absence of flashlight, moonlight, or paths, guiding them through three miles of dense woods away from sirens and toward the eventual sound of his neighbors' ringing bells. Experienced hikers may find this episode far-fetched. In a pat ending, Elliot announces that he is not ready for the responsibility of a dog, and Ben is overjoyed when he is allowed to keep it. This short chapter book with a large font and full-page pencil drawings may appeal to readers who crave drama and suspense in a contemporary story, but the beginning is a bit slow.–Laura Scott, Farmington Community Library, MICopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There, while inventorying some books, Marion discovers bound within the covers of Poe's Narrative of A. Gordon Pym the diary of an English detective, Jeremy Matheson, describing his probe into a series of sadistic child murders in 1928 Cairo. Marion becomes obsessed with the diary and in finding the solution to the old case. Strangely, the third-person diary selections include the thoughts of characters who could not have conveyed them to Matheson. This oddity will raise the suspicions of astute readers, who will be less than shocked by the twist ending.

A graduate of the San Francisco Art Institute, Valentine is a member of the Adjunct Faculty at the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology in Palo Alto, CA, where she earned a Masters in Counseling Psychology and a Ph.D. in Transpersonal Psychology. She has just accepted a position as Chair of the Pagan Community Education program at Cherry Hill Seminary, and has a private practice in wellness counseling and shamanic healing in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Descended from Scottish, Irish, French, and Native American ancestors, Valentine developed a combination of shamanism and art making (Healing Art©) to heal herself from cancer, and later founded a nonprofit organization, Orenda Healing International (OHI), devoted to promoting individual and community health and wellbeing. OHI umbrellas many of her research projects, which currently include the presence of the Goddess in Navajo spirituality; filmmaking as a catalyst for intergenerational healing among Native American youth and elders; the possibility of genetic inheritance as the inspiration for shamanic practice; and shamanism as a root philosophy for many of our modern professions, including medicine, religion, and art. She has taught art making to young people and adults and Healing Art© to AIDS and cancer patients; incarcerated, homeless, and challenged youth; developmentally disabled adults; and women in transition for over twenty years. She is a certified Reiki Master in the Usui Lineage. She has lived in Mexico, Washington DC, Pennsylvania, California, Nebraska, Oregon, and New Mexico, and has traveled in England, Ireland, the Virgin Islands, and the British West Indies.  She and her husband, Lewis Riddell, share an interest in nature photography, art, theatre, gourmet cooking, and cats. Valentine has two adult daughters and five grandchildren, and believes that her experiences in raising her own family inspired her interest in working with adolescents and catalyzed the writing of her books for young girls.", "related": ["B00BVJG256"], "rank": 3689847, "title": "Quicklet on Diana Gabaldon, Davina Porter's Voyager eBook", "author": "Valentine McKay-Riddell", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

William Hope reads leisurely  but with feeling, offering listeners the illusion that the  author is speaking directly to them. The abridgements are not  substantive, so listeners will feel that they have become  acquainted with the complexities of a text that is both orderly  and sprinkled with irony and other literary devices. The  chapters are tastefully set off by musical interludes that  complement Thoreau's own rhythms. Not only is this an excellent  alternative for students assigned to read the text that is often  offered in tiny print without benefit of margins, but it is also  possible to suggest this to thoughtful teens who are seeking an  intellectually engaging listening experience for their personal  enjoyment. Hope's pacing invites readers with minimal skills to  accompany their print foray with his narration. The careful  editing here assures that they will not become lost between page  and sound.Francisca Goldsmith, Berkeley Public Library, CACopyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B0084B1X2Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 3.875, "rating_total": 62.0}

In spite of this—or perhaps because of it—her biographers seem to have considerable trouble agreeing on much else about her life.  She was born either April 26 or April 28 and lived in Circleville, Ohio, until she was six [3] or eight, when the family moved to South Bend, Indiana.  Except for a year at school in Philadelphia, she lived in South Bend until 1853, when she was twenty-five, possibly teaching in Indiana schools from 1851-1853. In 1853, her parents or father died, and she moved either to Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, to teach, or to New York for a year.   In 1854, she either moved to an unspecified town in Pennsylvania, to write for the Presbyterian Publishing Board. Martha Finley is best known for her Elsie Dinsmore series, melodramatic and sentimental fiction focusing on Elsie's trials and the solace offered her by her religious beliefs. Originally written under the pseudonym \"Martha Farquharson\" (Gaelic for \"Finley\"), the series lasted for 28 volumes, published over a period of 38 years. Much has been written about the series, discussing everything from its tear-soaked heroine and her relationship with her father to its enduring popularity during the 19th century. Elsie, however, was only a little over a quarter of Ms. Finley's total works. A second series, Mildred Keith, ran for seven volumes and chronicles the life of Mildred Keith and her family as well providing glimpses of Elsie Dinsmore's early years. Mildred is a slightly more realistic character than Elsie, with spunk and independence and without Elsie's perpetual penchant for tears and Biblical quotations.  Martha Finley also wrote more than fifty short books or pamphlets, primarily for children, which were published by the Presbyterian Board of Publication and/or the Presbyterian Publishing Committee. The majority of these appeared between 1856 and 1876 in series or as individual volumes. Their titles and publishers suggest that they, too, were didactic literature, with a strong emphasis on religion.  Much of Martha Finley's writing was quickly forgotten, but Elsie persevered for over seventy-five years. In 1945, the first 12 volumes were still in print in the United States and England and had sold over 5,000,000 million copies.", "related": ["B00GLSFJTW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If we had this type of supernatural crime fighting group in the real world, bullying would be a thing of the past! Can't wait to read more books by Liane!

What inspired you to start writing about natural methods of stress relief?Women everywhere are experiencing severe amounts of stress in all aspects of their lives, on the job and at home. I see it all around me every day, and I know from personal experience that coping with stress is a difficult prospect. Unfortunately many turn to \"solutions\" that often do little to improve things and may even make their situation worse--drinking too much, using narcotics, or giving in to fits of anger; these things only hurt you and those around you and rarely do anything to actually address the situation that is causing stress.I discovered from my own personal experience that there are many positive and beneficial things that can be done to address stressful situations naturally. First of all, facing the situation and doing what you can to change it is vitally important, even if it means making long-term plans, long-term goals, and long-term lifestyle changes. That's why I decided to write about natural methods of stress relief, identify and expose the core causes and detrimental effects of stress for women, and share the high-performance strategies and techniques that women can use immediately to improve their lives. Natural methods work to relieve stress effectively and naturally.2. What are your best sources for coming up with tips to share with your readers (your own experience, research, suggestions from other people...)?My best resource is by far my own personal experience, as well as the experiences of the many women whom I have worked with in my professional life during the last 20 years. Women coping with divorce, family conflict, parenting challenges, financial tragedy, job burn-out and frustration; women who are overwhelmed by the pressures and anxieties of modern-day living. Really, who isn't stressed these days?But in addition to my own experiences, I also do a lot of research and reading on healthy living and wellness, not only focusing on physical wellness, but also on emotional and spiritual wellness. For women, emotional and spiritual wellness is supremely important for inner-peace, joy, and happiness.But more than just reading about healthy living, emotional wellness, and spiritual wellness, I work hard to apply what I learn.I used to be a stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed woman, but I learned how to slow down, re-organize my focus and priorities, and bring balance into my life. I discovered that there is a lot I can do to manage my stress levels and keep them within acceptable standards. When I see how natural stress relief methods work in my life, such as gardening, walking, juicing, proper time management and money management, camping, nutrition, aromatherapy, etc, I write about it so that other women can learn to implement these natural stress relief methods too. They really do work!3. In addition to your books, articles, and stress management for women ezine, what services do you offer in terms of personal support?I offer one-on-one support via email. I always answer emails personally.Most of the time when we are stressed, having someone to talk to goes a long way in helping to soothe frazzled nerves or just to help regain perspective and direction. Some women may not always feel comfortable opening up to family members, and others may live far away and isolated from family and friends, like I was for many years. Yet, via cyberspace, with the click of a button, you can connect with someone in a meaningful way that brings some perspective and peace to your life.Developing a meaningful support network is by far the single most important natural stress management strategy for women. The support network does not have to be big and extensive. It can be as strong as one person you can confide in, one pair of shoulders to cry on, and one pair of trustworthy listening ears.", "related": [], "rank": 2618391, "title": "Money Management For Stress Relief (Self-Help Stress Solutions Book 4) eBook", "author": "D.C.

She was born with no real difficulties and was a healthy 6lbs 7oz's.Ruth didn't experience many problems throughout her pregnancy other than the expected weight gain.Now Ruth had always been quite slim up to the point of getting pregnant, but through her pregnancy gained a lot of weight and she came to despise the way she looked.Being a personal trainer you would've thought I was the perfect person to help her...but think again.It's a bit like your dad teaching you to drive, it very rarely works out and often leads to arguments, tension and bitterness, so much so that I had to step back and leave Ruth to her own devices.Because of this, the relationship struggled along for a while and Ruth didn't manage to lose the baby weight she'd gained throughout her pregnancy, eventually she stopped trying and accepted that this  would be her new shape and size and we just went along as we had before for a while.  I always knew that Ruth wanted children, but I thought she was happy with just having one, I didn't really want to go through having another baby myself although I did like the idea of Megan having a sister, to play with and grow up together.After a couple of years when Megan became much easier to care for we decided that we would try for another baby, and Ruth got pregnant, we were delighted, or at least I thought we were...But there was something troubling Ruth, something that played on her mind constantly...And that was this...If she had one baby and changed shape so much throughout that pregnancy, how would she look after having to go through another pregnancy again and THIS TIME in her mid thirties?This caused her a great deal of distress and concern, she hated her flabby stomach and didn't really like her figure after having just one baby and she knew that she would definitely gain more weight after having another.She didn't know anybody who'd managed to lose baby weight and look good after having children and it just seemed expected that she would be the same.At the end of the pregnancy she had come to despise the way she looked...she told me that she felt and looked frumpy and that she couldn't stand her new baby belly...this made her bad tempered and put a strain on our relationship.She intentionally covered herself up with clothes that hid her shape, baggy t shirts, the most ridiculous track suit bottoms and huge jumpers.Even though the last time I tried to help it nearly ended in us hating each other, she wanted and needed my help badly this time......our relationship depended on it!I knew what Ruth needed to do to get back in to shape, in fact I could guarantee I could provide her with a solution to lose baby weight in as little as 8 weeks, as I had for hundreds of other women.The only problem was it would never have worked if I had tried to work with her in person again, we would've ended up falling out for good this time.I needed to find a way of helping her to lose baby weight that didn't require me training and motivating her myself...So I created an entire program for her to use, without me being there, that included a unique post pregnancy diet and a specially designed exercise plan that she could use to start getting rid of her baby belly straight away, one she could just follow and that fitted in to her new mom's daily lifestyle of feeding, changing and caring for our new baby.And she did follow it, to the letter...Within days of starting the program she began getting compliments of \"How well she looked\" and comments of \"WHEN did you have your baby\" in disbelief.She went from near depression at being the shape she was before starting the program to brimming with confidence and glowing with pride over losing her baby belly, her new figure and our beautiful new baby.", "related": ["B00534NOSI"], "rank": 1979714, "title": "The Baby Belly Fat Loss Plan - A Busy Moms Guide To Rapid Weight Loss After Pregnancy", "author": "Jago Holmes", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's not about his health problems. The book tells the\nstory of Sonny Jacobs, a songwriter who has his music stolen. Joel Reed, the artist\nwho stole his songs, is now 'off the charts' as a Christian Country singer. Despite\nthe trials of pain management and the loss of his ability to eat or drink,\nSonny and his dazzling wife Jenny still manage toget Sonny's musicback!Jack Teeter lives in Brighton, IL, with his\nwife Karen. \"We're very proud of this work,\" Karen said, \"and we hope it's an\ninspiration to cancer survivors everywhere.\"", "related": ["B00A29R22I"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Part 1 of The Snow Inside Me is about those events and their immediate ramifications. It's got a few main points, but perhaps the most important is to acknowledge that pain happens, and it's okay to feel it and let others know.Subsequent books in the series, however, will go deeper and will investigate through storytelling, not analysis, some of the longer-term effects that Post Traumatic Stress Disorder has had on my life. The stories examine big questions about spirituality, nature, coming of age and the ways in which we mold and shape our lives. With a natural propensity to work on metaphors equating the natural world to the human condition, I hope to use the collection to pique readers' curiosity about the ways we influence the environment around us--and how that environment, in turn, influences us.While the primary thread in the collection is the lasting impact that a traumatic event (or events) can have on a person's life, the story is much bigger: a portrait of the influential people and places I've been lucky enough to know and love: the storybook that is small-town Appalachia; the jagged peaks of Crested Butte, Colorado; the star-studded history of the United States' first destination ski resort in Sun Valley, Idaho; and Boulder, Colorado, to name a few.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her first book Fates, an adult fantasy, was published in 2010.

Currently, Brenda has twelve books published (one of which is free!) She is an Amazon top 50 author for Brothers By Bond and an Amazon top 20 author for Not For Sale. Her newest release, Highest Bidder, is the sequel to Not For Sale and available August 2013. Brenda resides in Tampa, FL when not attending conventions and is the Chapter Coordinator for the Tampa Bay O.G.R.E.s, as well as a volunteer with the Tampa Bay Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. She is also an active member in organizing the Florida Leather Fetish Pride weekend and an associate member of the Tampa Leather Club, as well as their event coordinator for Alt Life Bike Fest.

(David Vogler, Professor of Political Science, Wheaton College)Waldman provides a persuasive critique of American democracy that is refreshingly accessible, yet richly compelling in its implications. The author believes Americans can rise to the occasion, and establish a politics that is worthy of themselves, others, and their Creator. Highly recommended. (CHOICE)...this may be a book for you. (March 2008Friends Journal)An eloquent and persuasive writer, using the language of humanism while citing social science literature, Sidney Waldman demonstrates how morality and compassion have an important role to play in American politics, and that we as citizens are capable of enhancing the moral depth of our political participation. Remarkable for its vitality, this book effectively combats tired cynicism and the weakness of self-interest models of citizenship.

From 1974 to 1981 Jim was a session keyboard player for RCA, Decca, and Capitol Records in Hollywood, CA. He is a member of ASCAP as a composer and songwriter and has been featured in Music & Dance News. His music is aired on many radio stations across the United States, as well as other countries; with several CDs on the market. Jim performs at many fairs, festivals, and other events.In 1991, Jim earned an Associates in Arts Degree from Minneapolis Community College and became a member of Phi Theta Kappa; an international scholastic honor society. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business at Northwestern College in Saint Paul, MN where he graduatedCum Laude. He is married and has seven children.Jim's life hasn't always been rosy. Raised by an abusive mother in the 1950s and early 60s, Jim wanted to believe there was a God. He had to exist; He needed His help. As a little boy, he found God in the sparkles of the sidewalks in Southern California. He thought the sparkles must be God. He talked to God as he walked and asked Him to stop the abuse. He didn't. Jim left home at age fifteen. Because of the torturous mental and physical abuse, he suffered many issues. He couldn't hold down a job, failed in relationships, and was considered dysfunctional according to society. The only thing he could do well was play music.At age sixty-one Jim had a heart attack. On the operating table he went into cardiac arrest. CPR was performed three times before he was put on full life-support. The doctors were unable to stabilize him. What he experienced the next twelve days was more than he could comprehend--a journey to Heaven. During his brief stay in Heaven, he came to understand: who he is, who God is, and what Heaven is about.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Reckless Abandon takes you\n   on an emotional, sexy, action-packed ride that lingers long after the\n   last page!\"Roxanne St. ClaireNew York Times Bestselling Author\"In Reckless Abandon, the third book in the Shadow Soldiers\nseries by Kallie Lane, Billie Bradshaw, a feisty cowgirl, is nearly killed by a mysterious sniper. When her dad hires\nReece 'Rocket' Morgan, a capable military man and old teenage flame, to\nprotect her from the baddies, things are off to a rocky start. Even\nthough Rocket had disappeared suddenly, leaving a young Billie confused\nand heart-broken, she still can't deny the sparks that fly between them\nevery time his gaze catches hers. But there's more than romance building\n as the bad guys become more and more daring with each passing day, and\nRocket comes to the realization that it's not just Billie they are\nafter. A thrilling, fast paced novel swimming in heady doses of romance,\n Reckless Abandon is a perfect addition to the Shadow Soldiers series.Reckless Abandon is a thoroughly enjoyable read, a great blend of\nsuspense, mystery, and romance. It was also filled with lots of\ninformation about horses and ranching that I never knew and was\nfascinated to learn. There was great chemistry between Rocket and Billie\n and readers will be eager for them to have their happily ever after,\nespecially when the tension racks up as the bad guys close in. The\nmystery part was awesome as well. I can honestly say I did not see that\none coming and was just as shocked as the rest of the crew when things\ncame to a head. A thoroughly enjoyable read that I'd recommend to\nromance and horse enthusiasts alike.\"Reviewed by Kayti Nika Raet for Readers' Favorite", "related": [], "rank": 2218660, "title": "Reckless Abandon (The Shadow Soldier Series)", "author": "Kallie Lane", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Alan Villiers in the replica pilgrim bark, Mayflower II, from Plymouth, England to Plymouth, Massachusetts, where Mayflower is now preserved. Working his passage to the south Pacific he sailed among the Solomon Islands before leaving the sea and settling with his wife in Suffolk, England. His first major book, The Titanic and the Californian defended the captain of the Californian from the charge of not going to Titanic’s rescue. He subsequently turned to naval subjects, particularly great gunnery, strategy and tactics. His biography of the U-boat admiral, Karl Dönitz, led him to a portrayal of submarine warfare in War Beneath the Sea, and to biographies of other leading Nazis, Heinrich Himmler and Rudolf Hess, subsequently translated into many European languages. Latterly he has returned to naval history, attempting to bring it out of the specialist closet and present it as a major determinant of the modern world in a trilogy whose second volume, Maritime Power and the Struggle for Freedom, won the Mountbatten Maritime Prize, 2003.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.6667, "rating_total": 28.0}

The novel is also a philosophical meditation probing at the issue of the individual in society, and the problematic nature of fixed personal identity in an ever-changing world constantly redefined, collectively, by all people. That said, I refuse to call Petrichor a novel of ideas (although it has plenty of them), a label generally pointing to dry, dense, erudite tomes, for this is an intelligent and lively and entertaining read.Stevie is drawn by a strange noise one night to a dry lakebed in Cartago, California, a small town previously called Carthage, back when the lake was still there. There he discovers a mummified body.Surrounding the body is a massive narrative written on the ground: the words appear to go on forever, embossed into the earth like an endless, illuminated manuscript. Police Chief Jim Hill employs local eccentrics Guy and Jeanne Valleroy to build a roadside attraction to divert attention from the crime scene, while putting Stevie to work dictating the message into an old reel-to-reel tape recorder.The words, initially supposed by Chief Hill to be an elaborate suicide letter, reveal themselves as a story written by one David Edwards, detailing his bizarre job interview in a futuristic building the enormous structure gave the impression of a fantastical machine-organism the very screening process for which pays a lucrative $1,000 per day. This process, at turns creepy and illuminating, effectively leaves the job applicants in the dark about the details of the job for which they're applying. The interview, conducted by a face on a computer screen and a voice heard from a helmet each applicant is required to wear, turns out to be a curious exploration of societal issues related to identity. The glass shield of each helmet reflects to the others only what the wearer is looking at: I could see my face being reflected from a dozen different angles. I thought of cubism, and kaleidoscopes, and compound eyes. So not only has visual identity been effaced, but at one point their thoughts run into and from each other, allowing identity to become amorphous, each person an agent (theoretically) of pure potentiality; consciousness an ongoing collective effort in which past and present blur, and fiction and nonfiction are replaced with possibility.Stevie recognizes in David's story parallels with his own life: the aimlessness, the tendency to sell himself short, and the pronounced depth of awareness they share, the acute but not always articulable sensitivity to the unseen, the hidden. Which leads Stevie to reflect that there is a greater purpose to discovering this letter, this message, as though perhaps it were written for him, so he can discern (if such a thing were possible) what lies in his future. Petrichor, a word indirectly defined as that sweet, slightly acrid smell of new rain on dry pavement, might be thought of as unexpressed energy struggling to manifest itself. And knowing the future might be but a matter of deeply reading the present, much as Stevie tries to do, reading from his environment (literally) clues as to what that future might hold. Now if only he can finish deciphering all the words before a gathering hailstorm destroys them.Petrichoris the best kind of page-turner, and I feel it deserves a wide readership. It had me hooked from the first chapter, providing enough plot points, character depth, and philosophical food for thought to keep me going until the final page. I recommend it without reservation.--Andrew Powers,Prick of the SpindleHigh school dropout Stevie Ludich discovers a dry lake bed covered in words. Paid by the sheriff to read the words into a tape recorder before they disappear, Stevie uncovers a bizarre story of another young man's search for work and the strange company that considers him for a job. Besides transcribing the story, Stevie also has to deal with the attitudes of his small-town friends, disapproving adults, and the strangeness of life in general. Ewers's black comedy delivers a strong dose of magical realism as the central character becomes caught up in the experiences of the person in the story he is reading, finding it sometimes more real than his own narrow life.VERDICT Readers looking for definitive answers and plot resolutions will not find them in this moody slice of adolescent angst laced with a touch of the weird, but fans of modern fiction and magical realism should appreciate the author's storytelling talent.--Library Journal", "related": [], "rank": 3611759, "title": "Petrichor", "author": "David Scott Ewers", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There isn't a spare word and each word is embracing and engaging. For anyone weighing up the pros and cons of abortion it is essential reading. Abortion is always a woman's right to choose but it really helps when one can make an informed choice. \"Tough Choice\" provides the necessary information or at least enough segments of the pattern to assemble one's racing emotions into some kind of order. There are a number of abortion related stories but thankfully these are not in that ledger of pros and cons type way. There are nine accounts but the approach of each is rabidly different. There is the voice of the sixteen year old with her life before her placed next to the the story of a forty year old who already has a number of children. There is an account of a woman working in the American abortion industry and another voice from the Third World. While the book tackles abortions issues there is also the story of a woman adamant about keeping her baby despite her partner's pressure on her to abort. Of the varied stories, the one that stood out for me was one on taking an abortion pill - the do-it-at-home variety. If anyone is considering this method this story is mandatory reading. As the edtor of this work, Vanessa de Largie, states  \" these choices are being made by women every day everywhere.\" I must say I share with her the awe she expresses for the courage, strength and spirit of these women. These accounts are powerful, empowering and eye-opening for anyone needing insights into one of the most fundamentally challenging decisions a woman will ever have to make.", "related": ["B00C9SUIIK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I love a good romance. As the mother of seven children I also love playing video games with my children.

They are foolish, daring, resourceful and full of passion not only for life but for the friendships they have created in this world and the next. My love for Science Fiction gave birth to the Treborel Series. Paranormal romance adventures featuring a psychotic villain and a multiple layer of hero's fighting to survive the chaos. I write about how friendship and love can carry you through situations that you might not otherwise survive. You will find my stories exciting and steamy but I am not an erotic writer. I want my stories to stand on their own. My stories fade to dark when the steam begins to rise, but take it from me, the steam does rise and emotions do soar.

She graduated from Rutgers University-Newark with a B.A. in Psychology. Her intuition, though, directed her away from bureaucratic social service. Moving to Manhattan, NYC, she began work as a volunteer in the theater and poetry programs at St. Clement’s Church on West 46th Street. For five years, she was the director of the Poetry Festival at St. Clement’s. It was through poet Richard Spiegel, founder of the Poetry Festival, that she met Paul Johnston (PJ), the subject of this book. While at the church, in the West Side area known as Hell’s Kitchen, she intuitively sensed that she belonged in this unique neighborhood. She formed the most important friendships of her life, became an active member of civic groups and worked for several community-based organizations. One of these groups assisted homeless families in Times Square and Hell’s Kitchen. Shortly afterward, she began a monthly community newspaper. This allowed her to continue both her neighborhood involvement and her writing.  After returning to Florida, she completed Children of Light, published online at Scribd.com by Ten Penny Players. Her article, “Living Alive: A New Definition of Intuition,” based on PJ’s concepts, is online at Gatewood Journal, under the pseudonym Erin Yes. Mary’s poetry and prose have appeared in Waterways: Poetry in the Mainstream, Jimson Weed, Lips, The Archer, East River Review, Home Planet News, Clinch Mountain Review, and Freshtones, an anthology of women writers. Her Wikipedia articles include Paul Johnston (fine press printer and book designer), Egmont Arens, and Emmy Lichtwitz Krasso.

Woodworth describes exciting projects from all over the globe, ranging from forest preserve restoration in the Chicago metropolitan area and biodiversity restoration efforts across Western Australia to two separate endeavors in his native Ireland to restore forests and bogs. It is clear that ecological renewal requires locally specific methodologies and that no project is rapidly accomplished or perhaps ever free from the need for continuing human intervention. Woodworth's discussions of the various projects illustrate that ecological restoration is as much sociology as hard science, involving deep questions about humanity's proper role in caring for and participating in local ecologies. Indeed, Woodworth's penultimate chapter addresses these questions by comparing and evaluating the thought of three leading figures in the movement: James Aronson, Richard Hobbs, and Bill Jordan. Woodworth provides delightful descriptive passages about his travels, which balance the theory-heavy sections. An important text for scientists and policy makers as well as laypersons with an interest in supporting biodiversity on our planet.

K. Fralin’s lust for writing rose from a sixth grade poem that gained her notice by her teacher and encouragement from her parents.  She loved growing up under the protection of the Flint Hills in walking distance to the popular fishing sites of the Big Blue River. The scenic majesty of that valley plays heavily into her work.  She’s spent her adult life thirty miles or so north in Southeast Nebraska with her husband, raising three children who are now married with children of their own. Once the children left for their own life pursuits, G. K. found time on her hands to spend on her dream of writing a book.  After working as a licensed practical nurse for nearly twenty-year; G. K. went back to school and earned a Bachelor’s of Applied Science degree in Business Management. While back in college she took as many writing courses as she could before finishing her senior year. G. K. Fralin’s family, country background, conservative Christian values and vivid imagination all play into what she writes. She is a stickler for research. “I wasn’t great at history or geography in school, but now I can stretch my horizons as I choose and the world is amazing outside the small area of the globe where I live. The times of past and possible futures load a curious mind with wonderful knowledge and trivia.” Her first published book, The Search, trapped her main character, Sheridan, into the back country off I-80 in a small town of Hidden. She’s stuck with an increasingly deceptive innkeeper. The only way out is to follow a man called Shepard on a treacherous journey. Six Strange Short Stories shows G. K. Fralin’s bizarre repertoire of short stories she felt worth putting together.  Now with the release of the first book of the Charlie Bueller series, G. K. brings Who Be Charlie B.? out of the shadows of history to help him find why he was born with dark skin to white parents. How will he learn to step out from under his parents protection into a world of hate and prejudice?", "related": [], "rank": 3427461, "title": "Who Be Charlie B.

Larsen answers to the name Dean—mostly because that’s his name, but also because he’s a friendly fellow. He now lives with his wife near Charlottesville, Virginia. But how did he get there? you might ask. Well, he was born into a large family in a small town in Nebraska. And his first job titles were Chicken Catcher and Corn Detasseler. He went on to live a somewhat normal life in the Midwest until he dropped out of dental school and moved to Los Angeles, where he became a stand-up comedian and founding member of The Groundlings improvisational comedy troupe.     As an on-camera and voice actor he’s been seen and/or heard in hundreds of TV commercials. Along the way he wrote some TV shows and earned the dubious claim to fame of setting the record for performing the most winning acts on The Gong Show (three). But then, he also holds the record for the most gonged acts (three). He’s living proof that in life, you win some and you lose some.

I found that there were numerous answers to questions in my life, my career, and my family answered with simple everyday symbols in my dreams.After much prayer, I knew that I wanted to share the information I have researched over the past 17 years with everyone who may be interested in what their dreams mean. And I am sure they will be as thrilled as I am that the Lord would take the time to show us things we need to know in our dreams. In my case it may be the only way.. (laughter) because I am so busy with my hectic everyday life that I just don't always hear that small still voice speaking to me.I believe that the Lord will be sure to get the information we need to us somehow.. either through dreams and visions, or from friends, and those we trust in the Lord. Most of all with the Holy Spirit's guidance we can discover things that can really help us in our walk here on earth. God is Good!I hope these Bless whoever reads them. They are in different volumes because there is so much information, including scripture that trying to put it all in one book would make the book huge.. or we would have to take out stuff to keep the book from being too big.  And I want to do each subject thoroughly..

I am a concert and road trip junkie! I love the thrill of seeing my favorite bands live, and just having fun on the open road. My kindle has become like an extra appendage, as it is never far from my side. I became obsessed with books a little more than a year and a half ago and wished I had gotten into them much sooner!! My love of reading is what sparked my passion for writing, and now it’s one of my favorite things that I do for myself.", "related": ["B00ITTMGZG"], "rank": 825701, "title": "Runaway Love (Brown County Book 2)", "author": "Amber Nation", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 27, "rating_average": 4.8148, "rating_total": 130.0}

The books combine humor and murder in a total package of entertaining and fun southern adventures. At the same time, Jada sketches in addiction/recovery issues and childhood angst with a deft and compassionate touch. Jada spent the first twenty-odd years of her life in rural Kentucky, many of those years without electricity or running water. In her writings, Jada draws upon her early years of deprivation. Now, she lives in central Kentucky with her wonderful husband and their cat, rescued from the animal shelter. In spite of her humble beginnings, the cat rules the household and is also a kleptomaniac. Once, she stole a Bluetooth and hid it under the couch. It took her humans several days to locate her ill-gotten booty. In her day job, Jada works in higher education. She strongly believes adults can earn advanced degrees without taking on staggering student loan debt. While working full-time in a gas station and going to school full-time, Jada earned her bachelors degree in business administration. Using the tuition plan at work, Jada subsequently earned her masters degree in public administration. To help her better understand her childhood as well as to \"give back,\" Jada volunteered in a domestic violence shelter. Understanding the puzzle of abusers and their victims involves such complex factors as religion, culture, self-esteem. In many cases, victims later become abusers, triggering cycles of abuse and victimization spanning generations. In her volunteer role, Jada helped abused women work on their job searching, resume writing, and interview skills. In one exercise, she asked each woman to name just one positive thing about herself. It was heartbreaking to see the struggle to come up with one good trait or strength. Jada's mystery adventures are available on Amazon in electronic and paperback formats.

They met during a 1Night Stand in the bookHer Marineand--I admit it--I fell a little bit in love with Brody.\nHe was a strong guy, determined. While on leave, he stepped in for one of his\nfellow Marines (or so he thought) and met a woman who took his breath away. By\nthe end of the story, Brody had to return to his duty station and say goodbye\nto Shannon. I knew from the moment I wrote the scene that I wanted to see these\ncharacters again, but that it would take time before Brody could come home. What\nyou have here is his homecoming. We caught glimpses of Brody and Shannon in\nother books--Brody's call to Zach and Logan about Jazz duringNo Regrets, No Surrender, later Liam\nGardiner's introduction to Shannon inA\nMarine and a Gentlemanand Shannon's cameo inA Candle for a Marineand once more, Brody was mentioned duringHave Yourself a Marine Christmas. Not\nonce in the sixteen books that followedHer\nMarinedid I forget that Brody and Shannon were waiting--he was waiting to\ncome home and she waited for him to get there. I\nalways knew what the story would entail when I brought Brody and Shannon back\ntogether--and while they'd maintained their relationship long distance, there is\na very distinct difference for a couple to come together after so much time\napart. This same challenge faces so many of our military servicemen and women\nand the significant others who love them. Brody\nnever had anyone waiting for him before and Shannon lived with the constant\nworry that something could happen to him. They each had to be strong for the\nother. Life went on at home, Brody couldn't be there with her to meet\nchallenges she faced and sometimes weeks could go by without word from him.\nIt's damned hard and it takes a lot of determination on both sides for these kinds\nof couples to withstand the pressure. When\nI sat down to write this novel, it was like coming home for me, too. I'd waited\nso long to write those words, they were burned into my brain and poured out\nonto the page. I hope you enjoy Shannon and Brody's reunion as much as I did. Semper\nfi,  Heather", "related": [], "rank": 931094, "title": "Her Marine Bodyguard (Always a Marine series Book 22)", "author": "Heather Long", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 40.0}
