Now, Beattie rewards longtime fans and new readers alike with 11 deft, pitch-perfect stories. Plunging straight into the living rooms and back yards where her first-name-only protagonists gather to converse, complain, eat, drink and cook, Beattie gets to the evasive, impatient heart of 21st-century living. In clear, graceful prose, she presents a range of characters, from a penniless war veteran who must endure the \"revenge of the ordinary world\" (\"Hurricane Carleyville\") to a culinary celebrity who vacations in Key West and anticipates preparing an impromptu meal for President Clinton (\"The Big-Breasted Pilgrim\"). In \"The Famous Poet, Amid Bougainvillea,\" Beattie's subtle, satiric wit comes to play as Hopper and Randy, assistants to rich artists, reminisce about the past and creak through the daily motions of living in bodies that have failed them. Similar themes of dependence and vulnerability arise in the emotionally charged \"The Women of This World.\" Adeptly depicting the dynamics between Dale; her ditzy mother-in-law, Brenda; her scholarly husband, Nelson; and her shrewdly malevolent father-in-law, Jerome, Beattie juxtaposes Nelson and Jerome's struggle for perfection in life, music and wine with a terrible tragedy that causes Dale to ruminate on humanity's inherent imperfection. Beattie still captures the zeitgeist like no one else, effortlesslyDor so it seemsDrevealing the sudden intimacies and sweet ironies of a crowded, improbable world. Only when she touches down, light as a trapeze artist, at the end of a tale, does the reader become aware of the perfect arcs she traces. (Jan.) Forecast: Beattie won the 2000 Pen/Malamud Award for excellence in short fiction.

Beth, a divorced caterer, has been having an affair with Oliver, a married banker. Vivienne, a former \"Debutante of the Year,\" happens to be married to Oliver and doesn't know of the affair. Georgy, an American photographer on assignment in London, is infatuated with Beth's ex-husband. Without any obvious links (at first) to the first three are Sally, the sexy, freewheeling good-time girl from Australia, and Catherine, a veterinarian's receptionist whose famous mother cruelly squashed her one chance at love. Smith nimbly charts the ways in which the disparate lives of these women intersect until they all meet, by chance, in a gynecological ward, where they become friends. She generates suspense with a violent prologue in which an unnamed woman is attacked in her kitchen and maintains the tension with short, italicized chapters detailing further murders (with the players remaining anonymous). By the time the main plot acquires the sinister tone of the prologue and interchapters, every character has come so vividly to life that the reader is hooked, ready to be reeled in as Smith subtly orchestrates the series of events that brings the canny and experienced killer to the fore in a protracted and graphic conclusion.

At the center of the book is Brown's concert at the Boston Garden on the night following Martin Luther King's assassination in 1968. Because of rising tensions among African-Americans in the city, Mayor Kevin White's first impulse was to cancel Brown's concert. Yet realizing that ticket holders might be just as angry over a canceled concert as they might be impassioned to riot by a raucous one, he and Brown worked out a deal to allow the concert to go on. Once on stage, Brown opened with his by-then famous Please, Please, Please, which became that night a rallying cry for his audience to respect themselves and others, just as King had done. Sullivan only briefly traces Brown's rise and fall as a musician from his early days in Edgefield, S.C., to his death in Augusta, Ga., as he recovers a facet of James Brown as a political and racial leader.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Assuring a high level of data quality in a service-oriented architecture proves to be difficult for most organizations. Neal Fishman’s book explores the origin of data quality challenges and sheds light on how to tackle complex situations. I found this book packed with practical experience. While reading the book, I learned several effective architectural patterns and implementation tactics. I highly recommend this book for IT architects.” Xuegang “Harry” Huang, Solution Architect—Business Intelligence Competency Center, Danske Bank Group, Denmark “Viral Data in SOAprovides insight into topics that can get easily overlooked in fast-paced businesses. The book should help provide practitioners with the necessary knowledge to minimize or avoid embarrassing mistakes due to data errors. The book definitely drives home the point that data can be misused like any other resource and if improperly handled can do serious damage to the enterprise.” Joseph Thomas Farrell, Senior Consultant, Booz Allen Hamilton, United States “Neal sprinkles real-world business stories in the midst of more technical examples to show the importance of trustworthy data in a service-orientated architecture. In his terminology, data can quickly become viral, but in this positive and fun-to-read book, Neal encourages individuals and organizations to take an aggressive stand in getting the most out of their service-oriented solutions.” Lisa Seacat, Master Inventor and Software Engineer, IBM, United States “I thoroughly enjoyed readingViral Data in SOA.The book is written in such a way that it can appeal to everyone from the novice to guru.” Miranda Needham, Computer Systems Analyst, Montana Department of Transportation, United States “When I first laid eyes on the script, I was worried that this might be another of those books extolling the Boy Scout virtues of SOA without contributing anything new. But on closer examination, I found the book packed full of interesting insights. Seldom do we find a book that can deal with the all important philosophical basis of a subject matter and link it to very detailed low-level examples. It is the sort of book that I will pick up and read more than once. You can benefit from light reading, gleaming useful insights supported by interesting stories/anecdotes, and you can delve deeper and explore the details of the examples for more in-depth understanding of the issues covered.” Simon Seow, President, InfoSpec, Malaysia “To travel down the road of regulatory compliance can be challenging for enterprise compliance teams and software architects. Neal Fishman has made a powerful business case for data provenance as the cornerstone of data governance. His book, illustrated by compelling and timely business-world examples, is a most valuable resource since it will help tackle this problem ina principled manner.” Professor Luc Moreau, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, England “This book is a must read for any organization using data-integration or data interchange technologies, or simply any organization that must trust data. Neal takes the reader through an entertaining and vital journey of SOA information management issues, risks, discovery, and solutions. He provides a fresh perspective that no corporation should overlook; in fact, corporations might head blindly into SOA implementations without this awareness.” Kevin Downey, Senior Partner, Xteoma Inc., Canada “Viral Data in SOA: An Enterprise Pandemicis a must read for any business or information technology professional who is charged with improving the creation, management, and distribution of information in a large enterprise. This book makes the most important current contribution to understanding the complexities, issues, and practices for improving large enterprise data management organization, architecture, processes, and technology. The book brings a theoretical and intellectual clarity coupled with a practical perspective to enterprise data management.” Bruce Gallager, President and CEO, Syscore International, United States “An intriguing discourse. The text is relevant and pithy. If you help manage or create IT projects, this book is worth reading from cover to cover. The book explores the relevance of misrepresented data and its potential undetected wrath on business execution. Many companies have realized that data should be a recognized asset.Viral Data in SOAsets out to help you nurture and protect that asset.” David Kmetz, Partner: Global Business Services, IBM, United States “Neal Fishman’s book on the viral affects of data is a much-needed warning signal for a time when critical consideration of risk and impact take a backseat in the thrive to integrate and apply new technologies. This book alerts its readers of potential risks and indicates how these can be minimized in real-world implementations. A must read for all decision makers for today’s increasingly complex information architectures.” Thomas Buehlmann, Ph.D., Senior Manager, Accenture, United States “Viral Data in SOAhas an amazing amount of information that spans different disciplines and areas of interest. The author analyzes the subject of viral data at various levels of depth, starting from the business level and working down to the database modeling, administration, and development levels. The author uses his experience and knowledge to present a vast area of possible problems with data and provides an in-depth analysis of the causes of viral data, suggesting the right path toward solutions. I believe this is a very important book because it addresses the subject from a realistic perspective coming from real-life experiences.” Mika Nikolopoulou, Academic Affairs University Ambassador, IBM, United States “In this world of exploding data volumes, every CIO is exploring new and exciting ways to leverage information. Few, however, pause to consider the associated risks that come with poorly controlled data quality. In this book, Mr. Fishman provides a detailed understanding of just how pervasive data quality problems are across all levels of an organization. His eclectic use of examples leaves the reader with no doubts about the unexpected dangers ofviral datain a modern business. It provides a wake-up call to all IT professionals looking to use business data to create competitive advantage.” David McCarty, Information Management Consultant, BWH, France “Did you ever stop to think that the information you count on to make business decisions has the potential to cause a viral data pandemic that can disable the company? Neal Fishman’s latest book will definitely make you rethink your approach to business data. The book is chock full of entertaining illustrations that promptly make the reader realize how easily data can become poisonous bits of misinformation, especially when propagated throughout today’s service-oriented enterprises.Viral Data in SOA: AnEnterprise Pandemicdrives home the need for all businesses to establish an environment of trustworthy data. As Neal points out, ‘At the end of the day, there is a line between trustworthy information and viral data, and that line isveryfine.’ This book provides excellent guidance on a variety of governance models, techniques, and treatments to combat viral data and to derive trusted information. The book is a thought-provoking information technology guide that I will reread frequently.” Beth Brownhill, Distinguished Engineer, Information Agenda Executive Architect, IBM, United States “The most entertaining and informative book on information technology I have read to date. A fascinating look at the role of information in the workplace.” Mark Stewart, Managing Director, AV Pure & Simple, England “Neal Fishman has a deep understanding of data and how to keep it from becoming viral.

It is more than that though. It has a soul, and the soul is its vociferous attempt to communicate the teachings of Jesus, many of which this generation of Christianity has ignored. In my opinion, it is this essence to the book that sets it apart from many other devotional tools. The difference in tone is immediately apparent from the introduction. While explaining the urgent need for Christian heroes, Chris mentions the dangers of increased weaponisation, global warming, and poverty. It continues with a summary of the present state of Christendom; hollowed out from the inside by people who more often than not stand in antithesis to the message of Jesus. Running through the book is a love for peaceful social change and social justice....

The vessel sailed north from British Columbia toward the Arctic Circle and stopped at Alaska's Point Barrow to pick up an I?upiaq family. The expedition's mission, \"to study the plants and people in the high north,\" takes a backseat when the Karluk becomes locked in ice and eventually sinksAsurvival becomes the crew's goal. Unlike Snow Bentley, in which Martin neatly balanced the historical framework with telling anecdotes, here details of the expedition outweigh the human storyAdespite some interesting facts (e.g., \"Qiruk, the mother, could look at a man,/ cut a fur skin with her round-bladed ulu, and sew a pair of pants/ that would fit him exactly\"). Though the author guesses about how various family members feel while awaiting rescue (she writes about one daughter, \"Maybe she looked into the seal oil lamp and heard/ her grandmother singing the song of home./ And she did not feel so lonely\"), Martin does not speculate about why the I?upiaq family leaves their grandmother and their home to travel by sea with strangers. Despite scattered moments of suspense and Krommes's (Grandmother Winter) engaging, earth-toned scratchboard art, youngsters are apt to find this journey laborious and slow moving. Ages 6-up.

He also writes scintillating erotica and science fiction adventure stories. His publishing credits include seven novels, five short story collections and over 300 short story sales. From contemporary to historical, De Noux uses several recurring characters in his New Orleans stories and novels: NOPD Homicide Detective John Raven Beau (21st Century); NOPD Homicide Detective LaStanza (20th Century); Private-eye Lucien Caye (1940s) and NOPD Detective Jacques Dugas (1890s). A primary theme in De Noux’s fiction is the effect of violence on victims and their families as well as the sometimes debilitating effect of violence on law enforcement officers, private-eyes and their loved ones.  As a former private-eye and currently a police investigator, De Noux knows his subject well. De Noux’s stories span from mystery to mainstream, literary, suspense, thriller, science-fiction, fantasy, horror, erotica, humor, westerns, children’s fiction as well as cross-genre stories – erotic-detective, science-fiction mysteries and the like.  His stories have been published in the US, Canada, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Scotland, Sweden and Ukraine. From 1993 to 2006, De Noux taught creative writing and mystery writing at Tulane University, University of New Orleans, Delgado Community College and McNeese State University. He is the founding editor of two fiction magazines, MYSTERY STREET and NEW ORLEANS STORIES. O’Neil De Noux’s “The Heart Has Reasons” (Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine, September 2006) won the Private Eye Writers of America’s prestigious SHAMUS AWARD for BEST SHORT STORY 2007.  The SHAMUS is given annually to recognize outstanding achievement in private eye fiction. In 2009, the Short Mystery Fiction Society awarded the Derringer Award for Best Novelette to another Lucien Caye story, “Too Wise” by O’Neil De Noux (which appeared in Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine’s November 2008 Issue).  The Derringer Award is given annually to recognize excellence in the mystery short form. In September 2009, O’Neil De Noux received an Artist Services Career Advancement Award for 2009-2010 from the Louisiana Division of the Arts for work on his forthcoming historical novel set during The Battle of New Orleans.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Felske was born in New York City and grew up in Manhattan and Quogue, Long Island. He attended Bronxville High School and received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Dartmouth College. He did his graduate work in film directing and screenwriting at Columbia University. The Shallow Man, originally published in 1995, was his first novel. His second novel, Word, came out in 1998 followed by The Millennium Girl in 2000. In 2008, the author established his independent literary imprint The Dolce Vita Press founded in conjunction with Amazon to publish and distribute his books. The imprint’s inaugural publication was The Shallow Man:15th Anniversary Edition released in September, 2009 followed by Scandalocity in May, 2010. In August, 2012 special anniversary editions of the acclaimed Word and The Millennium Girl were released along with the publication of Felske’s newest original novel, The Ivory Stretch, in January, 2013.  The author launched The DVP to have significant contact with readership and to exercise creative control over his work from the editing to the covers, utilizing the top artists of the day. The DVP label derives from the Italian “dolce vita,” which translates to the “sweet life.” Felske was influenced by Federico Fellini’s masterwork, La Dolce Vita, a cinematic tale of a decadent group of glamorous partiers, nightclubbers, and exotic women as they navigate through Rome’s high society pursued by a playboy paparazzo. The author has referred to his early literature as “dolce vita fiction,” stories about nightclub impresarios, serial womanizers, fashionistas, fortune hunting women, entertainment business hopefuls, and scandal scribes entrenched in a similar dolce vita circuitry; i.e., characters living modern versions of that illusory ‘sweet life’ depicted in Fellini’s film.  In addition to the The Ivory Stretch, the author has two more completed works coming soon. Felske’s Chemical/Animal, his take on marriage in the 21st century and his 2nd written in first person as a woman, will be released in late 2013; A Touch of Noir will be released in 2014, a 1940s Hollywood detective mystery-thriller. All Felske titles for The DVP are available at the author’s Web site coertefelske.com, thedolcevitapress.com, Amazon.com, BN.com, independent bookstores and e-book distributors worldwide.

In 1992 San Paradiso, Calif., the mayor is prime suspect in a series of murders, a senator's wife receives pornographic photos of herself, an upright judge is reportedly hinting at a gubernatorial race--but all three know these \"facts\" are wrong. It's as if each has a double. Elsewhere in the world, Paris suffers earthquakes, a fanatic Ayatollah conquers Saudi Arabia and world leaders (including the U.S. president) are kidnapped at a summit meeting. In San Paradiso, reporter Laura Bennett learns that her long-dead father had been tormented by the devils in Goya's painting \"The Witches' Sabbath.\" Troubles climax in San Paradiso as these demons, who can \"echo\" anyone, turn to Laura as the Devil's potential bride. Enabled by inner strength to shrug off a fate worse than death, Laura nevertheless experiences horrors that would be even scarier as movie special effects.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Andorra es una de los más pequeños países del mundo. Es el país de la nieve y del esquí. El país está situado entre Francia y España, en mitad de los Pirineos, y se le conoce como la pequeña Suiza. Soy ingeniero industrial y escritor. Vivo a 1400 metros de altura, en pleno bosque, donde escribo. He escrito cuentos infantiles, ensayos y novelas. Destacan sobretodo mis novelas novelas históricas.  En novela negra, he escrito obras como \"El rapto, el muerto y el Marsellés\", Premio Serie Negra del año 2000, o \"Una vida en juego\", dedicada al Casino de la Rabassada. En relato de anticipación dispongo de obras como \"Un voto por la esperanza\", que mereció el título de Obra Seleccionada en el I Premio Internacional de Novela Plaza & Janés en 1985, o la celebrada \"El informe Phaeton\", que ha merecido el aplauso unánime del público, que dice que es mi obra más impresionante. Y en ficción histórica poseo títulos tan conocidos como, por ejemplo: \"El maestro de Keops\", Premio Néstor Luján de Novela Histórica 1998, \"El anillo de Atila\", Premio Fiter i Rossell 1999, \"Los ojos de Aníbal\", Premio Carlemany 2002, \"La Gran Concubina de Egipto\", Premio Néstor Lujan 2005, la trilogía dedicada a Jaime I el Conquistador (2000) formada por: \"El puñal del sarraceno\", \"La reina húngara\" y \"Hablad o matadme\" o la trilogía dedicada a Alí Bey (2004) formada por \"¡Maldito catalán!\", \"¡Maldito musulmán!\" y \"¡Maldito cristiano!\" o mi última novela \"Abre los ojos y despierta\". Me encanta mezclar con exquisita sutileza la realidad, la ficción y el misterio, que siempre rodeo de sentimientos, que considero el verdadero motor de la vida.  Tengo obras publicadas en varios idiomas: catalán, castellano, francés, inglés, checo, portugués, eslovaco, griego... Se me considera el revitalizador de la novela historica en catalán. Y me siento muy orgulloso por ello.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sort of. I'm not a guy who sees ghosts,\nso I tend to demean what happened, but taking a tour through the Chimney Rock\nArchaeological Area with my son, a boy ran across the trail in front of us. I\nput my arm out to stop my son from colliding with him. The boy ran to the\ncliff's edge and vaulted over one-handed, and I hurried to see. Below the rock\nwhere he placed his hand lay a landing place, a narrow shelf padded thick with\nPonderosa pine needles, the steep slope of forest plunging off below that. I\nnodded. Of course boys would do that. It left me stunned as if from a head injury. I couldn't stop\nthinking about that boy.What ifscenarios kept playing in my head. But the one that played the most went like\nthis: What if this boy changed everything about Anasazi society for just a\nlittle while? What if the Crab Nebula Supernova of 1054 set off a riot of\nviolence, and this boy somehow stopped it? Then I wrote it while learning how to write a novel. I'd\nbeen a short-story guy all my life. Novels? Too long. Just padded short\nstories. Wrong. Of course. Long-form storytelling is not something\nyou learn to do well quickly. Hence my goal: Write ten novels as quickly as I\ncan to learn the craft. As I write this, I'm in final production with my third\nnovel, and about to begin working on the first draft of number four.Less Than Nothingwas number one. Thank you for starting the progression with me.", "related": ["B008GFY0OS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dunegan just released by the publisher iUniverse. My comment means we all know that holding a cup of coffee would spill if you’re riding a roller coaster, right? In this particular case, author John L. Dunegan writes very smoothly, but after a dream-like introductory scene, for many pages thereafter he begins his story with lengthy character development scenario. Page after page of simple farm life tales of ordinary people made me wishing he’d \"get on with the sci-fi\" aspect, clearly knowing that he’s building up for some event, but anxiously anticipating getting to where he was leading. So I made myself a cup of coffee, and at around page 80, it happened. Just like a roller coaster ratcheted up and over the first arch, the book gained momentum and began a ride. I say this because the combination of the caffeine from the coffee and storyline’s speed and twists caused the \"perfect storm\" of enjoyment in my mind! I finished the book in one sitting as I truly couldn’t put it down!John L. Dunegan presents an original concept in time travel to the readers within his book. He claims not to have the H. G. Wells’ gadget of a time machine; nor the USS Enterprise traveling at multiple warp speed; nor even some hoop people jump through into the past. Those fictional storylines have all been played out and overdone. He promised in the preface a new idea, a creative twist - and he delivered on his promise. Having a technical background in real life, John L. Dunegan embellishes the storyline with just enough physics at just the right times to keep the reader figuratively strapped into his seat, compelled to read what will happen – next; or rather, to rephrase without giving away any of the story because of the time altering aspect, has already happened.The investment of time reading all of the book’s initial character development pays off when the events and circumstances of My Half of Tomorrow unfold. By then, the reader feels as if they know the characters so well and are able to empathize with their concerns, curiosity and decisions. The pseudo-scientific credibility of the fantasy aspects are truly a sci-fi enthusiast’s dream come true, totally in tune with those who appreciate dwelling on the thoughts and situations which may prove to be unintended consequences when dealing with the unknowns of time travel. Even the title is cleverly articulated, as the reader soon learns.By design, I did not mention any of the significant threads of the machinations of My Half of Tomorrow, as I wish for all those that choose to read this to enjoy the surprises fresh and first hand. My recommendation is to make a good cup of coffee, clear your schedule, sit back and enjoy! This is an ideal book for young adults to mature connoisseurs of well written novels, but for the true sci-fi gluttons, this an absolute must read, positively not to be passed up. Also, try not to spill the coffee when you get past page 80.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Acapella Blues was inspired by that love of the music and also from a desire to explore the life of a talented journeyman musician and his struggle to survive and overcome his demons.At the same time I explore again one of my recurring obsessions, the abuse of women by men in power. The spark for my plot came from a news story that I read about an American military contractor and its illegal and immoral behavior while operating in Bosnia. The activity included gun sales, drugs, and involvement in the Eastern European slave trade. The worst of it was that a number of the company's employees, including managers, had 'possession' of young women, using them as sexual and domestic slaves.I'm a big fan of James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux novels  as well as Tony Hillerman's Navajo mysteries. I think Acapella Blues is a blend of these two styles, along with my own inimitable prose, incorporating Burke's lyrical hard-nosed realism with Hillerman's sometimes light-hearted but ultimately serious exploration of character and theme.The book is set on Cape Cod where I live, but I've tweaked the Cape a little, making it a bit more mythical, a darker place with a floating casino and more violent crime than you normally encounter here. There is poverty, crime, drugs and violence on the Cape of course, among the beautiful land and dunes and bays and ponds and bogs, but Acapella Blues dwells more in the seedy dark side than in the sunlit corners of the Cape.Sam Ravello, our principled but flawed hero, wants simply to play his music for people, but that quest becomes complicated when he meets a young Romanian woman and her little boy and tries to help them out of the web of corruption, blackmail, and a violent criminal underworld. The mystery Sam solves here is sadder than any song he's ever written,  a dirge about innocence forever lost and the extremes of love betrayed.", "related": [], "rank": 395636, "title": "Butcher's Moon: A Mystery Crime Thriller", "author": "Robert Bucchianeri", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At about fifteen I wrote a children's play that was produced by a local Little Theater Group. In my twenties, I had a column in a weekly paper. One of my jobs was in-house editor for an investment firm, trying to teach the analysts the mysteries of grammar and punctuation. I traveled a lot, moved about from country to country, enjoying a very good life indeed. I read romance novels to relax. Hundreds, thousands, many thousands, over the years (hey, some weeks I read one a day!) and a couple of years ago I decided to write a romance novel. I mean, I've read so many, I must know how to write one, mustn't I?  But writing is different than reading. My first efforts were pretty sad, I think, but my family and friends were very supportive and I persevered. To date, I've published eight on Kindle, have another five in various stages of completion, and have just  finished my first collaboration with my good friend Kate Britton, who writes rather spicier romance than I do. She's a lot braver than me! It's going to be called Lucy's Love and we've sort of borrowed a few characters from my Cruising to Love series and Kate's book, Jennie's Joy. Hopefully it will be a success and the start of a great writing partnership. When not reading or writing, I travel, love cruising, garden, and love to cook. Oh yes, I love to meet handsome men I can use as inspiration for my heroes.", "related": [], "rank": 1860707, "title": "Martine The Beginning", "author": "Edwina J White", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 45.0}

The Glass Ceiling Delusion demythologizes each of thirty elements the author has identified of the now generally accepted claim that women are discriminated against in the world of white-collar work. Much has been accomplished recently in disclosing the half-truths about women and domestic violence, for example, but Buchanan illuminates an area that other critics of ideological feminism have not considered. Buchanan's analysis is based partly on his experience of working as an executive for major British and American multinational corporations for over 30 years until 2010. His book should inspire research on settings of corporate power everywhere. Always witty and sometimes even biting in style, Buchanan's text is grounded in important texts in psychobiology, sociology, history and politics. It is an impassioned yet not angry argument that deserves the careful attention of  policy-makers and a general readership.  Professor Miles Groth PhD, Editor, New Male Studies: An International Journal    Peter Saunders, Emeritus Professor of Sociology, Sussex University: 'The Glass Ceiling Delusion attacks head-on the militant feminist myth that men and women have the same interests and capabilities. Reviewing a wide range of evidence, he shows that the under-representation of women in senior positions in business has nothing to do with discrimination and 'glass ceilings' and that attempts to impose quotas are therefore fundamentally flawed. A polemical book with an important message.'   Glenn Wilson Visiting Professor of Psychology, Gresham College, London: 'Equality of opportunity is a fine thing but equality of outcome is another matter entirely. There is little doubt that men and women have, on average, different talents and interests that make gender quotas in the workplace unfair and impractical. The Glass Ceiling Delusion is a welcome, well-argued addition to the debate about whether women should be pushed up the social ladder just because they are women, and thus at a presumed disadvantage. This is rather an insult to women and Margaret Thatcher, for one, would not have agreed. Individuals should be treated as individuals, not as members of a particular race, class or gender. Whatever the historic injustices, this is the only way that social structures can evolve naturally.' Dr Vernon Coleman bestselling English author: 'The Glass Ceiling Delusion is an important and brave book, the best book on social economics and society in general published for decades. It's irresistibly compelling, cogently argued and superbly put together. It should be in all school and college libraries. It should be compulsory reading for social science, economics and politics students. It should be force-fed to male and female politicians. This is definitely a five-star book. Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant.'  Review of Mike Buchanan's David and Goliatha: David Cameron  -  heir to Harman? John Strafford Chairman of the Campaign for Conservative Democracy: 'Mike Buchanan has courageously taken on the radical feminists. For too long this group have dominated the public policy agenda. Pay equality, gender balance in the boardroom, all women shortlists have been given far too much prominence in public life. We needed the other side to be put and in his book Mike Buchanan does just this. His description of the Prime Minister having a 'female-pattern brain' is an interesting aspect of David Cameron. Without being insulting it explains some of the current direction of Conservative policy.  The book calls for a fight back against the radical feminists. It deserves to succeed. Women had a long hard justifiable fight to obtain the vote in our democracy (see my book Our Fight for Democracy), but now they have it the radical feminists want special treatment. This is not acceptable, each person's vote should have an equal value regardless of gender. Manipulating parliamentary candidate short lists to give preference to women is a distortion of democracy and anyone who believes in democracy should oppose it.'", "related": ["B00B07O4YA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cliff Trager, Sussman's producer, orders him to continue reporting on the incident and the reaction of the wrestling world. But when no one can tell Sussman who the masked wrestler really was, he becomes convinced it was a case of murder. As Sussman spends his time wining, whining and worrying about his stature as a serious sportscaster, the story picks up speed and interest with the arrival of Murray Glick, a private investigator who operates out of an exclusive Chicago-suburb shopping mall and runs a singles mystery-cruise business on the side. Eager to pitch his \"Clue of the Day\" idea to the network, Glick helps his old pal, Sussman, by following the convoluted trail of Double-X's mysterious past from Chicago to Redondo Beach and finding the killer. Katz's implausible ending is disappointing, but his characters are disarmingly off-center and his portrait of pro wrestling, comically sympathetic.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00ANLK06K"], "rank": 3292139, "title": "Last Dance In Redondo Beach", "author": "Michael J.

I think it is important to keep a good sense of humor about every aspect of life.  There is a right and a wrong, and it is not left or right. And there is no gray area in definite! There is but one creator to whom we will be ultimately accountable to. Bono is my favorite song writer and artist and U2 is my favorite band. I also love the Beatles and Bon Jovi! I am the mother of four extremely intelligent and talented children who are also very gorgeous. I published my first book of poetry in 2009, the second anthology is in the making on the very back burner.  I have also published a self help book on natural healing and a self help book on losing weight in a healthy manner. I have one CD out but I have ten more that have been written with the songs and melodies but they have to be produced. I also have several SEO webpages that are on the very back burner but it was fun while it lasted!  And I love to invest in tax liens of which I have a small port folio. I am adamant about Pro Life and Green Living. I am pursuing a political platform to bring about God's best for all of US!  God bless you & May God Continue to Bless America!

An international panel of contributors illuminates the rich history and philosophy of what the editors call Lamarckian problematics, and shows how a developmental perspective informs much of today's cutting-edge research. Throughout, Gissis and Jablonka integrate the many papers with impressively comprehensive interventions.\"—Susan Oyama, Professor Emeritus, John Jay College and The Graduate Center, City University of New York\"Ever since Darwin and the neo-Darwinians came to dominate the interpretation of evolutionary theory and its history, Lamarck has been ignored, misrepresented and stereotyped. The same was about to happen in the year of Darwin's bicentennial, but thanks to Snait Gissis and Eva Jablonka, Lamarck has finally received the serious attention his work deserves. The editors have assembled a group of world-class scholars -- historians, philosophers, and evolutionary developmental biologists -- to produce a far more accurate, comprehensive, and exciting portrait of Lamarck as one of the most sophisticated, knowledgeable, and influential naturalists of his day. The series of essays in this volume are an interdisciplinary tour de force.\"—Garland Allen, Department of Biology, Washington University in St. Louis\"The reemergence of Lamarckian themes is one of the most striking developments in modern biology. This book unites the work of historians and scientists to throw light on the legacy of Lamarck's theory, its eclipse in the twentieth century, and its triumphant return to center stage in the twenty-first. It marks a transformation of biology itself but also of how we write the history of evolutionism.\"—Peter Bowler, Queen's University Belfast\"This book is long overdue. Lamarck and Lamarckian ideas were not only ignored but actively ridiculed during the second half of the 20th century. As the subtitle of this book indicates, some of the most cogent reasons for reassessing those ideas come from within the citadel of molecular biology itself. A great strength of the book is that it does not seek to reintroduce Lamarckian ideas as they were originally formulated; rather, the Lamarckian perspective is used to assess where the modern synthesis needs extending or even replacing. For any serious student of evolutionary biology, this work will be a bible for many years to come.\"—Denis Noble, FRS, Oxford University, author ofThe Music of Life", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jason began his spiritual training remarkably early. From the age of six, his 71-year-old father and guru began teaching him how to properly interpret his dreams, meditate, channel, and develop his innate psychic abilities. By the time he was nineteen, he had traveled around the world three times, speaking with his father on the radio, television, and lecturing on a variety of metaphysical, spiritual, and New Age topics.  After his father's passing in 1988, Jason became depressed, ridden with anxiety, and debilitated by an inner ear disorder, TMJ, chronic fatigue syndrome, and mercury toxicity. This compelled him to go inwards and begin his journey of transformation.  After suffering severely for over a decade, Jason began his healing with upper cervical care in 1997. Two years later, in 1999, he discovered the numerous detoxification health benefits of an infrared sauna for his mercury toxicity, and subsequently founded Sunlighten. In 2001 Jason's life was utterly transformed by an ancient mystical inner body experience known as a kundalini awakening. Afterward Jason's creative prowess helped to propel Sunlighten to become one of the fastest growing companies in America for three years in a row, making the coveted \"Entrepreneur's Hot 100\" list for 2004, 2005, and 2006.  Sunlighten and Sunlight Day Spa (co-founded in 2004) are companies dedicated to empowering wellness through products and services that provide drug-free pain relief, drug-free detoxification, drug-free stress relief, massage therapy, and whole body rejuvenation using state-of-the-art wellness technologies such as far-infrared therapy and sound vibrational therapy. In 2007 Jason founded Transformational Art, a company to promote his fine art of mystical expressionism.

It has become her tradition to celebrate the season of giving with an original short story for her loved ones. Each one is an allegory that represents a concept she has learned or problem she has struggled with during the year.The catalyst came when Audrey began telling oral stories. Soon, she realized that storytelling was a big part of her past with bedtime stories of Dumbo told by Uncle Doc and Grandpap stories told by Dad. As a parent, she told improvised stories to her boys with their teddy bears, not even remembering that her Uncle used to do for her as well.Oddly enough, it was this new found passion of storytelling “finding her” that encouraged her to actually begin publishing the stories that she had written over the years. “Once Upon a Storytime at Christmas” is the compilation of Christmas stories that she traditionally writes each year during the Holidays, so look for more stories to come.The books, video and audio recordings of these stories are available on her website and Amazon.com.

I joined the Royal Navy straight from school, did four years at engineering college and then went to sea for three years in destroyers. I took a commission after that and joined the Fleet Air Arm as a helicopter pilot. I was married, had two kids and now have four grandchildren and one great grandson. I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Abner is dismayed to learn that he has inadvertently volunteered to march in his town's historical festival, dressed as his namesake, General Abner Willow. What if he falls off the horse? Or forgets the lines to his speech? His siblings devise the perfect solution–he needs bravery practice, which comes in the form of baked grasshoppers. Mrs. Delgado, the seamstress who comes to the house to sew Abner's costume, is delighted when she sees the children catching grasshoppers. “Back in my home country, we would catch all the grasshoppers we could find. Then we would eat them like you eat pretzels!” Abner is horrified. Young readers will be happily grossed out as he and his sister chomp on some baked and salted grasshoppers, and they will be amazed to find the siblings springing 20 feet into the air after consuming them. Since grasshoppers begin as eggs laid underground, they were able to soak up all the magic that is located in the town's soil. While having grasshopper magic is fun at first, the children quickly realize that there is a problem–Mrs. Delgado took home some grasshoppers for her two-year-old son, and the children have to act quickly to stop him from eating them and bouncing away. Dorman's charming pen-and-ink illustrations do a fine job connecting readers to the story. While the magical elements might seem a bit contrived, the book's target audience will buy into these aspects without a lengthy explanation needed.–Lisa Kropp, Suffolk Cooperative Library System, Bellport, NYα(c) Copyright 2013.

His graduate work focused on Early Man Studies and Experimental Physical Anthropology.      While in graduate school he went to work for the California State Department of Parks and Recreation as a State Park Ranger and retired as a Unit Supervising State Park Ranger II.     Throughout his life he has had an interest in the paranormal, both from his personal experiences, as well as through his studies in Anthropology and Parapsychology on both the personal and university levels.  Having had a lifetime of paranormal experiences, and after considerable thought, he decided to come forth and put his writing skills to work with the creation of this fictionalized story which is based on actual events that took place in his life.      He has written several regional art tourism articles as well as lengthy and detailed papers and reports in his State Park career. This is his first work of fiction taken to completion as a novel.      The events written about within the pages of this novel were actual events he has experienced. The names of individuals were changed to fictional names but the stories actually happened as written.       Roger McKasson who also is a nationally advertised fine art painter and bronze sculptor, now lives in southwestern New Mexico where he is presently working on another book of this nature, while also continuing to work as a fine art artist.", "related": ["B00JG98BXO"], "rank": 3193926, "title": "Memoirs of a Demigod", "author": "Roger McKasson", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ground breaking and fast paced, the novels are a characteristic mixture of the vampire lore and the clandestine secrets of the military. The concept led to a series of books: Operation Immortal Servitude, Operation Save the Innocent, Operation Face the Fear, and Operation Endgame.   A longtime favorite for Tony is the old style of “space opera” type stories which is the center of his two book series: Alien Deception and Alien Revelation. The series deals with an alien organization that has infiltrated the American political system. The series runs the gauntlet from humorous and light hearted to deadly serious as a young man and woman search for answers.    Coven is about: Little towns and their secrets; a guilty pleasure for some and a harsh reality for others.  Witches have secretly been in control of the town council for years and the town has prospered...until now. As they search for the truth behind the mysterious death of one of their shop owners, they uncover disturbing secrets about an ostracized witch and their own coven leader, making it unclear which one may have been using black magic to murder.   The Evil from Above: Sitting atop of the Fairfax Hotel is a gargoyle that some say wields mythical power to grant success, but not without a substantial price. Yet others claim it is simply a stone decoration misinterpreted by man's foolishness and greed for power. Which should we believe? It is a dilemma that defines who or what we are. Sam Blythe has reached that moment in his life where he has to make that choice and decide what sacrifices he is willing to live with.   Tony retired from the United States Navy in 2001 after twenty-three years of service. He and his family currently reside in Portsmouth, Virginia. While continuing to write, Tony teaches at Old Dominion University and Saint Leo University.

He majored in film and social psychology, minoring in Philosophy, Anthropology, and Human Sexuality, which gave him the diverse educational background to help him become a writer and director.  He holds a fifth degree black belt in Kenpo Karate, and is a certified expert in all manner of weapons, including the pistol, rifle, sword, stick, knife, goat, staff, tetherball, nunchaku, machete, and skin flute.  Above all else, he maintains excellent hair and lives in Sausalito with his wife, French Bulldog, and Miniature Dachshund aboard a yacht.  When he’s not writing, directing or teaching martial arts, you’ll find him fighting injustice, cherishing a number two, working out, or riding his mountain bike through the scenic hills of Marin County.   In 2010, I was diagnosed with stage 4 Non-Hodgkins T-Cell Lymphoma Cancer, and with only weeks before my imminent demise, began rigorous dose dense, chemotherapy.  With an extremely low survival rate, about one in five, I was particularly lucky to achieve a full remission in just over two months.  At that point, I was approved for a stem cell transplant at Stanford University, the procedure being the first of several state of the art treatments.  Three years later, in 2013, I had a minor recurrence and am lucky enough to be undergoing a bone marrow transplant at Stanford, the front line treatment and best hope for a lifelong cure.

Kerns was born. Her parents relocated to New York from Kentucky shortly before her birth. Talk about worlds colliding; being the only official Yankee in a house full of rebels made life interesting to say the least. Maybe that’s why she has always liked action movies and suspense.  Being a morning person allows her to get all her writing and other work done which leaves her time in the evenings for her favorite shows. Any given evening you can find her watching shows like NCIS, NCIS Los Angeles, Criminal Minds, Burn Notice, CSI, Elementary, Person of Interest and numerous others. Her interests don’t stop at regular suspense but extend to the great beyond. One of her favorite series was Stargate SG-1. She’s still waiting for a trip through the shimmering worm-hole ring. Warehouse 13, Continuum, and Defiance have also caught her interest and sparked ideas for several stories.  With all of these shows filled with quite a bit of violence you may wonder at her calling herself a romance writer. Never fear, while she enjoys the intricacies of figuring out the how, who, and why of crimes her real love is for the relationships that bind the players together. The bonds partners on the force and off the force. The dance between people at work, at play, and in their everyday settings. These are what keep Sandra writing her stories where Romance and Suspense Collide. Sandra invites you to stop by her website/blog: sandrakerns.com - Where Romance and Suspense Collide to learn more about her, her unusual blog posts, characters, and current releases.", "related": [], "rank": 1354728, "title": "Callaghan's Conundrum (Colorado Skies Book 3)", "author": "Sandra S.

Yes, really, 1979. He’s an old geezer. And sensitive about his age. He seems to think that younger readers may wonder how someone who has to have hit the big six oh could possibly have something interesting to offer. Maybe to the other Baby Boomers. But the man can’t program his smart TV. He doesn’t do Facebook or Twitter, he barely knows how to make phone calls on his I Phone.  On the other hand, the things that really matter, character and relationships and emotion and humor, he has that stuff down.  An avid reader, he goes through a half dozen book a month, now mostly on Kindle, but still an occasional actual book with words printed on paper. And like many of us, he always thought I could do that. I could write! What a great way to make a living! Making up stories, entertaining people. Like the Master, King Stephen, keeping people up late and night so they go to work bleary eyed and dull. What a concept! The trick is writing something well. Something lively and entertaining, with characters and motivations, and emotions you can understand, and plots that make you want to see what the hell is going to happen, enough to keep someone up late. That takes a talent for writing. Does he have it? You be the judge. Be careful. You may be sleeping through the alarm. James likes crime/mystery/thrillers because he knows criminals as well as anyone can, after twenty-five years in prison. Most aren’t sociopaths, but the few are terrifying. It’s a theme addressed in his new novel, Capital Punishment. He also likes science fiction because who can say what’s realistic in another world or time or dimension. It’s a genre ripe for world saving and special powers and time travel. Anything can happen! James has been married to the same patient woman for 39 years. They married young, he says, but it wasn’t that young. Before the Ph.D.. They’ve raised four children, all grown and pursuing their own careers. James and Patsy live in Canon City, Colorado. He enjoys the things that Colorado allows, hiking, fishing, ATV riding, camping, traveling to visit the kids, gardening and carpentry. He has three books available on Kindle and CreateSpace, and hopes to finish a dozen more before settling into the old rocker on the porch.", "related": [], "rank": 2746413, "title": "Twice Upon A Time (Infiniite Possibiliteis Book 1)", "author": "James Michaud", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What are the motives behind dishonesty? Perhaps it is the desire in everyone to protect that which they love. If one admits to past disasters, misdirection, failings, then it is possible to wonder if the Church is not in some way faltering now. But if we believe that truth and knowledge have limitations, we must welcome diverse opinions, even criticisms. Only by honestly receiving and scrutinizing all positions can we come close to an understanding of the truth.” These words remain as fresh and bracing today as they were nearly fifty years ago. The fifteen other essays and sermons, some published here for the first time, are equally bold, exposing injustice masked as God’s will. Yet, there is an underlying theme of personal integrity and striving for spiritual transformation. As an example, Menlove prays that an intersexed child will not be coerced into gender conformity because of faith commitments but rather that we try to stand perceived wisdom on its head, as the scriptures so often do. Readers will want to share many of these essays with family and friends but will also find the concepts occupying their own private thoughts.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This novella is easily read in a sitting or two due to its fast pace and wonderful first person narrative reminiscent of a great film noir or pulp novel of the past.   Samson runs a palm shop and deals drugs. The former brings him into the possession of what Nick--his loser, regular client--claims to be the severed head of an ancient mummy. The latter gets his brother Marky murdered soon thereafter. His ex-wife, Tia, who he still loves, goes missing also. Against all odds, he decides to take revenge against the Russian Mafia thugs responsible.   Well, maybe the odds aren't so bad once he learns what that mummy head can do. No spoilers here.   All this excitement and wonderful character development is set against the backdrop of the streets of Philadelphia. An author's note informs us Ford spent some time there but this is obvious in the vivid descriptions of both the city streets and many crazy street people that show up along the way. Some of them are so bizarre the reader assumes they are a product of \"truth is stranger than fiction.\"   I highly recommend this novella of revenge and regrets. It is thrilling, darkly comic and often poignant as well, without being overly sentimental.  - George Wilhite   horrorreview.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Me too. I don't have the answer though, so I drink at lunch.\"SL: Her vulnerability is vibrant at this point in her life because she's standing among the broken glass of a betrayed heart.

Better to hide that for now.\"SL: We're all part of a new wave of entertainment that says, \"We are human beings and the body is a playground.\" In my books, that playground involves women who are overcoming troubles in order to find love. GWTW:Most romantic stories have one male easily identifiable as the hero, but Lacey has written I Love My Healed Heart, so as the hero could have been one of three men. How did she create three men, potentially believable as Jess's hero?SL: For me, there isn't always one guy who opens your heart up to get you ready for love. It's often a few doing the work to prepare you for the one. And they, too, have their one. And you helped prepare them for her. It's a beautiful angle of life's shape that I've witnessed over and over. The path isn't linear. It's bumpy and multifaceted. GWTW:If more authors wrote their heroine's experiences of sex and romance like this, there would be more satisfied women in the world. - GoneWithTheWord.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

To be ‘free,’ citizens must express their deepest held convictions but also think critically and ascertain facts. Susan P. Liebell, in an unusually probing and utterly fearless fashion, explores this question, thoroughly reshaping our understanding of the relationship of religion and politics in the United States.Democracy, Intelligent Design, and Evolutionprioritizes science over religion--but it does so in ways that will surprise ‘secularists,’ and likely will earn the grudging respect of politically active religionists. A must-read for anyone interested in civic education in our supposedly ‘post-secular age.’\"—John P. McCormick,University of Chicago\"Susan Liebell has written a wonderful and extraordinarily timely book. Through an uncommonly rich mix of theory, law, and political analysis, she offers a thoughtful and penetrating analysis of the complex role that science plays in democratic politics and civic life. During a time in which science education is a subject of great political debate, we should pay close attention to Liebell's arguments.

She was a featured speaker for the “Life, Death and Beyond” International Conference in Crete, Greece, and is the resident psychic for Clear Channel’s Big Country 97.9FM in Northern Colorado. Her clients include adults and children from all areas of the world, including Australia, Italy, India and the UK. Her purpose is to connect us to our angels, guides and loved ones, and teach us how to access this information on our own. She discovered her gifts through her own tragedy – the passing of her seven-year-old son in March 2007.  She learned her son did not really die. He was still very close, leading her to her incredible mediumship gifts. Sarina works with a collective of Ascended Masters who can see what her clients need and assists in each session.  She has created several mediumship training programs, including one on one mediumship mentoring, long distance training, workshops and webinars to train others to connect with the other side based upon what she has learned from her son and the Ascended Masters.  She holds monthly live events and development workshops demonstrating how we are all connected. Sarina is also the Psychic Investigator Team Lead for Third Eye Paranormal Investigators, a Northern Colorado paranormal team, and educates home and business owners about these “residents” in their space. Sarina’s book about her journey, A Bridge to Healing: J.T.’s Story — A Mother’s Grief Journey and Return to Hope, is available now through all major booksellers.  Her latest book to be released October 2013, A Bridge to Healing: J.T.’s Story Companion Workbook, takes the work she has learned from her son to a new level to teach you what you need to know to have clear connection with your angels, guides and loved ones on the other side. Sarina Baptista is the Bridge to Healing, connecting heart and soul.

I occasionally receive emails from readers ofNo More Secs!Some thank me for writing it and putting into words what they were unable to express. Some say they used it to tell their loved ones what it feels like to have MS. Some tell me they simply feel less alone. After the cancer diagnosis, someone attempted to comfort me by saying, \"Now you'll have more credibility as a health writer.\" That's a bit of credibility I could have lived without. Still, if my story provides a small measure of comfort to one person, it's a story worth telling. I hope you think so, too.", "related": [], "rank": 1607834, "title": "Catch That Look", "author": "Ann Pietrangelo", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That is one of the many biblical lessons that Sarah Coleman points out in Unveiled: What the Bible Says About Women. In today's society, many women are more worried about how hot they look, than how beautiful they are or the grace with which they address the world. Passive sexuality is lingering in every corner of a person's daily life and its proportions are destroying us. As women of grace, discovering beauty, rather than \"hotness,\" ought to be the higher charge of a Christian woman. Sarah also points out that women were saved right along with men when Jesus died and rose again. Unveiled is a very well written and encouraging book for women, but is also a reminder to fathers, husbands, brothers, sons, and all men of what the Bible truly says about women. Christ won freedom for women the same as He did for men, but none ought to abuse that freedom and all need to understand that not all things are beneficial to our faith. Informative, encouraging and accurate Unveiled: What the Bible Says About Women is a great book for daughters, wives, mothers, and women who are searching for their place as a Christian and who need to understand what the freedom that Christ purchased for them means in their lives.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This wonderful book, based on authentic classical texts, is of great importance for those who seek deeper understanding for the sake of the health and peace of their patients and themselves. I am grateful to Master Wu and Dr. Karin Taylor Wu for their inspiration and for opening gateways into the hidden knowledge of the fundamentals of Chinese Medicine --Joan Duveen M.Ac., practitioner and teacher of acupuncture according to the heavenly stems and earthly branchesThis is an excellent portrayal of the philosophy of the Stems and Branches - TianGan DiZhi! It brings a fuller context to the subject for experienced practitioners by investigating each of the 22 characters of the GanZhi through calligraphy, poems from various sources in Chinese literature and cultural artefacts. It also introduces those new to this area of Chinese culture and medicine to exciting concepts that will help to take clinical practice to another dimension. --Sam Patel, Joint Principal, The International College of Oriental MedicineThis beautiful and timely book re-establishes Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches as a central tenet of Chinese philosophy and an intimate part of Chinese medicine, not an optional extra. Liberally illustrated with diagrams and backed by classical quotations, quietly authoritative writers Zhongxian Wu and Karin Taylor Wu share their deep knowledge to produce a kaleidoscopic presentation, bridging the ancient Chinese traditions of medicine, yin yang five phase theory, Yijing studies, cosmology, music and internal alchemy. From star pattern etymology for Chinese characters to practical seasonal advice, from discussion of the application of hidden stems to the complexities of alchemical transformation, this book serves as an essential primer that will be of use to beginner and advanced practitioner alike in the study of the pulsing rhythms of unfolding time. --Peter Firebrace, Past Principal of the International College of Oriental Medicine, co-founder of Monkey Press, acupuncturist, author and teacherThis beautiful and timely book re-establishes Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches as a central tenet of Chinese philosophy and an intimate part of Chinese medicine, not an optional extra.

There is a distinct voice that makes this story what it is and from the onset, I knew it was going to be a good one.A meteor punches through the atmosphere and we meet Julieth, bow and arrows in hand, fleeing a scorched city with the ten-year-old Bayne.  As she meets Ivanus something strangely wonderful happens. Not only can she fly, but Ivanus can help her people. Is this perhaps the winged woman the dark-hearted Samuel is afraid of? The descriptions in the narrative are strong and we can 'feel' Julieth's pain and her sense of mistrust. Already she is a character to root for. Bayne is injured and so she must carry him to safety. This cleverly fulfils the 'pet-the-dog' theme through the first chapter and we can only hope he survives.Toney has cleverly set the scene of devastation, raging battle, ripping explosions and a crumbling city in this opening chapter that will keep readers rooted to the end.  I can't recommend Toney's work more. He never fails to entertain.
