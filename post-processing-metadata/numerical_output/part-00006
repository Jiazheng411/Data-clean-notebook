Most Western works on Eisenstein concentrate on his  silent films of the 1920s, which are routinely taught in  introductory film classes as textbook examples of the montage  style of editing. While this collection discusses the importance  of this technique, which Eisenstein is usually credited with  creating, it seeks to explore the director's later works and  writings in as much depth. LaValley (film studies, Dartmouth)  and Scherr (Russian, Dartmouth) have collected a wide range of  essays, covering topics from the impact of the Orthodox Church  on the director's work to the influence Eisenstein had on  British directors. Several contributions by academics from the  former Soviet Union, as well as many essays by professors of  Russian literature, make this collection valuable to students of  Russian language and literature as well as to the expected  audience of film theorists. This collection will be of use to  academic libraries with a film studies collection and to large  public libraries.

To stagger together through today's column about grammatical possessiveness, you and I must agree on the difference between a gerund and a participle.Take the worddancing. It starts out as a form of a verb: \"Look, Ma, I'mdancing!\" When that word is used as an adjective to modify a noun -- \"look at that dancing bear!\" -- it's called a participle.But when the same word is used as a noun -- \"I see the bear, and itsdancingisn't so hot\" -- then the word is classified as a gerund. (From the Latingerundum, rooted ingerere, \"to bear, to carry,\" because the gerund, though a noun, seems to bear the action of a verb.)We give the same word these different names to tell us what it's doing and what its grammatical needs are. Two great grammarians had a titanic spat in the 1920s over the use of the possessive in this sentence: \"Women having the vote reduces men's political power.\" H. W. Fowler derided what he called \"the fused participle\" as \"grammatically indefensible\" and said it should be \"Women's having\"; Otto Jespersen cited famous usages, urged dropping the possessive and called Fowler a \"grammatical moralizer.\"Comes now Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia with the latest manifestation of this struggle. An Associated Press account of his stinging dissent inLawrence v. Texas,in which the Court struck down that state's anti-sodomy law, quoted Scalia out of context as writing, \"I have nothing against homosexuals,\" which seemed condescending. His entire sentence, though, was not: \"I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means.\"Note the lack of apostrophes afterhomosexualsandgroupto indicate possession; Fowler would have condemned that as a \"fused participle.\" Such loosey-goosey usage from the conservative Scalia, of all people?\"When I composed the passage in question,\" the justice informs me, \"I pondered for some time whether I should be perfectly grammatical and write 'I have nothing against homosexuals', or any other group's, promoting their agenda,' etc. The object of the preposition 'against,' after all, is not 'homosexualswho arepromoting,' but rather 'the promotingof(in the sense ofby) homosexuals.'\"I have tried to be rigorously consistent in using the possessive before the participle,\" Scalia notes, \"when it is the action, rather than the actor, that is the object of the verb or preposition (or, for that matter, the subject of the sentence).\"But what about his passage inLawrence, in which he failed to follow Fowler and fused the participle?\"I concluded that because of the intervening phrase 'or any other group,' writing 'homosexuals' \" -- with the apostrophe indicating possession -- \"(and hence 'any other group's') would violate what is perhaps the first rule of English usage: that no construction should call attention to its own grammatical correctness. Finding no other formulation that could make the point in quite the way I wanted, I decided to be ungrammatical instead of pedantic.\"But his attempt to be a regular guy backfired. In a jocular tone, Scalia observes: \"God -- whom I believe to be a strict grammarian as well as an Englishman -- has punished me. The misquotation would have been more difficult to engineer had there been an apostrophe after 'homosexuals.' I am convinced that in this instance the AP has been (unwittingly, I am sure) theflagellum Deito recall me from my populist, illiterate wandering. (You will note that I did not say 'from me wandering.')\"Mydoes beatmebefore that gerundwandering. Robert Burchfield, editor of the third edition ofFowler's Modern English Usage,writes, \"The possessive with gerund is on the retreat, but its use with proper names and personal nouns and pronouns persists in good writing.\"Now let's parse Scalia's self-parsing. In his refusal to say \"from me wandering,\"wanderingis a gerund. When a personal pronoun comes in front of a gerund, the possessive form is called for: saymy, notme. This avoidance of a fused participle makes sense: you say about the above-mentioned bear \"I likehisdancing,\" not \"I likehimdancing,\" because you want to stress not the bear but his action in prancing about.In Scalia's dissent in the Texas sodomy case,promotingis a gerund, the object of the prepositionagainst. His strict-construction alternative, using apostrophes to indicate possession -- \"against homosexuals', or any other group's, promoting\" -- is correct but clunky. He was right to avoid it, and is wrong to castigate himself for eschewing clunkiness.There would have been another choice, however: put the gerund ahead of the possessors. Try this: \"I have nothing against the promoting of their agenda by homosexuals, or by any other group, through normal democratic means.\" That would not only avoid the confusing apostrophes, but follows \"I have nothing against\" with its true object, the gerundpromoting-- and would make it impossible for any reporter to pull out a condescending \"I have nothing against homosexuals.\"Regarding your proposed solution to my gerundial problem (to wit, \"I have nothing against the promoting of their agenda by homosexuals, or by any other group, through normal democratic means\"): It is so obvious that of course I considered it. Two problems. (1) I do not like to have a relative pronoun preceding its antecedent, as in \"the promoting oftheiragenda by homosexuals.\" (2) More importantly, English remains a language in which emphasis is largely conveyed by word order, and the emphasis in my sentence was uponhomosexuals'promoting, not upon (where your alternative places it) thepromotingby homosexuals. Surely you can sense the difference.Justice Antonin ScaliaSupreme Court of the United StatesWashington, D.C.Copyright © 2004 by The Cobbett Corporation", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In adducing rigorous, empirical evidence regarding how state judicial elections actually operate, thereby busting a number of widely held myths about state judicial elections, Bonneau and Hall have entirely reconstruct our understanding of the state courts of last resort. An empirical tour-de-force that addresses extremely important normative issues of accountability and independence. No student of state or judicial politics can afford to ignore this important book.\"—James L. Gibson,Sidney W. Souers Professor of Government, Washington University in St. Louis\"This is an important book. Bonneau and Hall use a rich body of empirical data to illuminate the functioning of judicial elections and to probe the desirability of electing judges. The questions they raise about widely accepted arguments against judicial elections and the evidence they muster in support of their position are major contributions to the debate over how to select judges.\"—Lawrence Baum,Ohio State University\"Going against the tide, Bonneau and Hall, two leading scholars of state judicial elections, provide a strong argument for retaining this controversial method of judicial selection. The authors effectively debunk reformers’ pretensions and stick empirical fingers in the reformers’ eyes.\"—Stephen L. Wasby, Professor Emeritus, University at Albany, SUNY \"IN DEFENSE is another title in the Routledge series 'Controversies in Electoral Democracy and Representation.' It is a valuable and excellent addition to the literature of state judicial elections; if only for one reason, it empirically demonstrates and strongly argues that opponents of judicial elections are erroneous in their underlying assumptions...IN DEFENSE is a well-written book and very accessible to both scholars and non-scholars...I found it difficult to put down once I began reading it. The authors, while forceful in their condemnations of assumptions behind judicial election opponents' arguments, nevertheless acknowledge that elections are not the perfect panacea to some of the problems identified by judicial reform advocates. They conclude that these problems are not limited to judicial elections alone and that citizens are rightly concerned about all elections for political offices in the United States. Bonneau and Hall posit that there are other alternative solutions better suited for resolving these issues. I agree and strongly recommend the book to every reader concerned about either judicial independence or judicial accountability.\"--Salmon A.

Mikva, is a collection of writings that attempt to explain why the Ten Commandments exert such a powerful hold on so many people--even those who do not consider themselves Jews or Christians. Introduced by Lawrence Kushner, this collection includes essays by 10 prominent rabbis about each individual commandment, as well as two shorter pieces that, in rabbinical fashion, interrogate and locate the others' arguments in Jewish tradition. What all of these essays have in common is the effect of personalizing the commandments for today's readers, by demonstrating the power of this short scriptural passage to touch every aspect of a person's life. Each essay makes provocative and surprising observations. Rabbi Nancy Fuchs-Kreimer, writing on the third commandment, asks, \"By too easily claiming and naming God, by encouraging others to do the same, did I take the name of the Lord in vain?\" Writing on the second commandment, Rabbi Zalman M. Schachter-Shalomi observes, \"Real idolatry today is the worship of money, technology, addictions, absolute political systems--even of 'Judaism' and of the personal ego.\" This is a book that will help readers become more aware of God's claim on their lives, more honest with themselves, and more attuned to the ways that Scripture has shaped the way believers live together and in the wider world.--Michael Joseph Gross", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

BZZZZ! BZZZZ! BZZZZ!An arm emerged from beneath the covers. A hand groped for the alarm.Bap, bap, bap . . . SLAM!The alarm stopped buzzing.Lemuel Gulliver sat up groggily and immediately banged his funny bone against the wall of his tiny sleeping nook.“Ow!” He rubbed his elbow, but he was awake now. Swinging his legs around the side of the bed, he shuffled into his little bathroom and turned on the drippy shower faucet.Moments later, dressed in a dubiously clean T-shirt and wrinkly pants, Gulliver sat down at his small kitchen table and opened the morning paper, theNew York Tribune. He turned directly to the travel section and stared at a small picture at the top of the page. There she was: Darcy Silverman.Darcy had her own column: “Darcy Silverman’s Out and About.” She’d written today’s column about her trip to Mumbai. Gulliver had never been to Mumbai. In fact, he hadn’t really ever traveled anywhere to speak of, but that didn’t stop him from reading every word of Darcy’s columns. At last he tore his gaze from the pretty, intelligent face in the picture, swilled down the last sip of his bad coffee, slung hisNew York Tribunepress badge around his neck, and headed out the door.Gulliver hurried down the front steps of his shabby apartment building. Out on the street the tall Manhattan skysCRapers towered above him, making him feel small and insignificant—as usual. He trudged into his corner deli to order his breakfast sandwich.“Hey, Kenny, how ya doin’?” said a burly construction worker standing behind Gulliver.“Terrific, Mac! What’ll it be today?” replied the deli cook. He hadn’t noticed Gulliver, who had gotten there first. Gulliver was too short to see over the top of the ordering counter.“Let me get twenty-eight bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches!” said the construction worker.“Right away, buddy!” said the deli clerk. “That oughtta clean us out of sandwiches for the rest of the morning!”Gulliver sighed and walked out of the deli with his shoulders slumped.As he approached theNew York Tribunebuilding, dozens of people streamed past him, hurrying to get to work. He entered the cool, vaulted lobby, where a large group of reporters, editors, and other professional-looking people clumped in front of the elevators. They all got onto elevators going up. Gulliver stepped into the only elevator heading down.Later that morning Gulliver sat in his small, airless work area, studying a piece of paper. Behind him was a bulletin board packed with photos, many of them CRacked and faded. ACRoss the desk from him sat a young, impatient-looking man.“Your name’s Dan?” asked Gulliver.“Yeah. Like it says on my resume,” he replied drily. “Which you’re looking right at.”“What do you hope to get out of working in the mail room?” asked Gulliver, affable as ever.Dan stared at Gulliver. “What do I hope to get out of working in the mail room? I hope to get out of working in the mail room as soon as possible!”“You’ve got sass. I like that,” said Gulliver. “You’re hired! Welcome to the team.” He held up his fist for Dan to bump back with his own fist.Dan just blinked at him. “I wasalreadyhired. Not by you, either.”Gulliver leaped up. “First thing we must accomplish today is to—”“Deliver the mail to the departments that need mail delivered to them?” snapped Dan.“No! We must document your first day on the job!” Gulliver grabbed Dan and pulled him closer, then took out his iPhone and snapped a picture of the two of them. The printer spat out the photo and Gulliver bounded over to it and tacked the picture up on his bulletin board.Dan stared at the dozens of pictures. “Wow. How long have youbeenhere?”“Ten years,” said Gulliver proudly. He pulled the mail cart out from where it had been stashed and patted it affectionately. “All the great thinkers started out in the mail room,” he added.Dan stared at Gulliver in disbelief.“If this noble steed could talk, can you imagine the places she has been?” asked Gulliver.“Up and down the hallways of theNew York Tribune?”“Exactly!” said Gulliver. “Now . . . let’s go deliver some mail!”As Gulliver and Dan pushed the cart through the bustling corridors, Gulliver tossed piles of mail into various offices and toward different desks with pizzazz—behind-the-back passes, layups, alley-oops. Unfortunately the mail missed its targets more often than not, sailing over in-boxes, even hitting an assistant in the side of the head.“Sorry!” shouted Gulliver cheerfully as he turned a corner . . . and stopped outside the office of a powerful editor.Gulliver tiptoed quietly into the office and placed the pile of mail on the corner of the polished desk. “Your mail, sir,” he said deferentially, and began walking backward out the door.“Hey!” said Dan, addressing the editor behind the desk. “You’re Harold Jones, right?”Gulliver’s mouth fell open at Dan’s boldness.“Why, yes,” said the editor, looking over the top of his glasses to address Dan.“I just want to say that I loved your piece on the failure of the derivative market. Terrific stuff,” said Dan.“Well, thanks very much,” said the editor.Dan thrust out his hand. “Dan Quint. New mail guy.”The editor stood up and shook Dan’s hand. “I look forward to seeing you around,” he said with a smile.Gulliver seemed to have lost the power of speech during this whole exchange, but as soon as he and Dan had rounded the next corner, he pulled Dan aside.“What are you doing, man?” he whispered. “Mail room guys are not on the same level as these people! We’re thelittle people!”“I don’t want to be one of the little people,” said Dan, looking scornfully at Gulliver.“Who does? Hey, I’ve got some plans of my own too. Done some writing samples over the years and stuff. But you can’t talk to these people like that; you have to respect their work space.”“You’re just scared of them,” Dan said.“Nah, it’s not like that,” said Gulliver as they continued around the next corner. “It’s just that . . .” He gulped on his words, then suddenly stopped short. Dan followed Gulliver’s gaze.A pretty, intelligent-looking woman was leaning over her desk. A halo of fluorescent light bathed her in an ethereal glow. She stood back up and faced the other person in her office, a handsome, CRaggy-looking man wearing an interesting overcoat that clearly came from some exotic place far away.“Thank you for considering me for the travel writing position,” the man was saying. He had an unusual accent, perhaps Australian. “I hope you enjoy these sample articles I’ve done. If you have any trouble reaching me, it may be because I’m in the midst of ascending one of the higher peaks in the Himalayas.” He smiled broadly, flashing bright white teeth.“Thanks, Nigel,” said the woman. It was Darcy Silverman, the travel columnist. “As soon as I’ve made a decision I will let you know.”As the man brushed past the mail cart without a glance, Darcy smiled at Gulliver. “Hey, Lemuel. Got any mail for me?”Gulliver stammered something unintelligible, then started fumbling through the mail cart.“Hi!” said Dan, bounding forward to shake Darcy’s hand. “I’m Dan from the mail room. I’ll do whatever it takes to not be from the mail room!”“Dan’s just kidding,” said Gulliver, who had finally found his voice. But it came out in a high, nervous squeak. “And he doesn’t mean to bother you.”“He’s not bothering me.” Darcy laughed. “Nice to meet you, Dan. I’ll see you guys later.”As they wheeled away from the travel section offices, Dan smirked at Gulliver. “So how long have you had a debilitating CRush on the travel editor?”“Who? Me? CRush? On Darcy? Nah,” said Gulliver. “I mean, maybe she has a CRush on me, but . . . hey!”Dan had grabbed Gulliver’s iPhone. Now he sCRolled to a photo of Darcy, which Gulliver had taken on the sly one day. “Why don’t you just ask her out?” he asked.Gulliver shrugged. “I can ask her out whenever I want. It’s no big deal. It would just take me, like, five seconds. I could do it anytime.”“So do it.”“Next time I see her, I will!” said Gulliver.The elevator doors opened and they rolled the cart in. Just as the doors were about to close, Darcy stepped in.“Well! Hello again!” she said.“Gotta go!” said Dan, and with a big wink at Gulliver, he jumped out just before the doors closed again.Gulliver found himself alone with Darcy.“So how’s the day going?” asked Darcy brightly.“You know,” muttered Gulliver without looking up from the floor.“What are you doing this weekend?”“Bunch of stuff.”“Cool.”“Yeah. Cool,” he replied.“Well, have a good one,” said Darcy as ...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Popularized in the 1980s by The One Minute Manager and in the 1990s by Who Moved My Cheese, the fable is a short story about a business challenge told in narrative style. Typically, such books offer a quick read while teaching a valuable management lesson.Walter Geer's What Lucy Taught Us does a fine job of representing the fable style. Instead of concentrating on general management, however, Geer pinpoints business process. More often than not, business process is a painfully boring subject to read about, but Geer's fable presents readers with a refreshingly different alternative.To dramatize the problems associated with business process, the author draws on a classic episode of the old television show, I Love Lucy, in which Lucy and her friend Ethel work in a candy factory and find themselves overwhelmed by the production line. Geer writes, \"Its famous scene of Lucy and Ethel frantically wrapping candy (and missing quite a few!) resonates even more today as businesses struggle with productivity, efficiency, and the need to do more with less.\"Geer proceeds to weave a tale about a new vice president of operations at a medical products company who is faced with the challenge of bringing together disparate parts of the organization. The manager is embroiled in personalities and politics while being pressured by his boss to make improvements rapidly. He turns to a colleague, who agrees to help by facilitating a meeting with the manager's direct reports. Geer ingeniously integrates the I Love Lucy episode as part of the facilitator's solution to the problem.The president and CEO of the CA Group, a consulting organization, Geer does an excellent job of painting a picture of the company's problems. His descriptions of each character are finely drawn so as to make them believable. He provides touches of humor and drama to give the fable realism. The introduction of the facilitator into the fable makes the point that business process problems are not always easy to solve from the inside; sometimes an objective outside perspective is required. Ultimately, the point of the story is that people in an organization usually understand their own part of the process, but not necessarily how it fits into the overall process. Often, the process itself is inefficient and needs to be corrected.Managers in companies large and small will be able to relate to the story and take something away. The story's universal message makes it relevant to any type of business. The simple eight-step process improvement model included at the end of the fable gives managers a valuable tool to apply to their own situations.What Lucy Taught Us is a business book that, despite its short length, is likely to have a large and lasting impact on readers. --Barry Silverstein, ForeWord Clarion Reviews Barry Silverstein,", "related": [], "rank": 1924473, "title": "What Lucy Taught Us", "author": "Walter Geer", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Compton-Burnett suffered several losses after her father - her closest brother died three years later, three more of her younger siblings and her mother passed away by the time she was 35, something she rarely spoke about, but constantly visited in her novels.Compton-Burnett published twenty novels.  However, the first of her works to use her mature and original style was published when she was forty, in 1925. Compton-Burnett's fiction is often said to be Edwardian in setting - the domestic occurences in large households. She never married and lived in London as companion to Margaret Jourdain.

It's not\nreally a mix that works well most of the time, but author Jennifer Marko\n is comfortable with an oar in both ponds. It was refreshing to find a\nbona fide horror tale without all the gore that normally accompanies\nthem. The storytelling itself adds the horror factor, and that's not\neasy to do. In fact, it very much reminded me of The Bachman Books\ncollection, where author Stephen King was writing under a pseudonym.The\n descriptions of the setting, in an almost hidden town of northern\nOntario, are great. I felt drawn into that dark place more than once.\nAlthough Loveless is appropriate for young adults and has many of the\nkeystone elements of that genre, it's also an enjoyable read for adults.\n It should find successes once published and I hope to see more titles\nfrom Marko moving forward.\"John Breeden II - authonomy.com user review\"Thank for this exciting piece of work. I like people who books which\nfeature small town, little unknown people/communities, because such\nentities are always left taken to be irrelevant. The world want\nhear/listen/read about Nelson Mandela, Bill Chriton, Barack Obama and\nthe forth.

Rustin develops a compelling argument that neuroscience can teach us much about the development of self and, more specific to psychotherapeutic relationships, the development of self with other. This concept is applicable to all who work in relationship with their clients. . . . We recommend this book to those seeking a better understanding of the brain basis for matters significant to therapeutic endeavors (e.g., affect regulation, trauma).” (PsycCritiques)“[A] rare treat . . .” (Somatic Psychotherapy Today)“The author writes warmly and clearly in the first person, and focuses on storytelling about individual therapists' relationships with a few patients. . . . It is a vital book for practicing therapists trained in a traditional mode.” (Book News)“A beautifully written book . . . refreshingly clear. Rustin’s treatment of aspects of bodily experience, such as memory, fear, and mirror neurons, has much to teach us. The book is full of rich clinical examples in which she shares her own experiences as a therapist.” (Beatrice Beebe, PhD, Clinical Professor of Psychology in Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University)“Written with the utmost respect for both subjective and scientific data, Rustin’s timely book recognizes the hybrid nature of psychotherapy. Her synthesis of essential findings from infant research and neuroscience with psychotherapy and psychoanalysis is clear enough to introduce the novice, yet clinically rich and sophisticated enough to inform the understanding and practice of highly knowledgeable clinicians.” (Kenneth A. Frank, PhD, Director of Training, National Institute for the Psychotherapies, New York, NY)“Judith Rustin shares her journey to integrate concepts from infant research and neuroscience into her clinical practice. With detailed and specific examples and references to relevant research she shows how more explicit awareness of subtle implicit processes can lead to enhanced clinical interventions.” (Christina Sekaer MD, PhD, Faculty, William Alanson White Institute)", "related": [], "rank": 180174, "title": "Infant Research & Neuroscience at Work in Psychotherapy: Expanding the Clinical Repertoire (Norton Professional Books (Hardcover))", "author": "Judith Rustin", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He wrote a number of novels and short stories under the name Fred M. White, including the six Doom of London science-fiction stories, in which various catastrophes beset London. They include a massive killer smog, diphtheria, and a sudden and deep winter with paralyzing snow and ice. Not exactly the uplifting types of stories. Starting out at age 43, he wrote almost 90 books (novels and short stories) in the following 34 years (up until 1930). A list of his writing shows that he published 8 stories in 1908, one of which is the instant book, and 5 in 1930, the last year any data on him appears. Other than his prolific science-fiction and mystery writing ability this publisher was unable to discover anything else about Mr. White, giving rise to what may be the best mystery that Mr. White has created. The only information available about him is the fact that he was born in 1859, plus a list of the books he has written. Nothing else. No date of death. No details of his life. Every source our research department located merely listed his life statistic as “1859 –  ? .” Coincidentally, White was born in the same year as Arthur Conan Doyle, and White’s writing appeared in the Strand Magazine, most probably in competition with Sherlock Holmes. It may be theorized that he was writing under an assumed name, or that he is still alive, but if that is so, he would rank right up there with Elvis Presley, for whom there is at least a periodic ‘sighting.’", "related": ["B008UWBJB4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Originally interested purely in acting, Adam developed a hankering for writing and stand-up comedy in his 30s.

One of the results was 'I touch Myslef' by the Divinyls...\"  And then he goes on to sing the song \"I touch Myself\" but he inserts the word \"myslef\" for \"myself\".  Depending on what audience you were part of, you may or may not have had the steak that night. Adam has appeared in such films as Pleasantville and Lancelot: Guardian of Time, but those were made, like, 15 years ago and hasn't done much since.  He's tried, he just hasn't gotten any gigs in a while.  One of the reasons he started writing.  His sister took pity on him and allowed him to become a frequent contributing writer of the her award-winning Chicago website, thelocaltourist.com, while he was fumbling around with scripts and short stories that went nowhere. If it weren't for her generosity, he would've had more time to focus on that family-oriented TV pilot and could've really done something by now. His love of wordplay inspired him to write his first book, Unfinished Poetry.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There are excellent new sections on nurturing, responsive parenting and on the many sides of positive discipline. The new chapter on Why and How Children Come to Accept our Rules will give parents a fresh view of this often tumultuous area. Major sections on child and parent temperament have been streamlined to give you much needed insight into how the temperaments of a particular child and his or her parents work together (for or against each other) to set the tone for harmony or discord that can last a lifetime. The authors developed and standardized questionnaires to measure both how parents view a child’s temperament and how they view their own. From these measures, descriptions of various personality types are used to explain behavior resulting from certain traits. Parents who participated in the standardization were amazed at how accurate the profiles are and what can be learned to ease the parenting task. Oprah Winfrey should put Parenting by Temperament on her “Must Read” list for every parent.Marcia LasswellProfessor Emeritus in Psychology, Past President of the AmericanAssociation of Marriage and Family Therapy", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The following years were filled with minimal writing, mostly on spiral notebooks in the days before personal computers. Then, in 1992, Kathryn decided to get serious. \"Your writing can either be a hobby or it can be who you are. Make your choice.\" That was some advice she received from an established author. So she made a choice; she was going to make writing who she was. Historical fiction was her passion and she learned everything she could about it. Kathryn's Medieval Historicals have been called 'amazing' and 'character-rich'. She believes that total immersion in a time period and a subject is essential to create the perfect story. It's all a formula, like a mathematical equation: First, you need a great title. It sets the mood. Then, you need the perfect hero and heroine. Give your people flaws, because real people have flaws. And then hammer out the most interesting, touching and romantic story you can.  Although Kathryn's passion is her Medievals, she is very prolific and proficient at writing her Contemporary Adventure Romances. Those are her most popular books and she has five of them to date, including three that are in a series, that are her best sellers. Her objects of interest? Biblical Relics, Egypt and the mysterious jungles of the Yucatan to name a few. Her heroines are strong, intelligent and beautiful, and her heroes are usually tall, dark, very handsome and VERY big. You'll notice that. Kathryn doesn't have a hero in her contemporary novels under six feet four inches. But, just like her Historicals, the Contemporary novels are extensively researched and written with great thought and detail. One of her novels, Lady of Heaven, is currently being adapted into a screenplay. Kathryn has been described as a reader's writer - she knows what readers like and she writes from the heart. Read Kathryn Le Veque's novels and fall in love again... and again... and again.... Kathryn is the author of 21 novels and counting.", "related": ["B008BIXFPU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 40, "rating_average": 4.325, "rating_total": 173.0}

The fisherman's wife is dissatisfied with her husband's wish for a good catch and sends him back to wish for first wealth and then power. Unhappy with both, she wants to become a god. Paddling out into the black water of an angry sea, the fisherman calls out one final time to the turtle, who asks what the man wants for himself and grants it. He returns to his hut to find his wife a stone statue, like the other Aztec gods. Aviles uses acrylics and liquid watercolor, as well as motifs from Aztec art, in the brightly patterned illustrations. She changes the placid, blue-green sea in the opening pages to a truly frightful place at the end. Kimmel reminds readers that \"the great turtle still swims in the sea\" and asks what they might wish for. Pair this story with Margaret Read MacDonald'sThe Old Woman Who Lived in a Vinegar Bottle(August House, 1997) or a version of the Grimm brothers' \"The Fisherman and His Wife\" for an interesting exploration of the same folktale in different cultures.—Mary Jean Smith, Southside Elementary School, Lebanon, TNCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Both parties tend to live a nomadic lifestyle and, of\ncourse, both are known to do most of their dealings at night. Even Bram Stoker,\nthe brains behind Dracula as we know him today, was the Lyceum Theatre's\nbusiness manager for over 25 years.Barber's latest murder-mystery novel,Downstage Dead,revolves\naround a Stratford Festival production of Count Dracula. The production is\nturned on its head after the murders of the playwright's sister and another\nmember of the acting troupe. But Barber is quick to point out none of the characters are\ntrue creatures of the night.\"There are no real vampires in the book, though 'real' vampires is a\nfunny phrase,\" said Barber. \"But because a play is being done -Count Dracula- the\nlore, the atmosphere is all there.\"Downstage Deadis a follow-up to 1993'sThe Bloody Manand\n1995'sThe Running Girl. Those books were penned by Barber and another author\nunder the pen name \"Bevan Amberhill.\" So why come out of the writer's closet now?\"It's fun for me to have my name on it, I always wanted it\nthere...everyone does,\" he said, explaining it was his co-author who preferred\nto remain anonymous. Though this is the first book in the series he's tackled\nsolo, Barber was up for the challenge.\"The basic plots for the first two books were generated by me,\" he\nexplained. \"I started on some notes for a third, but then I went through a period where I\nasked myself 'Do I want to do this? Can I do this on my own?'\" (His co-author had decided to exit the series, but encouraged Barber to continue with it.)In the end, Barber decidedDownstage Deadwas something he did want to pursue. He used some notes he had compiled for another novel to be\nbased around the theatre and vampires. The actual writing process took under a\nyear to complete, however, it was a challenge for Barber to find a publisher. The first two novels had been published by the Mercury\nPress. Due to relocation and restructuring of the company, they weren't\ninterested in publishing the third book in the series.\"I did some rewrites and tinkered with it and I was finally\nable to get another publisher,\" he said.That publisher, Stratford-based Pasdeloup Press, usually\nfocuses on art and poetry books, but were willing to take a chance onDownstage\nDead. Barber had collaborated with Pasdeloup Press founder Virgil Burnett on\nseveral projects, including the anthologyHabaneras. Barber's book of poetry,The Liquid Hour, was also published by Pasdeloup.In fact, Burnett's sketches are featured throughout the\nbook, drawings first created for an amateur theatre production of Count Dracula\nstaged in Stratford over a decade ago. Barber said he was happy to include them\nas they serve the text \"very, very well.\" BeforeDownstage Deadwent to press, Barber revisited his\ntext, making the ties to Stratford stronger. He admits setting the story in the\ncity he's lived for so many years has an element of danger to it, having to be\ncareful not to model the characters after people he knows.\"You can't go into lazy mode when it gets difficult - that's\nfor the biography\" he said, with a laugh.One character is based on a \"dear friend\" who has passed\naway. Barber is confident if his friend was still around, he would be in serious\ntrouble because of the character. \"I wish very much he was here to disapprove\nof it.\"Currently Barber is busy promoting the book and expects an\nofficial launch to be held at Fanfare Books in the spring. He will also speak\nat the Library's noon book club on April 5. Though busy with other work, Barber\nsaid he has about twenty short stories in circulation to prospective publishers at any given time. He has not\nyet decided whether there will be another book in the series. Still in love with Stratford after all the years he has\nlived here, Barber gives much credit to the city and the people who live in it\nfor inspiring him and his writing.\"Without Stratford, without the people I know and have met,\nthis book simply would not exist,\" he said. \"I am grateful for that.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Yet, despite the reverence, almost awe, that he acquired from his bibliomaniac father, for scholarship, for having the wisdom of the ages on a bookshelf nearby, Neil did not pursue a scholarly career. Rather he got a degree in engineering, and spent 15 years in hard labor, doing penance for that misdeed, compelled to build rockets, and nose cones for missiles, and nuclear fuel for fun and corporate profits. Then, one day came that ah-ha moment in the turmoil of a mid-life crisis, when he realized that engineers do all that they do with only ten numbers, arranged in a variety of ways; whereas there are twenty six letters, meaning that there must be at least 2.6 times more ways to combine letters than numbers, maybe more. And from that day on, his interests turned to the theatre, the written word, and the spoken word. He served, for a period of 20 years, on the board of the Play- wrights' Center of San Francisco, which produced, during that time, more than 1,000 concert-staged readings of original plays. It was inevitable that he would eventually return to the passion of his youth, historical research. He set out, one day, to find the famous Uncle Fred, his great grandmother's brother, who, his father said, had two towns in the country named after him. This book is the result of that search. He still lives in the Silicon Valley with a house full of books, a patient wife, and an overbearing cat.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The best way to answer is it that I'm all of my female characters in one way or another. Somewhat of a brat, independent, mouthy, and not as submissive as I probably should be (which accounts for the reason I'm always in the hot seat here at home). John and I have been actively involved in D&S; since our first date when I got sassy with him. It was pure heaven to finally meet a man who wasn't afraid to say 'no' and follow through on his threats. Poor guy. Or maybe, poor me. Either way, we met our perfect match and, to this day, 8 years later, we are still very much in love and very much in lust! My characters, inspirations, etc.... I write what I know. With few exceptions, my scenarios are pulled from either personal experience or observation. I've served overseas as an Intell Specialist in the USMC, work as a nurse, and have degrees in Biology (pre-med) and a masters in Psych. Specialty? Deviant behavior and alternative lifestyles, of course. I put all of this together and try to bring about a fun, unique and, hopefully, thought provoking reading experience. In regard to the D&S; scene, I performed as a switch for several years, trying to discover the 'inner' submissive hidden within. During that time, I discovered many things about myself and those I interacted with. The psychology of the lifestyle appealed to me with all the questions that came with it. I learned quickly that it was perfectly appropriate to ask questions. It was also perfectly appropriate if there were no answers. D&S; lifestyle is a process of growth and, much like the age-play elements, requires trust, communication and direction from all involved. John describes his 'job' as my Dom is to be my husband, best friend, confidant, brother, father and teacher. John helped me find myself. That's the foundation of D&S; and the basis of all my writings. My newest release, Guardian Domination , is based on how he found my inner submissive and trained her to be who I am today.", "related": ["B00FQN0H5Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 17, "rating_average": 4.1765, "rating_total": 71.0}

I feel like we actually got in on the big secret. I loved the hype how it was all brought to the big battle between Demarko and Blaze against Slaine and Deklan.In Revelation, Demarko and Blaze are being told the story of Woody and Lady Red. They learn their whole story as they ran the kingdom and loved their people. They were very respectful and treated those in their kingdom well they felt it was the best way to run their Kingdom.However, once the story is complete it leaves Demarko and Blaze wondering and thinking and soon they meet up behind the back of Slaine.Their memories have come back and now they know whats been going on in the Kingdom and the rules they really play instead of what they have been lead to believe. They find out they have been lied to for quite some time and that they have powers beyond anyone's beliefs.They are now a force to be reckoned with, Slain and his brother, Deklan are in for it.Revelation was full of suspense and passion, kept me wanting more the whole way through. I sooo hope amBear Shellea writes more, I would love to read more about these characters and many more. It took a lot of imagination and thought to come up with a story like this.

However, they also suggest that not all Islamist-based terrorism is necessarily linked to the 'global jihad' and that therefore the solutions to it are not dependent on a 'global war on terrorism.' Instead, the authors—correctly in my view—stress the importance of local solutions for local problems, a commonsense approach useful to policymakers not just in Thailand, but in the rest of the terrorism-wracked world as well.

Rogers fills the gap somewhat with this journalistic biography of Ernesto Cortes, a grass-roots leader who teaches Latinos how to use the political system. A man who combines religion and secular ideology, Cortes is doing for the Latino communities nationally what Jesse Jackson did in Chicago a decade earlier. The book effectively captures the flavor of the movement in small, rural locales and in major urban centers, conveying Cortes's ideology and energy, as well as the issues close to the Latino heart. A welcome look at minority politics in the 1990s. Recommended for all libraries.- Roderic A.

We're plunged into the messy life and emotions of Declan, the young man trying to escape his difficult background on a Belfast estate by building a career working with horses. [Wilkinson's] human characters are rounded and utterly real, but the most fascinating character is Folly, the nervous, damaged horse that Declan rescues from abject neglect.  Folly's story runs parallel to that of Cian, a young boy already dabbling in drugs, alcohol and crime. Can Declan help either of them? Their stories are compelling, heart-breaking and truly shocking.   I'd recommend Grounded and taking Flight to absolutely any reader, and I can't wait to see what Sheena Wilkinson comes up with next.  She reminds me of K M Peyton, one of the most successful children's writers of our time.'

Ill health interrupted his formal education at Edinburgh University and plagued him throughout his life. Leading a bohemian existence during his twenties and thirties, his travels throughout Europe formed the basis of his first two books,An Inland Voyage(1878) andTravels With a Donkey(1879). In 1875 he settled into the artists colony at Barbizon and began writing for English magazines. There he met Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne, a married woman ten years his senior, with whom he fell in love. In 1879 he followed her to San Francisco (which gave rise toAn Amateur Emigrant). After she obtained a divorce, they married and for the next eight years traveled a great deal in Europe and America in search of good health. Stevenson remained industrious and during this period wroteTreasure Island(1883), his first popular success.Dr. Jekyll and Mr. HydeandKidnappedappeared in 1886, followed byThe Black Arrowin 1888.

After that book’s tremendous success, he was able to write full-time and moved back to Europe, eventually settling in Montreaux, Switzerland. Among his other notable books arePale Fire(1962) andAda(1969). In addition to his writing, he was a noted entomologist specializing in butterflies.

Out in space, when things are blown up, it leaves a lot of loose debris floating around. Many mining companies doing the blowing up sometimes don't or can't clean up the mess, usually not quick enough to suit the authorities anyway. That's where Ted and Roger Rustred, the owners of Dustup Incorporated come in. Their job is to clean up the clutter for a price, by vacuuming up dirt and debris in space, using ships that are giant space vacuums. After a while, the company is doing well enough for them to hire their cousin Bert. But, Bert and Dustup 3, the company's newest spaceship go missing while on a routine cleanup job. Ted and Roger, with the help of an ex-marine and a local space cop on leave, set out to find him and their lost ship. Along the way, they discover a plot to use the ship to rob an earthbound cargo vessel and then frame a dead Bert and Dustup 3 for the crime.Dustup is a well written and thought out story, combining futuristic technology with suspense, mystery, adventure and humor. The characterization of the two Rustred brothers, Ted and Roger, is first rate. The secondary players, both good and bad, are also well done. The plot is simple but enjoyable. Mr. Michaels uses a mixture of third and first person, but does so in a manner that takes nothing away from the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a creative and inventive space adventure tale.", "related": [], "rank": 3653243, "title": "Dustup eBook", "author": "Robert Michaels", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

By always challenging the status quo and connecting ideas from different fields, Steve Moya has been able to guide groups to new and better outcomes. His experience and knowledge comes from a background that includes the corporate, entrepreneurial, public, and consulting fields, and companies and entities that include Univision; the Los Angeles City Council; Moya, Villanueva and Associates; and Humana Inc. Born in East Los Angeles into a family that immigrated to the United States in the late 1920s, he has firsthand knowledge of the challenges that Latinos and other populations face in their efforts to advance. He has supported the community through involvement with Latino organizations in areas as diverse as political empowerment, literacy, policy research, the arts, and many educational initiatives. What distinguishes Moya's writing is his critical thinking, which builds from his expertise in change management, strategy development, trend analysis, communications, marketing, and situational analysis and planning. His view is that the world is becoming increasingly competitive, and those that advance (whether people or companies) can't simply do things slightly better-they must find new ways to meet the demands of the marketplace and society. While this may be easier for organizations, all individuals can work at this and improve their lives. Take the use of social networks: in low-income neighborhoods, people can connect either electronically or personally with neighbors to tap expertise, share resources, exchange services, and build skills to fill the gaps in their lives and create opportunities for their children.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In\nthese cases I must admit that my opinion may trump Detective Friday's assertion\nto stick to the facts.The Bill of Rights is often thought of as a list of our\nindividual rights, but in actuality, the amendments that make up the Bill of\nRights are limitations placed on government powers. Thanks to the forethought\nof our Founding Fathers, and the many wives and mothers, like Abigail Adams and\nMartha Washington, who played active roles in shaping government policy, we\nhave a living document that protects our rights and helps preserve our nation.Of course, the Bill of Rights is only valuable when citizens\nunderstand it and expect their government to respect its commandments.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although she never found the boots, she eventually replaced them and moved on.       Tessa’s interest in life out West led her to the tiny town of Alpine, Texas where she attended her first Cowboy Poetry Gathering. Impressed with the plethora of poets at the gathering and shocked that the term “Cowboy Poetry” wasn’t an oxymoron, Tessa began writing her Dream Catchers trilogy: Last Chance Texas, released in  2012; Stars Over Texas, an October 2013 release; and Storms Over Texas, a 2014 release. Tessa’s women’s fiction novel Texas Sunset is not part of the trilogy but like the others, it contains a Texas theme.  Many of Tessa’s settings will be recognized by residents of Alpine. The first in the trilogy, Last Chance Texas, opens within the wrought iron gates of the beautiful Alpine Angels Cemetery. To ensure authenticity in her novels, the author includes favorite local hangouts such as Penny’s Diner and the famous Reata restaurant. Tessa is a member of the Romance Writers of America, The Dallas Area Romance Authors, The Yellow Rose Chapter of RWA, The Texas Mountain Trailwriters, and is a regular contributor to the blog: Smart Girls Read Romance.

One of the best presentations of the Church's social teaching. Brandon Vogt adeptly and correctly positions social justice in relation to the lives of the saints and in doing so rescues it from the ideological constraints that have for far too long made this essential teaching of the Church inaccessible to most of the faithful. Social justice is not simply a theory, but a whole way of life, revealed in all its radical and saving grace in the lives of the Church's saints.\" --Very Reverend Robert E. Barron, Rector of Mundelein Seminary and founder of Word on Fire Catholic MinistriesIn this book, Brandon Vogt situates the principles of Catholic Social Teaching within the venerable Catholic spiritual tradition by presenting these principles within the details of the actual lives of the saints. Each description becomes as vivid as a stained-glass window as it illustrates how each saint lived out the Gospel, and then it presents us with concrete lessons we can learn today. This presentation will easily lead the reader to reflection and then to action. I highly recommend Saints and Social Justice as a rich resource for your spiritual reading. --Father Larry Snyder, President of Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA)Incredibly accessible: Brandon Vogt brings Catholic social teaching to life through the actions and examples of the saints. As we cannot commit to what we do not understand, this book opens minds and hearts to connect faith with personal action.

This is\naccompanied by refreshingly honest accounts of what to expect within the\n first year of a PR career.At the end of each chapter there are\nrelevant contributions from people within the industry.  These comments\nare mostly a welcome addition to the book. They support Stimson’s themes\n within the named chapters by providing more in-depth views and opinions\n of how these themes occur within the industry.However, one\nmajor criticism I have of this book is that these comments often overlap\n with each other. This results in frequent repetition, which can be a\nlittle tiresome.Nonetheless, Stimson’s conversational style made\nthe book an overall effortless read.  There are also clearly labelled\nparts and chapters that make referring back to sections easy, without\nhaving to re-read unrelated chapters.How To Get A Job In PR is\nthe go-to-guide for starting a career in PR and should be in the hands\nof every future PR practitioner.(PR Week, Dec 2013)", "related": [], "rank": 2838445, "title": "How to get a job in PR eBook", "author": "Sarah Stimson", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A relentless plot, evocative prose and compelling (and wrenching) portraits of the characters, good and evil, conspire to make this a must-read. And I have two words for hero Max Wolfe: More. Soon.\" Jeffery Deaver \"Has all the ingredients and more: great plotting, great characters and at least two eye-widening twists I didn't see coming.\" Sophie Hannah \"It's a brilliant crime novel, a thrilling procedural. Max Wolfe is a wonderfully endearing character, smart and tough and vulnerable, and with Scout (and Stan too) Tony has created so much warmth and tenderness, in a world, a genre, so often devoid of it. His research is wide, deep, impeccable - from forensics to the psychology, procedure to protocol. And boy does he know how to create suspense, and convincing plot lines, which snake and weave, and surprise right until the very end. This is a complex, shocking, very contemporary story, told with utter conviction and authority. I was hooked from page one. Crime writing has brilliant new star.\" Henry Sutton \"Tony Parsons has fashioned a fiendishly plotted, chilling and unexpectedly moving thriller. The Murder Bag is pacy and passionate, often beautifully written, with a genuinely surprising final twist. Detective Max Wolfe has just the right balance of compassion and rage.
