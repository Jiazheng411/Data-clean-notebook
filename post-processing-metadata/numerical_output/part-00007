A scandal involving untoward behavior by her father has landed the unhappily overweight Molly without money or connections in an out-of-the-way English suburb. A dirty old man, stationer Mr. Roberts, takes stern pity on her and offers Molly a room above his shop in exchange for some shelving work, albeit with \"conditions.\" The latter include climbing a ladder and spinning stories about her life while Mr. Roberts gropes her ample calves. Molly obliges with more and more elaborate dissembling, which will catch up with her just as she manages to make a few friends in the neighborhood: Miranda, the similarly weight-battling haircutter across the street whose habit of trading compliments with Molly is suspect; attractive, sweet, delusional Tim, who thinks he's a secret agent; and lonely-hearts librarian Liz, who urges Molly to readThe Story of Oto build character. Salway's characters are deeply estranged from the mainstream and too calculating to be sympathetic, except perhaps Mr. Roberts, married to a Frenchwoman whose attractiveness overtaxes his poor, dirty heart. Salway's book is a frustrating study in the intimate layering of deception.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

That is who they were. Little Ozark farm people. Little House® people. This book, Laura Ingalls' Friends Remember Her, is by and about Ozarkers.  Dan L. White and his family settled in the Ozarks some years ago about 12 miles up the road from Laura's Rocky Ridge Farm. There they live on a forty acre Ozark farmstead, with cows, horses, chickens, goats, blackberries, black walnuts, ticks and chiggers. In this book Dan talks with other down home folks in the Ozarks who were close friends of Laura and Almanzo and gives us a view of the Little House® lady from her own kind - the Little House® kind of people.

This story was written during the time frame based on operations with the Hawaii Air National Guard's F-15A/B Eagle fleet. Particular F-15s such as 76-0120 or 77-0077 are actual airframes that belonged to the 199th Fighter Squadron. Other weapons and capabilities are, in fact, very real. Only the characters and story are fictional.I will say that finding accurate information on the RC-135 Rivet Joint capabilities was extremely difficult due to its classified nature. Therefore, the abilities described in this book are entirely fictional. This is also true for the Chinese J-10 multi-role fighter and its defensive systems.As for the Hawaii Air National Guard, the 199th Fighter Squadron is the only ANG fighter unit charged with the unique and sole responsibility of defending an entire state from enemy air attack. The fleet of F-15s that the squadron has used has normally been limited to fewer than twenty aircraft.Additionally, the aircraft are all products of the late 1970's. They were some of the last F-15A models produced and are some of the oldest operating F-15As in the entire USAF fleet. Fortunately, all have been upgraded under the Multi Stage Improvement Program (MSIP) and have very modern avionics and up to date weapons systems.The Squadron's maintenance personnel also do an outstanding job of keeping their aircraft in incredible condition. During several overseas deployments, the 199th was able to keep up a 100% mission capable rate, thanks to the unit's dedicated maintenance troops.They do a tremendous and incredible job with what they have to work with, and they do it all day, every day, 24/7, 365!This book is a representation of events that may have actually happened...", "related": [], "rank": 1839707, "title": "In Defense of Paradise", "author": "Keoki Dahl", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From 1995 through 2000, she was the dean of students and undergraduate education at MIT. As a humanist at a school known mostly for engineering, she is able to offer a fresh take on the impact of technology on society. Her narrative is laced with family and childhood stories (her grandfather came to MIT in 1901, little knowing that he would never return to the family farm), which helps readers understand how technology affects us on a personal level. David C. Mowery and Nathan Rosenberg's more scholarly Paths of Innovation also discusses the consequences of technological change, but while it provides evidence of how technological innovation in the United States led to strong economic growth, it does not delve into the social consequences. Easy to read and understand, Williams's work provides interesting insights on modern culture and our obsession with technology. Recommended for large public and academic libraries.John B.

Writing Peach's story in the first person, Angell gets at the human side of the business, as Peach declares she is proud to employ gorgeous, gutsy girls with education and help them along their way in life. With some literary aspirations herself, and having worked first in sales and then as a receptionist for a Boston madam named Laura, Peach decides to open her own \"out-call\" business, Avanti, specializing in \"vanilla sex and a chat.\" At first, she rarely has time to meet the girls she employs, but relies on their street smarts and status as students; instantly, her service catering to lonely middle-class clients takes off. The money is great, the parties fab, the drugs copious, and Peach even gains notoriety in the area, although some girls take advantage of her, burn out or even die of an overdose. Peach's upbringing as a Southern lady tempered her cynicism, she notes, and the early trauma of her father's death shaped her; though the Scarlett O'Hara act at disdaining vulgarity is unconvincing (money, for example, is seldom discussed). Angell sounds the happy businesswoman theme that running a prostitution ring is just a stepping stone to marriage and motherhood.(Jan.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

B. Story is a writer living in the southwestern United States. While that territory can cover anywhere from New Mexico to Hawaii he declines to be more specific at this time.

Such invasions of one’s personal life become an unnecessary distraction. D. B. Story has long had interests in both Science Fiction (since first discovering his mother’s secret cache of Ace Doublebooks stashed under her bed) and writing. In fact, anything he has enjoyed participating in he eventually has a desire to create as well. He seriously began writing (although not selling) stories ten years ago due to a dissatisfaction with what he was reading at the time and the belief that he could do it better. He started out with the interaction between humans and the sexy robots they would inevitably create and later branched out to other erotic Fantasy and SF genres. During that time he has written everything from flash fiction to a 402,000 word novel and a screenplay based on his other writings, as yet unsold. Whether his writing is actually “better” he admits he must leave to his readers to decide, but he likes his stuff a lot. He has often said that, “Writing time is always good time.” He also says that with the advent of cheap computers, word processors, eBooks, and the Internet that times have never been better for a diversity of writers to be heard.", "related": ["B003HS5098"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They lived to describe this experience only because a man and his son, out snowmobiling, decided to investigate what they thought was an abandoned car. When they were first reported missing, the young women's frantic families urged Arizona law enforcement authorities to launch a statewide search, but officials delayed for a week, insinuating that the two were runaways (they had actually been driving home for Christmas and took a wrong turn). Although Barzano lost several toes, Goldman had to have both legs amputated below the knee. This well-written, inspiring description of Goldman's physical and emotional rehabilitation includes a wealth of information on prosthetic devices. Encouraged by her loving family, Goldman began running competitively against other disabled athletes on \"cheetah legs\" (specialized running prosthetics). Goldman, writing with Cagan (who has co-authored with Joan Lunden and Grace Slick), effectively makes the point that many amputees end up in wheelchairs because of a health care system that will not pay for state-of-the-art prosthetics.

Her distinct perspective, that of an accepted neighbor who's still considered an outsider, drives this observational memoir. Travel readers will enjoy chucklesome details-a town with about five surnames, Henderson's phone book \"is the only one... I know of to use nicknames in its listings\"-but Johnson's news background proves both blessing and curse. On one hand, she's a fearless reporter, but her profiles too often cut short just when they're getting good. She touches on the poverty, racism and other troubles (like hurricanes), but doesn't probe in much depth, effectively reducing some of her friends and neighbors to two-dimensional ciphers. Where she does achieve a more nuanced portrait, readers will find a wonderful, personal look into a Cajun community.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is an essential resource for anyone interested in California archaeology and a model for other regions to emulate.... (Michel, Mark)This new book is now the primary reference on the prehistory of the entire state, updating two classic 1984 volumes (Joseph Chartkoff and Kerry Kona Chartkoff, The Archaeology of California, CH, Feb'85; Michael Moratto, California Archaeology,CH, Mar'85). Since then, an abundance of new information has accumulated from contract archaeology field projects, and new methods of analysis, theoretical perspectives, and research questions have emerged. For this comprehensive review, more than 50 authors contributed chapters on their specialties. Ten chapters divide the state into geographic regions; for each, authors present detailed descriptions of the succession of cultures and particular research themes. Other chapters review paleoclimate change,linguistic prehistory, materials trade, rock art, and DNA. In the book's subtitle, Colonization refers to the origin and spread of California's earliest populations. Culture refers to continuities and relationships among prehistoric populations through space and time. Complexity refers to the elaborations that evolved among California's hunter-gatherers, including a high degree of regional differentiation, relatively dense populations, intensive economies, social ranking, and sociopolitical organizAt last, a comprehensive review of California archaeology for specialists and advanced students alike! Jones and Klar have assembled a magnificent orchestra of specialists, who provide an up-to-date, comprehensive synthesis of the subject from a multidisciplinary perspective. California Prehistory is destined to become a fundamental work for anyone wishing to delve into the complexities of California prehistory at a general and technical level. Strongly recommended to anyone with a serious interestin the early chapters of California history...

His genius, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the Renaissance Man, a man of \"unquenchable curiosity\" and \"feverishly inventive imagination\". He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent and \"his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, the man himself mysterious and remote\". Marco Rosci states that while there is much speculation about Leonardo, his vision of the world is essentially logical rather than mysterious, and that the empirical methods he employed were unusual for his time.", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although Sam denies the sum's existence, Ruth had seen a bank statement on which it appeared; under California divorce law, she is entitled to half of it. As Jeri follows standard procedures for tracing money--checking bank accounts, looking for aliases, seeking third parties who might be holding the funds--she sees Sam's new girlfriend driving a new, expensive car. After the car is reported stolen and a major insurance claim is filed, Jeri discovers that Sam's past conceals a previously unknown former wife who had divorced him for abuse. Jeri's next task, however, is hunting for evidence to clear Ruth of Sam's murder. Intelligent and determined, Jeri holds her own among the ranks of impressive female detectives.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B005E4ISTC"], "rank": 196025, "title": "Take A Number (The Jeri Howard Series Book 3)", "author": "Janet Dawson", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Perhaps because I was growing up during that period, the era of the 1930s and '40s has an emotional pull for me that subsequent wars and historical events lack. My father was a doctor, a Colonel in the Army Medical Corps. We were camp followers--going to live in North Carolina and Alabama when he was stationed in those states. I love to read history books and novels written about \"The War,\" as people of my generation usually refer to it. The films and music of the time captivate me. Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt--larger than life figures; the OSS, the Maquis...those names conjure up visions of intrigue and heroism. I remember a family friend who was dropped behind enemy lines...those words, \"dropped behind enemy lines\" still give me a chill. I once met a woman whose father was a diplomat; as a teenager, she traveled back and forth across the Atlantic in convoys several times during the first few years of The War, living in London and Switzerland, until it was cut off to Americans. And so, for THE EXPATRIATE, I created Alexa Summerfield, an American student at Oxford, who is swept up in the onslaught of the Nazi war. Because I have spent a great amount of time in Austria, I used that beautiful country as my setting. This novel has been a work in progress for many years. For the research, I traveled to England, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, and the eastern republics of the former Soviet Union. It is the tale of an extraordinary woman who finds herself in the most unexpected and dire circumstances. It is about the OSS and the Austrian Resistance.

Rowlands convincingly argues that the new science of the mind will concern itself with explaining mental processes as amalgamations of neural, bodily, and environmental processes. This book stakes out important new territory and is sure to have a major impact on the future of the field.(Richard Menary, The University of Wollongong)Mark Rowlands insightfully draws from resources in both early analytic philosophy and phenomenology to defend recent conceptions of embodied and extended cognition. He presents convincing arguments to show that, at its core, intentionality involves a transcendental disclosure of the world, and then remarkably shows that the transcendental is characteristic of a mind that is an amalgamation of brain, body, and environment. He thus lays out a brilliant strategy to defeat all of the neurocentric naysayers with respect to the extended -- or, in Rowland's terms, the amalgamate -- mind.(Shaun Gallagher, Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences, University of Central Florida and University of Hertfordshire)Those who ask whether mental processes can extend beyond the brain and into the world may seem to be asking, 'Where is my mind?' Mark Rowlands instead replaces questions about the location of cognition with a process-based vision of the mind as a complex set of activities distributed across brain, body, and world. His integrative and original book demonstrates that the cognitive sciences already treat mental processes as amalgamations of disparate neural, bodily, and environmental resources. It brings a new level of precision to the case for the extended mind.(John Sutton, Macquarie Centre for Cognitive Science, Macquarie University)", "related": ["B0050YV1R2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I was eight years old and it was the first school assignment of the year after we'd spent the Summer, may parents and I, visiting my aunt in Boston. My aunt was attending MIT and applying for jobs with the CIA to help make spy-gadgets smaller. In short, she was a nerd, just like my dad, who spoke in a lot of acronyms.The trip had been mainly walking and history lessons up to a certain point (there are great pictures somewhere of me throwing a fake bale of tea over the side of a fake old wooden ship). Anyway, I was eight, it was Boston. One night, my aunt decided to take me for a walk through the old city at night to show me the neighborhood cemetery. If you've never had a person take you to a cemetery in Boston after sundown when you're eight, you've missed something that leaves an impression. It was in this cemetery that my aunt told me a story that was kind of spooky--about a boy who finds a turtle and takes it home only to have it turn out to be demonically possessed. It was your typical \"Don't go to sleep\" story and when it came time for a school assignment to write something creative, I was weak and ignorant and I got a B+ because my teacher didn't know I'd totally kiped the idea.It's been over 20-years now. And sometime between ages eight and fourteen I figured out that stealing stories wasn't nearly as rewarding as making them up to impress girls. I've written for the stage and for television as well as online magazines and literary journals.Atlaswas my first independently released novel.", "related": ["B00JSISQ1U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Central students have taught her how to sing \"Jingle Bells, Batman Smells,\" how to chew a mint so it sparks in the dark, and how to play soccer on a field of mud.She spent two weeks with the whole fifth grade class while, in a kind of total immersion, they studied the Western Movement. On the first day the boys and girls found out who they'd be married to for those two weeks. Then they took pioneer identities, joined a wagon train, chose supplies, decided whether to cross a rushing river at midnight, made pumpkin butter, dipped candles, and built mock fires with fake buffalo chips. They had a wonderful time--mostly. Jamie wrote a book about it:Wagon Train 911.\"It's true, though,\" she says, \"that while Central is very special to me, every school is brimming with rich stories. I talk with children all over the country about my writing, and the one question they always ask is, 'Witt you put us in a book?' If I were there tong enough, I expect I could.\"Jamie Gilson's professional life has always involved writing and communications. Formerly a teacher of junior high school speech and English, she was a staff writer and producer for Chicago Board of Education radio station WBEZ, a writer of Encyclopaedia Brittanica films, and continuity director for fine arts radio station WFMT. She was, for ten years, a monthly columnist for Chicago magazine.Born in Beardstown, Illinois, Jamie Gilson spent her early years in small towns in Illinois and Missouri where her father worked as a flour miller. After graduating from Northwestern University School of Speech, she married Jerome Gilson, then a law student and now a trademark lawyer.

With cake tester position in short supply and impaired vision putting a halt to those loftier ambitions, Jason settled on a career in the travel industry which afforded him the ability to indulge of another great passion – travelling. Thanks to various positions with travel organizers, agents and airlines Jason got to visit more than thirty countries and travel around the world. Following a redundancy and a chance encounter during the early 1990’s Jason secured a job with a local radio station and thus a career in media began. He went on to produce and present a number of radio shows and programmes for a number of local radio stations in the UK as well as hosting a series of video travel brochures and corporate films. It was whilst working in the radio industry than Jason was asked to write an article for a local newspaper in Essex and then a regular column. It was this start with the written word that ignited a fire of desire that had always burned somewhere deep within Jason’s mind and since then he has written countless articles, features, news stories and columns for various on and off line publications and in 2012 produced his first non-fiction book – The Top 50 Most Influential Gay Movies of All Time.

Many years later I got very sick with the flu and strep throat. One week after finishing my medicine, I broke out on both legs with very deep, painful welts. I saw several doctors who were not exactly sure what the condition was or how to treat it. Finally the doctors all agreed it was erythema nodosum, a condition resulting from strep with no cure. I didn't accept no cure and surfed the Internet trying to find light at the end of the tunnel. I discovered juicing, a holistic diet and no exercise due to my condition helped my condition. I had such great results, I sat down and wrote about my experience.

He served as a General in the Union Army during the American Civil War (1861–65), for which he received recognition for his outstanding command of military strategy as well as criticism for the harshness of the \"scorched earth\" policies that he implemented in conducting total war against the Confederate States. Military historian B. H. Liddell Hart famously declared that Sherman was \"the first modern general.\" Sherman served under General Ulysses S. Grant in 1862 and 1863 during the campaigns that led to the fall of the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg on the Mississippi River and culminated with the routing of the Confederate armies in the state of Tennessee. In 1864, Sherman succeeded Grant as the Union commander in the western theater of the war. He proceeded to lead his troops to the capture of the city of Atlanta, a military success that contributed to the re-election of President Abraham Lincoln. Sherman's subsequent march through Georgia and the Carolinas further undermined the Confederacy's ability to continue fighting. He accepted the surrender of all the Confederate armies in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida in April 1865. When Grant assumed the U.S. presidency in 1869, Sherman succeeded him as Commanding General of the Army (1869–83). As such, he was responsible for the U.S. Army conduct in the Indian Wars over the next 15 years, in the western United States. He steadfastly refused to be drawn into politics and in 1875 published his Memoirs, one of the best-known firsthand accounts of the Civil War.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In finding the answer, he meets the sinister John Mark and the beautiful Ruth Tolliver. The listener will be interested in discovering just how Brand gets these folks back to the mountain desert and how many big city vices they encounter on the way.

Other stories feature cross-cultural disorientation: an American student spending her \"Winter Term\" in Paris, a visiting American scholar who threatens to blackmail faculty at a Polish university in \"The Twisted River.\" This is storytelling at its best.

I found the information in the book to be invaluable. Before I retired earlier this year, I presented the 'Law Enforcement' version of 'Bridges' material to members of my Department, local probation officers and juvenile justice personnel. All persons in law enforcement and departments of correction, probation, etc. would greatly benefit from reading this book. The TOOL graphics were on point and easy to understand. The material is presented in a way that never tries to correct officers' behavior or tell them 'how to do their jobs'. It does answer so many of the questions law enforcement and corrections personnel have asked throughout their careers. In presenting those answers, the material provides understanding, or 'the why' of behaviors officers experience on the job. With an understanding of 'the why', the job becomes easier and officers can stay safer. The information Jody provides in this book is indeed another tool for officers and just as important as duty weapons (e.g. pepper spray, night sticks, firearms). It is my opinion, when embraced, knowledge of the material may decrease the need to use the aforementioned 'means of persuasion'. Tactical Communication should be required reading for all new hires and newly promoted officials in Law Enforcement. --Sgt. Rutha DeJesusTactical Communication has helped my officers and me improve the way we relate to the communities we serve. Today when we go to a hot call, my officers have the tools to remake confrontations into opportunities for mutual respect. --John M.

Edwards is widely acknowledged to be America’s most important and original philosophical theologian, and one of America’s greatest intellectuals. Edwards’s theological work is very broad in scope, but he is often associated with his defense of Reformed Theology, the metaphysics of theological determinism, and the Puritan heritage. Recent studies have emphasized how thoroughly Edwards grounded his life’s work on conceptions of beauty, harmony, and ethical fittingness, and how central The Enlightenment was to his mindset. Edwards played a critical role in shaping the First Great Awakening, and oversaw some of the first fires of revival in 1733-1735 at his church in Northampton, Massachusetts. Edwards’s sermon Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God, is considered a classic of early American literature, which he delivered during another wave of revival in 1741, following George Whitefield’s tour of the Thirteen Colonies. Edwards is widely known for his many books: The End For Which God Created the World; The Life of David Brainerd, which served to inspire thousands of missionaries throughout the nineteenth century; and Religious Affections, which many Reformed Evangelicals read even today. Edwards died from a smallpox inoculation shortly after beginning the presidency at the College of New Jersey (later to be named Princeton University), and was the grandfather of Aaron Burr.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Here, Stich demonstrates the ways colleges—in particular, less elite comprehensive schools—are using art programs and museums to 'open up' privileged knowledge to broader communities. Stich puts us at the center of the resulting tensions and complexities, illuminating a discussion of cultural capital with stunning and nuanced ethnographic detail. This is a masterful intervention.(Greg Dimitriadis, University at Buffalo, State University of New York)Despite the well-intended, now mature process of democratization, the postsecondary system is still charged with high levels of inequality. In the interest of uncovering the mechanisms through which democratization, as currently conceived, preserves and perpetuates inequality within the system of higher education, this bookreconsiders the role of social class in the production and dissemination of knowledge, the valuation of cultural capital, and the reproduction of social inequality.", "related": [], "rank": 4207730, "title": "Access to Inequality", "author": "Amy E.

Raised by a single mother on a public school teacher's salary, she quickly learned that frugality and cost-cutting was a necessity but none of the necessities in life needed to be sacrificed as a result.Her mom's passion for “being green” ( long before “green” had the meaning it has today) also became a passion for Doreen, dating back to regularly packing up recyclables and carting them across town to the only recycling center in multiple counties. Today she lives comfortably with her husband and two children on the income of only her husband, but they proudly carry little debt and still live a green and environmentally-friendly lifestyle.Her hope is to inspire others by sharing realistic ideas and information necessary to make wise choices where family health, wellness and environmental conservation are concerned. She shares her best tips and tricks at MomGoesGreen.com and hopes to help dispel the misconception that environmental consciousness and a healthy well-being are costly commitments. Her greatest inspiration is doing her part to help make the world a better place for her children and she hopes to teach them how to treat their planet and live a better, healthier, eco-friendly life.Please feel free to join me at www.momgoesgreen.com for more information about leading a green lifestyle.

I also dreamt of heroes and villains and the women that inspired the best and worst in them.It seemed like every book I read as a teen was a classic bodice-ripper. Wimpy-virgin-heroine always making bad choices and getting herself in trouble, cue the macho hero, yadda yadda yadda. Those books are what inspired me to write my own stories, not because I loved them, but because I constantly found myself tossing them aside and fuming. I would think of all the ways the story would have been better: if she had just picked up the sword and stabbed the bad guy when she had the chance...I LOVE writing, and I love the new direction that fiction has taken over the last decade. So many amazing, strong female leads now! And so many new writers that finally have a voice in the indie publishing community.I was blessed with a wonderful husband who supports my passion for writing and reading, and who really helped me focus my desire to publish my work. When I'm not busy enjoying my daughter and husband, I'm usually developing a new story idea, or sneaking in a bit of free time with my favorite authors.I'm a bit of a hermit, they called it being \"shy\" when I was a kid, but I love hearing from fans. I also love ferrets, hiking, chili dark chocolate, strong coffee, nursing mamas, and rain.​", "related": [], "rank": 678360, "title": "A Kiss Beneath the Veil", "author": "Aimee Roseland", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.4667, "rating_total": 67.0}

This evolved into arranging those mysterious phrases together, and as they came together, fascinating and unexpected lessons were learned. Some learnings actually began to build upon the previous learnings, which gave rise to new insights. But some were quite puzzling and prompted further investigations, like wondering why God would care about our laws, our courts, and our history.

Though these recurring mental breakdowns greatly affected her social functioning, her literary abilities remained intact. Modern diagnostic techniques have led to a posthumous diagnosis of bipolar disorder, an illness which coloured her work, relationships, and life, and eventually led to her suicide. Following the death of her father in 1904 and her second serious nervous breakdown, Virginia, Vanessa, and Adrian sold 22 Hyde Park Gate, and bought a house at 46 Gordon Square in Bloomsbury.Following studies at King's College London, Woolf came to know Lytton Strachey, Clive Bell, Saxon Sydney-Turner, Duncan Grant, and Leonard Woolf, who together formed the nucleus of the intellectual circle known as the Bloomsbury Group which came to notorious fame in 1910 with the Dreadnought hoax Virginia Woolf participated in, dressed as a male Abyssinian royal.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After collecting only half the ransom--the rest to be paid upon her safe return--the kidnappers left her to die, but luckily Colum Sullivan was tracking her. Finding her unconscious and feverish, he nurses her back to health, and they begin the long trek back on foot to her home only to discover that their troubles have just begun. The second Love's Valley historical romance is set in the mountainous region of south central Pennsylvania just after the end of the Civil War and features Monroe's cousin and Douglass Esmeralda's brother fromChoices(2005). As the title suggests, Brown tackles the concepts of forgiveness and absolution in this story of former enemies trying to rebuild shattered lives. Brown's use of a down-home, folksy style may irritate some but will surely charm others as it provides a more complete mental vision of the various characters via their verbal sparring matches.Lynne WelchCopyright © American Library Association.

Pour la satisfaire pleinement n'hésitez pas à consulter mon site www.jackybourgogne.com En ce qui concerne ma flamme littéraire Sur le style : A l'origine j'étais plutôt un musicien, un compositeur arrangeur, accessoirement auteur. Ceci pour expliquer que dans mes écrits, j'aime la couleur des sons et donc des mots. Ce qui explique que parfois je m'en amuse et abuse de ma muse ;-) Sur le fond : J'essaie sans cesse de proposer des sujets qui me passionnent et qui me semblent porteurs de connaissances et de rêves tout en sortant systématiquement des sentiers battus. Sur le contenu : \"Au delà\" n'est pas mon premier livre mais est celui sur lequel j'ai consacré le plus de temps Il faut dire que le sujet de l'après vie m'a toujours passionné . Son originalité : Passé 20 pages d'introduction et de mise en contexte , l'on peut le lire dans n'importe quel sens car est interactif. Il dispose de 8 fins différentes. Après l'au delà, j'ai enchainé avec un sujet qui me semble tout aussi primordial: Le sens de la vie . « Enquêtes sur le sens de la vie » s'apparente à un ouvrage de philosophie, light car pas mal de bouquins de philo me donnent mal à la tête. Son originalité: Une multitude d'enquêtes collectées sur le net de pensées de gens célèbres comme Einstein, le Dalaï Lama, Hubert Reeves, Henri Labori, Bernard Werber etc. qui tous nous éclairent de leur vision de la vie. De tout cela j'en ai fait une synthèse par thème (sociologique, scientifique, ésotérique etc.). Un autre ouvrage sur le pays sympa où j'ai la chance de vivre et travailler par choix délibéré: le Maroc. Dans « Maroc, le découvrir, l'aimer, s'y installer » vous trouverez comme dans tous les guides, des photos des plus beaux paysages du royaume mais ce qui fait son originalité et que je me suis penché sur le coté psycho-sociologique des Marocains. De plus il propose en 3eme partie une sorte d'étude de faisabilité pour un nouveau projet de vie, que ce soit pour y travailler ou y passer sa retraite. Quand au dernier « Dernières nouvelles du monde réel » il reprend mes concepts philosophiques en les assemblant de façon facile à lire. Son originalité ? Des réponses philosophiques et scientifiques à des questions essentielles illustrées de petits contes et nouvelles fantastiques. Ce faisant, vous pourrez vous instruire tout en vous distrayant.", "related": [], "rank": 3599550, "title": "Dernires nouvelles du monde rel: Nouvelles fantastiques et philosophiques (French Edition)", "author": "Jacky Bourgogne", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The speed of change in the growing field of molecular and developmental biology warrants this revised and updated version. Overall, it improves upon the third edition it replaces, with improved artwork and the new approach to the development of the head that dental students will find very useful.\" -Mark Jaffe, DPM, MHSA (Nova Southeastern University), from Doody's Reviews\"This is an excellent content bridge between anatomy and clinical practice: the vignettes are great and the images from the book are available online and downloadable as slides.

His tour of duty completed, Paul attended the University of Minnesota and later joined the staff. In 1968 he resigned academia and moved to Hawaii.       Paul's first publication was in high school when his English teacher submitted a short-story assignment to a national high school literature magazine. Some 30 years later his first novel was published. Life, a family and a boat named Waiola put the brakes on writing for a while.

Bucksot is a wonderful scriptural dissertation of the weapons Christians have been given by God to carry out the spiritual warfare in which we spend our every hour. I have to confess this is not what I thought the book was going to be about. I selected this book to review because at my Church we are going to be doing Ephesians chapter 6 next Sunday. I mistakenly interpreted the title to be a reference to the spiritual armor of God which is the subject of that chapter. However, what I found instead was a superb extension of what we should be doing once we've donned that spiritual armor. Armor is primarily defensive. Weapons are offensive. Both must be properly used to win a battle. Patrick Bucksot has distilled the essence of God's arsenal for us to better understand how we are to face - and defeat - the enemy and his many temptations.The Weapons of Our Warfare is, truly, a reference book that has a place on the bookshelf of every Christian. Nothing in this book cannot also be found in the Bible, but Mr. Bucksot has sought out each and every weapon available to us, and discoursed upon them within the pages of this book. In many ways, one could consider this book a Bible Study. Indeed, it would serve quite well as a Bible Study text, in which each chapter of the book would be the topic of prayer, study, and discussion in successive weeks. Mr. Bucksot has faithfully followed the leading of the Holy Spirit to produce this work. I most adamantly suggest it should belong in the library of every Christian.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a readable book for anyone who loves stories of the human spirit, and the ways in which God works through others. It is honest, not sugar-coated. Every parish minister will recognize the sufferings, struggles and joys he describes.

Nason Sr. and Dorlene Reyome. A short story he had written for English class was published in a Northern New York Literary magazine when he was 16. He had always thought about becoming a writer as a child but as the reality of life caught up with him, he started looking for ways to break out of the cycle of life many families were caught in during the early eighties.He graduated from St. Lawrence Central high school in 1982 a full year ahead of time and entered the U.S Army at the age of 17. While stationed overseas he met his first wife and married her when he was 19. After his son was born in 1986 he decided to leave the Army and try to support his family in the civilian world. In 1988 he left the United States to live in Germany, a country he had grown to love during his time in the service. During the next twelve years he worked in the Goodyear company which was located in the town he and his wife's family lived in. In 1992 he graduated from the Apprenticeship program and became a Journeyman in Information Electronics. The equivalent in the United States would be a bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering. Later he would become a Master in the field. He was unable to pursue his childhood dream of writing until 2011 when he began writing his first novel.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is now, and has always been, an avid sun worshipper. Much to the embarrassment of his family, he thinks nothing of striping down to his skivvies and parading his fifty year old body on a beach full of twenty-something's. Not many things have been known to ruffle Damian's feathers in the past, except when people started talking about the Bermuda Triangle. Damien has been out to sea in the Bermuda Triangle, quite a few times actually. He loves to fish and claims there's nothing quite as relaxing as kicking back in the middle of the ocean with nothing to do but wait for the next bite. He and his trio of close friends even thought about entering a tournament in Bermuda at one time, but decided against it since none of them are very good. Damien says that the strangest things he's ever encountered in the Bermuda Triangle are the tourists, especially the newcomers who seem to have every bit of lore at their fingertips, despite never having visited before. That's why he started looking into the stories in the first place. He got tired of hearing them and decided to do something about it. He reasoned that the best way to shut people up was to show them how wrong they were. It's never worked before but hey, there's always a first time. But something happened that Damien hadn't been expecting. He anticipated laughter, some of it raucous, but the stories started drawing him in. The more he read, the more he began to think that there might be something to a few of them after all. Damien still doesn't believe in alien abductions and what he terms 'other far out BS', but he's willing to admit that some of the cases are pretty strange. He's happy to let others ferret out the mystery, but he has been keeping an extra eye on his electronic equipment when he goes out fishing lately. And he's a lot more tolerant of newbies and their stories, even providing additional details on occasion. He's finally decided to share some of his burgeoning expertise with the rest of us, if only to get away from the constant urgings of his eldest son.", "related": ["B00CDS9EPO"], "rank": 2056100, "title": "The Mystery of the Bermuda Triangle", "author": "Damien Rollins", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And more importantly, where is he?  All attempts to locate him have failed.  Muncaster private detective, Dick Privet, hired to discover his whereabouts, drew a blank, a face that resembled a potato, and a three legged horse. But, enough of his artistic failings; what did he discover about the elusive Robert Lee?   Rumour (and a plea for help in the form of a note attached to a carrier pigeon’s leg) has it that the unfortunate scribe is being held against his will in Muncaster’s asylum. Other than the one attached to Lucky, his Jack Russell terrier, this was the only lead Dick had. Keen to get to the truth, he tried to gain access to the asylum, but was prevented from doing so by the gargantuan Igor, the over-enthusiastic doorkeeper whose job is to ensure the inmates remain within its four walls. Even though it does not come within his job description, he also enjoys keeping everyone else without, a task he undertakes with relish, and sometimes with tomato ketchup – as poor Dick Privet found to his cost.   After the offending bottle had been removed, Dick Privet took it to the local recycling centre, and his suspicions to the local constabulary.  DC Shirley Combs, still emotionally and mentally traumatised by the  unsavoury incident in Muncaster United’s dressing room, took on the investigation and interviewed the Asylum’s director, Dr Edmund Latimer, who said:- “Robert Lee? Never heard of him. We haven’t got any writers imprisoned in the attic with reams of paper, an endless supply of quills and a large vat of ink. Cross my heart and hope to… aaarrrrgghh…”   Robert Lee’s whereabouts, and his identity, remain a mystery.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Once the final part of the serial has been published I'll\nbe releasing the whole thing as a novel anyway. There's no need for\nanyone to buy parts of the serial unless they really want to.

Update the story to modern-day Michigan, make the two characters a river guide and an older man whom the guide has hated for years, replace the film’s commentary about racism with some Native American mythology, and you’ll wind up with this involving novel. Joe McCartney is coerced by his wife, a nurse, to take an ailing patient, Frank Talbot, up the Escanaba River, hoping that, even though Joe hates Frank for what Frank did to Joe’s father many years ago, Joe will be able to get rid of the rage he keeps buried deep within himself. Trapped on the river by a forest fire, Joe and Frank must work around their antipathies and find a way to survive. They are watched by two spirits, Pauguck (who guides the souls of the dead to the afterlife) and Raven (who blinds the dead souls before their journey). There’s no happy ending to the story—Frank and Joe are both in darker places by the end—but readers will find Gubbins’ story surprising and real. An elegantly written and compelling novel that effectively mixes multiple genres. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": 3148456, "title": "Raven's Fire", "author": "John Gubbins", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All of this while\nbringing to light the love story of Michelle and Lars, a hardworking, humble,\nand swoon worthy hero. \"The characters are exceptionally\nauthentic. They're down to earth, yet complex. I find myself rooting for the\nmain characters, but knowing it won't be that easy. It never is...I'm waiting in anticipation for the\nsecond installment of the Braving Love trilogy. \"4.5 Stars for a fabulous\nread!\" - Kimmie Easley, author ofSouls Set Free ALSO:\"Cornered, book one of theBraving Lovetrilogy, is a great story that will resonate with every woman who has ever been\nin a really bad relationship.  We're all hoping that Michelle finds\nhappiness at last with Lars, even while finally removing an abusive ex-boyfriend\nwho keeps coming back to haunt her from her life for good.  Like most\ngreat stories, the book is about courage, hope, and love. The ending is a real\ncliff hanger and makes you unable to wait until you can get your hands on book\ntwo!\" - Lyn Heffernan, reviewer atReadioactiveBooks.com", "related": ["B00L82ZVYE"], "rank": 2029130, "title": "Cornered (Braving Love Trilogy #1)", "author": "Ariana Gael", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 3.6, "rating_total": 18.0}

It has resulted in 80-90 percent recovery from PTSD in five to twelve hours and was found to be much faster than cognitive behavior therapy. EMDR is the perfect solution for people who are tired of going through long years of therapy for distress or psychological barriers, those who are considering therapy but are daunted by the long-term commitment, those who have found out that awareness, willpower, and determination are not enough for change, and those who want a deep psychological change in an extremely short period of time.

In the past decade, the story has grown, changed and evolved as much as I. The end result is something I am excited for readers to experience.The Teutevar Saga is a unique blend of my favorite book and movie genres. That was how the story began -- as a way for me to combine my favorite entertainment forms. The original story can trace its roots to classical fantasy such as Tolkien, C. S. Lewis and Lloyd Alexander but also drew from the creations of Brian Jacques, George R. R. Martin, J.K. Rowling, Joe Abercrombie and George Lucas, to name a few. Where my stories take a different path from traditional fantasy, however, can be traced back to the numerous John Wayne movies I grew up watching and the rugged mountain landscape that is my home. As a writer, I have labored to makeOut of Exile a little bit of everything I love. I truly believe the end results is like nothing you have ever read -- classical mythology, epic fantasy and American Western themes all rolled in to one.My characters were  inspired by personalities in a multitude of books, movies and even video games. They also have touches of real people I have crossed paths with and a little bit of me went in to each one as well. While each varies in levels of good and bad -- I suppose some even have a little ugly -- I approach them all as very real individuals, people with hopes and dreams, tempers and fears, joys and sorrows, pasts and futures.I did my best to makeOut of Exile a story that can be enjoyed by most audiences, from beginning adolescents to adults, even the ones who call themselves grown ups. It was my goal for readers to be able to lose themselves in the world of Peldrin that I have created. I hope you enjoy reading this book as much I have writing it.Happy Reading!Derek", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Each selection is based on a picture book by the same name from the publisher’s Tales of Young Americans series. Noble’s “The Scarlet Stockings Spy” concerns Maddy Rose, a Philadelphia girl whose clothesline code informs her brother (a spy in Washington’s nearby army) about British ships in the harbor. In Papp’s “The Town That Fooled the British,” young Henry’s idea saves his Maryland town during the War of 1812. “The Last Brother,” a Civil War tale by Noble, tells of an 11-year-old bugler at the Battle of Gettysburg. Sometimes dramatic and occasionally poignant, the stories are always accessible. The illustrations use light and color dramatically while sometimes depicting faces with near-photographic realism. The title and cover art will help this short story collection find its audience. A second volume in the series, Westward Journeys, was published simultaneously.

Sometime around 2008, I was told by a psychic that I would start channeling other groups, and I said, \"No. If anyone else wants to come through, they can give their message to Eloheim and then Eloheim can share it.\" I flat-out wasn't interested in channeling anyone other than Eloheim.On June 10, 2009, something rather remarkable occurred. We were in our regular weekly meeting with Eloheim and all of a sudden no one--not the group, not me, and not Eloheim--could remember what we had just been discussing. It was as if we had jumped into another time stream. I wish I had a less woo-woo way of describing it, but I don't. We could feel \"other versions\" of ourselves sitting in a circle on the other side of the room. As Eloheim and I explored this energetic, The Visionaries were allowed to come in and I channeled their first message.That was just the beginning. Over the next 12 months, six additional groups joined what has become known as The Council. The Birth of The Council series of seven books documents the 56 weekly sessions held during that time.Volume Seven introduces the final Council members: Fred. I was very hesitant to add another Council member as there were already SIX!  However, Fred has added SO much to the teachings and he is super funny as well.Even though I was hesitant to connect with anyone other than Eloheim, I am sure glad that I did. The amazing energy, information, love, and fun that have come from getting to know The Visionaries, The Guardians, The Girls, The Warrior, The Matriarch, and Fred have brought so much to my life. I trust that you will enjoy getting to know them, as well.", "related": [], "rank": 713376, "title": "Birth of The Council, Vol. 7", "author": "Veronica Torres", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fergy, 14, lives with his family in a van; his father, J. P., believes that because \"the system\" cheats everyone, he is entitled to \"reclaim\" items the family needs, like the van and food. But when J. P. reclaims a luxury motor home (belonging to people who have been kind to the family), Fergy decides to run away to the home of his maternal grandparents, whom he has never met, with his little sister in tow. J. P. comes after them, but Fergy's mother decides that she, too, has had enough. Most of the characters in this novel are richly realized, especially Fergy, who longs for a normal life and schooling. The one problem is that J. P. is unrelentingly mean, and his nonconformist philosophies sound more like slick rationales than sincere ideals.

Whether they realize it or not.Maddie is a Food Network junkie, a wannabe gardener, a by-the-seat-of-her-pants cook, and a closet hermit. She works/writes every day in her converted sunroom office, and wouldn't have it any other way. She frequently rescues stray pets and plants and an occasional antique wicker table. All of these quirky topics, and more, make their way into her books.Her first book, THE WILD WEST, a Kensington Precious Gems romance, received a Calico Trails Cameo Award. RED: A SEDUCTION TALE, claimed first place as the Romance Book Scene's favorite novella of the year. A four time nominee for a CAPA/Psyche Award from The Romance Studio, she wonders if she is the Susan Lucci of romance, although she has received a number of Top Pick, 5 Star, and Best Read reviews from various reviewers. Her books have landed on Amazon Top 100 Paid Bestseller lists, including BROKEN, a #1 bestseller in western romance.

I've gotten tired of writing it. So, expect this to be a non-standard bio. I’ve been writing for over two decades and before that, I was creating my own bedtime stories to tell myself. I penned my first short story at 8. It was a fable about how the raccoon got its eye-mask and was roughly three pages of handwritten, 8 year old scrawl.  My mother still has it and occasionally, I still dig it out and admire it. When I got my first computer, I took all my handwritten stories and typed them in.  Afterwards, I tossed the originals.  In my early twenties, I had a bit of a writer’s meltdown and deleted everything.  So, with the exception of the story about the raccoon, I actually have none of my writings from before I was 23.  Which is sad, because I had seven Aislinn Cain novels written along with a half dozen other novels and well over two hundred short stories.  It has all been offered up to the computer and writing gods as a sacrifice and show of humility or some such nonsense that makes me feel less like an idiot about it. I have been offered contracts with publishing houses in the past and always turned them down.  Now that I have experimented with being an Indie Author, I really like it and I’m really glad I turned them down.  However, if you had asked me this in the early years of 2000, I would have told you that I was an idiot (and it was a huge contributing factor to my deleting all my work).   Personally, I really do suffer from a severe anxiety disorder and migraines.  I find both to be huge impediments to the life I would like to lead.  I find solace in the fact that I have found a significant other that tries to understand my obsession with writing, wonderful family members who support my writing obsession and a best friend who understands and accepts me regardless of my quirks and idiosyncrasies (for the record, she is more like Alex from The Dysfunctional Chronicles than Nyleena).   When I’m not writing, I play in a steel-tip dart league and enjoy going to dart tournaments.  I enjoy renaissance festivals and sanitized pirates who sing sea shanties. I can often be found in the summer at Mark Twain Lake in Missouri.   I am a native of Columbia, MO, which I will probably call home for the rest of my life, but I love to travel. Day trips, week trips, vacations on other continents, wherever the path takes me is where I want to be and I’m hoping to be able to travel more in the future.", "related": ["B00FJ4TTQI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And after years of imagining a galaxy for my epic in which multiple\nhuman civilizations are at war with each other, it did me a world of good to\nwrite about a galaxy where most people are just trying to make a living and find some joy in life.I received so many requests to extend the Date Night universe into a series\nthat I put aside my epic for an extended period to write a sequel, Alien Night\non Union Station. The events take place five years after the conclusion of Date\nNight, and the plot involves a mix of business, diplomacy, gaming and family\nrelations. As a bonus, we finally get to meet Kelly's mother.", "related": ["B00K94J2OW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 17, "rating_average": 4.0588, "rating_total": 69.0}

A very enjoyable read.\"-Jody Lynn Nye, author ofView from the Imperiumand co-author of theMyth Adventures of Aahz and Skeeve\"Not since the people of Atlantis predicted 'low humidity' has there\nbeen such an original twist in Greek Mythology. This book is also far\nmore amusing.\"-Brian Rathbone, creator of the bestsellingGodslandFantasy Series\"Zeus Is Deadis a book about the return of old gods, but Cthulhu is not\n in evidence, and it did not drive me to the very edge of madness.\nInstead it is a hilarious, satirical, page-turning romp through a world\nbeset by plagues of monsters, egotistical gods, and reality television\nshows. I highly recommend this book to those who value both their sanity\n and a hearty guffaw. \"-Seamus Cooper, author ofThe Mall of Cthulhu\"A hilarious mythological tale of god-like proportions.
