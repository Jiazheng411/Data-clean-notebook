The author's powers of description are also keen, transporting readers to the \"brilliant, benighted, argumentative, inspiring\" Calcutta, as well as the \"stamped on, bitten, battered and clawed\" post-war Baghdad. At times Gill becomes preachy (\"Travel should question, not confirm\"), and occasionally offensive (\"What's in it for female suicide bombers? The promise of seventy adolescent virgin blokes?\"), but he also educates from the less-traveled corners of the world (Pakistan, Sudan, Greenland and others), albeit with a guilty sense of awareness. As a whole, Gill is far more interesting when reporting from \"There,\" demanding careful attention from an international audience; dispatches from \"Here,\" though they may appeal to a British audience, don't quite measure up.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But aside from wry chapter titles (e.g., \"Austerlitz: They Fell for It? Austria, 1805\"), these are generally straightforward accounts of some of the deadliest carnage in human history. That includes the Civil War's Battle of Antietam—the bloodiest single day in American history, during which some 6,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed and more than 16,000 were wounded—and the three-day Battle of Gettysburg, which resulted in 51,000 casualties on both sides. There's also the WWII Battle of Okinawa, during which more than 12,000 Americans were killed and nearly 32,000 wounded, along with 142,000 estimated Japanese casualties (military and civilian). Fawcett (You Did What? Mad Plans and Great Historical Disasters) gathers 37 concise, analytical, finger-pointing accounts of these and other battles from ancient times to the late 1960s. He and contributors Brian Thomsen, William R. Forstchen, Douglas Niles and Edward E. Kramer readably and insightfully convey a wide knowledge of military history, but more in-depth and well-annotated analyses of these battles are readily available elsewhere.(July 1)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this installment in the series, while visiting her aunt and uncle in Pennsylvania, she and Linden are invited to visit the Spy Force headquarters in London, where they will be made full-fledged members of the team. An invisible jet whisks them to England, where they join Ella, another young spy (whose friendship with Linden drives Max crazy with jealousy) and the entire cast of mad scientists and chefs who run the organization. They are given a mission: to stop evil Mr. Blue from controlling the minds of all children. Max soon realizes that being a spy doesn't immediately solve all of her problems, most of which hinge on the fact that she is a negative person with almost no sense of humor. The tale moves along at a brisk pace and has lots of fun details.

She offers substantive contributions to the 'quarrel' between philosophy and poetry and to contemporary hermeneutics of Plato.(Marina McCoy, Boston College)In this lucidly written and engaging book, Sonja Tanner provides an innovative interpretation of the concept of imagination in Plato's dialogues. Tanner not only rethinks the role imagination plays in Plato's portrayal of the uneasy yet productive tension between poetry and philosophy, but also extends her analysis to modern debates about the relationship between literature and philosophy.(Dmitri Nikulin, New School for Social Research)Scholars commonly depict Plato as the archenemy of poetry. This view stems in large part from Socrates' harsh treatment of poets in Republic II, III, and X; however, it also rests on the questionable assumption that Socrates spoke for Plato. Such an assumption, Tanner (Univ. of Colorado at Colorado Springs) insists, flatly ignores the role of literary form in Plato's work. When one takes into consideration that Plato wrote dialogues, not treatises; that the dialogues have poetic features; and that they often violate Plato's alleged prohibitions against quoting and imitating poets, Plato's attitude toward poetry emerges in a different light. Far from being opposed, philosophy and poetry are very much intertwined for Plato; the form of the dialogues contributes to their content. Vital to understanding this relationship is the imagination, though not only in what Plato says of it explicitly but also in how it functions within the dialogues themselves. In the end, though not everyone will agree with Tanner's self-professed 'continental' approach to Platonic studies or find her arguments compelling, her monograph will certainly generate much thought and scholarly discussion. Recommended.(CHOICE, November 2010)By the time Plato takes up the question of how we are to speak truthfully, the quarrel between the two imposing forms of such speech—philosophy and poetry—was already 'ancient.' And it remains a question that is unsettled and unsettling today. Rather than insisting upon a quarrelsome relation, Sonja Tanner argues that this matter is best understood as an infinite dialog that enriches those who engage it, and she shows how imagination assists in the birth of wisdom. Thus begins her real contribution to a conversation that must never end.(Dennis Schmidt, Penn State University)", "related": [], "rank": 4479344, "title": "In Praise of Plato's Poetic Imagination", "author": "Sonja Tanner", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Luckily we were now relatively close to home. As I parked\nthe vehicle, Charlie O. Chaplin licked his genitals. This was of course a\ncommon action for Mr. Chaplin; he is a dog after all. What? Did you think the\nblack and white film star rose from the grave to demonstrate super human\nflexibility? While Mr. Chaplin had a rather laissez faire attitude about this\nsituation, I knew that this smoking death trap would now lead to a greater\nheadache. I'm not referring to the headache caused by inhaling what I'll assume\nis toxic gas from underneath a car; I'm referring to the headache of having to\ngo to Pep Boys.For those of you unfamiliar,\nPep Boys is an auto repair/parts dealer. At least that's what they'll tell you\nif you ask them, I however like to think of Pep Boys as a super villain's lair\nfilled with this evil villain's minions circling around aimlessly. After doing\nsome research on my car's issues, a process which involved moving beads on my\nhandy abacus, scratching my chin hair, and having my mother heat up some hot\npockets, I made the arduous journey to the depths of hell for a heater hose.\nThe first thing you'll notice instantly about Pep Boys is that none of their\ncustomers appear to know how to pull out of a parking spot. When walking from\nmy car to the front door, I was nearly run over three times by people backing\nout of their spots. There were so many rear ends trying to back up on me, I\nstarted to think I was in a weird gay orgy porno.When I finally made it into the\nstore I approached a woman and asked her if she had any heater hoses. After\nchecking her pockets she answered no. I then asked if she worked here. She\nagain checked her pockets, which I thought was strange but chose to ignore, and\nagain answered no. Pep Boys customers are weird. I then walked over to another\nperson, this time they were wearing a Pep Boys shirt. I asked the man for some\nhelp, and he hurriedly replied \"I'll be right with you\" before\ndisappearing. His disappearing act was kind of amazing, a shame he never\npursued that career as a magician. I stood in that spot by the anti-freeze for\nwhat seemed like an eternity before I became worried. This poor young man with\ndreams of being a magician, forced to work for an evil super villain, had gone\nmissing. I had strange visions of sitting at home eating a bowl of Fruit Loops\ncereal and seeing his face plastered on a milk carton. I had to help this young\nman before it was too late. I'm pretty sure I read a story on the internet\nabout young men who work in auto repair shops being sold as slaves in foreign\ncountries and forced to have sex with mufflers and trannies. I dialed 311 and\nasked for information on how to set up an Amber Alert for the young man, the\nperson on the other end of the phone replied \"Please hold. I'll be right with\nyou.\" She disappeared. I waited on hold standing by the anti-freeze for\nwhat seemed like an eternity before I became worried. This poor young woman\nwith dreams of being a 911 operator, forced to answer phone calls for what I\nassumed was an evil super villain, had gone missing. I had another strange\nvision of sitting at home eating a bowl of Fruit Loops cereal and seeing a\ntelephone headset plastered on a milk carton. After three more visions of\nmissing people on milk cartons I decided to move away from the anti-freeze.I walked over to a counter\nmanned by an old man. Due to his age I could tell he was full of much wisdom.\nAlso, due to his age I could tell that he was probably full of lots of\nMetamucil and Viagra. His poop stained slacks and erection were clear\ngiveaways. Pep Boys hires only the best of the best. After he told me about the\nwar for 15 minutes (a subject I didn't even ask about) he asked me \"how\ncan I help you?\" After taking a moment to remember why I had originally\ncome to this god forsaken place, I asked if they sold heater hoses. The old man\nstared blankly at me for a minute; after thirty seconds had passed I began to\nworry the old man had died; the old man finally replied \"let me check in\nback.\" The old man disappeared, I instantly became worried that I would\nhave another vision of milk cartons; due to my lactose intolerance, too many\nvisions of milk cartons could cause a deadly case of explosive diarrhea;\nluckily the old man returned rather quickly. He replied \"yes we do, what\nmake and model is your car?\" After divulging the information to him, he\nreplied \"let me check in back.\" It was at this point that I began to\nwonder what was \"in back.\" On the counter was a computer that was\nalmost surely connected to the internet, whatever was \"in back\" had\nto possess greater knowledge than what was on the internet.The old man returned and asked\n\"what length heater hose do you need?\" I replied \"two feet\"\nand then waited for the inevitable rebuttal I knew would come. The allure of\nwhat was \"in back\" would surely force this minion to reply with\n\"let me check in back.\" He blankly stared at me, again I assumed he\nhad died, before replying \"are you sure?\" I was shocked; would I be\ngetting my two foot heater hose this easily? I had a vision of skipping merrily\nto my car with heater hose in hand, dodging cars pulling out of parking spots,\nand riding away on a magical unicorn. I think I may have inhaled too much of\nthose fumes coming from underneath my car.I nodded my head at the old man and replied \"yes I'm sure.\" He\nagain blankly stared at me for a moment; I looked around the store to see if\nany defibrillator machines were available; he then quickly shattered my utopian\nvision and replied \"let me check in back.\"Want to finish this essay?

Torrio. Ricca. Giancana and Accardo. The giant legends of organized crime that led the largest, wealthiest, most powerful, and near completely documented organized crime syndicate in the world. At the height of its power, the Chicago mobs influence extended from Lake Shore Drive to the beaches of Havana, the neon lights of Vegas and the heroin drenched back alleys of Hanoi. The years 1900 through 1959 are largely considered the Golden Age for the Chicago mob. The end came with the accession of Sam \"Momo\" Giancana to the criminal throne that Big Jim Colosimo had founded. Flashy, arrogant and dangerous, Giancana's rise to the leadership of the Chicago Mob was paralleled by the federal government's assault on organized crime. By 1980, the so-called Golden Age of Chicago Mob had ended. Between 1900 and 1959, fifty-nine years, only seven Bosses led the Chicago Mob. Between 1963 and 2000, thirty-seven years, there were more than nine Bosses in rapid succession. All except one of them...the indomitable Tony Accardo...died in jail or under federal and state indictment. While the Chicago Mob still wields considerable criminal, financial, and political influence, it is a mere shadow of what it once was. With increased pressure from far reaching RICO laws, the constant surveillance of a well-informed and effective federal organized crime task force and increased competition from equally ruthless and ambitious new ethnic mobs, there is little chance it will ever reemerge as the awesome power it once was.", "related": [], "rank": 972448, "title": "The Mob Files.

Two men walk past--one stops to help. The Good Samaritan is not a new character, but in the hands of pastor-speaker Nolan the story becomes contemporary and applicable to even the most terrifying situations. Nolan stresses the need for Christians in particular to put life on hold to help someone in need. To help readers slow down their thoughts and lives, he forces readers to pause after each chapter by asking questions to stimulate reflection on his message. Incorporating his version of the Good Samaritan parable into recycled tales that tell of others' redemption, the author demonstrates the reward of halting to help. Although some of his anecdotes about others sound unoriginal, Nolan is best when recalling his own painful past, with physical abuse, drug use, and suicide attempts. His childhood memories are haunting and violent, but when toned down with a witty, hopeful voice, the author becomes a living example of hurt man turned hurt healer. His forward-thinking optimism inspires action without inducing guilt, a recipe that should \"fling open the locked hearts of those who are indifferent.\"Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

WhileMark of the Demonwas the most challenging segment to write, this final offering was a pure pleasure. A frenetic roller coaster of a ride, Closures was perhaps the most intuitive story that I've ever written and it is in this final novel that the focus of the tale shifts from Cynara Saravic to the series' long-suffering protagonist, Elizabeth Simpson. Of all the characters I've created, over the course of the five novels I've written thus far, Elizabeth is the character with whom I feel the closest bond.Closures in Bloodis a dark horror offering rooted firmly in the genre's rich soil, but really, the story transcends the genre limits to become more of an intense (and bloody) drama about one woman's thirty-five year search for normalcy after the foundations of her life have been eradicated a series of cataclysmic events. Elizabeth's painful and poignant journey is really a metaphor for perseverance and a sustained belief in the power of hope. Still, this is first and foremost, a horror story. I wanted this novel to unfurl like an avalanche...or more correctly, a convergence of avalanches, all coming together with a brutally violent finality.A rich and diverse tapestry of characters inhabit this final segment of the trilogy, but as the name implied, I wanted to make sure that each individual thread was tied come story's end. I can promise the reader that I was diligent in insuring that no loose ends remained when the final word was written. I've been asked by fans of the series if I would eventually write another Elizabeth and Cynara tale and while I've developed an outline for a story that would occur some thirty years or so after the conclusion of Closures, I'm reluctant to undertake the project. I feel that the ending ofClosures in Bloodwas the perfect ending for this horror trilogy and I'm afraid that taking up the thread of Elizabeth and Cynara's story might somehow sully that ending, so for the time being, the concept will remain just that...an idea.", "related": ["B00FC7O8UY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was also the first American to translate Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy and was one of the five Fireside Poets. Longfellow was born in Portland, Maine, then part of Massachusetts, and studied at Bowdoin College. After spending time in Europe he became a professor at Bowdoin and, later, at Harvard College. His first major poetry collections were Voices of the Night (1839) and Ballads and Other Poems (1841). Longfellow retired from teaching in 1854 to focus on his writing, living the remainder of his life in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a former headquarters of George Washington. His first wife, Mary Potter, died in 1835 after a miscarriage. His second wife, Frances Appleton, died in 1861 after sustaining burns from her dress catching fire. After her death, Longfellow had difficulty writing poetry for a time and focused on his translation. He died in 1882. Longfellow predominantly wrote lyric poems which are known for their musicality and which often presented stories of mythology and legend. He became the most popular American poet of his day and also had success overseas. He has been criticized, however, for imitating European styles and writing specifically for the masses.", "related": ["B002HMCIBI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He chairs Future Worlds Center and is in the Board of the Institute for 21st Century Agoras. He was trained as a neurophysiologist and systems scientist in Germany and the US. He became known for his peace work in the late 90’ties through his innovative tech4peace.org project, which pioneered in breaking the communication divide. As member of the Conflict Resolution Trainers Group, he was involved in the training of thousands in structured dialogue and conflict resolution. He continues to be an active member of the bi-communal peace movement that is struggling for the re-unification of the island. Laouris contributed to the scientific refinement of the science of Structured Dialogic Design and is credited for the discovery of the Law of Requisite Action. His team works closely with Aleco Christakis, father of the science, and is an international leader in applications that span the peace process in Cyprus, the Middle East and many pan-European networks. The Hellenic Society for Systemic Studies recognized his contributions in systems science honoring him with their 2008 Award. In the early 90’ties together with two friends, he launched an island wide experiment to introduce IT in the lives of young children. This venture succeeded to provide the service to almost 15% of the country’s population and expanded in 7 countries.

These essays also highlight local heroes--for example, sometime-resident and baseball great \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson, and Cynthia Jacobson, still trying to solve a 100-year-old family murder. From John Wesley, founder of Methodism, to rock-and-roll pioneer Elvis Presley, many notable figures have left their mark on the city, and most of them are chronicled here.   Timothy Daiss, a Savannah native, is a journalist, columnist, and author whose works have appeared in local, regional, and national publications. His column runs weekly in five Georgia newspapers.

Scalable Vector Graphics, which are described through text like a programming language and can be read on any computer platform with the appropriate viewer, hold great promise for the Web designer who knows how to take advantage of the latent power. This book helps to harness that power.It's important to note that this book is not written for Web designers looking to add SVG graphics to their sites, but rather for Web programmers who need to add such graphics based on information extracted from a database, or who want to add them by hand. If you have or use an application that can export or embed SVG graphics, you may not need this book. However, if you are looking to create dynamic images that get created on the fly, or perhaps be able to draw graphics based on information from the user or from a database, you've come to the right book.Although only 330 pages, the book offers 13 chapters and six appendices. Everything from a basic overview of the SVG language through practical examples to the finer points of serving SVG files over the Web is thoroughly detailed, and each chapter is concisely written and rich with screenshots, illustrations, and code examples.O'Reilly has earned a positive reputation for publishing outstanding technical books, andSVG Essentialsmakes a fine addition to their lineup. The SVG graphics standard is rapidly gaining ground. Backed by important vendors as Adobe, SVG is poised to be a powerful tool in the arsenal of today's Web designer. Keep this book within arm's reach of any SVG developer or Web designer who wants to take advantage of this emerging and powerful technology.--Mike Caputo", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

George's spiritual awakening came at the age of 12, after seeing the film \"The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima.\" That proved to George that films do have an influence on people's lives. At the age of 14, after major surgery, George had a near-death experience. He was told, \"You have to go back, you have a destiny to fulfill.\" In 1968, George moved to Southern California. He currently resides in Ontario and Palm Springs. He has two daughters, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He owns and operates his own business. He is also a previously published author. In 1977, George had a dream. When his dream ended, a voice said to him, \"Now you have dreamed a story, wake up write it down and do something with it.\" That dream sent George on a mission to warn people to fight the forces of evil and to encourage them to get their lives in order with God. If George had known his effort, via a screenplay, was going to place him in the midst of a battle between the forces of good and evil, he would have began his mission with fear and trepidation. But, George withstood all obstacles and fulfilled his mission. He lived the documented true story he was to tell. He wrote this book with hopes that it will inspire people to live better lives. George is a member of The Thalians, a show business charity organization founded and chaired by Debbie Reynolds and Ruta Lee. He was a member of the Beverly Hills Friar's Club, a member of the Board of Directors of The Film Welfare League and The Pomona Valley Writer's Association, and he is Past President of The Film and Performing Artists Foundation.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When she was still in high school, she concealed Gone With The Wind inside her textbooks so she could read it during class. \"No wonder I had trouble passing geometry,\" Larosa says. West Virginia's 1963 statehood centennial sparked an interest in the Civil War and, living in the state that was born out of that conflict, inspired her to research the subject further. It was then she felt motivated to write about the human wreckage left in the wake of that war. During her research, she visited the locations mentioned in her four-part family saga. Larosa and her husband live in Bridgeport, West Virginia, where they pursue their various interests. She is kept busy these days promoting her books, as well as writing the fourth and final book in this family saga.

He is a seminary graduate (Fuller Theological Seminary) and an ordained minister; as such he has preached and taught on prayer for some years. Since his retirement from the University of Washington, he has felt an even deeper call to a prayer life by God. This has manifested itself in greater, more earnest prayer for family, for friends in and out of the church, and for God's leading of our national leaders. This calling has been at the heart of his work in compiling the prayer poems of this book. James currently lives in Spokane, Washington, with his wife and lives close to two of his grown children and their families. He is an active member of a local church where he has taught and presented through public readings his published poetry.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Their father has halfheartedly raised them while their mother has been in prison for 10 years, charged with dropping baby Kat from a balcony. Darcy's and Kat's lives are turned upside-down when they receive word that their mother is going to be released. Darcy will do anything to distance himself from the woman, who he believes does not deserve a second chance, but then he remembers the truth about Kat's fall: it was he who dropped his infant sister. Just as the teen is coming to terms with the truth, he is accused of molesting the little girl he baby-sits as well as his sister. It is with the help of his teacher and his mom that his name is cleared. Each surprising new plot element keeps readers turning pages until every truth unfolds. Darcy develops as an everyday hero who proves that perseverance in any situation is possible as he approaches each challenge with dignity and grace. Additionally, the supporting characters unfold to reveal their own compassion.

They're both strong-willed, fiercely  independent, and fervent Brooklyn Dodgers fans. Their divergent paths merge when  Brick's family's orchard is destroyed by fire, and his parents send him to stay  with Mariel and her adoptive mother in 1941 Brooklyn. Though excited by the  chance to see his beloved baseball team play in person, Brick can think of  little else but getting back to Windy Hill and saving what's left of the apple  trees. Unexpected help comes in the form of Mariel, whose big heart cannot  always overcome the weakness of her polio-stricken legs. Determined to help  Brick and discover the identity of her birth mother, Mariel finds a way to get  them both to Windy Hill--where Brick's trees and the hospital where Mariel was  born await--one shaky step at a time. Author of the much laudedLily's Crossing, Patricia  Reilly Giff has written another lovely work of historical fiction that perfectly  evokes a long-past time and place. Here, we can't help but smell Brick's apples  and hear the cheers of hopeful Dodgers fans in Ebbets Field. A wonderful story  of friendship and personal triumph for the preteen set.

Aus eigenem Erleben kennt er die Tricks der Waffenhändler, der Treuhänder in Zürich und die der Banken. Die Methoden der Schlapphüte des KGB und seiner westlichen Gegenspieler hat er schmerzhaft am eigenen Leib erlebt. Er sagt - ich schreibe aus meinem Kopf ab. Und wenn das nicht reicht, nehme ich die Köpfe meiner Freunde hinzu. Geboren 1942 in Landsberg/Warthe, aufgewachsen in Güstrow, Krefeld und auf vielen Stationen dazwischen. Ausbildung - etwas liederlich, größtenteils auf Reisen, weniger auf Schulen. Reisen nehmen einen großen Teil seines Lebens ein, besonders die Jahre bei der Handelsmarine. Diese Phase beeinflusst ganz wesentlich sein Schreiben. Detlev Crusius hat gelebt und gearbeitet in Krefeld, Köln, Frankfurt, Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden, Rom, London, Moskau, Riad, Jeddah, Tripolis, Damaskus und Zürich. Zu seiner Biografie gehören auch vier Jahre Gefängnis, wegen Verstoß gegen das Außenwirtschaftsgesetz und das UN-Embargo gegen Libyen.

Since 9/11, hatred and misapprehension have blossomed as part of a backlash against immigration and a belief that Islam is incompatible with the culture and ideals of the West. Bowen explores numerous cases in the U.S. and Europe of protests against the building of mosques, banning Muslim women from wearing headscarves, violent attacks, and even the killing of Muslims. He examines how so many of these actions go against Western beliefs of religious freedom and free speech. Bowen debunks several beliefs, including that the ideals of multiculturalism are opening the door to Muslim immigrants who then do not integrate well and that sharia is becoming law in areas with sizable Muslim populations. Bowen argues that Western biases cause people to see religion as the focus of actions by Muslims, a perception that is not applied to people of other faiths. An illuminating look at Western perceptions of Islam. --Vanessa Bush", "related": ["B009ZRNQCS"], "rank": 1808949, "title": "Blaming Islam (Boston Review Books)", "author": "John R.

Turkey hunting is a tactical sport. For everything\nyou try and do to take a gobbler, he's got a different strategy to keep you\nfrom introducing lead to his head. Most of the time, the turkeys don't do what\nthey're supposed to do. After about 10 years of wondering why turkeys didn't do\nwhat I read they were supposed to do, I finally came to the realization that\nturkeys didn't read the same books and magazines that I did. I also realized\nthat every turkey I'd ever hunted had been an individual turkey, with his own\nset of rules and strategies to prevent me from taking him home for supper.\nAlthough you can amass a vast amount of turkey-hunting knowledge, nothing that\nyou learn always works on every turkey. To become the best turkey hunter you\never can be is a great goal, but it's an impossible mission if you think you'll\ntake every turkey you hear gobble. The wild turkey has the ability to keep\nturkey hunters humble. But in this book, I try and give you the information\nthat will help you stack the odds in your favor for success.", "related": [], "rank": 768920, "title": "Turkey Hunting Tactics eBook", "author": "John E.

During those years, he learned that reading science fiction and fantasy allowed him to escape the strangeness into the more understandable worlds crafted by Isaac Asimov, Piers Anthony, Marion Zimmer Bradley, and many other great writers.  As time went on he began to mold his own worlds.   Stephen now lives in Midlothian, Virginia, with his wife, daughter, and two white Chihuahuas that enjoy morphing from Therapuppies into miniature dragons at the sound of food being opened.

Its aim is to bring psychoanalytic theory to life, to make it accessible to a much wider range of readers, both lay and professional, than would normally be familiar with this kind of approach. In the simplest of terms it tells the most complex of stories: the story of the internal development of a person from infancy to old age. In so doing, it reflects and encompasses the generational structure of the clinic as a whole, tracing the interacting influences - between infant, child, adolescent and adult - on the nature and quality of emotional growth and development.This book provides a perspective on the relationship between psychoanalytic theory and the nature of human development, which is not currently available in written form. Following the major developmental phases from infancy to old age, the author lucidly explores those vital aspects of experience, which promote mental and emotional growth and those which impede it. In bringing together a wide range of clinical, non-clinical and literary examples it offers a detailed and accessible introduction to contemporary psychoanalytic thought and provides a personal and vivid approach to the elusive question of how the personality develops.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Six months and 20 lost pounds later, she realized that her plan worked better than she had ever dreamed. Inspired, she wrote \"The Candida Remedy\" so she could share her success, and has also published the journal she kept while healing from the candida overgrowth, titled \"Diary Of A Candida Sufferer: A Personal Journey Back To Health\".

I produced some good pencil images which sadly have now been lost. There was a drawing of an engine from a Rolls Royce Camargue. It was large, and the shading of it used up three pencils. I remember the hours I spent on its production during the summer holidays, and the music I listened to as I worked. I was destined to go to Art College, but family circumstances meant that I never got there. Instead, I finished up getting a job.  My working career started in Architecture, where with ink stained fingers and an adjustable setsquare I turned the architect’s concepts into technical drawings. Eventually the drawing boards were abandoned in favour of computers, which led me to forge a career using the dark arts of information technology. The technical world in which I found myself doesn't really cater for artists, and for a long time I didn't do anything creative. The artist in me had been well and truly suppressed.  Suppressed, but not forgotten, and certainly not gone. There was still a thread that connected us together. The artist called to me from the wilderness, whispering in my ear, subtlety altering my perception of things. He fed my mind when it needed to escape the tedium that work can sometimes be. Reading was the thread that bound us, and I don't remember a time when I haven’t had at least one book on the go.  Sometimes though, reading isn’t enough. There wasn't a specific point when I decided to write a novel. There was no revelation moment. One day I just started writing about how I had received the silver watch mentioned in Amantarra. I then attached a fantasy aspect to the gift, which led to the birth of Valheel, the creation of Elleria, Amantarra, and a puzzle surrounding all of them. The artist had escaped.  Several months after I published Amantarra on Kindle, I met someone I hadn't seen for thirty years. He was a friend of my father's and I've known him since I was four. At some point in the conversation I told him I was a published author. \"You haven't changed,\" was his comment. He seemed disappointed that I still retained some aspects from my childhood. Things that he thought I should have grown out of. Quite what he was expecting me to have become I don't know, but I make no apologies for disappointing him. I have never lost my fascination with the imagery that good story invokes. I hope I never will.", "related": [], "rank": 3532919, "title": "Amantarra", "author": "Richard J Galloway", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She couldn’t wait to learn to read and has led many lifetimes within the pages of great literature.

Her works span multiple categories including novels, short stories, and poetry in a blend of genres that range from very dark to extremely light and witty.  Lori’s book titles include Out-Of-Mind Experiences, Chocolate-Covered Eyes, Dance Of The Chupacabras, and An Ill Wind Blows.  She pens a humorous and darkly horrific monthly column called “Poetic Reflections” at www.trilllogicinnoventions.com. Be warned:  The author unapologetically takes pride in creatively reshaping the rules of writing and genres when it suits her style.

Young readers will appreciate the historical information about hunting, mining, and the age of steam, in addition to the detailed black-and-white illustrations that evoke the period. The story's themes of forgiveness, compassion, leadership, faith, and lovewill appeal to adults.Maya FleischmannSet in the pre-industrial revolution era, Woodcutter’s Revival is the story of two young men who leave their farms in search of work and greater opportunity. Friends since childhood, Raymond and Stewart are very different people, and although they plan to meet again at the same destination, the two find themselves on disparate paths.Woodcutter’s Revival effectively compares and contrasts Raymond and Stewart’s physical and spiritual journeys. To reach their mutual destination, Raymond takes a direct route, while Stewart opts for a more circuitous route through the mountains. Raymond finds work in the town of Discovery. Though he is displeased by his employer’s greed and lack of concern for his workers, he avoids confrontation in order to keep his job and maintain the approval of Victoria, his boss’s daughter. Meanwhile, Stewart saves the life of a man injured in the mountains and stays with him while he recuperates. Stewart is enlightened by the man’s stories about his brother’s betrayal and how he resolved his anger to finally find peace.Although the plot is not complex, the story contains elements of adventure and romance. The characters reveal inner motivations that change even for secondary characters like Victoria, whose priorities shift when she realizes that standing up for what is right is more important than turning a blind eye to injustice in the name of peace. Author Jerry Slauter’s simple writing style lends itself to the fable-like nature of this story while also allowing for different levels of interpretation and discussion. Young readers will appreciate the historical information about hunting, mining, and the age of steam, in addition to the detailed black-and-white illustrations that evoke the period. The story’s themes of forgiveness, compassion, leadership, faith, and love will appeal to adults.The story is spiritually based, with several biblical references, but it does not come across as preachy. Instead, Slauter uses religion as a parable and to inform the belief systems of his characters. For example, using the parable of the miner who couldn’t find silver although it was literally beneath his feet, Michael tells Stewart, “You won’t recognize your dreams when you reach them without the light.”Despite redundancies in the story’s details and some seemingly irrelevant elements, such as the introduction of a third travel companion,Woodcutter’s Revival is a thoughtful tale of two men and the how their experiences and choices impact their lives.Maya FleischmannForeword Clarion Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The lavish excesses of late-19th-century Newport, R.I., where every doting mama is looking for a title for her daughter, is the perfect hunting ground, but Gannon is repelled by the scene and escapes to the seashore, where he meets Audrey St. Clair, also an unwilling player in the marriage mart. Defying society's dictates and her dragon of a mother, Audrey's dream is to study music in Vienna. She devises a risky plan in which Gannon will pretend to court her for the summer and she will show him how to invest his money. At summer's end, Gannon can return to England wealthy enough to save Camberly and Audrey can freely leave for Vienna. But love intervenes and Audrey must choose between her dream and her man. While the prose can be overblown, the fun is in the caste system of Newport's summer social season, while the engaging characters fufill the expectations of the genre.(Feb.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The son of a Farmer Steve grew up in the Rural Cotswold’s where he learned shooting and hunting on the farm where his Father worked. Following 5 years service in the military (Royal Air Force) Steve joined the Hampshire Constabulary, in 1969, serving as an officer for 21 years. During his police service Steve became a certified Firearms instructor with the NRA (GB) and the NSRA (National Small Bore Rifle Association) He competed in local and National competitions, for a time he was secretary of his Divisional Police pistol club and did much to foster good relations with civil and military gun clubs in the area. During his service more and more regulations and restrictions were imposed on Gun owners, and inevitably the enforcement of these regulations fell on the shoulders of the City and County Police Forces. Steve found himself more and more at odds with the policy of gun control and the subsequent hardening of Police attitudes.   In 1995 Steve left the Police Force and became active in Politics, Still a member of the 2 main shooting organizations he had seen the slow strangulation of gun rights in the UK. And after a year with a single issue political group he joined the UK Independence Party after attending a public meeting against the increasing dominance of European Union.    After forming a local Branch of the party in his home town Steve campaigned in several local and National Elections, culminating in his being selected by the Party to fight for the Parliamentary seat for the Eastleigh Constituency in the UK General Election in 2001.  Steve failed to win the seat which was captured by the Liberal Democrats who were, among other issues, heavily in favor of Gun Control.     Following his defeat in the Election Steve continued to actively campaign with the party taking part in a 4 million strong National rally in London on September 22nd 2002 organized by the Countryside Alliance. A group supporting field sports and Countryside activities including Hunting, and Fishing.  In 2006 Steve met his wife Eva via the Internet and in 2007 they became engaged. The following November Steve moved to the USA and He and Eva were Married in Ketchikan southern Alaska,  In 2009 the couple settled in Kentucky where they bought a Farm and in 2010 opened a Firearms training School. Now a permanent US Resident Steve is a tireless campaigner for the second amendment rights.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Author, teacher, and advocate of children, Penny Wagner earned the knowledge that no two people are alike and that we all possess the inert ability to \"make the world a better place\" The hero of her favorite book is the grandpa in Barbara Cooney's Miss Rumphius. The grandpa in this award-winning children's book is a seascape artist who allows his granddaughter to paint the clouds in the sky while telling her, \"You must travel to faraway places, own a cottage by the sea, and find a way to make the world better\" \"Yesterday\" written by Paul McCartney is a reflection of Ms. Wagner's life, not living with regrets, but recognizing that life binds our past to the present and the future. She will complete the scrabble of her life, which may be descending now, but she has eons to go as an author, a grandmom (currently just two cats), and a purveyor of truth to share with those who may still come to blossom. When she was a child, her two older brothers enjoyed sporting events with their dad. It wasn't uncommon for him to bring them to a twilight double header at Yankee Stadium. Ms. Wagner wanted to go too, but they would venture without her, saying, \" You're a girl\" This is still recorded on her memory. Later, as her brothers got girlfriends or moved into college dorms, she won a place with her dad. Today she is an avid Yankee fan and loves watching the games. Ms. Wagner resides in St Augustine, Florida, and her gentle companion is a yellow lab named Kingsley. Her favorite pastime is walking Kingsley by the sea.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It can also be highly toxic. This book offers a comprehensive review of the toxicity of methanol and its effects on humans, animals, and the environment. Much of the current research on methanol's toxicity involves animal models; however, the author explains how the results of this research can apply to humans.The Toxicology of Methanolbegins with an introduction to methanol production and markets. It then explores the impact of methanol on the environment, presenting realistic scenarios that demonstrate what can happen when large quantities of methanol are accidentally released into the environment. Next, the book covers:Human toxicity, including exposure, metabolism, in utero exposure, controlled human studies, and management of methanol poisoningAnimal and aquatic toxicity, including acute toxicity, irritation, sensitization, and repeat exposuresDevelopmental and reproductive toxicology of methanol as well as the pathogenesis of methanol-induced birth defectsKey differences between PBPK models of methanol disposition in mice and in humansOxidative stress and species differences in the metabolism, developmental toxicity, and carcinogenic potential of methanol and ethanolThe final chapter is dedicated to methanol and cancer, exploring potential mechanisms such as genotoxicity and oxidative damage. Each chapter in the book ends with conclusions underscoring what we can glean from current research results. Each chapter also includes extensive references leading to the primary literature in the field.Reviewing all the latest research studies,The Toxicology of Methanolwill help toxicologists, industrial hygienists, environmental scientists, and product safety professionals better understand and manage the hazards of methanol toxicity.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This,\"\nshe said as she came to a glass case, \"is a glass slipper. The only one remaining\nfrom the story of Cinderella, what Americans believe to be a fairy tale, but was\nindeed a true occurrence here in Normandy.\nThe daughter of Duke Phillipe de Moreau, forced to work as a slave in her own home,\nwas given these slippers as a gift from the gods and transformed into a princess.\nAnd that is what she became.\"I snickered. \"Yeah, sure. I suppose\nyou want a thousand dollars for me to try to squeeze that shoe on my fat foot.\"\"Not a single Euro. Not one.\"\nShe gestured to a chair. \"Please, try it on. You have nothing to lose.\"\"Except my pride. But I lost that\na long time ago after seeing myself in the mirror, so I guess I will.\" I sat\ndown and slipped off my shoe, embarrassed of the pungent way my feet smelled even\nthough I tried my best to scrub in between my chubby toes everyday. She wiped my\nfoot off with a moist cloth. Removing the slipper from the glass case, the shoe\nmesmerized her gaze as the glass caught the light and sent a thousand sparkles dancing\non the walls of the room.\"There is no way a shoe that small\nis going to fit my foot,\" I said.\"Try it. You will see.\"She carefully handed me the glass\nslipper. I groaned inwardly as I bent down to reach my foot. My belly rolls impeded\nthe movement. I pulled my leg up and placed my ankle upon my opposite knee and slipped\nmy toes into the shoe. The shoe didn't look like it would fit over my heel. I removed\nthe glass slipper from my foot and gave an exasperated sigh.\"Try,\" she insisted. \"Try\nharder.\" I pulled and pulled at the shoe, until\nmiraculously, the glass grew warm and the shoe molded to my foot. I placed my slippered\nfoot down on the ground with a loud clack. \"Now,\" she said. \"Behold.\"She led me to a mirror. At first I\nhobbled, but as I balanced, the shoe began to feel comfortable. I gasped as I looked\ninto the mirror. Staring back at me was a slender woman with blonde hair and blue\neyes just like mine, but with a chin, cheekbones, and a long, lean body. She disappeared\nslowly, and there I was, my fat, pudgy old self. My shoulders sagged with disappointment,\nand yet the glass slipper still fit.\"Do not despair,\" she said.\n\"Demain. Awaken with the rise of\nthe sun, and you shall become the true beauty you are inside. But when you forget\nthat true beauty lies within, the spell will be broken, and all shall be as it was.\nI will take the slipper from you now. \"S'il\nvous plaît, do have a look at the beads.\" I purchased a trinket necklace\nand a few pairs of earrings and left to board the train back to Paris.", "related": ["B008UWBJB4"], "rank": 1663595, "title": "The Best Kept Secret In Normandy eBook", "author": "Liz Newman", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However, complicated calculations are replaced with figures and thought experiments, the text being formulated in such a way that the reader will be able to understand the gist intuitively. The first part of the book focuses on the essentials of special relativity. Explanations are provided of the famous equivalence between mass and energy and of why Einstein was able to use the theory of electrodynamics as a template for his \"electrodynamics of moving bodies\", simply because besides the speed of light, the electric charge itself is also absolute, leading to the relativity of other physical quantities. General relativity is then introduced, mainly with the help of thought experiments. Reference is made to the previously introduced special relativity and the equivalence principle and, using many figures, it is explained how space-time is bending under gravity. The climax of the book comes with the Einstein equations of gravity that describe the way in which matter bends space-time. The reader is shown how to obtain the famous Schwarzschild solution. There follows a numerically correct and yet intuitive explanation of the classic effects such as light bending or the movement of the perihelion. The book concludes by explaining the Friedmann model of the big bang and why the theory of gravity does not fit with quantum theory.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a political biography; of Herzl's family life, his loves and his hatreds we learn little. With almost nothing but his will, he wrote, cajoled, talked and organised Zionism into existence. Between 1895 and 1897, in two short years, he provided the movement with its key text (Der Judenstaat), its destination (Palestine) and its organisational birth (the first Zionist Congress in Basle). Then he hawed his ideas around the leaders of Europe, to see if he could make a reality from the dream. These unlikely peregrinations are captured perfectly by Avineri. Without them there would have been no Israel. -- David Aaronovitch THE TIMES 20140104 The great strength of Avineri's immensely readable biography is to deliver Herzl in all his tortured complexity and - something not always given its due - the philosophical clarity of his diagnosis of what had befallen the Jews in the modern age and what might be done about their predicament. He had the beard of a poet but a brain for realpolitik. As one might expect from Avineri, who is first and foremost a powerful historian of political thought, this is the most chewily cogent account yet of Herzl the political thinker and doer. -- Simon Schama FINANCIAL TIMES 20140104 What...Shlomo Avineri, a professor of political sciences at Jerusalem's Hebrew University, offers is a different perspective on Herzl's life. Professor Avineri largely relies on Herzl's own writings, especially his obsessively written diary, rather than so much on secondary sources as many other books do. This device has the advantage of explaining Herzl's thoughts, as well as his actions. -- Alistair Dawber THE INDEPENDENT 20131214 It was Austrian politics, not a French miscarriage of justice [the Dreyfuss case], which moved Herzl towards Jewish separatism, Avineri explains, with a rather more complex story than the one the professor tells us is taught to Israeli schoolchildren. Political liberalism had ended official anti-Jewish discrimination in Austria and widened the franchise; but, to the horror of liberals like Herzl, anti-Semitic demagogues were elected. It seemed that the more democratic Austrian society was, the more anti-Semitic it became. -- Jad Adams SUNDAY TELEGRAPH 20140105", "related": [], "rank": 2141692, "title": "Herzl", "author": "Shlomo Avineri", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I have a deep connection to the story and a visceral understanding of the actual grounds over which Washington and his men trod and literally saved the American cause from complete annihilation in 1776. I lived in the town of Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania for just over 15 years. During Washington’s time it was called Taylorsville. On my way to New York City when I was commuted there full time I must of passed by McKonkey’s Ferry literally thousands of times. And I often thought, “I’d love to do THAT story…The Crossing.\"Opprtunity CalledI finally got the opportunity when I was asked to write and direct a film called, America’s First D-day Washington Crossing, being produced by the Continental Film Alliance based in Doylestown, PA. And I literally threw myself into the project writing, researching and finding the best ‘George Washington’ living historian on the planet (John Koopman III). We completed filming the actual Crossing scenes last winter in Bucks County, PA and intend to complete the filming later this year. More on that in the (About the Film) section of the book. I loved recreating the time period and aligning myself to that era and those dark days. They were desperate times indeed. The majority of Washington’s men were sick and ill clothed and armed. They had nothing but their will and the courage to carry the fight to the enemy. And that audacity and subsequent victories at Trenton and Princeton sent shock waves across an ocean to Great Britain. The British Parliament and populace realized when word reached them of Washington’s success that the American war would be a long one and in all likelihood Britain would not emerge victorious.The Turning PointWashington Crossing WAS the turning point in the American Revolution, a watershed moment much like Pickett’s Charge at Gettysburg. Combatants on both sides in both wars realized that whatever the future held, it would be forever changed. And for me The Crossing goes even further. I believe it forged and defined the American soldier and character and that is the reason for the title, “America’s First D-Day”. American courage and fighting spirit was born on the banks of the Delaware and we can trace a direct line almost two hundred years back from Normandy to Trenton. Americans are a brave yet compassionate people as Washington demonstrated to the British. He knew history and humanity would stand in judgment of him. And that is why studying and reading our own history is so enriching. It reminds us of exactly who we are and guides us, hopefully, towards where we are going.", "related": [], "rank": 1789985, "title": "Washington's Crossing", "author": "Robert Child", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At the age of 8, boys passion for martial arts was recognized and he began learning personally from the great master Bo-Wan. He was trained in various methods: Wing Chun, Shao Lin Guan, Tai Chi Guan, Xing Xi Guam. He studied Chi Kung with my master and Buddhist monks. Just before his Sifu left this world, he told to 14 year old boy: \"Xi (his name for author), you have to go and spread this knowledge. You can do much more then I ever could, you will see.\" Author felt humbled and obligated to carry out his wishes and he did so. After finishing his studies of traditional Chinese medicine with Dr. Le Cai, author moved to the Western world. He often stated that he never understood what his Sifu meant by saying 'you can do much more'. He did not say 'better', but 'more'. He explained that despite spending more then 30 years in teaching martial arts, Chi Kung, and related disciplines just recently he was able to understand why he used the term 'much more'. It was not because of anything in me. It is because of the Internet and modern technology that I really am able to fully fulfill his instructions. I am more than grateful to all my students and readers who help me, and continue reading and using my books. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, and God bless you.", "related": ["B00D99MAZC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Mr. Taylor is a retired California Peace Officer, educated in criminal psychology and geology. Currently a Biblical teacher and counselor, he offers us some most unique insights into the profound attributes of God. He has also authored 'Hiking Life's Difficult Trails', an in depth look at life's spiritual dilemmas, now in two editions, the second of which is solely for High Country Hikers, whose desire is to learn more about what's behind the wonder and splendor encountered along the high trails. 'Knowing Just Who You Are', is the latest in this 'self-help category', and is for sure an eye-opening look at ourselves as individuals-a treatise on body, mind and spirit.  Mr. Taylor has in addition produced books that he labels, 'a bit of fiction and reality'. Among his bestsellers in this category are, (1) 'Lone Pine'; a story of love undying, (2) 'A High Sierra Christmas'; an untold tale of Jeremiah Johnson, (3) 'Three Days in Lone Pine'; and untold tale of the High Sierra 1873, and his latest western, (4) 'Still Waters'; legend of the white wolf. (Note: 2, 3, & 4 are now part of the new 'Lone Pine Western' series.)  'The Sun, The Glass, and The Leaning Rock'; the secret of the lost Dutchman's gold (also published under the 1984 title, 'A Second Chance'; a daring tale of high adventure), kicks off an exciting mystery series involving characters Rod Florea and Mitch Holland, whose expertise in treasure hunting and route finding are unmatched anywhere in the country. The second book in this series is 'The Secret of Monument Valley'; the Trail of the Anasazi, which solves the mystery surrounding the disappearance of the Anasazi people of the desert southwest.  In the third book of the mystery series, 'Treasure of the High Sierra'; Dead Men's Gold, their treasure hunting and route finding experience leads them on a most enlightening but dangerous journey, where they come to the aid of two teenagers in their quest for old, hidden pirate treasure. Unfortunately they must deal with the ghastly spirits of long dead buccaneers! Expect more great stories in both this mystery series and the new Lone Pine Western series. Coming soon in the mystery series: The Secret of Death Valley, (late 2013).", "related": ["B00FED5D8C"], "rank": 1380987, "title": "STILL WATERS: Legend of the White Wolf (A Lone Pine Western Book 3)", "author": "Mark Stephen Taylor", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While another short story, ‘BRANDI AND THE TRENCH COAT MAN,’ was adapted to a screenplay by Film Maker Josh Allen and became the short film entitled:  ‘EVIL WITHIN.’  It has since been taken to various Film Festivals from Louisville, Kentucky to Los Angeles, California.    One Screenplay; a Romantic Comedy called, ‘FIRES OF EVA’ has been optioned to 'S Entertainment' in Canada - The film company that produced the movie ‘PUMP UP THE VOLUME’ Starring Christian Slater.     Another Screenplay, a Comedy called, ‘SÉANCE,’ was Quarter Finalist in the 2002 'Next Success Writing Contest' in Hollywood, CA. Actress Kathy Najimy has read this script and expressed strong interest in portraying the character ‘Rebecca Spritz,’ once a Director has signed on to it. Other scripts include: An Action/Suspense/Thriller, ‘WASTELAND STALKERS.’  An Action/Adventure/Thriller, ‘LEAVING BABYLON.’ And a Horror/Drama, ‘DEADLOCK.’     Brad’s first Novel, ‘THE MELTING’ is a Horror story stemming from Vengeance of the Dead. This is a truly original first novel and has been endorsed by Horror veteran ANNE RICE in her statement:     “Brad, Congratulations and all blessings on The Melting. You know the secret; it’s courage. We need you and your work.”    Brad’s second Novel, The Fictional Biography of a Warlock called,  ‘TROPAES,’ is the story of a man born in 1822 with certain metaphysical powers that develop with each year of his life. By his 28th birthday, he has acquired full power and ceases to age from that moment on. This story spans his lifetime up to the year 2005.       Brad third Novel is a murder mystery full of deceit, mystery, murder and mayhem called “DAMEN BRIAR.”   And now he has unleashed the Two Volume set of books featuring his complete collection of short stories - TENDRILS; Book I -Creepy- and TENDRILS; Book II -Crawly-.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The son of a Swedish chef and a Russian language instructor, Olden knew from an early age that he wanted to leave Sweden and conquer the world. He tried enlisting in the army to satisfy this dream, but a bad knee led to his rejection.  Unsure of what to do next, Olden applied for a scholarship to study economics in Copenhagen. There he met two people who would have an enormous influence on his life: his best friend Alex and a woman named Marie. After Alex moved to China and Marie ruthlessly broke Olden's heart, Olden realized he needed to make a fresh start. On a cold, wet winter's night he decided to follow Alex east. He emptied his meager bank account, bought a one-way ticket on the next available flight, and landed in Shanghai at 9:25 a.m., March 8, 1999. It was the Year of the Rabbit and the start of Olden's ten-year adventure in modern China.", "related": ["B00I88BUL4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
