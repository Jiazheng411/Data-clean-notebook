The sleuth is John the Eunuch, lord chamberlain to Emperor Justinian. When the body of Leukos, the Keeper of the Plate, is found in a filthy alley behind a house of ill repute, the emperor asks John to investigate. John obliges because, as Leukos's friend, he can't imagine what a devout Christian such as Leukos was doing in a whorehouse or who would have wanted to murder the kindly man. The obvious suspect is an old, itinerant soothsayer. But again, John can't fathom why his friend would be courting pagan practices such as having his fortune told. Oddly, after John talks to him, the old man vanishes, rumored to have drowned in the sea while trying to flee the city. Another suspect is a knight from King Arthur's court on a quest for the Holy Grail. After the soothsayer disappears, however, Emperor Justinian seems suddenly cool to John's efforts to pursue evidence against other possible culprits. John's investigations are further hampered by the sudden appearance of his ex-wife and a daughter he did not know he had: years earlier, John had been captured and sold into slavery, forever separated from his wife and emasculated by barbarians. Their prose suffers from affected archaisms, but the authors gracefully intertwine John's personal history and the traffic in holy artifacts with the early history of Christianity.

Dickinson grew up in a military family, living in Portugal and Japan as a child before settling down in western Massachusetts. After graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point, he accepted a commission in the US Air Force and spent twelve years as a hurricane hunter and air traffic controller. His duties included flying into the eyes of 40 hurricanes throughout the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, sampling radioactive debris clouds from Chinese nuclear explosions, and tracking incoming Russian ICBMs over the North Pacific. His first novel, Hurricane Alley, reflects many of his military adventures. After leaving the Air Force, Dickinson drifted into the telecommunications industry, starting as the manager of the communications center for the University of Washington. Eventually, he became a consultant to cellular telephone companies, working in Bogota Columbia to build that nation’s first wireless telephone network during the height of the drug war there. After settling down in Seattle with his wife, Dick moved into the wireless E911 industry, becoming an industry expert in technical issues related to the unique challenges of delivering E911 calls from wireless and VoIP telephones to the correct E911 answering points throughout the country. Throughout his telecommunications career, Dickinson maintained his avocation as a novelist, publishing The Silent Men and its sequel, The Warlord, and now, Acts of Honor.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In fact, he hadn't even looked at her, though he'd been seated directly across from her in the lounge car of the train for the past fifteen minutes. He seemed to focus his attention on the wintry Texas landscape that zipped past the window. But several times Marin had met his gaze in the reflection of the glass.Yes, he was watching her.That kicked up her heart rate a couple of notches. A too-familiar nauseating tightness started to knot Marin's stomach.Was it starting all over again?Was he watching her, hoping that she'd lead him to her brother, Dexter? Or was this yet another attempt by her parents to insinuate themselves into her life?It'd been over eight months since the last time this happened. A former \"business associate\" of her brother who was riled that he'd paid for a \"product\" that Dexter hadn't delivered. The man had followed her around Fort Worth for days. He hadn't been subtle about it, either, and that had made him seem all the more menacing. And she hadn't given birth to Noah yet then.The stakes were so much higher now.Marin hugged her sleeping son closer to her chest. He smelled like baby shampoo and the rice cereal he'd had for lunch. She brushed a kiss on his forehead and rocked gently. Not so much for him—Noah was sound asleep and might stay that way for the remaining hour of the trip to San Antonio. No, the rocking, the kiss and the snug embrace were more for her benefit, to help steady her nerves.And it worked.\"Cute kid,\" she heard someone say. The man across from her. Who else? There were no other travelers in this particular section of the lounge car.Marin lifted her gaze. Met his again. But this time it wasn't through the buffer of the glass, and she clearly saw his eyes, a blend of silver and smoke, framed with indecently long, dark eyelashes.She studied him a moment, trying to decide if she knew him. He was on the lanky side. Midnight-colored hair. High cheekbones. A classically chiseled male jaw.The only thing that saved him from being a total pretty boy was the one-inch scar angled across his right eyebrow, thin but noticeable. Not a precise surgeon's cut, a jagged, angry mark left from an old injury. It conjured images of barroom brawls, tattooed bikers and bashed beer bottles. Not that Marin had firsthand knowledge of such things.But she would bet that he did.He wore jeans that fit as if they'd been tailor-made for him, a dark blue pullover shirt that hugged his chest and a black leather bomber jacket. And snakeskin boots—specifically diamondback rattlesnake. Pricey and conspicuous footwear.No, she didn't know him. Marin was certain she would have remembered him—a realization that bothered her because he was hot, and she was sorry she'd noticed.He tipped his head toward Noah. \"I meant your baby,\" he clarified. \"Cute kid.\"\"Thank you.\" She looked away from the man, hoping it was the end of their brief conversation.It wasn't.\"He's what… seven, eight months old?\"\"Eight,\" she provided.\"He reminds me a little of my nephew,\" the man continued. \"It must be hard, traveling alone with a baby.\"That brought Marin's attention racing across the car. What had provoked that remark? She searched his face and his eyes almost frantically, trying to figure out if it was some sort of veiled threat.He held up his hands, and a nervous laugh sounded from deep within his chest. \"Sorry. Didn't mean to alarm you. It's just I noticed you're wearing a medical alert bracelet.\"Marin glanced down at her left wrist. The almond-shaped metal disc was peeking out from the cuff of her sleeve. With its classic caduceus symbol engraved in crimson, it was like his boots—impossible to miss.\"I'm epileptic,\" she said.\"Oh.\" Concern dripped from the word.\"Don't worry,\" she countered. \"I keep my seizures under control with meds. I haven't had one in over five years.\"She immediately wondered why in the name of heaven she'd volunteered that personal information. Her medical history wasn't any of his business; it was a sore spot she didn't want to discuss.\"Is your epilepsy the reason you took the train?\" he asked. \"I mean, instead of driving?\"Marin frowned at him. \"I thought the train would make the trip easier for my son.\"He nodded, apparently satisfied with her answer to his intrusive question. When his attention strayed back in the general direction of her bracelet, Marin followed his gaze. Down to her hand. All the way to her bare ring finger.Even though her former fiancé, Randall Davidson, had asked her to marry him, he'd never given her an engagement ring. It'd been an empty, bare gesture. A thought that riled her even now. Randall's betrayal had cut her to the bone.Shifting Noah into the crook of her arm, she reached down to collect her diaper bag. \"I think I'll go for a little walk and stretch my legs.\"And change seats,she silently added.Judging from the passengers she'd seen get on and off, the train wasn't crowded, so moving into coach seating shouldn't be a problem. In fact, she should have done it sooner.\"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I made you uncomfortable with my questions.\"His words stopped her because they were sincere. Or at least he sounded that way. Of course, she'd been wrong before. It would take another lifetime or two for her to trust her instincts.And that was the reason she reached for the bag again.\"Stay,please,\"he insisted. \"It'll be easier for me to move.\" He got up, headed for the exit and then stopped, turning back around to face her. \"I was hitting on you.\"Marin blinked. \"You… what?\"\"Hitting on you,\" he clarified.Oh.That took her a few moments to process.\"Really?\" Marin asked, sounding far more surprised than she wanted.He chuckled, something low, husky and male. Something that trickled through her like expensive warm whiskey. \"Really.\" But then, the lightheartedness faded from his eyes, and his jaw muscles started to stir. \"I shouldn't have done it. Sorry.\"Again, he seemed sincere. So maybe he wasn't watching her after all. Well, not for surveillance any way. Maybe he was watching her because she was a woman. Odd, that she'd forgotten all about basic human attraction and lust.\"You don't have to leave,\" Marin let him know. Because she suddenly didn't know what to do with her fidgety hands, she ran her fingers through Noah's dark blond curls. \"Besides, it won't be long before we're in San Antonio.\"He nodded, and it had an air of thankfulness to it. \"I'm Quinn Bacelli. Most people though just call me Lucky.\"She almost gave him a fake name. Old habits. But it was the truth that came out of her mouth. \"Marin Sheppard.\"He smiled. It was no doubt a lethal weapon in his arsenal of ways to get women to fall at his feet. Or into his bed. It bothered Marin to realize that she wasn't immune to it.Good grief. Hadn't her time with Randall taught her anything?\"Well, Marin Sheppard,\" he said, taking his seat again. \"No more hitting on you. Promise.\"Good.She mentally repeated that several times, and then wondered why she felt mildly disappointed.Noah stirred, sucked at a nonexistent bottle and then gave a pouty whimper when he realized it wasn't there. His eyelids fluttered open, and he blinked, focused and looked up at Marin with accusing blue-green eyes that were identical to her own. He made another whimper, probably to let her know that he wasn't pleased about having his nap interrupted.Her son shifted and wriggled until he was in a sitting position in her lap, and the new surroundings immediately caught his attention. What was left of his whimpering expression evaporated. He examined his puppy socks, the window, the floor, the ceiling and the ruby-red exit sign. Even her garnet heart necklace. Then, his attention landed on the man seated across from him.Noah grinned at him.The man grinned back. \"Did you have a good nap, buddy?\"Noah babbled a cordial response, something the two males must have understood, because they shared another smile.Marin looked at Quinn \"Lucky\" Bacelli. Then, at her son. Their smiles seemed to freeze in place.There was no warning.A deafening blast ripped through the car.One moment Marin was sitting on the seat with her son cradled in her arms, and the next she was flying across the narrow space right at Lucky.Everything moved fast. So fast. And yet it happened in slow motion, too. It seemed part of some nightmarish dream where everything was tearing apart at the seams.Debris spewed through the air. The diaper bag, the magazine she'd been reading, the very walls themselves. All of it, along with Noah and her.Something slammed into her back and the left side of her head. It knocked the breath from her. The pain was instant—searing—and it sliced right through her, blurring her vision.She and Noah landed in Lucky's arms, propelled against him. But he softened the fall. He turned, immediately, pushing them down against the seat and crawling over them so he could shelter them with his body. Still, the debris pelted her legs and her head. She felt the sting of the cuts on her skin and reached out for something, anything, to use as protection. Her fingers found the diaper bag, and she used it to block the shards so they wouldn't hit Noah.The train's brakes screamed. Metal scraped against metal. The crackle and scorched smell of sparks flying, shouts of terror, smoke and dust filled the air.Amid all the chaos, she heard her baby cry.Noah was terrified, and his shrill piercing wail was a plea for help.Marin tried to move him so she could see his face, so she could make sure he was all right, but her peripheral vision blurred. It closed in, like thick fog, nearly blinding her.\"Help my son,\" she begged. She couldn't bear his cries. They echoed in her head. Like razor-sharp daggers. Cutting right through her.Sweet heaven, was he hurt?There was some movement, and she felt Lucky maneuver his hand between them. \"He's okay, I think.\"His qualifier nearly caused Marin to ...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And while it's been proofed several times, there are still some\npunctuation errors and the occasional typo. While I'm proud of the story, it\nbegs for a good editor to pound it into better final form. It won't be me,\nhowever. I take to heart the advice of Asimov (at least, I think it was Asimov)\nto avoid the temptation to re-write a book with the benefit of several years'\nlearning curve. At some point, you have to walk away. A common reader reaction that the first book is confusing\nuntil it settles in is the criticism I take most to heart, since the last thing\nI wanted to do was make the book hard to approach. Culling historical\ninformation from so many source texts spanning eons led me to begin the story\nin the middle of things, as one slice of a much broader history. A good editor\nwould no doubt have suggested a way of introducing the broader history as\npreface, then setting the stage, then introducing the characters and their\ninterrelationships. I chose, wisely or unwisely, to toss the reader into the\nfray. I was hoping that the resulting sense of dislocation would best convey\nthe strangeness of the Irredente universe. A criticism that bothers me is that the vocabulary is too\ndifficult. I have tried to place individual characters in unique contexts\npartly through their individual manners of speaking. In cases of high-church\nofficials, for example, the language is dense and often slippery or difficult\n-- pedantic, academic. In cases of lowerdeckmen on spaceships, by contrast, the\nlanguage is coarse and concrete. Throughout, the limited-omniscient\nthird-person narration remains the same, an attempt to convey a sense of\nviewing the characters and events through a glass. The reader is involved in\nthe translation of coded communication equally as many of the characters are.\nThe accusation that I employ big words to try to sound smart isn't true -- or\nat least, it's not something I've set out to do. I use big words either to cast\ndoubt on the enterprise of signification itself, or else to situate\ncommunications between characters in specific contexts. As a reader, I rarely\nuse a dictionary to look up unfamiliar words; I just let it ride, seeing what\ndevelops. I hope my readers will do the same. Book I is now available in print. Book II will be in print\nmid-2012. Book III won't be completed until late 2012 or early 2013, but I\nanticipate releasing it in print and e-book formats at the same time.", "related": ["B005578UHI"], "rank": 1779123, "title": "Out From Edom", "author": "J.

Irvin Alexander's gripping memoir of the fall of the Philippines, the Bataan Death March, and his three and a half years as a prisoner of war during World War II. Originally written in 1949 but not published until now, Alexander's remarkable and chilling odyssey is told with clarity and stark realism. As a U.S. infantry officer assigned to the Philippine Army, Alexander was wounded in combat and decorated for heroism in the losing battle for Bataan. But the inevitable surrender to the Japanese was just the start of the nightmare. The brutality of the Death March was exceeded only by the horrors that awaited American POWs in fetid prison camps and ships. Starvation, disease, madness, and torture were the POWs' greatest enemies, and death was the only escape. This is an astonishing story of human suffering, courage, ingenuity, and hope. Its insight and imagery make it a superb example of one man's victory over despair. Strongly recommended for all libraries and historical collections.?Col. William D.

After savagely murdering most of his family, they shot him three times and left him for dead. Miraculously, he survived, only to spend the next few years fighting for his life and running from the Khmer Rouge along with his remaining family members. Eventually, he and his siblings made their way to a refugee camp where his older sister bought his freedom. In this memoir, written with the assistance of his college professor, Keat paints a poignant portrait of life as a child in Cambodia in the 1970s. His skills, cunning, and sheer will to survive enabled him to endure devastating occurrences and difficult living conditions. The story is not for the faint of heart, as suffering torture at the hands of soldiers, subsisting solely off of rice chaff, and being forced to sleep among human remains are only some of the atrocities he suffered. Keat's story is compelling and concise, and readers will find themselves invested in his eventual escape.—Kelly McGorray, Glenbard South High School, Glen Ellyn, ILEND", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Losing their two hired men to various dangers but picking up four more travelers from a primitive village along the way, the explorers find Mendip, where they encounter orphaned children, a boatful of treasure, and hordes of hungry zombies. As usual, Sebastian attracts much female attention, rather inexplicably as he displays very little personality or dash in this installment, although to his credit he remains true to his faraway love, Jenna. There is plenty of bloodshed, with both friends and enemies dying like flies; the interlude at the village is puzzling; and the zombies add shopworn thrills. The ever-vocal, ever-hungry Max provides comic relief, and Sebastian Darke's fans will likely enjoy the action, but this is the most disappointing entry of the series so far.—Eva Mitnick, Los Angeles Public Library(c) Copyright 2010.

(C. H. Spurgeon) Richard Sibbes was known in London in the early 17th century as \"the Heavenly Doctor Sibbes.\" He is known as a Biblical exegete, and as a representative, with William Perkins and John Preston, of what has been called \"main-line\" Puritanism. He was the author of several devotional works expressing intense religious feeling The Saint's Cordial (1629), The Bruised Reed and Smoking Flax (1631, exegesis of Isaiah 42:3), The Soules Conflict (1635), etc. A volume of sermons appeared in 1630, dedicated to Horace Vere, 1st Baron Vere of Tilbury and his wife Lady Mare. Most of the other works were first published by Thomas Goodwin and Philip Nye, after Sibbes died. The content belied the mainly moderate and conforming attitudes for which Sibbes was known in his lifetime. Beames of Divine Light, A Description of Christ in Three Sermons and Bowels Opened appeared in 1639, as did The Returning Backslider, sermons on the Book of Hosea. A complete edition was published 1862-4 in Edinburgh, in seven volumes, by James Nichol, with a biographical memoir by Alexander Grosart. His works were much read in New England. Thomas Hooker, prominent there from 1633, was directly influenced by Sibbes, and his \"espousal theology\", using marriage as a religious metaphor, draws on The Bruised Reed and Bowels Opened. The poet George Herbert was a contemporary, and there are suggestions on parallels. Where Herbert speaks in The Church Militant about the westward movement of the propagation of the gospel, Christopher Hill comments that this may have come from The Bruised Reed.[ Other examples have been proposed by Doerksen. Sibbes was cited by the Methodist John Wesley. The Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon studied his craft in Sibbes, Perkins and Thomas Manton. The evangelical Martyn Lloyd-Jones wrote in the highest terms of his own encounter with the work of Sibbes.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He puts the Jordan phenomenon into historical perceptive, correlating the man's success with the rise in popularity of the N.B.A. and the changes in the style of the game over the years. In addition, he explores the relationship between athletics and the marketing of products. Jordan's latest career as a minor league baseball player is touched upon in the last few pages. While at times insightful, this book does have its drawbacks. For one thing, it is sure to disappoint the many readers who pick it up expecting more on Jordan's life and less philosophizing on the state of sports today. And even the philosophizing doesn't completely succeed; not all of the ideas are fully developed and the entire approach is somewhat disjointed. Lipsyte does avoid the over-awed, gee-whiz tone of many sports biographies, but he sometimes goes too far the other way and simply seems grumpy. The text is illustrated with black-and-white photographs of Jordan and other important figures in the history of basketball. Other biographies on this superstar are likely to have more appeal to young fans.Todd Morning, Schaumburg Township Public Library, ILCopyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The local banker is pressuring the Whitcombs to sell their land to the Chicago and North Western railway, promising to foreclose on their mortgage if they refuse. This prompts Early's Uncle Jesse, 19, to head west and find gold, disappearing under suspicion of bank robbery. After he writes that he has found gold but suspects that it will be stolen, Early sneaks away and signs on to a wagon train destined for Cherry Creek and Pike's Peak. A representative of the railroad is also traveling with the wagon trains, and the boy suspects that he wants to find Jesse and prevent him from helping his family save the farm. Early makes an unlikely ally in Lizzy Bunderly, the free-spirited daughter of his wagon-train employer, and the two friends face heartache, hardship, and loss while learning the value of endurance on this journey that takes them across the wild, unsettled territory. The novel deals with difficult times in the life of a young person, but emphasizes Early's optimism and hope for better days. The lessons he learns as a result of the choices he makes, as opposed to those made by his uncle, reveal the importance of making decisions wisely. The period reproductions add much to the understanding of an earlier way of life. The chapters are short and broken up into diary format so as to mimic travel journals of the early wagon train adventurers.

Her writings provide scriptural prayer instruction to help you pray more effectively for those things that concern you and your family and for other prayer assignments. Her teachings on prayer, the personal growth on the intercessor, emotional healing and related subjects have brought understanding, hope, healing, and liberty to the discouraged and emotionally wounded. She is a woman of prayer and praise whose highest form of worship is the study of God s Word. Her greatest desire is to know God. Word Ministries, Inc. is a prayer and teaching ministry. Germaine believes that God called her to teach the practical application of the Word of Truth for successful victorious living. After years of searching diligently for truth and trying again and again to come out of depression, she decided that she was a mistake. Out of the depths of despair she called upon the Name of the Lord, and the light of God's presence invaded the room where she was sitting. It was in that moment that she experienced the warmth of God's love; old things passed away, and she felt brand new. She discovered a motivation for living life had a purpose. Living in the presence of God she has found unconditional love and acceptance, healing for crippled emotions, contentment that overcomes depression, peace in the midst of adverse circumstances and grace for developing healthy relationships. The ongoing process of transformation evolved into praying for others, and the prayer of intercession became her prayer focus. Germaine is the daughter of the late Reverend A.H. Buck and Donnis Brock Griffin. She and her husband, Everette, have four children, and their prayer assignments increase as grandchildren and great-grandchildren are born.

Her father wishes to send her crotchety aunt Hildegarde to be her new live-in chaperone.  Emma is ready to go on with her life. She wants to avoid her aunt's moving in, so she jumps back into the social scene with gusto.  Nicholas Arden had been a friend of Emma and her late husband.  The dashing bachelor's warmth to her in the past had led Emma to believe he would be open to a relationship with her.  However, Emma throws away whatever chance she might have had with him -- she proposes to him the first time she sees him after the prescribed mourning period is over!  Nick is shocked at her boldness;  his Marry you ? echoes painfully in her heart.  Nick does esteem Emma, however.  He offers to help Emma evaluate her suitors' suitability, and she accepts.  He arranges for her to meet new eligible fellows, including his cousin, Lord Philmore.  Emma's father makes his own stringent standards for Emma's new love very clear.  Or perhaps a Season in London would enable her to find a worthy prospect?  Between Emma's feelings and Nick's judgment, it's not clear that any of the first several gentlemen Emma sees will do.  Nick's new role gives Emma and Nick the opportunity to become re-acquainted under the changed circumstances of her being unmarried.  Having gotten to know her assets and her needs better, Nick realizes who is the perfect man for her, and he's right under their noses.  Joan Smith's storytelling is smooth -- she's mastered the special world of the Regency period.  The characters'  dry wit is enjoyable.  She paces the resolution of the tale in a skillful, satisfying way.  You'll be surprised at the whirlwind turn of events beginning with Lord Philmore's having an accident and Emma's coming to the rescue, and ending with unexpected guests at a ball held by Nick.  The ending is tender and delightful.Readers who love regencies love Joan Smith! Once more, visit London in days of old -- share in the adventures of Emma and Nick as they weather the battle of the sexes.  Will Fate leave them opponents or allies? More delightfully written with each succeeding chapter!Frances Mosconi  --Copyright © 1994-97 Literary Times, Inc.

Instead, both kinds of readers are likely to be disappointed. Only 25 pages are spent summarizing the Canon, in some cases spoiling the plots, but 40 are devoted to \"Fans and Followers,\" a history of organized devotees of Holmes and Watson. Despite the author's pride in avoiding errors in the first edition, this one is not free of them, including the assertion that a \"Merivale\" was one of the Scotland Yarders pitted against Holmes by Doyle to the claim that actor Jeremy Brett authored the play he appeared in, The Secret of Sherlock Holmes.

During early childhood and adolescence, he lived in the Ida B. Wells housing project on Chicago’s south side. In the late 1960s, his family moved to Chicago’s South Shore community where KS Cramer experienced “White Flight” first hand, and witnessed a community immediately changing from White to Black. KS Cramer attended South Shore High School, and against the odds, went on to Northern Illinois University (NIU) where he earned a Bachelor’s degree while living in an interracial environment for the first time.Upon graduating NIU, KS Cramer began a career that exposed him to a world of comfort, affluence and privilege known to too few African Americans.

Each chapter is peppered with both rhetorical and thought-provoking questions that need to be addressed by those in charge of presenting music for worship and those who participate in its offering.LeVie claims not to be an academician or biblical scholar, but his writing reveals not only knowledge and application of Scripture, but well-reasoned assertions, proposals, and conclusions drawn from his research, which is well annotated at the end of each chapter. . . Besides offering convincing and supported arguments, LeVie interjects questions that demand serious thought for nearly every claim, opinion, and perspective that promotes the use of CCM or Christian Pop Music for worship services.If you want an eye-opening perspective on this hotly contested issue that gently but firmly leads you through the false presumptions, fallacies, and half-truths that often characterize the worship music debate,It's All About HYMNis THE book that will do it. --Christian Worship Book ReviewChristian Review of BooksIt's All About HYMN: Essays on Reclaiming Sacred and Traditional Music for Worshipfocuses on the view that the hymns we sing in church should be about bringing honor to the Lord and not bringing attention to ourselves.The book contains 12 different essays relating to different subjects regarding music in the church. One essay titled \"The Worship Issue Throughout the Ages\" expounds on how worship music has changed over the centuries. It explains, using scripture to back up what is stated, that music is about honoring the Lord and not about how it makes us feel. The author shows how throughout history music has changed to meet the needs of the singers instead of keeping the focus on the Savior.In an essay titled \"Does Secular Music Have a Place in Worship Services?\", the author explains that we should not mix the world's music and rhythms with music that is to honor the One who made us. He states that we are to be separate from the world and its views and our music should be another way we express that separation.Although this can be a controversial subject, the author does an excellent job of explaining his view of the topic without coming across as arrogant or condescending. This is not a book you can read quickly but if you do take the time to delve into the subject matter you will enjoy the insights of this well educated author. --Christian Review of Books WebsiteDr. Gary Gilley, Pastor, Southern View Chapel, Springfield, ILand author ofThis Little Church Went to Market,This Little Church Stayed Home,Is That You, Lord? Hearing the Voice of the Lord, A Biblical Perspective: As the so-called worship-wars continue to ravish the church of Christ, some have stepped up to offer wise, biblical insight. Donn LeVie, Jr. is one of these. InIt's All About HYMN, Donn provides well-informed, scripturally based criteria by which to select and use music appropriate for worship of our holy God. All who are serious about corporate worship will greatly benefit from a careful study of this thought-provoking book.--Inside cover of bookDr. David Music, School of Church Music, Baylor University, Waco, TX: Donn LeVie, Jr. has provided biblically based, balanced, and sound arguments for the use in modern worship of sacred music in traditional forms. LeVie clearly points out that worship and its music is not a matter of our personal likes and dislikes or of the commercial success of the music, but of obedience to the principles laid out in the Bible. This book should be read by all leaders of Christian worship--and by their congregations as well. --(inside cover of book)Christian Review of BooksIt's All About HYMN: Essays on Reclaiming Sacred and Traditional Music for Worshipfocuses on the view that the hymns we sing in church should be about bringing honor to the Lord and not bringing attention to ourselves.The book contains 12 different essays relating to different subjects regarding music in the church.

By showing how plausible Dred Scott was in its own day, Graber offers a brilliant and sobering meditation on whether, in shaping our constitutional life, we should choose peace over justice.\"Jack M. Balkin, Yale Law School\"To say that Professor Graber has written an important book is an understatement.  No book published in recent years is more illuminating both about the practice of constitutional interpretation and the sometimes pernicious effects of the basic structures of American government established by the Constitution.  Every scholar must read this book.  More to the point, so should anyone who is concerned with the health of the American polity.\"Sanford Levinson, University of Texas Law School\"Here is one of the most provocative books on constitutional law you will ever read, about history's most reviled case.  Bucking the tide, Graber argues the Supreme Court actually got it right in Dred Scott.  Constitutions, Graber explains, often are compromises with the devil.  Once made, there are no tricks of constitutional law or interpretation that can make the evil go away.\"Barry Friedman, New York University School of Law\"Constitutional 'evil' is an unsettling idea.  It is a wrenching and embarrassing part of American constitutional history, but it is often painted with a light brush.  In this fascinating book, Mark Graber has brilliantly compelled us to do much more.  No longer can we ignore evil in our own experience.  The emphasis on the Dred Scott case is a superb choice to highlight within the many other examples that are also considered.  It provokes us to think about evil in its many forms -- from racial to institutional.  It is a powerful solvent against the notion of American exceptionalism.\"Thomas D. Morris, author of Southern Slavery and the Law, 1619-1860 and Cleveland-Marshall College of Law\"Mark Graber shows that, sadly, the Dred Scott decision's grim affirmation of slavery's constitutionality was an all too reasonable reading of American law.  He then poses an even more painful question: whether the Civil War was the best route to eradicating that great constitutional evil.  His sobering reflections will stimulate disagreements but also deeper understanding of monumental issues that are very much with us today.\"Rogers M. Smith, University of Pennsylvania\"...one of the best and most fascinating works of constitutional theory to emerge in the past decade...\"The American Prospect , Scott Lemieux\"Dred Scott and the Problem of Constitutional Evil is the most interesting and original book on American constitutionalism that I have read in years.\"Thomas M. Keck, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University, The Law and Politics Book Review\"this very important work recovers suprisingly significant elements of antebellum constitutional thought.  It is relentlessly discomfiting and it forces one to recognize how strongly constitutional evil drove early American political development.  It deserves a wide reading.\" - Richard M. Valelly, Swarthmore College\"This is a sharp and refreshingly realistic book about the limits of constitutional law.\" - Gerard N. Magliocca, Indiana University School of Law\"Graber offers an interesting, if controversial, approach to understanding constitutional history and the role of both the President and the Supreme Court in constitutional changes.\" -Council on National Literatures", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When younger, she spent two years in a cliff-top boarding school converted from a Victorian mansion with wood-panelled rooms, a huge marble staircase and one of the largest collections of stuffed birds in England.  Finding a silver housekeeper’s châtelaine while clearing out her father-in-law’s flat whetted her interest in Victorian servants and their masters and mistresses, and prompted her to create a fictional country house of her own. Jennie lives in London with her husband and a dog, and has two grown-up sons.

Managers and Executives were just one of those that looked alike. They were though responsible for policies implemented - that those policies benefit everyone in the corporation.As we in the United States today suffer through a time of dissatisfaction with our leadership, we should possibly look to the past and Tom Watson Sr.'s democracy in business. His leadership required a responsible individual and responsible representatives for those individuals. He was almost brutal with his management staff as he was concerned with the concentration of power in the hands of a few.

Kiefer, a freelance writer and former Outside magazine editor, tells the story of Quentin and Jack Young, dashing naturalists and adventurers. Kiefer first met Quentin in the late 1980s and spoke with both brothers (by then estranged), though he spent more time with Quentin. At the time of the expedition, the Young brothers and Harkness knew little about pandas (Quentin actually admits that he hated them), and Kiefer doesn't whitewash the cruelty of their mission. In the 1930s, only a handful of Westerners had seen these animals, and swashbucklers such as Theodore Roosevelt's sons, Ted Jr. and Kermit, had made a sport of hunting them. Once Chicago's Brookfield Zoo bought Harkness's panda, other zoos began to covet their own specimens, setting off a legacy of panda hunting that led to the animals' becoming endangered. At the same time, the author obviously admires Quentin, though he's aware how unfashionable and morally dubious his lifestyle as a hunter is considered today. As he puts it, \"Quentin Young is the last specimen of an endangered species: the early twentieth century explorer-adventurer-naturalist.\" Readers interested in either this or the more traditional kind of endangered species will enjoy this well-researched, nuanced tale.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Heroine Margaret has, as the title implies, a dark relationship with her family, a tangle of step-siblings and ex-spouses. She also has a boyfriend named Tracy, a member of Sex Anonymous who engages in various forms of sexual congress with Margaret in full view of her relatives and ultimately prods her into committing incest with her stepbrother Cam. At Tracy's instigation, Margaret, Cam and Tracy seek out Cam's father, whom Cam has never met and of whom Cam knows only that he was once a model for Arrow Collars. Flook's style is frequently arresting; describing a car speeding dangerously through lanes of traffic, she writes: \"It was a reverse wake, a terrible seam ripping upwards.\" But her version of the family romance--a catalogue of wayward deeds, odd sexual encounters, ugly secrets and uglier psychodramas--is more exhibitionistic than revelatory, and it becomes increasingly difficult to share her brittle characters' overwhelming interest in themselves.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He attended a church where the main educational thrust was a national agenda to eliminate racism. Its commission on racial and social justice was the instrument which attempts to change in racial attitudes. He is an active member of this commission. Before transferring from the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, Rev. Foy led a congregation into a new church facility in Kittrell, North Carolina, an historical community which once educated Blacks at Kittrell College, an institution of the African Methodist Episcopal Denomination. His educational background includes a degree in sociology  from North Carolina A&T; State University, Greensboro, North Carolina, a Master of Divinity degree at Shaw Divinity School, Raleigh, North Carolina, and continuing education courses toward a Master of Education degree at North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina.  In 1980, on the campus of Saint Augustine’s College, Raleigh, North Carolina, he founded an affiliate chapter of the National Black Child Development Institute. His church involvement includes being an Assisting Minister at the Historic Saint Paul A.M.E. Church, founded in 1848 in Raleigh, North Carolina, and an affiliation with the Interfaith Alliance of Washington, DC. This national alliance was formed in 1994 to be a voice opposite the Religious Right Coalition. Foy believes that students of various institutions of learning, whether public, private or religious based; will benefit from a broader understanding of the multiple discoveries and inventions introduced to our society by African-Americans. Regardless of a student’s ethnicity, a deeper knowledge of so many facts which have been concealed is even vital to the future growth and collective understanding of all who live and function in the American way of life. This project was initiated, continued, and concluded with those beliefs in mind. Previous works by David Foy include Human Issues and Human Values, Council of Concerned African-American Christians, published in 1978.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The twists and turns in this story were truly unexpected. Some of the characters weren't quite who they seemed and others were exactly what they seemed snakes in the grass. I couldn't stop reading until I got to the end and when I got to the end, I can't say I was glad it was over because I wasn't. It wasn't the happy ending you'd expect, but more of a realistic ending for sure considering the circumstances. Team Nikki all the way, if you do a sequel I'd gladly buy it, but you also wrapped the story up in a manner where if you don't I won't be mad at ya!! A Job well done.

Unfortunately many of those students do not have the luxury\nof heading home to the comforts of a loving and secure family situation. So,\nwhere does that leave them? Where does it leave our innocent children who only\nwant to feel safe in school as well as home? I commend Rebecca Coffey for her diligent research of the\nmany situations of school/campus violence. Without stating so literally, she\nhas made the fragility and vulnerability of our young people quite clear. --Lisa\nMcCombs, GOODREADS.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Brian's antidotes for the lack of personal peace include such attributes\nas tolerance, equality, patience, love and contentment. He also addresses the\nproblems of maintaining peace in divorce, bereavement, old age, sickness and\ndeath. Brian's\nstyle is practical, no frills and plain speaking which makes this an easy read\nand no doubt will be a useful addition for anyone seeking self-help and answers\nto the question of maintaining a peaceful, stress free life, which probably includes us all!P.H.Victoria Australia", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That virus never left me again, so from the mid 1970s I started collecting vintage cars myself. Naturally my first such car was a Mercedes, a rather neglected prewar 170V Cabriolet B.

Somewhat forgotten as a classic,The Good Soldierhas been called everything from the consummate novelist's novel to one of the greatest English works of the century. And although its narrative hook--the philandering of an otherwise noble man--no longer shocks, its unerring cadences and doleful inevitabilities proclaim an enduring appeal.Ford's novel revolves around two couples: Edward Ashburnham--the title's soldier--and his capable if off-putting wife, Leonora; and long-transplanted Americans John and Florence Dowell. The foursome's ostensible amiability, on display as they pass parts of a dozen pre-World War I summers together in Germany, conceals the fissures in each marriage. John is miserably mismatched with the garrulous, cuckolding Florence; and Edward, dashing and sentimental, can't refrain from falling in love with women whose charms exceed Leonora's. Predictably, Edward and Florence conduct their affair, an indiscretion only John seems not to notice. After the deaths of the two lovers, and after Leonora explains much of the truth to John, he recounts the events of their four lives with an extended inflection of outrage. From his retrospective perch, his recollections simmer with a bitter skepticism even as he expresses amazement at how much he overlooked.Dowell's resigned narration is flawlessly conversational--haphazard, sprawling, lusting for sympathy. He exudes self-preservation even as he alternately condemns and lionizes Edward: \"If I had had the courage and the virility and possibly also the physique of Edward Ashburnham I should, I fancy, have done much what he did.\" Stunningly, Edward's adultery comes to seem not merely excusable, but almost sublime. \"Perhaps he could not bear to see a woman and not give her the comfort of his physical attractions,\" John surmises. Ford's novel deserves its reputation if for no other reason than the elegance with which it divulges hidden lives.--Ben Guterson", "related": ["B0093M15D2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her mother Demeter, Goddess of the Corn, refused to let anything grow whilst her daughter was in the Underworld and the ruling Olympian god Zeus had to intervene. Persephone was only to remain in Hades domain for six months of the year. During this time, Demeter mourns her daughter's absence by allowing nothing to grow; when her daughter Persephone returns to her at the outset of Spring, everything once again blooms and blossoms; hence, our seasons. The second myth is that of Argus, Hera's many-eyed watchman, who is blinded by Hermes the messenger god during one of Hera and her husband's Zeus many martial squabbles, stemming as usual from his infidelities with a young maiden.It was my research into matriarchal societies and the shift from polytheism to monotheism and the consequent shift of power from the women in society to the men that inspired me to re-work the story the way I have. It is a study of gender power shifting encapsulated in time-old tales.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He graduated from Northwestern University (economics), the University of Illinois Medical School, and the University of Illinois Affiliated Hospitals Emergency Medicine Residency Program. Dr. Hennenfent is an Ayn Rand fan. He is a student of Objectivism, Libertarianism, Constitutionalism, Individualism, Conservatism, Republicanism, and of the Tea Party Movement. As a physician, Dr. Hennenfent sometimes worked under socialism and was horrified by what he saw. He believes in patient empowerment—Patient Power healthcare—not third party control. He hopes to teach people about the evils of socialized medicine, and about the abomination of socialism as a form of government, before it’s too late, using passionate writing that readers will enjoy. Dr. Hennenfent is a voracious reader, and thinks he may have the world’s largest private collection of novels written by doctors. It’s a hobby of his to edit every book he reads. Dr. Hennenfent wrote the book, Surviving Prostate Cancer without Surgery, which became a niche best seller. Ten of Dr. Hennenfent’s articles on healthcare and economics have been published by the online newspaper, The Gold Coast Chronicle. He authored a monograph entitled The Prostatitis Syndromes, and he has been published in the British Journal of Urology, the Digital Urology Journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases, Annals of Emergency Medicine, Consultant, EMERGINDEX, Techniques in Urology, and the Journal of Pelvic Surgery. One of Dr. Hennenfent’s hobbies is statistics, and he recommends reading Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics: The Manipulation of Public Opinion in America, which is the book by Michael Wheeler that first brought popular attention to how and why statistics are often misused. He also recommends the hilarious How to Lie with Statistics by Darrell Huff, and The Honest Truth about Lying with Statistics by Cooper B. Holmes. Dr. Hennenfent is working on a romance novel entitled The Elevators of Cook County, and an educational series featuring the Alligator Etymologist. He blogs at BradMD.com, tweets at Twitter.com/BradMD, and his e-mail is Dr.Hennenfent@Gmail.com.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Charlie Barton and his wife, Donna, ran the Bridge, a historic bookstore in Franklin, Tennessee, for 30 years, but a declining industry and a devastating flood left them with an empty storefront and insurmountable bills. Molly Allen and Ryan Kelly connected in college over their passion for reading, using the Bridge as their getaway from the very different lives they lead. ED: S/B “they led”? Years later, both look back and wonder what could have been. When Charlie gets into a horrible accident, Ryan decides to organize a book drive and gather donations, so Charlie can rebuild the bookstore when he heals. Through the effort, Ryan and Molly reconnect. It’s hard to know what is most important until something forces you to change your perspective. Kingsbury’s characters are confronted with the hard choices readers face daily. The award-winning author brings her trademark empathy for the people she writes for to this tale, and fans will love her dramatic take on real issues. --Carolyn Richard", "related": ["B00KG252XM"], "rank": 214353, "title": "The Beginning: An eShort prequel to The Bridge", "author": "Karen Kingsbury", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 64, "rating_average": 4.6875, "rating_total": 300.0}

As a result, they've stopped reading it. It's gone out of vogue, and lost it's prominence in the literary world. I believe that's because today's readers demand relevancy. If poetry made sense to people, if it came alive and jumped off the page with a moving message, why wouldn't the public read it? I promise you this collection of poems won't be dry, boring or incomprehensible. I believe there is still a niche for poetry which is inspirational, motivational, even exquisite in nature. We all need to be reminded that there is something greater inside of us than the confining, challenging circumstances we face, and this trilogy of e-books proclaims it IS possible for you to overcome the hurdles in your life. I hope you will give poetry a second chance.", "related": ["B001XUQXC0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Thanks so much for your interest in my books! My principal interests are true stories of the unusual or of the previously Unknown or unexplained. I have occasionally also written some fiction.  I was born in Memphis Tennessee and grew up in a small town near Tupelo Mississippi. After graduating from Mississippi State University as an aerospace engineer I moved to Orlando Florida and worked for Lockheed Martin for 24 years. I advanced from an aerospace engineer to a Vice President of the Company and President of the Tactical Weapons Systems Division. I then formed Parks-Jaggers Aerospace Company and sold it 4 years later. I continued my education throughout my career with a MBA degree from Rollins College and with Post Graduate Studies in Astrophysics at UCLA; Laser Physics at the University of Michigan; Computer Science at the University of Florida; and Finance and Accounting at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. After selling my aerospace company I formed Quest Studios, Quest Entertainment and Rosebud Entertainment to make films at Universal Studios. I produced 10 films, directed 7 films and wrote 5 films produced at Universal Studios. I then formed UnknownTruths Publishing Company to publish true stories of the unusual or of the previously Unknown or unexplained. These include books about past events so unbelievable that most people have relegated them to \"myths\". I have published 22 books and have an additional 9 in development.", "related": ["B00G1DD3VS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I hope if you read one you'll go ahead and read the others. Then maybe even try one of my 16 novels. Might work. I hope so.My favorite of the four spooky short stories...Ghost Brother. My second choice, The Banshee and the Witch, which is the longest short story at about 10,000 words and is about a witch who wants to live forever and might just do that.

Castro's revolution is picking up steam, unbeknownst to legendary actor-director and all-around dapper gentleman, Dick Powell, who travels to Cuba to scout locations for his latest film.Crooning'strusty fictional narrator--the screenwriter--goes along for the ride, despite concerns for their safety. Within hours of their arrival, the Hollywood duo falls prey to Castro's horde, who holds them up for ransom in the mountains. The pair soon learns that Castro is not simply the leader of the revolution, but also something of a crooner himself, albeit a tone-deaf one. Considering Pulitzer Prize-winning Frank D. Gilroy worked with the real Dick Powell in the 1950s, it's hard to know what's fact or fiction in this tale of misbegotten adventure; Gilroy's charming storytelling certainly oozes intimacy with the subject matter at hand. Ultimately, it doesn't even matter.Crooningis madcap and funny--Castro even sheds tears over his inability to hit a note. What more could you ask for, other than a recording of the revolutionary singing \"White Christmas\"?--Raya Jalabi", "related": [], "rank": 1222931, "title": "Crooning (Kindle Single)", "author": "Frank D.

This brilliantly conceived, always fascinating and richly documented study is, incontrovertibly, an outstanding scholarly contribution, which should be mandatory reading for all with a serious interest in the history of Central and Eastern Europe and in American and broader international politics.”Peter D. Stachura,Slavonic & East European Review“Regional identity as a political concept is a useful, if controversial, vehicle for exploring important international relations issues. Chodakiewicz (history, Institute of World Politics) formulates \"intermarium\" to argue that the US should be more actively engaged with the region between the Baltic and the Black Seas. He asserts that the US has failed to address the security implications of a \"resurgent\" Russia with \"imperial objectives\" that focus primarily on the intermarium. Characterizing the history of the region as an effective defender of Western civilization since the time of the Mongols, he argues that today there is a convergence of interests and values among the states of the region and the US. . . . He concludes the book with a plea to scholars to engage in rebutting \"Communist lies,\" ethnocentric myths, and Western distortions about the region. The book is recommended for all those interested in pursuing this challenge. Summing Up: Recommended.”—R. P. Peters,Choice“[A] well-researched and well-written book; a balanced combination of theoretical insights with good narratives; an objective study of an area full of subjectivities; and, a thorough summary of important historical events.”—Nicholas Dima,SFPPR News & Analysis“For Chodakiewicz the Intermarium includes the Baltic States, Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova. It is hard to pick out the primary theme of the book—there are many—but one of them is that the struggle for the soul of the Intermarium is between the Polish model, which represents tolerance, prosperity, parliamentary democracy, intellectual achievement, and freedom, and the Russian model, which represents totalitarianism, corruption, cronyism, atheism, and moral relativism.”—Karl A. Roider,The Sarmatian Review“The Intermarium is one of the most culturally and politically significant regions of Europe. Yet historians and journalists too often limit themselves to a consideration of interests of the powers that have ravaged it. In this fascinating and deeply researched book, Marek Jan Chodakiewicz restores the region’s separate identity. He shows the interplay of its peoples and their often tragic destinies, but also the traditional love of freedom that makes the Intermarium a vital source of support for the ideals of the West.”—David Satter, Hudson Institute; Foreign Policy Institute of Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies\"Dr. Chodakiewicz's unprecedented, long-overdue impeccably researched and extraordinarily well-argued study directly challenges the common view of the Intermarium as mere borderland between the 'West' and Russia. Professor Chodakiewicz's clarity of thought, highly readable prose, impressive command of 1,000 years of the area's history, and his unique perspectives gleaned from expert analysis of a multitude of foreign archival material rarely seen in English compel all those in academia, the US government, and the US foreign policy establishment to overturn the Moscow-centric approach to the Interrimarium that has governed US foreign policy for the last 70 years.\"—Dr. Robert W. Stephan (CIA Ret), Adjunct Professor Institute of World Politics; author,Stalin's Secret War, Soviet Counterintelligence against the Nazis 1941-1945“Intermarium: The Land between the Black and Baltic Seasis an important, path-breaking work. It serves to redefine our conceptualization of the European world.The comparison of [Chodakiewicz’s] efforts with those of Raul Hilberg is on target.”—Irving Louis Horowitz, Hannah Arendt Professor Emeritus, Rutgers University“This extraordinary new book by Professor Marek Chodakiewicz, a scholarly yet eminently readable and engagingtour de force, should establish his reputation as one of the most erudite historians of what is generally known as Central and Eastern Europe writing in the United States today. Ever the iconoclast, Professor Chodakiewicz exposes a plethora of inaccuracies and disinformation about this region promoted by Russian—and later Soviet—imperialist narratives, exacerbated by varying American biases which, over the course of more than a century, have resulted in a grossly distorted understanding of this critical part of the Western world which, in turn, prevents a clear appreciation of its own heritage rooted in the ideology of freedom. Many in academia will find his analyses unsettling; but no honest reader can fail to be impressed by the thoroughly researched arguments and the enormous breadth of his perspective.Intermariumis a breathtaking accomplishment.”—Juliana Geran Pilon, director, Center for Culture and Security Institute of World Politics“Based on noble ideals obscured by layers of colonialism from East and West, Chodakiewicz’s vision of Eastern Europe’s potential is boldly drawn and elegantly written.”—Ewa Thompson, research professor of Slavic Studies, Rice University“In this broad-minded and generous work written in the spirit of Oskar Halecki and Norman Davies, Chodakiewicz explores both the history and the contemporary problems of the lands between the Baltic and Black Seas. His work will prove essential for both academics and policy makers as well as any reader seeking a deeper understanding of the complexity and diversity of east-central Europe.”—John Radzilowski, University of Alaska Southeast", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Born in 1943 and still kicking, he has spent his life on or near the water. His first memories of the water were when his mother taught him to swim after school at Miami Beach. That was in the first grade. He later became a life guard at another beach in Maryland. His love of the water has carried him through many different types of boats. He has gone down rapids in a canoe. He has crossed the ocean in a sailboat. He has rowed wooden boats and driven motor yachts in the ocean and gulf. Eventually he was awarded a 100 ton Masters license from the US Coast Guard. Not only did he enjoy the many different boats he owned along the way but also the people he met. One day while recording the day's events in his log a guest said, \"Why don't you write these adventures into a book. I think they would make a great story.\" Terry Kimmel received a BA from the University of Maryland and later a DDS from their Dental School. After a tour of duty with the USAF he moved to the Annapolis, Maryland, area and opened a dental practice. Right before he retired he had a boat built for his wife and himself to go cruising. Ten years later he had a heart attack. While he was convalescing he put this book together from his log notes and told the stories as his guest had suggested. We are told all these stories are true but they did not necessarily happen in the order they appear in his book. He also mixes many stories of this childhood adventures on the water and the antics of some of his pets on board as a counter balance to the tales of his trips in the ICW and the Bahamas in later years.", "related": ["B0096RYE7I"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

MJ Wayland’s interest in the paranormal, especially ghosts, began at an early age after experiencing a number of unusual incidents that his peers could not explain. In his early teens he joined various research societies and began to study the multiple facets to the paranormal with a scientific and historical viewpoint.  His research has taken him from dark haunted castles of Britain to the haunted graveyards of New Orleans, investigating his primary love of ghosts to sightings of black panthers. Since the mid-1990s, MJ Wayland has provided consultancy for TV, film and theatre as well as appearing in local, national, international newspapers, radio and TV.  He is the author of eight best-selling books, “50 Real Ghost Stories” holding the Amazon top 10 bestselling Paranormal book for the second consecutive Halloween in 2013. More recently he provided consultancy for the forthcoming Hammer film “The Quiet Ones” due April 2014.", "related": ["B008C9INSM"], "rank": 844747, "title": "Real Christmas Ghost Stories", "author": "MJ Wayland", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After spending a half-hour googling the expression, hell if I could come up with a definitive definition. To me, Psycho Noir is a natural way to describe Jim Thompson's best and most psychotic works: Hell of a Woman, Savage Night, Killer Inside Me, Swell-Looking Babe and Pop. 1280. These are books populated by characters whose perception of reality is just skewed and oft-kilter enough to screw them, as well as anyone with the misfortune of getting too close to them. Reading these books can be both a startling and exhilarating experience as it slowly dawns on you that these characters who are trying so hard to convince you that they're normal are actually mad, bad, and very dangerous. There's an energy that buzzes through these books that is hard to find any where else in crime fiction. Anyway, this was my definition of Psycho Noir, and this was the challenge I put out there--to write the type of stories that would make Jim Thompson proud--stories that are on the edge of madness--where the protagonists perceptions and rationalizations are just off center enough to send them to hell. \"In my opinion, the writers for this issue more than met the challenge. These stories are buzzing with the same sort of psychotic madness and energy that you find in the best of Thompson--and I can't think of higher praise. This is pure noir at its heart. Brutal. Hard-hitting. Nothing watered down. Characters dancing on the edge of madness and destined to slip down the wrong side.

Beginning at an early age, Andre' took an interest in food.... growing up in a South Louisiana culture rich in tradition and heritage. Having a \"food family\" didn't hurt either, as Andre' spent countless hours in the kitchen, preparing meals and prepping for professional and private parties.In high school, Andre' began to work in the industry, first as a fifteen-year-old grill cook, then as a catering cook at Crokett's receptions in Baton Rouge. At age 17, Andre' spent his summer as Pantry Chef at the respected Baton Rouge Country Club. By age 18, Andre' figured out he could supplement his income in the kitchen, and while attending the Conservatory, he worked evenings as a Pasta Chef at the famed Fedora Bar and Grill on the plaza in Kansas CIty, Mo.Working as a jingle writer and singer, it was then Andre' and wife Jami left their jobs to open their own restaurant, Beignet's Louisiana Kitchen, located in the heart of Chicago's Gold Coast.Within months, the restaurant gained enormous popularity, and would see it's numbers soar. Two hour waits were common on weekend nights, as Andre' would boil 800 pounds of live crawfish on the sidewalk at State and Chestnut. Within a year, the spot was named \"Top 10 Restaurants in Chicago Under $10\" by the Chicago Sun Times, and was featured on Fox TV, as well as numerous radio stations. In 1994 Andre' and Jami sold their interest in the restaurant and moved to Los Angeles, California.In 2005, André and Jami opened their cuban-by-day, Tapas-by-night hotspot\"The Lava Room\"in downtown Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The venture was critically acclaimed but sadly closed soon after Hurricane Katrina affected the area in 2005.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The second is The Visible Suspect. Both are now available on Amazon for the Kindle. This series is on temporary hold though I hope to revisit it in the future. The second series is the Zombie Civilization Saga. The first book, Zombie Civilization - Genesis, is currently available with the next one due no later than June 1, 2013. The series takes place, at least for now, in the backwoods of southern Ohio. The survivors of the initial infection struggle to construct a new society out of the ruins without becoming barbarians in the process. This series is planned for a set of three books with perhaps more to follow. The third series I have begun is the Sherlock Holmes Uncovered Tales. The first book, The Eccentric Painter is currently number one in the kindle store for Sherlock Holmes books. I have more books in the queue and will be releasing them at regular intervals.

Little did they know how much she enjoyed her very active life. She spent so much time hiking and camping she thought she should have become a forest ranger. But her carefree times are about to change when a full moon rises on Bree during a Werewolf Pack Run. An adult paranormal romance for those over 18, featuring a confident BBW who reacts to being surrounded by werewolves exactly the way most beautiful women would. The question is--will the werewolves survive? (Warning: This story is so hot your Kindle may melt. It features explicit sex involving a curvy big girl and a sexy werewolf! This is the first of the Bree Paranormal Adult Romance series which concludes in the collection: Romancing the Wolf)Excerpt:MikahI loved touching her. By now the Ecstasy had been metabolized and I was as normal as I'd get. If it hadn't been for Kevin's pill pushing, I wouldn't be here now, and god knows the others wouldn't have followed me to the sensory delight of Bree. I might have some explaining to do to the Pack Leader as to why I didn't return with the others, but I didn't care. I loved her size. When I've been with a skinny girl, I've always been afraid I might snap her in two. Bree was strong and solid. I knew I could make love to her and not end up breaking her. And she just felt so fantastic when I touched her--such incredible softness.I could track her response by sense of smell and being able to listen to her heart beat. I knew she was getting gushy in her ladyparts--always a good sign. Her heart beat and body scent told me she trusted me--she had no fear. I took the next step and ever so gently teased the tip of my cock in and out a little--then in and out again.\"I have a condom,\" she whispered.\"One of the advantages of being what I am--I can't catch human STDs or pass them on. I also know from your scent, you're not in your fertile time. I'll be glad to use a condom if that's what you would like--but there really isn't a need for it.\" I kissed her once again on her neck.", "related": ["B00860MWLG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 14, "rating_average": 3.2143, "rating_total": 45.0}

Chapman. I haven't always been a preacher, quite the contrary. When I was a young teenager everyone always said: \"Boy what a good kid Luke is. He is a wonderful young man.\" Because of a stepfather that had no love for me, my clothes were packed for me and placed on the front porch on Christmas morning. Arrangements were already made for a near friend to pick me up to take me to my real dad's home. This became a cycle unto me. I learned soon to take flight in life, realizing I'm on my own. I was kicked out of school for truancy, failure to want to go to school and to learn. This started a foundation for my life, for my ongoing future. My new friends taught me how to smoke, drink, and cuss and to tell lies. I graduated to smoking weed and using cocaine. I never drank or used cocaine on a regular basis. I just started on weekends or invited parties. I got married and had a Child when I was 21 years old. But, with a lifestyle of drinking, spending money in bars and not on bills or in my home, I soon went through a divorce. Does this sound familiar, like today's youths? At this time, now I'm remarried my wife and I are both cocaine addicts. My wife smoked weed? I sold weed and cocaine to supply our habits. My wife left me one day. I was arrested the same day and put in jail. In jail, I bowed my knees on the floor in my cell. I was the only one there that day. I called upon Jesus and was saved and sent to North Central Correctional Institution. I never thought anyone cared. But I was so wrong. What was meant for evil for me, God changed for the good. Prison became My Bible College. Prison was where God counseled me about my morals. God taught me about being a good husband, a good father unto my Children and how a preacher must live and act. I served six and a half years in prison to learn not do use drugs, not to walk through life aimlessly. I learned my lesson. God raised me up to be a preacher in prison. Prison was my lifesaver. Wow, what a statement one might say! The reason prison was my lifeline was I could have graduated to the other side of life... Six Feet Down. I almost did! I had a heart attack, just before I was sent to prison, from smoking crack cocaine. I almost died. Your Friend... The Harley Davidson Preacher Man Luke L. Chapman Gods Vision...

Known for unveiling unseen worlds, scientific breakthroughs, and historical secrets, Rollins' knack for breakneck pacing and stunning originality has been hailed by critics and embraced by scores of millions of readers around the world.The Critics RaveThe New York Times says that his \"roguish charm comes from his efforts to persuade readers the story is credible [through] real-life sources for his novel's science, history and geography.\" Rollins' rare blend of action, suspense, and knowledge was also mentioned by the Huffington Post, which stated that \"After Crichton passed away in 2008 he clearly passed the baton to James Rollins, who like Crichton, is a renaissance man.\"NPR calls his work \"adventurous and enormously engrossing...\" and the New York Journal of Books had this to say: \"If you're a fan of smart, entertaining adventure fiction, this is your summer beach read writ large....All the science, all the history, and all the locations are masterfully intertwined. The characters are multi-dimensional. And the story is, well, a corker.\"The Story Teller's StoryAs a boy immersed in the scientific adventures of Doc Savage, the wonders of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and pulps such as The Shadow, The Spider, and The Avenger, James Rollins decided he wanted to be a writer. He honed his storytelling skills early, spinning elaborate tales that were often at the heart of pranks played on his brothers and sisters.Before he would set heroes and villains on harrowing adventures, Rollins embarked on a career in veterinary medicine, graduating from the University of Missouri and establishing a successful veterinary practice. This hands-on knowledge of medicine and science helps shape the research and scientific speculation that set James Rollins books apart.Explosive Page-Turning AdventuresThe exotic locales of James Rollins novels have emerged as a hybrid between imagination, research, and his extensive travels throughout the United States and Europe, as well as New Zealand, the South Pacific, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. Recent jaunts include book tours and stops across the country and several European nations to give talks, seminars, and media interviews.\nIn recent years, much of James' travel has involved meeting readers in small and large groups, at writing and fan conferences, and even aboard seagoing \"seminars.\" James' mentoring and coaching skills have made him a sought after writing instructor and guest speaker for workshops, symposia, conventions, and other forums throughout the country.James Rollins is the author of nine thrillers in the bestselling Sigma Force series (Sandstorm, Map of Bones, Black Order, The Judas Strain, The Last Oracle, The Doomsday Key, The Devil Colony, Bloodline, and The Eye of God); six individual adventure thrillers; and the Jake Ransom middle grade series (Jake Ransom and the Skull King's Shadow, Jake Ransom and the Howling Sphinx.)", "related": [], "rank": 162600, "title": "Blood Brothers: A Short Story Exclusive (Order of the Sanguines Series)", "author": "James Rollins", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 33, "rating_average": 4.6364, "rating_total": 153.0}

It has been estimated that 90% of the data in the world today was created in the last two years. At the enterprise level, though, only about a quarter of this data actually has business value. Storing and maintaining unneeded “data debris” is costly and diverts resources away from the management of high value information. Organizations need to adopt information governance (IG) policies in order to streamline and systematize approaches to Big Data and to more efficiently meet compliance and legal demands.Information Governanceis the first book to address both the big-picture concepts and the proven, detailed best practices that are central to deploying IG.This book addresses the five key impact areas of IG, as set out in the Information Governance Reference Model (IGRM): Legal Functions, Records and Information Management (RIM), Information Technology (IT), Privacy & Security, and Business Operations. Leading subject matter experts such as Barclay Blair, Monica Crocker, Charles Dollar, Randy Kahn, Esq., Barry Murphy, and others provide valuable new insights. Specific recommended processes, technologies, and best practices are presented in a clear, understandable format. For mid- and large-sized enterprises, information is a key source of value. But retaining excessive information also carries legal and compliance risks. InInformation Governance, Robert Smallwood demonstrates just how costly mismanaged information can be. To minimize risk related to poor IG, organizations need to pare information down to the essentials and secure it properly. Inside, learn how to do these things the right way, to ensure compliance with internal governance requirements and external regulatory and legal demands.If information governance is so important, why have IG programs not been adopted by more organizations? And more importantly, why have so many existing IG programs failed so miserably? Smallwood explains that costs and benefits associated with information governance are still not widely understood. In the pages ofInformation Governance,the author builds the business case for IG through a comprehensive, pioneering approach for information-related risk assessments that leverages high value information.Carrying out well-considered IG initiatives is not easy, particularly when so much valuable information is stored and accessed by third-party service providers. Social media, mobile computing, and cloud computing, and certainly traditional e-mail, are exposed to leakage and theft risks. Even discarding unneeded information in a legally defensible way can be quite challenging.Information Governanceaddresses the practicalities of managing these various information platforms. This comprehensive book—the most comprehensive ever compiled on IG—is an essential resource to equip enterprises with a sound approach to governing and leveraging information in the age of Big Data.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In addition, I spent two summers in Alaska working in a gold mine and two years in France and Switzerland speaking French. I have five children that are all now teenagers. Nope, no twins. They all think I'm a dork and apparently I keep providing evidence to support their theory.

A past member of Toastmasters and former columnist for a national industry specific magazine, I naturally evolved into a writer of novels- a story teller, really. Twice the Christmas, a novella, was my first work available. My hope is to have this book available in print by this Christmas. Ain't Dead Yet, a Porter Rockwell Novel, is my newest work and the first installment of what I hope to be an exciting Western series, based on the Utah LDS legendary character of Orrin Porter Rockwell. The second book of the series in currently in rough draft. I hope to have it polished up by summer of 2014. I also have a work in progress based on a boy working at a gold mine in Alaska, circa 1980. Not sure where I got that inspiration (wink, wink) and another Christmas story set in late 70's Reno Nevada (another mystery of inspiration).

Each minute that passed\nwas getting harder to pay attention to his job. A job he normally loved.It was all Darrin's fault.He shivered as he moved to the next\nplant and started tending it. The man had been calling in regular orders for\nthe last nine months. He'd lost his phone for a few hours the first time the\nman had called and Darrin had left a message.The man's sexy-as-sin voice had been\nlike a shot of adrenaline, lust, and dark passion to his groin. No other man\nhad ever had that effect on him.If he wasn't such a freak, he'd have\nmade a personal delivery of the herbs and spices Darrin ordered just to meet\nthe man. One bad beating and two rude responses to him showing a man attention\nhad taught him that quite a few men didn't like transgenders at all. No\npermanent physical damage had been done, but he'd learned he was a freak.\nPeople don't like freaks. All the citizens of the small town he'd grown up in\nhad proven that. The town he lived close to now was no better.Looking at his inherited property,\nhe was proud of all he'd accomplished since a distant great uncle had passed\naway and left it to him. He may not be fit to date, but he sure as hell knew\nhow to grow and run an herb-and-spice company. The ten acres he'd inherited\nseven years ago were perfect. There was room to grow the business and the soil\nwas great for plants. Taking a deep breath, he enjoyed the fresh, woodsy air.\nYes, this was a great place.Speaking of great, Darrin should be\ncalling sometime today. Most likely in the evening. The guy must be too busy to\ncall during the day like the rest of his customers did. Pierce didn't care.\nHearing the man's voice made his day. Grinning, he acknowledged that Darrin\ncould be an older man with four grown children and a devoted wife.That didn't stop him from\nmasturbating to Darrin's voice. Sometimes he could do it from memory alone,\nother times he played the recording he had.He looked down at his fit, firm\nbody. Would Darrin think he was strange? There were those who'd think he was\nnothing more than a thirty-four-year-old weirdo. His genitals didn't match what\nhis mind told him he was. He gladly took supplements like men's vitamins,\ncalcium chews, protein shakes, and natural spices and herbs that helped him be\nstronger and feel more like a man.The women in his family were\nnaturally flat chested, which helped him out. All he had to do was work out to\nkeep his chest looking manly. Facial hair was something he didn't worry about\nat all. Several races didn't have a lot of facial or body hair and that didn't\nmake them less manly.A few women had hit on him over the\nyears, all from other cities. The ones he went to in order to get supplies for\nhis business. He chuckled at the thought of how horrified they'd have been if\nhe'd stripped down. His cut, muscular form would have impressed them for sure.\nThe lack of a large penis would've had them running and screaming. Although, his\nclit was extra large and looked like a small cock. It was big enough to be\nproud of.Looking around at all the woods that\nsurrounded his garden from a distance, he felt a pang of loneliness. Most of\nthe time he didn't mind being alone. Lately, though, he'd begun to wish Darrin\nwas free and gay. A male that didn't mind being with a transgender man. What\nwere the odds of that happening? Almost zero. It was best he stick to all those\ndildos he had collected over the years. Although he'd never been with anyone,\nhe was no virgin.The thought of Darrin's sexy voice\nhad him creaming his briefs. As soon as he got off work he was going to get\ndown with two dildos. Now there was a dream. Two hot men fucking him senseless.Speaking of dreams, he shivered when\nhe remembered the dream he'd been having for the last year. Mmm. Two vampires\nmaking love to him. They caressed and kissed him everywhere and when he was so\nhot he couldn't think straight they'd sink their fangs into him and fuck him\nblind.He groaned before taking a calming\nbreath. Vampires weren't real so his dream could never come true. Their perfect\nlips had sure felt real. He'd never seen their faces, but he had pictured their\nlips and the special energy they emitted.A crazy part of him wished Darrin\nwas one of the vampires in his dreams. That sexy voice would fit one of his\ndream men perfectly.  Shaking the lust off, he tried to\nonce again pay attention to his work. A well-tended plant produced more herbs\nand spices than an unkempt one. Doing this job gave him a reason to live. All\nof his products healed people. Because of his gifted green thumb people lived\nhealthier lives. Not everyone on the planet was hateful. Some were even nice\nand innocent.He knew there were places where\ntransgender males and females were accepted. One day he planned on taking a\nvacation in one of those places. The internet was full of information on the\nsubject. So far, growing his business had stopped him from going.Then there was his unnatural desire\nfor Darrin. A man he'd never even met. He was losing it. That was the only\nfeasible answer. Or maybe he was just dog tired of being alone. He'd been by\nhimself since he was eighteen. He sighed, and unbidden, the part of him that\nlonged for a large family to love and be loved by rose to the forefront of his\nmind. With a little mental effort he put it back in its secret hiding place in\nhis heart. Yep, he needed a vacation. One where his kind were normal. He'd look\nup places to go right after he masturbated to Darrin's husky voice.", "related": ["B00LMMBYMS"], "rank": 908506, "title": "Mate of Two Vampires [Vamp Mates 3] (Siren Publishing Menage Amour ManLove)", "author": "Dakota Dawn", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

More than the Atkins\n  diet, it is a low and optimal carb diet based on the way our ancestors\n  theoretically would have eaten -- at that time fruit would have only been\n  available in season instead of all year round like today. Grains would have\n  been inedible without the milling and processing used today. St. Julien\n  writes from the inarguable perspective of a professional in the medical field\n  with an opportunity to observe patients suffering from a multitude of\n  diseases, not the least of which is evidenced in the obesity epidemic.\n Putting these elements together, he realized there could be a link\nbetween a grain-filled and otherwise processed diet, and these \"new\" diseases\nof diabetes and obesity.The Paleo Lifestyle Explained lists many benefits to adopting this lifestyle:\n  feeling better, stabilizing blood sugar, weight control, fat burning, better\n  sleep, healthier looking skin and hair, reduced allergies, reduced\n  inflammatory pain, improved mental clarity, lower risk of debilitating\n  \"lifestyle diseases\", and too many others to list here. St. Julien does not\n  neglect the science of how this works in your body. Grains, glutens, dairy,\n  and lectins are the villains here, stripped of their enzymes and essential\n  fats through processing. Processed food makes one more susceptible to\n  dramatic highs and lows in blood sugar, causing lightheadedness and hot\n  flashes, signaling the damaging effects to the body.All in all, this is a very approachable diet and lifestyle and one that\n  I enjoy. -Mary DeKok Blowers for Readers' Favorite", "related": [], "rank": 1770734, "title": "The Paleo Lifestyle Explained: Everything You Need to Know for Optimal Health, Self-Sustaining Fat Loss and a Phenomenal Body", "author": "Jeffery St. Julien", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The victim is an unlikable rock star with more enemies than friends. An aging drummer, Spike, has a music store and teaches music. When he is found dead in his store, all evidence points to one of Spike's music students, Adam, a young man with Asperger's Syndrome who is found standing over the dead body, apologizing. The death weapon? An Australian musical instrument called a didgeridoo. Enter Jamie Quinn, the reluctant heroine who is recovering from her mother's death - and not at all interested in pursuing her career as an attorney. However, she is pulled into this case because the fragile Adam is her nephew. Jamie must untangle the mystery and protect Adam from a legal system that might destroy him.\nBarbara Venkataraman has created a compelling cast of characters that populate an intriguing story. Duke, the private investigator that Jamie hires to collect evidence for her, is a great character who is a wonderful foil for Jamie's wit and intelligence. The dialogue between the two is smart and moves the story forward. The character of Adam presents an accurate picture of how a person with Asperger's Syndrome might react in this sort of situation. \"Death by Didgeridoo\" is a very good read - and makes me anxious to read the next in the series!\"I enjoyed reading about Jamie Quinn and her lovable band of characters having the time of their lives solving a murder mystery.

This book showed me how things can make you drift away from God. For me it was TV. We bought a digital converter for our old tv so we could watch the news. Instead we ended up getting hooked on other shows. That's when I felt a message from God that I was drifting away from him. So between reading Lilliet's book and God I decided to return the converter. Both my husband and I felt a huge weight lifted when we did that. It brought us back to reading God's word again.I also realized I was becoming a bit of a hoarder, thinking \"I might need this some day\". There's stuff in my closet I haven't seen for over a year. So if I haven't needed it for that long then it's time to get rid of it. I would rather spend my time with the Lord. This is why I really like Lilliet Garrison's books. They make you think, see and understand. I believe she is truly inspired by God to help us see his path and what he wants us to do and be.This is a great book for your library as you will no doubt read it more than once when you need \"Getting Unstuck\".   -Kelly Carpo, \"Ms. Kelly\"", "related": [], "rank": 8749, "title": "GETTING UNSTUCK, Moving Beyond What's Holding You Back: (Identify the negative patterns that ruin your life)", "author": "Lilliet Garrison", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this important book, Gene I. Maeroff offers a clear and compelling analysis of this project and situates his study in the larger context of the national debate over the direction of school reform. Readers will not only learn why this work is important to the future of Syracuse, but they will also see that the lessons to be learned from this project have profound implications for education throughout the United States. Maeroff brings great insight and clarity to this project. Educators, policymakers and anyone concerned about the future of American education will find much to learn in this book.\" - Pedro A. Noguera, Peter L. Agnew Professor of Education, New York University, USA\"Amid urban school reform failures by both government agencies and big-ticket donors since the 1990s comes Gene I. Maeroff's report on the Say Yes foundation's work in Syracuse, where it guarantees free college tuition to every high school graduate. In cooperation with city officials, business leaders, and college presidents, the Say Yes foundation seeks no less than improving schools and student lives but goes further in wanting to revitalize the economic, social, and cultural life of this mid-size city. While it is a work in progress after five years and much remains to be done in Syracuse, Say Yes's work does offer a model of school and city cooperation that promises an educational and urban makeover. Maeroff documents in clear, crisp language the errors in earlier reform models, bumps in Syracuse's road, and lessons anchored in Say Yes's ambitious efforts. Reformers need to heed the errors, bumps, and lessons in this ambitious, far-reaching venture.\" — Larry Cuban, Professor Emeritus of Education, Stanford University, USA", "related": [], "rank": 2545421, "title": "Reforming a School System, Reviving a City", "author": "G.

His first novel 'Ring Fenced' was published in November 2011 and this is a crime story with a difference as the underlying theme is obsession tinged with power, control and how they are used and abused. This novel was followed by a collaboration with Elly Grant to produce 'Twists and Turns' a book of short stories and flash fiction. Zach’s second novel 'Made a Killing' was the first of a series of Alex Warren murder mysteries (published in November 2012) and this has been followed by 'A Measure of Trouble' (August 2013). Zach is currently working on a novel based on investigative jounalism. Alike his central character in 'Ring Fenced,' (Bemjamin Short), Zach Abrams grew up within an orthodox Jewish family. He completed his education in Scotland and went on to a career in business and finance. He is married with two children. He plays no instruments and has an eclectic taste in music, although not as obsessive as Benjamin. Unlike Benjamin, he does not maintain mistresses, write pornography and (sadly) he does not have ownership of such a wealthy company. He is not a sociopath (at least by his own reckoning) and all versions of his life are aware of and freely communicate with each other.  More in keeping with Alex Warren, he and his family reside in the south side of Glasgow.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 4.5833, "rating_total": 55.0}

Allende offers a compelling saga of the turbulent history, lives,  and loves of late 19th-century Chile, drawing on characters from her earlier  novels,The House of  SpiritsandDaughter of  Fortune.In typical Allende fashion,Portrait in Sepiais crammed with love,  desire, tragedy, and dark family secrets, all played out against the dramatic  backdrop of revolutionary Chile. Our heroine Aurora del Valle's mother is a  Chilean-Chinese beauty, while her father is a dissolute scion of the wealthy and  powerful del Valle family. At the heart of Aurora's slow, painful re-creation of  her childhood towers one of Allende's greatest fictional creations, the  heroine's grandmother, Paulina del Valle. An \"astute, bewigged Amazon with a  gluttonous appetite,\" Paulina holds both the del Valle family and Allende's  novel together as she presides over Aurora's adolescence in a haze of pastries,  taffeta, and overweening love.One of the most interesting aspects of the novel is Allende's decision to turn  her heroine into a photographer: \"through photography and the written word I try  desperately to conquer the transitory nature of my existence, to trap moments  before they evanesce, to untangle the confusion of my past.\" There is little  confusion in Allende's elegantly crafted and hugely enjoyable novel.--Jerry  Brotton, Amazon.co.uk", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However greatly the professional criminologists might benefit from the authors' illuminating insights and the new cognitive vistas their investigations have opened, the impact of this book may well stretch far beyond the realm of criminology proper and mark a watershed in the progress of social study as such. This book, after all, brings into the open the irremediable unclarity, endemic contentiousness and the resulting frailty of the line dividing deviance from the norm of social life - that line being simultaneously a weapon and the prime stake in the construction and servicing of social order.Professor Zygmaut BaumanCultural criminology has been written about and discussed  at length in criminology circles over the last five years -- including by the well-known trio of Ferrell, Hayward and Young -- but this is their best work to date on this fascinating approach and its significance.  Beautifully written and superbly conceived, with illustrations and examples that combine theory and practice across a range of disciplines, Cultural Criminology should be read by anyone - academics and smart readers alike - interested in crime, media, culture and social theory.  Bravo to Ferrell, Hayward and Young on a tour de force that is at once cool and classic!  Cultural Criminology  will influence the field for a very long time to come.ProfessorLynn Chancer,Hunter College and the Graduate CentreAn invitation indeed. The cultural criminology project described by Jeff Ferrell, Keith Hayward and Jock Young in this remarkable book will surely inspire many students of crime and crime control to accept their invitation and join the movement. The book comes at precisely the right time, as a powerful synthesis of a set of ideas, research practices, and political sentiments that have energized an expanding network of criminological researchers during the last two decades...no one can fail to be impressed by the skill and energy they have brought to this effort. With their remarkable grasp of the intricate details of contemporary cultural life and a narrative style that expresses the distinctive energy and flow of the late modern era, the book’s authors demonstrate cultural criminology’s purchase on the world of crime and transgression in the 21st century...this book represents by far the most comprehensive examination of this emerging criminological perspective...a key text in the development of cultural criminology.Stephen LyngCarthage College, USACultural criminology is still developing and this book, and the work that has developed in the cultural criminology tradition, has reenergised criminology and brought the offender back into the picture. This picture is vivid, energetic and passionate.Craig WebberUniversity of Southampton, UKThis resource provides an excellent textbook for those teaching cultural criminology as a module. Its use of vignettes, photographs and the novel way of highlighting films of interest at the end of each chapter provide a resource useful for teachers and students alike. One is left with a sense of optimism and an enthusiastic taste in the mouth. This book is a pleasure to read in no small way due to the humour of Ferrell, Hayward and Young in (a) pointing out the absurdities of the discipline and (b) suggesting a refreshing alternative. Highly recommended reading.Dr. Matt LongNottingham Trent University", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Gray uses speculative language to describe how dinosaurs might have lived their daily lives (PerhapsAllosaurusfollowed herds. Maybe it ate dinosaurs that became sick or died). This, along with theorizing about the function of certain body parts, and the admission that scientists sometimes come to the wrong conclusions, presents paleontology as a fluid, ever-changing field where new discoveries are possible every day. Photographs paired with artist renditions make an exciting presentation. A competent and concise introduction.

She came out of the womb writing, her parents have recorded evidence of Andrea's whimsical imagination. She has had many poems and short stories published over the years, even did free verse sessions at a local coffee shop but there isn't any recorded evidence of that. Andrea is thankful for the lack of technology in the 90's.  After twenty-nine trips around the sun, she decided it was time to sit down and write her first book. And, she did. Two weeks before her 30th birthday, Andrea completed, Deadly Deception. Sadly, it sat in her laptop for two years before she decided to self-publish in November 2012.  Montlake Romance loved Deadly Deception and Deadly Redemption so much, they wanted them and their author. Andrea and Montlake Romance decided to interweave the two stories into one novel. The \"new\" Deadly Deception released October 8th, 2013. The 2nd book in the series, Deadly Revelation, released April 8th, 2014.  Andrea resides in North Carolina with her quirky family, where she homeschools her son and writes about the craziness that pours from her mind. Her son, Logan, has caught the writing bug. He talks about being on the Autism Spectrum and homeschooling at his very own blog, The Quirky Mustache. Logan has touched many lives and is her hero.

As an Author, I try to keep my stories as tasteful as possible while still remaining true to my characters. The men in my stories are over the top Alpha males, who will do anything to get the woman that they have set their sights set on. If any of these things offend you, then this is not the series for you.  I do not write stories that leave you hanging in hopes of you having to buy the next book. My stories are complete and will not leave you feeling as if you were forced into buying a sequel. Though my books come in series, each book is capable of standing alone and can be read without having to go through a numerical sequence. I also go out of my way to keep my pricing fair to the reader, because these books are 'self-published' and they are not as long as a standard published book would be. I chose to self-publish these fiction books in order to build up a fan base. As is the case of any other writer, I am growing and learning daily. I am constantly researching and studying in order to better myself for the people who enjoy my books. As my fan base grows and finances come along with that growth, I can promise my readers the traditional published and edited books. Though I am not a world renowned Author, I do have a very vivid imagination and the capability to tell a very emotive and provoking story. I look forward to growing with you and for you, because in my world it is all about you the reader. I hope that you enjoy reading my stories as much as I enjoyed writing them for you.", "related": ["B00KC8Q522"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He joined the British Army as an Infantry Junior Leader in 1972 at the tender age of 15, serving in the Coldstream Guards on ceremonial duties at the Royal Palaces, flying the flag in Africa, and on operations in both Ulster and on the UK mainland. In 1981 Andy swapped his green suit for a blue one with the Metropolitan Police. With volunteer reservist service in both the Wessex Regiment and 253 Provost Company, Royal Military Police (V) he spent twenty four years in front line policing, both in uniform and plain clothes. The final six years as a police officer were served in a London inner city borough and wearing two hats, those of an operation planner, and liaison officer with the television and film industry. His first literary work to be published was that of a poem about life as a soldier in Ulster, sold with all rights to a now defunct writers monthly in Dublin for the princely sum of £11 (less the price of the stamp on the envelope that the cheque arrived in.) The 'Armageddon's Song' series began as a mental exercise to pass the mornings whilst engaged on a surveillance operation on a drug dealer who never got out of bed until the mid afternoon. On retirement he emigrated with his wife to the Philippines where he dives for relaxation and is a member of the famous Asian running club 'The IGAT Runners'.

Yet, they\nprevailed, as did my country, and nowadays, Israel stands proud in its technological and economic\nachievements.My father hailed from Tunis, and was a staunch\nZionist, joining the Palmach and eventually losing a leg in the Battle of\nEylat, and in time, our family adopted its namesake as our surname.  My mother emigrated from France.  Life took its twists and turns.  My teens were a difficult time for me, as they no doubt are for\nmany. It was around that time that some of my deepest crises began to\nrear their heads, including my mother's attempted suicide, and my later\nmarriage that ended in divorce.I am now happily married to my Japanese husband whom I\nmet 25 years ago.  With an international\nbackground of Turkish grandparents, French mother and Tunisian father, is it\nany wonder that I would feel comfortable in any culture?As a child in Israel, stories from the Bible\nwere a routine part of the school curriculum.\nWhen I practiced Catholicism, I was indoctrinated into the teachings of\nthe New Testament.  I pursued studies in\nphilosophy and psychology, eventually graduating with a degree in the\nfield.  Writing has been a thread throughout.I suppose it is my exposure to the diversity of cultures\nthat has imbued me with sensibilities that are at the heart of this book.  I have made some mistakes, along with some\nquestionable choices, all of which has converged to create the woman I am today.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
