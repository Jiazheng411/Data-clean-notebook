While the Bs still go for French manicures and (gasp) matching furniture, Kate has embraced the urbane life. She has a Chelsea apartment and a neat job as school psychologist at Andrew Country Day \"in the best neighborhood in Manhattan.\" But when Kate meets bad boy bar owner Billy Nolan in her natal borough, she instantly wants to get Brooklyn back into the girl. He's hot for her, too, but fate intervenes in the form of Kate's best friend, Elliot Winston. Elliot and his boyfriend, Brice, are determined to keep Kate from committing romantic folly yet again. In a plot twist that the late Goldsmith (The First Wives Club, etc.) might have calledQueer Eye for the Straight Goy, Elliot notices that every time Billy dumps a girl, she marries the next guy she dates. So instead of following heart and loins to Billy's bed, Kate helps Elliot engineer a match between Billy and Bina, whose putative fiancé, Jack, went to Hong Kong without giving her the anticipated diamond. Minor complications abound, as Bina dates Billy but falls for someone else, and Kate's burning jealousy blinds her to the truth long after the reader sees it. Goldsmith's fans will perhaps forgive the almost farcical absence of reality; others may resent not only the illogic but also the stereotyping of gays, Jews, working-class Catholics and nearly everybody else. If Goldsmith had affection for her characters, she hid it well.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Langton first contemplated writing a book while lying, virtually paralysed, in a rehabilitation ward. He had earlier been stricken with a particularly serious form of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, sometimes referred to as G.B.S., and had already spent over seven months in intensive care, more than six of those months on a ventilator for breathing assistance. He had recovered his ability to speak, and was becoming used to entertaining visitors by recounting some of the dream sequences he had experienced during his period of hospitalisation. He was interested and encouraged by the positive messages he appeared to be providing to his visitors.Many of the dreams were quite hilarious, in spite of Brian's serious predicament, and it occurred to him that a collection of them would make for interesting reading. It had also become evident that few had experience of G.B.S., and he was constantly being made aware of just how rare the illness was, and of the nursing community's appetite for knowledge about the Syndrome. It was this realisation which prompted Brian to seriously consider writing a book, not just about the dream sequences but to produce a sort of handbook on G.B.S., suitable for medical professionals, caregivers, G.B.S. patients and relatives, alike.Upon eventual discharge from hospital, Brian carried these thoughts home. He could not write at that time. It was only just possible for him to move his right arm in a limited way from the shoulder. His recreational therapist had arranged a one finger splint to allow him to use a computer keyboard by pressing one key at a time, but it would take more than that to write a book, or so he thought. It was not until a student caregiver convinced him that he was physically capable of writing the book he was contemplating, even if it meant using 'voice software' and possibly, if the worst came to the worst, by the one finger typing method.Thus encouraged, and in spite of no writing experience, Brian, with the help and encouragement of that student, commenced work on his book at the start of the new millennium, January 2000.Brian was born in Derbyshire, England in 1928. He was educated at the West Bridgford Grammar School, Nottingham. After two years of service in the British Army, he embarked on an accounting career, which eventually led to a senior financial position in Salisbury, Wiltshire. In 1977, having achieved his career ambition, he emigrated for the second time, to the 'Blue Sky country' - Alberta, Canada - with his wife and three daughters, seeking new challenges.It was in June 1998 when he met with the catastrophic life-threatening illness, Guillain-Barré Syndrome. At the time of his frightening encounter with that disease, Brian was a healthy 'young' sixty-nine year old International Sales Manager. He was an enthusiastic golfer, even if, in his own words, not particularly good. In addition, he enjoyed various other hobbies, each one calling in its own way for physical fitness. These included gardening, model railroading, and walking. He had, and still has, a keen interest in nature. He loved to spend much of his leisure time walking and enjoying the wildlife that was so abundant in the area close to his home in Calgary.His book, A First Step - Understanding Guillain-Barré Syndrome, is a personal account of a battle for survival against an acute, chronic form of that rare disease, and his subsequent determination to return to as normal a life as possible. His story should be an inspiration to others.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

To do this job of demolition and reassembly, Robinson relies on a large and varied tool kit: energy, curiosity, elegant writing, and the wide-ranging experience of a life that took him from childhood in the segregated South - on what they called the \"colored\" side of the tracks - to the heights of American journalism.In a 25-year career at The Washington Post, Robinson has been city hall reporter, city editor, foreign correspondent in Buenos Aires and London, foreign editor, and assistant managing editor in charge of the paper's award-winning Style section. He has written books about race in Brazil and music in Cuba, covered a heavyweight championship fight, witnessed riots in Philadelphia and a murder trial in the deepest Amazon, sat with presidents and dictators and the Queen of England, thrusted and parried with hair-proud politicians from sea to shining sea, handicapped all three editions of \"American Idol,\" acquired fluent Spanish and passable Portuguese, and even reached an uneasy truce with the noxious hip-hop lyrics that fester in his teenage son's innocent-looking iPod.Using the old-fashioned instincts and habits of a reporter, Robinson goes out and finds these stories. He sees them as the foundation that supports his provocative opinions - and as building blocks that can be used to assemble the larger narrative of today's America.Robinson was born and raised in Orangeburg, S.C. and remembers the culminating years of the civil rights movement - the \"Orangeburg Massacre,\" a 1968 incident in which police fired on students protesting a segregated bowling alley and killed three unarmed young men, took place within sight of his house just a few hundred yards away. He was educated at Orangeburg High School, where he was one of a handful of black students on the previously all-white campus; and the University of Michigan, where during his senior year he was the first black student to be named co-editor-in-chief of the award-winning student newspaper, The Michigan Daily.Robinson's first book, \"Coal to Cream: A Black Man's Journey Beyond Color to an Affirmation of Race\", was published in 1999.

Not only do God's flames incinerate the impurities in our lives, but these fiery ordeals are also for righteousness sake, so that He gets glory from our earthly perseverance.

Original material adds to one connected series and completes Burstein's homages to Asimov, Heinlein and Clarke.

A Soldier is trained for battle, a wife has many more resources at her disposal, a mother in Arizona and a sister in Indiana often have nothing to help them understand what their loved one will experience or how to even get the answers they might need throughout a military deployment. Friends for Life is a story of two women who despite time, age and distance were able to find the love and support they needed to survive and thrive during their respective loved one's year long deployment to Iraq. Friends for Life affirms, despite the horrors of war and the fear that lives in the heart of every Soldier's loved one, that sometimes something as beautiful as a lifelong friendship can be found. The story they tell will touch the hearts of military and non-military families everywhere. A must read for any family member who is unsure of what to expect when their loved one deploys. --H.S. Bartel, Schofield Barracks, HIThis book is a must read for anyone who has any interest in what soldiers and families sacrifice for our freedoms. This story is written by two women, a mother and a sister of two soldiers who served in the Iraq War. These women, complete strangers before the war, became Friends For Life through this experience. The book allows those of us who have never experienced the terror of having a loved one in harm's way to have a glimpse of what happens to the families and the soldiers who are serving our country. The resource lists alone would be worth the price of the book. --Dr. Evelyn BristerThis book is a must read for anyone that has been touched by the war in Iraq.

She graduated from Yale and holds an MFA from the University of Michigan, where she won the Hopwood Award for the Novel-in-Progress.Little Boy Blues, Malcolm Jones’ elegant, poignant riff on his North Carolina childhood in the 1950s and ’60s, is actually much more than a memoir.Moving with grace and irony between the personal and the social, it traces a boy’s growing consciousness of family traditions and conflicts, race relations, music, religion, and a mid-south landscape--a landscape that has by now collapsed into the ground with many of the old houses in which such lives were once played out. Jones grew up mainly near Winston-Salem, with forays into South Carolina. He also grew up the only child of an ultimately single--and frequently bitter--mother, a bright, hardworking woman who hungered for respectability for her small family. At the heart of his story, rendered with humor, painful honesty, and compassion, stands an often-anguished bond between mother and son.Malcolm Jones doesn’t let his examination rest there, however. The beauty of the book lies in his ability to give small specificities an understated greater meaning: he touches on the liberation provided him by music, for example, in his meticulous rendering of the scratched-up shellac record that introduced him to the blues: “. . .the crackling hiss on its surface told me that someone had played it a lot.” A child surrounded by adults and their mysteries, the young Jones seems to have been as keen an observer as the older one, spectator in a world where manners and prayers were exhaustively taught but the obvious pain of adult lives never explained.I might as well confess here that I’ve ruined my copy of this book by turning down the corners of too many pages I found myself rereading on the spot. I’ve also ordered plenty more to give to friends of three generations.Little Boy Bluesis already among my favorite American memoirs, member of an elite line-up. I don’t know what plans Malcolm Jones has for a second such reminiscence, but I devoutly hope there will be one.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The nuns use Chaucer's Canterbury Tales as a hook on which to hang their discussion of fellow pilgrims, but the characters are instantly forgettable.

Senson, producer of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation�s radio science show �Quirks & Quarks,� has turned roughly 100 radio interviews into lively, short essays about some of the astonishing ways animals raise their young, find food, or, yes, have sex. Senson covers a lot of ground in this survey of the weird. In the first section, the battle of the sexes is discussed, with examples such as water-strider females evolving armament to keep males from riding on their backs, or male fish that sometimes eat the eggs they�ve just finished fertilizing. Impressing the other sex can lead to such oddities as home wrecking in bowerbirds or the use of citronella �cologne� in crested auklets. Parenting often creates dilemmas, such as the scarcity of nest burrows that causes band-rumped storm petrels to �time share.� Finding food can inspire creativity, such as the use of cow dung by burrowing owls to attract one of their favorite foods, dung beetles, or squirrels eating rattlesnake skins so they�ll smell like the snakes and be left alone. Based on interviews with scientists studying all walks of natural selection, this lively book is perfect for sampling during a spare moment. --Nancy Bent", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This tableau, twice repeated inThe Red and the Black, reveals two essential things about the novel. First, Julien Sorel is a social climber, on his way up in the world. And second, seducing the two women who become his lovers, both of them social superiors whose doors he cannot afford to be seen entering, turns out to be the major means of his social ascent.            The reader is under no obligation to sympathize with this erotic agenda for career advancement, however accidentally the ambitious young protagonist falls into it, or for that matter with the protagonist himself. Again and again, especially in the scenes of romantic courtship, Stendhal takes pains to show Julien’s conduct as animated, if that is the right word, by cold-blooded self-interest more than by genuine passion or desire. A military campaign aimed at conquering the enemy, one of Julien’s favorite metaphors for what he is up to, is not a particularly appetizing way to think about love. Why then have generations of tenderhearted readers found this tough-minded novel so compelling?            To begin with, it is because Stendhal makes the reader feel how heavy the odds are against ascending the social ladder from the point where Julien starts out. The stubborn incomprehension Julien gets from his peasant father, while it falls somewhat short of monstrous tyranny, does set him up (like Charlotte Brontë’sJane Eyre) as a sort of nineteenth-century Cinderella: a suffering, sensitive, disadvantaged figure with whom it is almost impossible not to identify, at least at the outset. In bringing this fairy-tale structure forward into the dense, realistically observed detail of early-nineteenth-century France (the novel’s subtitle is “A Chronicle of 1830”), Stendhal also puts French history itself to work in making his protagonist more palatable. Though the Revolution of 1830 is not in fact discussed—the novel was finished before it broke out, and it was his publisher’s idea, not Stendhal’s, to use the subtitleto capitalize on reader interest in this topical and momentous event—one can hardly avoid the sense of unbearably oppressive social weather on the eve of a devastating political thunderstorm. In the period after the defeats of Napoléon in 1813 and 1815, conventionally described as the Restoration (the monarchy was restored to power), the term “reactionary” was not a piece of mud-slinging hyperbole. Hard though it may be for a twenty-first-century reader to take in, the French Revolution’s proposal that democracy should be realized in the world was still, to its opponents, unnatural and terrifying. The people who ruled France during the Restoration were self-consciously reacting against the democratic idea itself, and not merely against the violence of the terror with which that idea had been visited upon the king and the aristocracy. In restoring the monarchy, the rulers were restoring a natural social order in which, as God willed, one’s place was determined by one’s birth. Piety, hierarchy, and social immobility were cherished moral values of the age. Seen against this backdrop, Julien looks a lot more sympathetic. He seems to have little choice but to pretend he believes things he doesn’t believe, like the dogmas of the church. If he wants to improve his lowly condition, history decrees he must be a hypocrite. In love, as in religion and politics, he must ignore the empty banalities he is fed and take a hungrily scientific interest in how the gears and levers of social power really work.            Stendhal also softens our view of Julien by refusing to offer morally attractive alternatives. When Julien asserts that “‘the people whom the world honors are merely villains who have had the good fortune not to have been caught red-handed’”, he is both a rebel against his time and, less obviously, a representaative of it. Behind the Restoration’s pious façade there was in fact significant social motion, even if such motion was deemed illegitimate and was officially denied. The increasing prosperity of Julien’s shrewdly business-like father, which complicates the image of Julien’s own rise as unique and unprecedented, is an obvious example, and there are others. An amoral skill in worldly matters—what the French callmondanité—was prized even in ecclesiastical circles, as we see in Stendhal’s accounts of priestly maneuverings over church titles and positions, over land, and, in the case of the Abbé Frilair’s dishonorable intentions with regard to Mathilde, over sex. If Julien differs from the people around him, it is in part by being honest with himself, which is to say (given his place at the novel’s center of consciousness) honest with us. And this honesty helps offset the impact his hypocrisy with others has on us.            To complicate matters further, Stendhal leaves us guessing as to whether Julien’s career might after all embody some higher moral principle than merely getting ahead. Whatarethe deep motives for his social ascent? When his father knocks Julien’s book out of his hands and into the stream beneath the sawmill, the blow is struck not against reading as such; Julien’s talent for memorizing Latin texts, which will do almost as much as his good looks to aid in his rise, has not been discouraged at home. Symbolically, the target is Julien’s passionate attachment to the ideals and accomplishments of the French Revolution and its recently defeated hero, Napoléon. (The book he is absorbed in when caught by his father is a record of conversations with Napoléon from prison.) Stendhal, who had himself marched with Napoléon’s armies in defense of the Revolution, made no secret of his own revolutionary loyalties. Dreaming of a greatness higher than his father’s money-making, Julien acts out his author’s feelings about the sordidness of Restoration France. And in so doing he also acts in the name of upward mobility, which one might have thought entirely consistent with money-making. “Careers open to talent!”, Napoléon’s meritocratic motto, at that moment still sounded (mainly) revolutionary, however ambiguous it may have come to seem since then. Stendhal seemed to think upward mobility could mainly be alignedagainstmoney-making. The novel’s early chapters find various ways, subtle and not so subtle, of associating Julien with those still poorer and more unfortunate than himself, like the prisoners on the other side of M. Valenod’s wall, who are stopped from singing so as not to disturb Valenod’s distinguished guests as they carouse. Even the scene in which M. de Rênal decides to hire Julien as his children’s tutor, thereby setting the novel’s plot in motion, is framed by concern—not M. de Rênal’s, of course, but the novel’s—over how the poor of the village are being treated by its constituted authorities. As he climbs his various ladders, Julien somehow carries this concern with him. One of the novel’s ongoing interpretive mysteries is what exactly he is striving for or, more precisely, to what extent his goals transcend the acquisition of money and power for himself.", "related": [], "rank": 523538, "title": "The Red and the Black", "author": "Stendhal", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This notebook bound in dark varnished leather, is it not, tooled with a design of rich roses, thornless, yet leafy, a design that means only Design in the final analysis but bespeaks an authority. What is written beneath this heavy and handsome book cover will count, sayeth this cover.The thick pages are ruled in light blue—you are practical, so thoughtful, and you probably know I almost never put pen to paper to write anything at all.Even the sound of the pen has its allure, the sharp scratch rather like the finest quills in ancient Rome when I would put them to parchment to write my letters to my Father, when I would write in a diary my own laments . . . ah, that sound. The only thing missing here is the smell of ink, but we have the fine plastic pen which will not run out for volumes, making as fine and deep a black mark as I choose  to make.I am thinking about your request in writing. You see you will get something from me. I find myself yielding to it, almost as one of our human victims yields to us, discovering perhaps as the rain continues to fall outside, as the café continues with its noisy chatter, to think that this might not be the agony I presumed—reaching back over the two thousand years—but almost a pleasure, like the act of drinking blood itself.I reach now for a victim who is not easy for me to overcome: my own past. Perhaps this victim will flee from me with a speed that equals my own. Whatever, I seek now a victim that I have never faced. And there is the thrill of the hunt in it, what the modern world calls investigation.Why else would I see those times so vividly now? You had no magic potion to give me to loosen my thoughts. There is but one potion for us and it is blood.You said at one point as we walked towards the café, “You will remember everything.”You, who are so young amongst us yet were so old as a mortal, and such a scholar as a mortal. Perhaps it is natural that you so boldly attempt to collect our stories.But why seek to explain here such curiosity as yours, such bravery in face of blood-drenched truth?How could you have kindled in me this longing  to go back, two thousand years, almost exactly— to tell of my mortal days on Earth in Rome, and  how I joined Marius, and what little chance he had against Fate.How could origins so deeply buried and so long denied suddenly beckon to me. A door snaps open. A light shines. Come in.I sit back now in the café.I write, but I pause and look around me at the people of this Paris café. I see the drab unisex fabrics of this age, the fresh American girl in her olive green military clothes, all of her possessions slung over her shoulder in a backpack; I see the old Frenchman who has come here for decades merely to look at the bare legs and arms of the young, to feed on the gestures as if he were a vampire, to wait for some exotic jewel of a moment when a woman sits back laughing, cigarette in hand, and the cloth of her synthetic blouse becomes tight over her breasts and there the nipples are visible.Ah, old man. He is gray-haired and wears an expensive coat. He is no menace to anyone. He lives entirely in vision. Tonight he will go back to a modest but elegant apartment which he has maintained since the last Great World War, and he will watch films of the young beauty Brigitte Bardot. He lives in his eyes. He has not touched a woman in ten years.I don’t drift, David. I drop anchor here. For I will not have my story pour forth as from a drunken  oracle.I see these mortals in a more attentive light. They are so fresh, so exotic and yet so luscious to me, these mortals; they look like tropical birds must have looked when I was a child; so full of fluttering, rebellious life, I wanted to clutch them to have it, to make their wings flap in my hands, to capture flight and own it and partake of it. Ah, that terrible moment in childhood when one accidentally crushes the life from a bright-red bird.Yet they are sinister in their darker vestments, some of these mortals: the inevitable cocaine dealer—and they are everywhere, our finest prey—who waits for his contact in the far corner, his long leather coat styled by a noted Italian designer, his hair shaved close on the side and left bushy on the top to make him look distinctive, which it does, though there is no need when one considers his huge black eyes, and the hardness of what nature intended to be a generous mouth. He makes those quick impatient gestures with his cigarette lighter on the small marble table, the mark of the addicted; he twists, he turns, he cannot be comfortable. He doesn’t know that he will never be comfortable in life again. He wants to leave to snort the cocaine for which he burns and yet he must wait for the contact. His shoes are too shiny, and his long thin hands will never grow old.I think he will die tonight, this man. I feel a slow gathering desire to kill him myself. He has fed so much poison to so many. Tracking him, wrapping him in my arms, I would not even have to wreathe him with visions. I would let him know that death has come in the form of a woman too white to  be human, too smoothed by the centuries to be  anything but a statue come to life. But those for whom he waits plot to kill him. And why should I  intervene?What do I look like to these people? A woman with long wavy clean brown hair that covers me much like a nun’s mantle, a face so white it appears cosmetically created, and eyes, abnormally brilliant, even from behind golden glasses.Ah, we have a lot to be grateful for in the many styles of eyeglasses in this age—for if I were to take these off, I should have to keep my head bowed,  not to startle people with the mere play of yellow and brown and gold in my eyes, that have grown ever more jewel-like over the centuries, so that I seem a blind woman set with topaz for her pupils, or rather carefully formed orbs of topaz, sapphire, even aquamarine.Look, I have filled so many pages, and all I am saying is Yes, I will tell you how it began for me.Yes, I will tell you the story of my mortal life in ancient Rome, how I came to love Marius and how we came to be together and then to part.What a transformation in me, this resolution.How powerful I feel as I hold this pen, and how eager to put us in sharp and clear perspective before I begin fulfilling your request.This is Paris, in a time of peace. There is rain. High regal gray buildings with their double windows and iron balconies line this boulevard. Loud, tiny, dangerous automobiles race in the streets. Cafés, such as this, are overflowing with international tour- ists. Ancient churches are crowded here by tenements, palaces turned to museums, in whose rooms I linger for hours gazing at objects from Egypt  or Sumer which are even older than me. Roman  architecture is everywhere, absolute replicas of Temples of my time now serve as banks. The words  of my native Latin suffuse the English language. Ovid, my beloved Ovid, the poet who predicted his  poetry would outlast the Roman Empire, has been proved true.Walk into any bookstore and you find him in neat, small paperbacks, designed to appeal to students.Roman influence seeds itself, sprouting mighty oaks right through the modern forest of computers, digital disks, microviruses and space satellites.It is easy here—as always—to find an embraceable evil, a despair worth tender fulfillment.And with me there must always be some love of the victim, some mercy, some self-delusion that the death I bring does not mar the great shroud of inevitability, woven of trees and earth and stars, and human events, which hovers forever around us ready to close on all that is created, all that we know.Last night, when you found me, how did it seem to you? I was alone on the bridge over the Seine, walking in the last dangerous darkness before dawn.You saw me before I knew you were there. My hood was down and I let my eyes in the dim light of the bridge have their little moment of glory. My victim stood at the railing, no more than a child, but bruised and robbed by a hundred men. She wanted to die in the water. I don’t know if the Seine is deep enough for one to drown there. So near the Ile St.-Louis. So near Notre Dame. Perhaps it is, if one can resist a last struggle for life.But I felt this victim’s soul like ashes, as though her spirit had been cremated and only the body remained, a worn, disease-ridden shell. I put my arm around her, and when I saw the fear in her small black eyes, when I saw the question coming, I wreathed her with images. The soot that covered  my skin was not enough to keep me from looking like the Virgin Mary, and she sank into hymns and devotion, she even saw my veils in the colors she  had known in churches of childhood, as she yielded to me, and I—knowing that I needn’t drink, but thirsting for her, thirsting for the anguish she could give forth in her final moment, thirsting for the tasty red blood that would fill my mouth and make me feel human for one instant in my very monstrosity—I gave in to her visions, bent her neck, ran my fingers over her sore tender skin, and then it was, when I sank my teeth into her, when I drank from her—it was then that I knew you were there. You watched.I knew it, and I felt it, and I saw the image of us in your eye, d...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All rights reserved.Game: Magic Rocks.Age: 3 years+,Minimum number of participants: 2Resources needed: Clear space, a wand (optional).Other Benefits: To stimulate children's imagination and creativity.Instructions:\n Get each child to find a clear space. They must make sure that they are\n not touching anyone else. The children crouch down on the floor and\nmake a ball shape with their bodies. The teacher explains that all\nchildren are magic rocks and that the teacher is a magic wizard. The\nteacher waves the magic wand and says: \"Magic rocks turn into\ndinosaurs.\" All the children turn into dinosaurs and move around the\nroom as dinosaurs. The teacher then says: \"Magic rocks turn into magic\nrocks.\" The children return to their clear spaces and crouch down on the\n floor again as quickly as possible. The magic wizard can change the\nmagic rocks into anything they want, for example superheroes, animals,\npeople, household items and so on.  Variation: The children can take it\nturns to be the magic wizard.Game: OctopusAge: 4 years +Minimum number of participants: 3Resources needed: Clear space.Other Benefits: This game can be used to work on co-operation and teamwork skills.Instructions:\n One child is chosen or volunteers to be the octopus and stands in the\nmiddle of the clear space. The rest of the children should line up along\n one side of the space. When the octopus shouts out \"Octopus!\" the other\n children have to run past the octopus and try to reach the other side\nwithout being caught. Children that are caught become part of the\noctopus's arms. They are not allowed to let go of each other's hands.\nOnly the children at the ends of the octopus's arms can catch people. As\n the game progresses, the octopus becomes longer and longer. The game\nbecomes more difficult, as more and more children become part of the\noctopus's arms. It ends when all the children are caught.Game: Prison BreakAge: 4 years +Minimum number of participants: 3Resources needed: Clear space.Other\n Benefits: This is a warm up game that children really enjoy. It also\ncan be used to improve listening and co-ordination skills.Instructions:\n Children all line up on one side of the clear space. One student is\nchosen, or volunteers, to be the guard on duty and stands in the centre\nof the room. The rest of the children are prisoners. When the guard\nshouts out \"Prison break!\" all the prisoners must run to the other side\nof the space. If the guard catches a prisoner they also become a guard.\nEventually there will be more guards then prisoners. The last prisoner\nbecomes the first guard on duty for the next game.Game: Fruit BasketAge: 4 years+Minimum number of participants: 7Resources needed: Clear space and a chair for each student - if you do not have chairs you can use sheets of paper or cushions.Other Benefits: This is a well-known game which can also be used very effectively as a listening game or an observation game.Instructions:\n All the children sit in circle on a chair or a cushion. The teacher\nchooses three different fruits and goes around the circle giving each\nperson the name of a fruit, in a particular order, for example, apple,\norange, banana. A child is then chosen, or volunteers, to go into the\ncentre of the circle. His/Her chair is taken away. The child in the\ncentre calls out the name of one of the three fruits. If the child in\nthe centre says apple then all the apples change place, if s/he says\nbanana, all the bananas change place and if s/he says orange, all the\noranges change places. If s/he says fruit basket then everyone changes\nplaces. The child who is left without a chair goes into the centre for\nthe next round.Variations: There are lots of variations to this\ngame and you can change the names to go with a specific theme. Fruit\nbasket - apple, orange, and banana -could be replaced by: Barnyard -\nchicken, pig and cow, Zoo - elephant, giraffe and tiger, Circus - clown,\n ringmaster and acrobat, Ocean - fish, mermaid and shark.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As in earlier editions, the book includes a time line, an introduction, country studies, and chapters that focus on significant trends. Comparing the countries included in the 'Country Studies' section of this newest edition reveals some differences. Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, and the Scandinavian region are featured in all previous editions, whereas Russia and Poland, included in this fourth edition, did not always appear in older editions. The country studies provide an excellent historical overview, along with coverage of the current political climate, for each featured country. The chapter on postwar Italy's complicated political history is particularly interesting. The editors continue to address significant European issues. Contributors represent scholars from a variety of disciplines and institutions. Some names are new to this edition, while others have contributed to earlier versions. Chapters include box inserts of news articles, statistics, maps (where relevant), and a bibliography for further reading. The 'Thematic Chapters' section supports the tone set in the introduction, which states that 'Europe faces an existential crisis,' by focusing on the struggles for European integration, governance, and dealing with NATO. Highly recommended.

A young deaf woman, accepted into one of the few programs providing hearing ear service, is matched with a dog and attends an intensive training course. The remainder of the book details their first year together. The bonding process is presented as spiritual in nature as the hearing aide dog enhances the quality of life for its deaf owner. Indeed, although the writing is somewhat dry, the story presented here gives an upbeat portrait. The dog provides the woman with a way of overcoming obstacles. She becomes more self assured, gains recognition at the office, makes new friends, and becomes romantically involved. Yates was fortunate: she points out in regard to other owners and their dogs that there are sometimes compatibility problems. A more straightforward account is Patricia Curtis' Cindy, a Hearing Ear Dog (Dutton, 1981) which has less fictionalizing and presents information clearly and concisely. Curtis' book also has photographs and a list of organizations. Sound Friendships reads as a story, and information must be culled from it.

And as he learned to play guitar and sing, he also studied their music. In the Kindle SingleBeyond the Sun... The Story, Isaak recounts his life-long admiration for the rockers who got their start at Sun Studio in Memphis. His writing reflects the melodic and humble qualities of his songs. But while his songs, such as \"I Believe\" or \"Wicked Game,\" are tight and evocative, his writing here is loose and free-form, touching on his childhood, his influences, and the formation of his band. He also tells the elaborate back story behind his most recent album,Beyond the Sun, a tribute to the Sun Studio originals.

Il s’installe en 1879 à Londres où il est reçu dans la meilleure société et où il développe ses théories esthétiques qui feront l’objet de conférences aux Etats-Unis. En 1884, il épouse Constance Lloyd avec qui il a deux fils. En 1891, il rencontre Lord Alfred Douglas Queensberry et leur union homosexuelle scandalise Londres et le père d’Alfred qui poussera oscar Wilde à entrer dans une procédure judiciaire pour diffamation. En 1895, le jugement est sans appel : Oscar Wilde doit passer deux ans en prison pour pédérastie. À son retour en 1897, l’auteur est changé et bien plus virulent contre l’ordre bourgeois. Il s’installe alors en France où il développe un intérêt croissant pour l’art gothique et pour une esthétique plus torturée. Lui-même se laisse peu à peu décliner malgré le soutien d’amis tels qu’André Gide à ses côtés et il meurt à 46 ans.Oscar Wilde est enterré au cimetière du Père Lachaise. Il laisse derrière lui une image de dandysme et de légèreté en accord avec ses dernières paroles : « Ou ce papier peint disparaît, ou c’est moi. »", "related": [], "rank": 19789, "title": "Portrait de Dorian Gray, Le (French Edition) eBook", "author": "Oscar Wilde", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

During her training as a landscape gardener, she wrote her first novel, a manuscript full of a beginner’s mistakes. Fortunately, she found books on Creative Writing and soon her stories improved. For a while, reality interfered with her writing but after finishing a degree in forestry and a PhD in Science she returned to her vocation. She enjoys to write Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Historical Novels for all age groups. At present, she is writing at her next project in a small house near Hildesheim, Germany, where she lives with her husband, three children, and a dog.", "related": [], "rank": 3092534, "title": "Urchin King: Historical Fantasy", "author": "Katharina Gerlach", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 3.8889, "rating_total": 35.0}

After serving in Vietnam, he finished his enlistment in Barstow, California, in the Mojave Desert. Many off-duty hours were spent exploring deep in the mines in the close-by Calico ghost town. It was there that his lasting interest in silver and gold mining was formed.  After his enlistment was up, Watson and his wife, Carol, moved back to the California coast and after college he worked in the medical field there for twenty years. In 1991 they moved their family to Carson City, Nevada, where they currently reside.  When time permits, Watson enjoys taking trips to abandoned mining towns throughout Nevada and eastern California.

She was the founder, editor, and publisher of Daughters of Nyx: A Magazine of Goddess Stories, Mythmaking, and Fairy Tales. Her work has twice been short-listed for the Tiptree Award and has appeared in many best-of-the-year anthologies. Critics have admired her “literary fearlessness” and her vivid language and imagination. John Clute, writing about her novel The Gaia Websters in the third edition of The Science Fiction Encyclopedia, had this to say: “In the end, as usual in her work, any useful answers are held by the Earth herself.” Clute’s words could serve as a handy description of Kim’s writing and her life. Kim’s first novel The Jigsaw Woman is a modern classic of feminist literature. Her other novels include Church of the Old Mermaids, The Fish Wife, Ruby’s Imagine, Her Frozen Wild, and Mercy, Unbound.

If the body lacks\ninsulin, a diabetic person becomes more fatigue than usual. However, diabetes\ncan be controlled when you follow a strict meal plan which means eating\ndiabetic-friendly food all the time. It is suggested by health experts that\npeople who are diabetic should be eating healthy food and follow a strict\ndiabetic plan because it will help them lower the chances of stroke and heart\ndiseases which are two complications associated with the disease. Do you have\ndiabetes or have loved ones who has this disease? Do you always find it very\nchallenging to find healthy but tasty diabetic-friendly recipes that you can\neasily prepare at home?

Either way, they will be missed when coming to the end. As in life, the roles of the characters in the story are not limited to one simple category; they are braided and bound by the intricate weave of them all. As you embrace the storyline and characters I’ve created,  my intention is for you to come to think of them as real figures plucked from the pages of history. And although I have included a tremendous amount of information about the workings of the Civil War and following era’s to support the integrity and enrichment of the tale, Dove Collect is historical fiction.

Her most challenging and rewarding role however, has been that of being a mother. She says, “Children don’t come with instruction manuals. Sometimes you just have to make it up as you go along, and have lots of love and faith”. Through joy, heartache, laughter and tears, Amber discovered a passion for helping and encouraging others to enjoy the journey we call life.

Peckford is a former premier of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador and holds a Bachelor of Education degree, having also completed postgraduate work in English Literature, Education, Psychology, and French Literature. Prior to entering politics, he was a high school teacher in rural Newfoundland.He was first elected to the House of Assembly in 1972 at the age of twenty-nine. He was appointed parliamentary assistant to the premier, Honourable Frank Moores, in 1973. The following year he was appointed minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing and in 1976 held the portfolios of minister of: Mines and Energy; and Rural and Northern Development. At the age of thirty-six, he was elected leader of the provincial Progressive Conservative Party and premier of the province, becoming the youngest first minister in over 100 years.It was Peckford's administration that fought for and achieved a new, groundbreaking arrangement with the federal government called the Atlantic Accord, which has become the template for all exploration and development of offshore oil and gas resources in Canada. It is under this arrangement that the oil fields of Hibernia, Terra Nova, and White Rose have been developed and are producing today. It is as a result of the revenues from these developments that the province of Newfoundland and Labrador has achieved \"have\" status, the first time since becoming a part of Canada in 1949. Peckford retired from public life in 1989 and established his own consulting business serving government and business clients in North America and Europe.In 1982, Peckford received the Vanier Award as an outstanding young Canadian. That same year he was sworn to the Privy Council of Canada by her majesty the Queen, and he published a book in 1983 entitledThe Past in the Presentexpressing his views on Newfoundland and Labrador's economic history and prospects. In 1986, he received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Memorial University and served on the board of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and as chair of its Human Resources Committee from 1993 to 1998. He was appointed, in 1998, as a one-person inquiry by the Government of British Columbia to investigate the state of Fraser River salmon stocks and management issues related to the fishery. Two reports were issued in ninety days, on budget. In 2001, he received an Outstanding Contribution Award from the Newfoundland Ocean Industries Association for his work on offshore oil and gas issues. In 2007, he was appointed Chancellor of Sprott Shaw Degree College.In 2008, Mr. Peckford was chair of a federal government-appointed expert panel to review federal chronic disease policy, especially diabetes, and to present a report to the federal Health minister. The report was completed on time and on budget. Peckford is currently a director of Strongbow Exploration Inc., a public junior mining company with exploration interests in British Columbia, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and the United States. He and his wife, Carol, reside in Qualicum Beach on Vancouver Island.Although Peckford is well-known for his persistent efforts to improve the financial and economic condition of his native province, there are other firsts for which he and his administrations are responsible, including the first aquaculture legislation, first Department of Environment, first pay equity policy, first Arts Council, first Status of Women Council, first community college system, and the first and only Fine Arts degree program and building at the Grenfell Campus of Memorial University in Corner Brook.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Since the death of creator Robert E.  Howard in 1936, several authors have kept the franchise going.  The plot of the 1980 Liberator is typical: the mercenary  barbarian commands an army sworn to destroy an evil ruler and  liberate the oppressed. Enter an evil sorcerer, and Conan finds  that it will take more than his sword to win this battle.  Despite the corny story, de Camp and Carter's solid rep in the  sword and sorcery world will guarantee fun for fans of the  series. In Sword of Skelos (1979), Conan is matched with \"the  beautiful and fierce\" Isparana to deliver a magic amulet. The  two are double-crossed and must face the evil sword that can  fight on its own. Diehards aren't drawn to these books for the  great plots, so this one also is worth buying, especially at  this price.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B003552THY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His father was the son of a French nobleman and a Black slave and took the name Dumas from his mother, fighting as a general under Napoleon himself. He died of cancer when Alexandre was four, leaving the family very poor. Working at the Palais Royal, under the Duke of Orleans, Dumas began writing articles and plays under the name Dumas, as his father had done.  His plays became popular, and he took to writing full time.  In 1830, however, he became embroiled in the French Revolution, which placed the Duke of Orleans on the throne. After peace was restored, Dumas began writing novels which were translated into many other languages, earning him a great deal of money, which he spent as fast as he made.  Living the high-life and having as many as forty mistresses, he wrote more than 100,000 pages in his lifetime. When Napoleon became president, ousting the Duke of Orleans, Dumas fled to Belgium, then to Russia and Italy.  In 1840, he married Ida Ferrier and had at least seven illegitimate children.  He died on December 5, 1870, in Seine-Maritime, France, at the age of 68.  In 2002, his ashes were reinterred in the Pantheon de Paris, a great honor.", "related": [], "rank": 1400551, "title": "The Corsican Brothers", "author": "Aexandre Dumas", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Simmons (HarperCollins, 2012), when she was newly orphaned. The pluck (and a bit of magic) that she demonstrated allowed her to escape from her callous, potentially lethal, uncle. That same grit, and a great deal more magic, help Lucy now as she sets out to find a relative who has researched the curse that ails her family-the same one that caused the death of her parents. Lucy and a motley crew set sail from Maine and travel to Australia in seach of her long-lost aunt. Magic figures prominently throughout the entire voyage, not only propelling the ship along at a fantastic speed, conveniently saving the characters from several disasters, but also allowing Lucy to find clues (through a very special deck of playing cards) to locate her aunt. Sailing on a 19th-century ship is effectively described using nautical terms. An adept sailor herself, Lucy interacts regularly with everyone onboard. The international crew spouts accents that are almost clichés (a native of the Caribbean reveals that \"…back on my island, me, I be da shaman. I feels dings of the spirit world…\" while an Italian warns of an iceberg, saying, \"Bergy-bit, this-a big…Ice-a-berg….\") The characterization is a bit thin but the tale unwinds at breakneck speed to a generally satisfying ending that leads in to the next installment.—Maria B.

Yes, we took the last page of Book 1 and burst into another volume... the problem was, we had moved away from the original small-town High School background, and had grown into the surrounding Arizona area, running along I from all directions from Flagstaff. But we had the Vampire High School series to consider, so we kept the main title.Book 3: The Rage Wars soon followed, and the series continued under the Vampire High School banner. The characters had grown older, both in years and experience, again taking them past the original High School tag, but we're writers; we have vivid imaginations, we'd written three novels, and put our three/four main characters through the mill.But that wasn't out current problem; we'd also invented a host of minor players in our vampire tapestry. These characters needed some fleshing out, but not in a clinical, hidden, behind-the-scenes way, but in a complete reader-driven back story anthology.So out pops our biggest volume yet, Blood Anthology, just giving background stories. In addition, since we hadn't enough on our plate, we had started a new book, called Vampires Don't Cry; a deeper, darker tale. So dark, reading it out loud, it made my wife cry.At first we'd decided to write in two separate series, but of course, we had mixed characters from each series, it seemed to be getting kinda muddy which series some characters belonged to.Then we wrote Vampire High School Book 4: Blood Red Roses, in which our major characters, Lyman and Mandy go to college, leaving their high school days firmly behind them. They'd also moved on sexually, and Book 4: Blood red Roses had a more serious erotic side that the character growth could not contain.Either way, we'd moved on from the original name.So, we've re-branded the whole series; every book is now under the Vampires Don't Cry banner.Book 1 will now have the subtitle; Vampire High School, as a homage to the old ideals. And the darker book, due out in 2014? We plan on it.We've decided to call that series; Vampires Don't Cry; Origins.It all seems simple, looking back, once you've talked about it for year! All the best from April and Ian, and we hope our 'transformation' won't cause you too much trouble.", "related": ["B004E3XVIM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In another, the individual stories are so exquisitely personal you want to savour each one, linger over it, mull it over, and see if you can apply it to your own life and experience.Each story is based on Owen Zupp's personal experience, ethic or deep contemplation about the nature of aviation past and present. He brings the history of aviation into the `now' and makes the past relevant to today's reader.The stories range from the humorous to the tragic but even the saddest has an uplifting note. 50 Tales of Flight: From Biplanes to Boeings is a must read for trainee pilots (who will learn much from an experienced old stager), aviation buffs and anyone interested in memoir based short stories. Each tale is a gem. Beautifully, thoughtfully written. A must read. More than deserving of 5 stars.\"-Kristen Alexander, author of \"Clive Caldwell. Air Ace\" and \"Jack Davenport.

He carried out research into the discovery of new sweeteners, and looked in depth at the ways sweeteners work.  When he left industry in 1992, he became a professor at Rosalind Franklin University. He has spent the last 21 years there doing research and teaching in the College of Pharmacy, the Medical School, and the Graduate School. His current areas of research include sweeteners, antiviral drugs, and antibiotics. He also teaches a course in communicating scientific information, and has written a book on that subject (Scientists Must Speak, co-authored with his wife, Gale Walters, who is a food scientist). Conducting research and communicating science are his passions. On several occasions he has been called on as an expert witness.

He encouraged everyone to memorize 12 verses over a 12 week period.  I took the challenge seriously and over the next 12 weeks selected verses that were meaningful to me and memorized them.  This began a passion in me for the word of God and memorizing verses from it.This brief book contains some of my favourite passages for prayer, meditation and memorization My prayer is that it would be a blessing to you as you pursue you own personal relationship with God.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She still grasps every possible chance to be free and feral but regrets those opportunities are too few. JB Rowley’s full name is June Barnes-Rowley.

How many times have you seen your child throwing a temper tantrum, frustrated, angry, screaming and shouting?Everything you have tried doing - soothing, caressing, embracing, yelling, punishing - have only served to send them deeper into their emotional turmoil. Have you experienced your children being sad because they had a fight with a friend? They cry, their sadness threatening to engulf them completely and maybe engulf you a little too. You are probably familiar with the situation in which your little loved ones are in the middle of a jealousy attack; irritating, snatching, pushing one of their siblings who got a gift or attention, exhibiting little to no self-control. Your children's emotional mood takes over their entire world and it seems as if nothing can stop the emotional storm. Your children's eruptive behavior is threatening to control you too. You often feel helpless. Now, please close your eyes and imagine your children are able to manage their emotions and thoughts. Imagine them doing it easily, simply, and intuitively. Imagine them feeling so comfortable with themselves that they have no problem sharing their feelings with you.Is it a Dream?Is it a reality?Is it possible?Yes!They will be able to do it once you allow them to float off to the dreamy world of Mood Balloons. Mood Balloons? Yes. Mood Balloons. Mood and balloons. This is a Kingdom in which each thought and emotion is connected to the tops of our heads by a string: A Mood Balloon.Every balloon has a unique color representing our mood at any given moment. The Mood Balloon expresses the mood and the color of the world our children are experiencing. Our emotional management tool is intended for children between the 3 -6 years old, the dream period of early childhood. During this period they will meet the very violent world of stimuli and screens which is all around us. The Mood Balloons allow the children to deal with this harsh world by means of little, charming childhood images. This happens with the help of a simple and friendly tool. The Children color their Mood Balloons with five easy steps, and as we, the parents would say, start managing their moods:Observation: the children are asked to observe the colorful balloons. Every color symbolizes an emotion they experience and feel. (Pink - love, blue - sadness, orange -joy, and so on)Point of view: the Mood Balloon's color can mold the children's perception of reality, causing them to experience and believe a story that is not a true story as if it was. The Mood Balloon's color is the color through which the children perceive people and things in the world. Attention: We ask the children to pay attention to every emotionalstorm they experience, which calms them down before the mood takes over their world and colors their Mood Balloon.Breathing: the children win the key to the kingdom of their personal emotions by breathing. Success: children who have chosen the color of their Mood Balloon and stand behind their choice will not be emotionally shaken the next time a storm passes by. All over the world thousands of children reading and listening to this story are carried away by this magical and imaginary tale. It fortifies their ability to believe in themselves as the person in charge of their own moods.The book invites you, the parents, to give your children tools which will enable them to conduct a different conversation with the world. A conversation existing in an indirect and colorful space, without clouding the delicate \"I\" which wakes up, develops and lands in this word in the years of early childhood.Apparently, there is another option to the limited conversation: \"How was playschool today?\" with the constant, vague answer: \"Fun\". You can ask the children what Mood Balloon they met today. You wouldn't believe the wealth of stories and experiencesthat will burst out of that conversation.The Mood Balloon reality becomes an accessible, easy and simple emotional base through which the child's experiences are easily accessed and converted.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Growing up, she was always very artistic and decided to attend college at the University of Kentucky in their Architecture program. After graduation, she spent a year traveling the world. She has been to 14 countries and over 40 of the United States. When she realized that working at an architecture firm and attending school for architecture were vastly different, she decided to pursue her art again. Elissa then went on to receive her BFA from Georgia State University, and graduated in 2005 Suma Cum Laude. It was shortly after her graduation that she was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. This debilitating disease kept Elissa almost completely bedridden for 3 years and kept her from working on her ceramics. Even though she couldn't be a ceramicist at that time, she found other ways to satisfy her artistic needs including writing. The premise for her first novel, \"Between Heaven and Helen,\" came to her in a dream. Elissa had finished her first children's book, \"Are They Speaking Martian?\" in 2012. Now she is completing a children's book trilogy about Booker the Cat. In her spare time, she still works in clay, and even though the fibromyalgia is under control, she still experiences bouts with pain every day. Elissa never thought she had a prowess for writing but she has happily proved herself wrong. Elissa doesn't plan on stopping her artistic or writing pursuits anytime soon.", "related": [], "rank": 3897776, "title": "Booker the Bald Cat", "author": "Elissa Burr", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This is the holy grail of pharmaceutical technology books. The text reads well and introduces difficult concepts in a more easy-to-understand way. It is definitely worth the money to help you get through the module, If you are doing a research project in pharmaceutical design then this would also be an excellent buy.''In my pharmacy degree I have to do a Physiochemical Principles of Pharmacy module which is about drug forms/dosage etc. and this book really helps and is really well laid out and easy to understand. Definitely a book I would recommend to any pharmacy student and my lecturer says it's a book needed for nearly the whole degree so means it's not another book you'll use once and then wonder why you spent so much on it.''This book is on most reading lists for a UK Pharmacy Degree (MPharm). It is great for the Pharmaceutics aspect of the course. It is easy to read, with good diagrams and pictures to help explain concepts well. It is probably one of the easiest reads for Pharmaceutics textbooks.

An emerging theme was the image of astronauts and cosmonauts in popular culture and the media in the US and Russia/Soviet Union. The book begins with a fine editorial introduction by Neufeld (Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum). Next, nine scholars from the social sciences and the humanities address this broad topic. The first three chapters consider the images of American astronauts over time, from the early \"heroic era\" to the space shuttle period. The following three chapters take a comparative look at the American astronauts and the Russian cosmonauts, including an excellent chapter focusing on Yuri Gagarin, the first human in space, in Russian and Soviet myth. The cult of Gagarin took on religious-like relevance in Soviet times, and continues to provide nostalgic and nationalistic comfort in rural Russia today. The final three chapters address astronauts exclusively in the space shuttle era, including a revealing analysis of the sexism the first six female astronauts chosen by NASA in 1978 faced. Summing Up: Highly recommended. All academic, professional, and general history of science/space exploration collections.   --J. Z.

To be precise I was born in Hamilton in 1975. (a year my oldest daughter thinks is close to around the time Vikings invaded Britian; that's how old her dad is.) Then when I was very young we moved to Dunblane where I spent most of my years until I was roughly 20. After some traveling around I have landed back in Hamilton with my wife Kathleen and our two amazing daughters. They do say you always go back to where it all started one day. Having had two personal brushes with death; both far too early in my life if you are asking for my opinion. I decided it was time to follow my dreams, not be afraid anymore, and let my creative side out. I have always loved writing and have written many short stories. One day I will publish these stories (re-written and tidied up of course) for everyone else to read. I knew in my heart that I wanted to write a novel and I had many ideas competing to be first out the hat.(I have to wear a hat these days, I am bald and it gets cold in Scotland) I did write a book, as yet untitled, but chose not to release it after I had the idea for The Viking's Apprentice. This new idea grabbed me and I began writing. Inspired by my daughters and especially my oldest who loves to read. I wanted to write a story they could read and enjoy sooner rather than later. A story aimed at younger readers, but that could be enjoyed by everyone. Two years of hard work, re-writes, edits and learning about the industry came to fruition when the Viking's Apprentice was released on Amazon on March 28th 2013. It reached No.1 in Canada & No.2 in the US I am thankful for everyone who helped and supported me during the creation of The Viking's Apprentice. I am grateful for the new friends I have met on the journey. My proudest moment as an author so far came when a school teacher contacted me to say that my book, The Viking's Apprentice, had inspired a 10 year old non reader to begin reading. This child went from hating reading time and not joining in to looking forward to it and being unhappy on days when my book was not being read. I have since had the chance to visit that school and speak with the teacher and all the children who read my book. A great experience for me, and one that I am very grateful for. The Master's Revenge is book 2 in the Viking series, and I am currently beginning work on book 3.  Writing is what I love, and I hope I bring some joy to others with my stories.", "related": [], "rank": 1151977, "title": "The Master's Revenge (The Viking's Apprentice Book 2)", "author": "Kevin McLeod", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It hurt. It hurt so damn good.The inside of my bottom lip was still tender when I touched it experimentally with the tip of my tongue. Last night, I'd bitten on it to keep the sounds of my lust under control. Eventually, I'd failed.I'd shared the bed with two males, had shared all of me. One of them, my future husband, Qay, had lured me to his home planet, Dezra, with the promise of a marriage proposal.I suppressed a yawn, brushing my fingers along the sleek fabric of my gown--a floor-length, steel-gray beauty of a wedding dress. Its cool gray color matched Qay's eyes to perfection.A bride shouldn't be so bone tired at her own wedding ceremony.I wondered what would happen if I said no. I wouldn't, of course. I couldn't wait to be his wife. Still, had such an event ever happened here on Dezra? I was sure Dezrians wouldn't put up with nonsense such as a bride changing her mind at the last second.Though we weren't yet officially joined--not until this exhausting ceremony ended--in my heart, I'd always thought of Qay as my husband. And I'd always wanted to be his wife. Now it was becoming reality.I traced the three-leaved flower pattern of the choker that encircled my throat. A gift from Zyn. Last night, he had snapped the choker around my neck. I tried not to think about all the other things he'd done from that point on. Tried not to think about what I had done, on my knees, submitting to him. Sleep had been in short supply.Pleasure had come in an extraordinary amount.", "related": ["B00JM1HPUQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As this magical buck flew past her and down the mountain side an idea came into her head and she began formulating a story about a disabled, severely crippled boy. At that time Sharon had no idea why at that precise moment she began putting her future book \"Chasing Thunder\" together or why, nevertheless that spiritualder at that moment in time was her inspiration for her storyline and the question would be answered when the book was finished. Sharon would write this story, not just about a handicapped youngster and his challenges and obstacles, but rather for children to read who actually face some of these painful daily hurdles. In the beginning of this book you are saddened at that this young boy Eli endures even from his own family. But he lives in his own magical dream world beautifully descrubed by Sharon's well chosen words and you are glad for a bit that you can be there with him enjoying his freedom, his imagined agility and the relationship with his very own race horse. But the dream soon turns into a nightmare and Eli wakes up to the daily reality of his life, his surroundings and people that would taunt, tease, belittle and bully him. This all takes place in 1881 in Colorado, during Indian War times between Battle of the Little Big Horn and Wounded Knee. Eli's father scorns him because he cannot carry his weight in labor on their small cattle ranch. The neighborhood boys are mean and vicious to him, contantly humiliating him and Eli contemplates suicide. But he decides to wait just one more day to see if his luck changes. This is where his real journey begins and the story just continues to keep you turning the pages to find out what could possibly happen next. Each chapter Eli meets up with some fascinating characters and impossible situations including an old trapper who tells him he is spiritually \"the chosen\" and soon to meet his destiny to hunt down a living Sioux spirit which dwells on a dangerous peak in a hidden valley which may not even exist. Eli risks his life to pursue and impossible dream. Try or die, Eli steals his father's prized racehorse to embark on this perilous odyssey even though he knows next to nothing of tracking, hunting, riding or surviving in the untamed Rocky Mountains and must learn all these skills \"on the run.\" During this impossible journey Eli encounters more adventure than he'd ever dreamed and learns that independence comes with a high price. I am going to tell you that I just received this book a few days ago and had to speed read it so that I could do this article before we go to press. However, I am looking forward settling down and re-reading Chasing Thunder at a nice comforable pace so that I can absorb every word, page and chapter. This is my kind of book. Full and complete, emotional and very well researched and written. Sharon's words carry you in, and sometimes bury you deep into the fiber of this young hero's soul. I think this is an outstanding book for the entire family. I plan to give this to my twelve-year-old great granddaughter who loves adventure and of course, horses!

Yet its construction began when Arab influence in Spain had already begun to wane. In his marvellously illustrated book Homage to Al-Andalus , Michael Barry traces the story of the Arabs who first crossed the 14 miles of water that divide Spain from north Africa and who brought with them such a rich store of creativity. The Arabs were not the first group of people to settle in Spain for, as Barry points out, peninsulas are vulnerable places, so ahead of the Arabs were the Phoenicians, the Babylonians, the Romans, the Byzantines and the Vandals, though it was the stunningly designed and decorated architecture that has left Al-Andalus still a major showcase of artistic achievement. In 760, there was a switch in power from the Damascus-based Umayyad dynasty to the Abbasids who moved the Caliphate to Baghdad. This resulted in Abd Rahman, young scion of the defeated Umayyad dynasty, forced to flee Damascus and to spend five years travelling southwards through the Egyptian desert to north Africa until finally he reached Spain. For the next couple of hundred years, the Arabs were on a roll. Barry's book charts every battle, every skirmish, every assassination, all of which were to characterise the ensuing centuries so that you have to wonder where on earth they found the time to build their glorious mosques, palaces and castles. Roads they didn't need to build - the Romans had already seen to that. The answer lies partly in the fact that when a treaty between Christians and Muslims was agreed, it gave the parties 10 or 20 years of stability in which they could plan their extravaganzas. As Barry remarks, the fruit of peace was prosperity. It was the period after just such a treaty, signed in 1246 between the king of Castile and Leon, Fernando III and Ibn al-Ahmar, founder of Granada, that gave the latter a period of peace during which he started the construction of the Alhambra. And despite the richness of the architecture, this was not a hugely expensive undertaking.The materials used, writes Barry, were not expensive. The necessary inputs were imagination, inspiration and many skilled hands which were obviously available in abundance. Barry has clearly walked much of Al-Andalus and anyone planning a walking holiday through this part of Spain will find his book invaluable as a guide to some of the secret, forgotten places of Arab Spain. --Book of the Day, Irish TimesImpressive book.

Justin Dickerson is the most prominent character and much of the story is from her viewpoint. A biblical archaeologist, she knows the truth about the birth of mankind and is determined to find the irrefutable proof and reveal it. Justin . . . unleashes a world of trouble for her and those whom she holds dear. Someone does not want the story to come out and will do anything, even commit murder, to ensure that it doesn't.In Irrefutable Proof, Abby L. Vandiver back[s] up her fictional arguments for the origins of mankind, with actual, existing documentation and artefacts. It is a stroke of genius which is presented in such a way that I began to wonder to myself if she could be right. The novel is light hearted, skipping along at a steady, engaging pace, which makes it a satisfying read. The trips through history are fascinating and add another dimension to the story, while . . . [t]he characters, at first isolated in their quest, are skilfully brought together, linking and overlapping as the story unfolds. . . . Vandiver's careful research, intelligently explained, is enough science fiction to make the reader wonder, could we really have originated from an alien race? It is a clever blindsiding of reality which has made for an entertaining read.                                                            ~ Readers' Favorite.

Courtney vive en las Montañas Rocosas (Estados Unidos) junto a su marido, a su perro poco domesticado y a su enérgico gato. Mucho antes que ella empezara a escribir novelas históricas, Courtney se graduó en Química y Física por la Universidad de Berkeley. Después se inscribió en la escuela de derecho de la Universidad de Michigan y obtuvo la calificación de summa cum laude. Luego trabajó un poco como secretaria para personas muy importantes y que son demasiado serias para ser nombradas aquí.
