Most research simply compares men's and women's friendships and finds men's lacking. Through his adept interviews, Greif does something smarter: he finds out what friendships actually mean to men. He listens to what they say, maps their friendships, and sees them from men's point of view. This is a very useful and timely book!\"--Michael Kimmel, PhD, Professor of Sociology, SUNY Stony Brook, and author ofManhood in America\"Any man who would like to enlarge the place of friendship in his life will savor this book. It's not that Greif tells us how, specifically, to do it. (We do want to retain some room for our own unique innovations.) It's that he teaches us the kinds of questions to ask ourselves, and then he tells us how other thoughtful men and women view relationships of all kinds.

Expanding on an article he wrote forMen's Journal, Frump (Until The Sea Shall Free Them) offers a deftly written study of the park's 2,000 lions and the refugees, and \"the crossed paths the two species traveled.\" Frump delivers a dispassionate examination exploring how \"efforts by conservationists to preserve lions are directly resulting in the loss of human life\" due to an inadequate governmental response to the continuing refugee crisis. He balances first-person accounts of his travels in the Kruger and his attempts to literally walk in the same path as the refugees with sharp and fascinating portraits of Africans such as John Kohza, one of the first of what Frump calls \"the modern surge of refugees through Kruger\" in the 1970s. Kohza's flight from the horrors of Mozambican famine and persecution is one of the book's emotional high points.(Aug.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Cruising is a passion of mine that allows me to escape from everyday reality and a stressful profession of court reporting.  Whether we are cruising out of Port Everglades or Port of Miami, it is always a vacation to remember.  My first cruise was in 1979, through two hurricanes (now there's a story); yet, I've only become more enamored and enchanted with cruising over the years.  I have an amazing, supportive husband and a wonderful son who always keeps me on the edge of my seat with his studies in medical school.  My two loving poodles continually teach me about what's important in life ... unconditional love, family, and enough treats to get me through the day.   Reading, writing, and cruising are my passions.  Please visit me at my blog address of lynnbyer.wordpress.com and my website at lynnbyer.com.  I love to hear from readers!

This is a must read for scholars and practitioners in the fields of social movements, labor relations, and geography.\"—Maite Tapia,Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal(Summer 2011)\"Tattersall's interest in going beyond bemoaning unions’ decline, on the one hand, and celebrating extraordinary success stories, on the other, ought to spur further comparative analysis on the same themes. In particular, it should spark useful discussions among union activists at a time when the public is increasingly unfamiliar with the labor movement’s historic role and demands more inclusive goals from the movement—and when unions are in sore need of allies.\"—Manfred Elfstrom,ILRReview(October 2012)\"Amanda Tattersall's book is the most insightful study of coalitions to date. It is not your typical gauzy view of coalition building, but offers a clear-sighted, practical road map to building more effective labor-community coalitions and in turn an opportunity to transform the labor movement. It combines a rare mix of academic rigor and analysis with an organizer's sensibility, which makes it as useful in the field by practitioners as in the classroom by scholars.\" —Jeff Blodgett, Executive Director, Wellstone Action\"At last a scholar/activist who understands that coalitions are not merely a way of advancing union goals! Building on three successful coalitions in Australia, Canada, and the United States, Amanda Tattersall identifies three main mechanisms that lead to successful coalition formation between unions and community organizations: identifying common concerns, building organizational relationships, and finding the right scale. She shows how unions can transcend the narrow corporatism of 'business unionism' to return to the social movements they once were in a world that has become more complex and more indifferent to the needs of both workers and communities.\"—Sidney Tarrow, Cornell University\"If unions are to maximize their influence in the twenty-first century they must build alliances with other organizations around economic, social, and ecological concerns affecting humanity. This book shows it is possible to build the necessary coalitions to achieve this end.\"—Jack Mundey, instigator of the 1970s Green Bans movement in Sydney\"Essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how to build the power of working people in a changing world, Amanda Tattersall’s book is at once timely, practical, inspiring and challenging. Combining analysis of action with useful theory, it provides an important new tool for activists everywhere —in unions or beyond them—who want to build sustained and sustaining coalitions that have the potential to change the world.\"—Barbara Pocock, Director, Centre for Work + Life, University of South Australia", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They follow him through a magical door that opens to a place inside Hamelin Hill. Right away, their excited giddiness turns to panic and fear. They're trapped. \"When the door closed, summer had been left behind. In here it was winter.\" For the first 50 or so pages, the main character is a girl named Marianna, whose disabled brother, Jakob, can't keep up with the others and becomes, at least briefly, the only Hamelin child not trapped inside the Hill. Then, the story shifts to tell the backstory of the Piper. Readers learn that he is half human, half elf, and has been cursed to turn into a beast whenever the moon is full. His salvation can only come from a child with special powers in a town overrun by rats. Classic fantasy themes like loyalty, transformation, and sacrifice are part of this interesting book. Especially intriguing are the scenes of Marianna changing into a fox and experiencing the world as a wild animal. But the plot suffers from multiple points of view—from Marianna to the Piper, and then on to Jakob and even Marianna and Jakob's father—that aren't done in an integrated way, giving an overall disjointed feel.

InTheena's Landing, the early settlers living among the scarlet ibis and wild orchids tamed the wilderness to make way for the storied city of Miami.She has also been recognized for her ante-bellum historicals, set in Louisiana among the Creoles, Cajuns, and African slaves. Always and Forever, from Kensington Zebra, won the Colorado Romance Writers Award of Excellence for Mainstream with Romantic Elements and was chosen as an Editor's Pick in the Historical Novel Society reviews. Continuing the saga of the same extended families,Ever My Lovewon the Booksellers Best Award from the GDRWA. The last book of the trilogy,Evermore, carries the families into the early days of the Civil War.Gretchen was born in the Florida Panhandle and grew up in St. Petersburg on the Gulf Coast. She and her husband have lived in South Florida, Germany, and Maine, and are now in Texas among the mesquite and sunflowers. Maybe because she's lived in such diverse climates and terrains, Gretchen's novels are notable for their strong sense of place.

Rather than live on as glorified servants in their cousins' home, they decide to open a school in a small town, where they end up teaching the daughters of one mill owner, and the sister of Ben, another. At the ripe old age of 28, Martha is firmly embedded in her spinster ways. And Ben, who has a lot going on and many people dependent upon him for their livelihood, can't be bothered to improve his less than gentlemanly manners. Martha and Ben get each other's back up whenever they meet, but circumstances force them to unite when a third mill owner, an evil man who starves and endangers his workers, tries to demolish Ben's operation, and even kidnaps Ben's sister. Ben and Martha soon discover what they're truly made of, and that they're made for each other, in this well-told tale brimming with well-developed characters readers will root for.Maria HattonCopyright © American Library Association.

Jim Russell offers us a sweeping portrait of the development of social policy in Europe and America and helps us to understand not only the differences between the European and American welfare state, but why these differences are so important. (Piven, Frances Fox)Russell's tools are clear writing, tight argumentation, and impeccable logic. He uses them to calmly and surgically dismantle the myth of American superiority as he explains how and why Americans receive far fewer social welfare benefits than their European counterparts. A real eye-opener. (Levon Chorbajian)James Russell restores my faith in sociology as the best line of inquiry into nagging political questions that too often get assigned to narrow-minded economists. We need books like this to combat academic provincialism as much as to correct social inequality. (John R. MacArthur)In this earnest, constructive book, Russell provides a systematic sketch of the way Europeans and Americans conceive of socail welfare and deliver it in different ways. Recommended. (Choice)Scholars of comparative social policy often include a chapter on the USA to show how far it has to go before it could be regarded as having a welfare state. In this closely argued, detailed and meticulous book Russell compares the development of social policies in the USA and in European states, pointing out areas where there are significant differences of approach but also those where one has borrowed from another. The strong historical and philosophical basis for Russell's analysis makes this a novel, engaging and challenging addition to the comparative literature.

The setting, Manchester, is unusual, as are the main characters, both undervalued and responsible members of their families. The author writes about both the fashionable and workaday worlds of the time and her description of conditions in the factory are very well done without detracting from the story. The mystery of the missing artifact is an engrossing one and adds as much to the story as Brayden and Jane's rocky romance. The other characters and their environment are vividly portrayed and the dialogue is well written and flows smoothly. This is definitely a must read for fans of this genre.\" Reviewed by Maura of Coffee Time Romance \"DERE'S DEMONS is an unusual Regency romance in both its setting, the industrial town of Manchester, and its heroine. Jane isn't the first put-upon daughter or sister with no expectations but to serve the family, but she is certainly one of the few if not the first to actually work in a factory as a common laborer. Those were very dangerous places as witness the accident involving a little boy and a loom. Dere is an admirable hero with a great load on his back. If he's just a bit dense at first in judging Jane, he'll make up for that in time...Other characters of note are Braden's younger sister Arabella and his friend Kit, Viscount Hulton... I found DERE'S DEMONS to be entertaining and the main characters likable and don't hesitate to recommend it to Regency romance lovers.\" Reviewed by Jane Bowers of Romance Reviews Today", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Now, the same scientist discovers that the obesity of American citizens threw the Earth out of balance and the planet stopped spinning and started traveling out of the Solar system. An immediate remedy on the national level is necessary... The sense of humor reminded me of Douglas Adams - the same absurdity and fast pace. Excellent. --Amazon Top ReviewerThe obesity epidemic in America has claimed a new victim: the Earth, in a toothless satire that takes aim at the diet and fitness industries, government hubris, and American selfishness.  Gaylord Kitnas, a scientist  and disgraced diet guru, discovers that the massive weight of North America is pulling the planet out of its atmosphere, portending certain death for everyone, an entertaining premise that does not quite deliver as a novel.  The hapless President and his team consider numerous marginally amusing schemes: a fat tax and fitness regime administered by a trio of goofy bodybuilders, a massive rocket-propelled lift system to toss the extra weight into space, a worker exchange program with India based on weight, and even an invasion of Canada.  Havre Wilbanks, an obese office worker, stumbles around the plot, dealing with the increasingly bizarre regulations imposed on him.  Kitnas' ultimate solution to the problem is laugh-out-loud clever, but it is one of the few genuinely sharp, funny moments of the book.  When the story relies on tired jokes and easy stereotypes, like a fat woman on a treadmill drinking regular soda and rhapsodizing about her fast food lunch, it's a waste of time.  When it goes deeper, as when a furious French response to the situation prompts the United States to offer free one-way tickets to France to its heaviest citizens, the uniqueness and the biting wit are a pleasure to read. --manuscript review by Publishers Weekly, an independent organization", "related": [], "rank": 1837077, "title": "OVERWEIGHT: A Novel", "author": "Nathan Jendrick", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the absence of a good book—which doesn’t happen often now that we have e-books—she’s been known to read the back of the cereal boxes.  Fulfilling a lifelong dream, Sharon is now writing two mystery series. Her debut novel, THE SILK TRAIN MURDER is the first book in the “Klondike Era Mystery” series. The book received starred reviews in Booklist and Quill & Quire and was nominated for an Arthur Ellis award for Best First Novel. In this book, a down on his luck gentleman washes up in Vancouver, hungry and broke. Running from his past, afraid of his future. Until he his best friend’s arrest for murder.  Granville’s desperate hunt to find the real killer before they hang his friend takes him to the seedy side of the city; to burlesque halls, gambling joints, brothels and opium dens. Along the way he finds companionship in odd places and an ally—and more—in Emily Turner, the emancipated daughter of a very Victorian father.  DEATH OF A SECRET is the first book in the “Barbara O’Grady Series”. These are urban private eye novels, based in Vancouver and seen through the eyes of failed artist turned investigator Barbara O’Grady. In this book, long forgotten scandals and murders erupt with the murder of Senator Ed McMather. Barbara frantically searches for a serial killer in an investigation with roots deep in the past. Upper-crust Vancouver families reveal dark secrets and the body count rises as Barbara unravels lies within lies and finally reaches the truth. A twisting tale of old secrets, death and treachery.

I was the primary caregiver for my husband who suffered and died from ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). I spent many hours searching the literature, and  I gained a wealth of knowledge which allowed me to attempt to provide for his care. In the process of caregiving, I came to know this particular horrendous disease up close and personal.  I believe what I learned during this difficult journey has equiped me to help others who may be facing a similar challenge. I am a Christian who believes in God's promise that He will sustain us and go with us through the fiery trials of life. I have had two unrelated nursing articles published in the American Journal of Nursing. I have a BS in Nursing with forty-five years experience.  I am able to read, interpret, and relay complex medical information in simple, understandable terms. During the early part of my career, I served  as a Second Lieutenant in the Army Nurse Corp, and I was stationed at Brooke Army Hospital in San Antonio, Texas. Soldiers with life altering injuries taught me about true courage.  I am now an Army Veteran. I have nursing experience in essentially every clinical area of a general care hospital setting, including the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  My primary interest was in cardiac care, and I spent most of my career working with cardiac patients.  I was the nurse manager of a Coranary Observation Unit for twenty-five of my forty-five year nursing career.  The last ten years, I was nurse maager of a cardiac rehabilatation program.  I retired from nursing in 2004 in order to care for my husband. I hope to share my experience and  what I have learned about caring for a person diagnosed with  such a devastating, life changing  disease. I had caregivers in mind when I wrote this story, but I believe Bill's story would appeal to patients, family members, care-givers, friends, co-workers, nurses, students, and numerous others connected to and affected by this horrendous disease.  Maybe it is the tragedy as well as the mystery, which surrouinds this illness that makes it so powerful...so intriguing.  It does indeed remind us of our human frailty.  It does not fail to remind us of our human mortality.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When the circus comes to town, Harlan discovers a runaway animal in his garage: \"a medium-sized elephant, which is to say it was about the size of a delivery van.\" Hannibal, a perceptive pachyderm with the gift of gab, turns out to be just the kind of chum Harlan needs; the two form a risky and protective partnership. When a fierce hurricane hits their small town, Harlan and Hannibal's remarkable strength and friendship helps them save residents' lives, and earns each of them a richly deserved understanding and freedom. In his deftly written first novel, Harvey seamlessly blends passages of chuckle-producing humor with gently affecting moments--the whole overlaid with an ingenuous, old-fashioned charm. Richardson's black-and-white pencil sketches, droll and delicate, perfectly complement the book's slightly fey tone. Harlan and Hannibal are an endearing pair whose happy ending is cause for cheering.

In fact, her talent for spelling makes her more special than she could ever imagine. This is a great book in a new series, and one that reluctant readers will be pulled into because of the fantasy elements. The story line itself is one many readers can relate to, as B has insecurities she has to deal with, such as being too shy to speak in class and too timid to stand up to the class bully.

Danielle began flight training in New Zealand, and left for africa to gain experience in charter operations on Cessna singles and twins, and later joined the national airline in Namibia, flying the Beech 1900 and Boeing 737. Their motivation to write the books was to improve training and thus operating standards in the general aviation sector (the non-airline civil aviation sector), especially for light aircraft in private and charter operations. Training has been identified by the FAA, and other civil aviation authorities, as a major cause of light aircraft accidents, Oleg and Danielle hope the Cessna Training Manual series will help to improve training standards by improving the information available for pilots.  Oleg and Danielle based the Cessna Training Manuals format on the progression of a typical training syllabus and information normally provided for training on larger aircraft, where there is stricter control over standards.

This setting is perfect, surrounded by very old buildings with cobbled pedestrian lanes leading off in all directions into a great neighborhood we shall explore next.  This friendly and lively piazza is one of the major focal points of the city, just three blocks south of Piazza Navona (coming up later in this walk) and an easy walk if your hotel is in the historic center.  If you're staying further away, take a taxi.Arriving any time in the morning is good, but earlier is better.  Campo dei Fiori makes a great start for our walk: it is the only main attraction opening by 6am and it is simply a wonderful morning scene.  This magical Campo has multiple personalities, changing character throughout the day: Rome's main veggie market in the morning, a ring of busy restaurants at lunch, peaceful in the afternoon, and a party scene at night.  That is only the first hour of three perfect days, conveniently divided into six half-day walking tours that will guide you through this majestic city.  Rome on Foot.", "related": ["B0079M54XA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However, this book made sense to me as I am a retired Police Officer as it\ncould all so easilly have happened. The plot seemed to be a realistic version of\nevents and very easy to get drawn into the story.The book was an easy\nread, although due to some of the descriptions and graphicness of the story\nlines, I felt that I had to be a tad careful where I read it as it was read on a\ntablet PC, mostly on a train - you will understand why when you read\nit!The book finished on an unusual issue which I did not expect and this\nis something that you only find out in the last couple of paragraphs.For\na first book by James, I found this a compelling read and cannot wait for more\nbooks by him.Review by Radders - 'A Gripping Read' 14th May 2012", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After failing to make the grade as a professional football player, he spent much of his early years traveling, hitch-hiking around Europe and North Africa and then heading to Asia. His experiences in Bangkok and India later inspired his thriller VENOM, and his adventures in the jungles of the Golden Triangle of Burma and Laos were also filed away for later, the basis of his OPIUM series about the underworld drug trade. He later moved to Australia and worked in advertising, before moving to Sydney where he freelanced for most of Australia’s leading newspapers and magazines, as well as working in radio and television. He started publishing in 1984, mostly humor and young adult fiction, but with the publication of VENOM in 1990, he became a full time novelist. He has published over 40 books in print. HAREM was an enormous bestseller in Germany and THE NAKED HUSBAND was ranked #9 in Australia on its release. AZTEC stayed on the bestseller lists in Mexico for four months. He is a bestseller in Europe and his work has sold into translation in 23 countries: Brazil, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech republic, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Indonesia, Korea, Macedonia, Montenegro, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Turkey. He lived for many years in the beautiful Margaret River region in WA, and helped raise two beautiful daughters with his late wife, Helen. While writing, he also worked in the volunteer ambulance service for over 13 years His marriage ended in tragic circumstances, a story he has told in ‘The Naked Husband,’ and its non-fiction sequel, ‘The Year We Seized the Day,’ written with a writing partner, Elizabeth Best. He travels regularly to research his novels and his quest for authenticity has led him to run with the bulls in Pamplona, pursue tornadoes across Oklahoma and black witches across Mexico, go cage shark diving in South Africa and get tear gassed in a riot in La Paz. He also completed a nine hundred kilometre walk of the camino in Spain. He did not write for over five years but returned to publishing in 2010 with the release of SILK ROAD, and then STIGMATA the following year. ISABELLA is due to be published in 2013.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Findlay's excellent translation of The Communist Manifesto, embedded in a splendid introduction and a most carefully chosen appendix of Marx and Engels pieces, superbly places this nineteenth-century classic in an extraordinary historical context. There is no other edition at the moment that can match its quality in terms of translation, and its substance in terms of historical context.\" (Renate Holub, Director, Interdisciplinary Studies)\"Findlay engages the reader by depicting how personal and historical events shaped the thinking of Marx and Engels. At the same time, he clarifies why Marx and Engels pursue the manifesto format, explains its historical significance as a political genre, and highlights the importance of Marxist concerns in the post-industrial, post-Cold War era. Combined with the excellent array of appendices, Findlay's translation should enrich readers' understanding of the Manifesto's historical context and help solidify their understanding of the fundamentals of Marxism.\" (Bryon Moraski)\"Findlay's new edition of The Communist Manifesto is very scholarly, and the additional documents are a real bonus, providing an interesting context for the work.

'My Alien Self - My Journey Back To Me' is my memoir which follows my journey through travel, excitement, normality and mental illness to find myself again. '39' is about what happened afterwards; the year before reaching the prime age of forty, family relationships, love and memories. I want to inspire others that it is possible to recover and have a life worth living. Because I grew up with my mother having severe Schizophrenia, who had been incarcerated in psychiatric hospitals for years, and felt the bullying and loneliness that stigma can spread, I campaign to 'stop the stigma surrounding mental illness. I also felt the wrath of stigma when I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality disorder. Many people do not understand mental illness, so judge people unfairly. So I created www.amandagreenauthor.co.uk where I publish articles on the topics covered in my story, including self help, depression, bankruptcy, Alcohol/drug abuse, family and relationships, sexual, physical and mental abuse, anxiety, anger, Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), self harm, Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), Anorexia Nervosa/Bulimia, mindfulness, panic, rape, Schizophrenia, pychosis, Suicidal thoughts, , paranoia, dissociation, mood disorder, thyroid issues and psychology. I will be working with mental health charities, magazines, newspapers, social networking and other PR projects, actively making people aware of this disorder through every means possible through the media. But also, I hope that my books will help other sufferers and their families and friends to understand BPD and mental health and how to help oneself to feel better. I want to raise awareness to the general public about mental illness and the stigma sufferers have to deal with. I hope that Doctors and the medical industry involved with mental health will benefit from reading my stories, as they unfold what it is like to suffer from debilitating mental illness from the inside out and how it manifests itself. But I have also written my memoirs in a style that I hope will be compelling and sometimes shocking reads for anyone interested in memoirs with a twist, so that I can reach more people. Outside of work, I love eating out and reviewing restaurants, travel, days out, campaigning for the precious Orang-utan and the issues of unsustainable palm oil production, running six websites of my own and seeing my family.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 24.0}

It has tons of romance, as well as edge of your seat action and suspense. Secrets of Jenkins Bridge starts off fast and never once slows down. Long lost loves, broken hearts, abductions, murder, extortion, this novel has it all and then some. There were points where I laughed out loud and cheered for the good guys, and times when I literally chewed my nails in anticipation of what might occur. This is one of the novels that will have a long life, and that readers everywhere will adore. I most certainly did; I couldn't put it down!When FBI agent Mitchell Donovan is called out to a car accident, he knows things are not as they seem. When the person they pull from the wrecked vehicle is his former high school girlfriend, things go from odd to dangerously bizarre in a flash. Why did Katherine drive off the road? What secrets did her dead ex-husband carry with him to the grave? Where is her daughter Aly? All of these questions and more will be examined in the course of the story. Once Mitchell and Katherine start to unravel the secrets of the past and examine the players of the present, things will start to come together in a way that no one could ever anticipate.Book Blurb for Secrets of Jenkins Bridge", "related": ["B005LHTAQM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was there to see the good, the bad, the ugly, and the insanely great. His first career was 10 years of raising purebred cattle. Running a large farm far from a safety net provided a great foundation for someone who would survive for so long in the high tech pressure cooker of Apple.  His farm was in Canada north of Fredericton, New Brunswick on the banks of the Tay River in what some would call wilderness.Those first 30 years of David's professional life on the farm and as a Silicon Valley computer soldier forged his character. Life on the farm taught him that who you are is far more important than what you do. How much money one makes is not the measureinlife which matters. How you treat others is far more important than any money one might make. Corporate life reinforced his belief that standing up for what is right is fundamental to any life of value.Beyond that David is greatly influenced by where he now lives and believes that how we treat the coastal marsh is  a measure of how much we care for future generations.David spends his life after Apple immersed in the extraordinary natural beauty of North Carolina's Southern Outer Banks. He can often be found walking the beaches or out on the water in his kayak or skiff chasing fish or a great sunset.  Photography is one of his great passions.David has commented that by doing the right thing for the right reasons, enough money to get byseemsto make it into his bank account. He counts himself blessed and sleeps well at night. David's high school years were spent at McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He graduated from Harvard College in 1971.  He was proud to apply the training he received from studying Colonial America History to his successful career of raising cattle. Rumors that his book, The Pomme Company, is causing iPads running Kindle reader to overheat are unfounded.  According to David, users are holding their iPads incorrectly.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With the Huns continuing to make inroads, he is called upon by virtue of his exceptional skills as a healer to join forces with General Flavius Aetius. At the Battle of Catalaunian Plain, he gains renown for his astounding curative powers. While the empire teeters on the brink of destruction, Myrddion completes his mission, setting the stage for his return to Celtic Britain and ­future—perhaps more familiar—adventures. Interweaving the fable of Merlin with the last gasp of the Roman empire, Hume has fashioned a fantastical voyage through both mythology and history. --Margaret Flanagan", "related": [], "rank": 1063882, "title": "The Merlin Prophecy Book Two: Death of an Empire", "author": "M.

It might be best to read the first two novels in the series (City of Dreadful Night, 2010, and The Last King of Brighton, 2011) first, since the trilogy is really one story told in three parts, but even read as a stand-alone, the book is gripping and satisfying. Worth noting, too, that readers familiar with the author’s previous series, about journalist-turned-sleuth Nick Madrid, should not expect the same sort of jocularity here: the laughs are few and far between. This is a serious, gritty novel designed to shock, captivate, and emotionally drain its readers, and it succeeds on all fronts. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Unfortunately, however, some of us despair of ever finding it.Often it’s because we live with a gripping sense of defeat brought on by some unwanted a feature. Usually our nemesis is our weight, although sometimes it’s a particular part of our body, like a nose or a chin that is undeniably out of proportion to the rest of our face.There are more than enough thoughtless or shallow people in the world who may insist upon defining us by our single most troubling physical feature. We’re fat, we’re ugly, we’re not sexy. And even though we silently rage against this horrifically narrow assessment, we may eventually become complacent, figuring that this is the way it will always be for us – because we don’t think we can change ourselves.And so, to our emotional rescue, come the women in this collection of stories who are our inspirational champions. They decided to take charge and radically change the way they looked. In so doing, they triumphed over the formidable opponents we all face every day: bad habits, occasional self-pity and the pernicious devil inside of us that tells us we can’t do it so why even try. In shedding pounds – lots of them – they also shed destructive self-perceptions.Most of these women did not go eagerly down this road, however. They balked and resisted and rationalized and procrastinated just like the rest of us. But eventually something clicked in their head that led them out of the zone of wanting to change and into the determined mindset of actually doing it.Perhaps they overheard a particularly biting observation from someone they respected – or even from someone they loathed. Or perhaps they wanted to look good at an upcoming family wedding or to catch the eye of a particular man. All of them, however, were tired of perpetually feeling bad about themselves.Although their motives for changing the course of their lives were different, our heroines all learned the same lesson in the end: It’s easier to find your true love when you start by genuinely loving yourself.The things we do for love . . .", "related": [], "rank": 1248520, "title": "Losing It for Love: TruLove Collection", "author": "Anonymous", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the course of the eight decades following that earth-shattering event, the United States was involved in no less than seven wars; suffered through the great depression; saw the advent of the nuclear age; the horrors of the holocaust; the assassination of a president; the downfall of the Soviet Union; the landing of a man on the moon and a robotic rover onto the surface of the planet Mars. The world also stood witness to the to the momentous advances of science as antibiotics were introduced into the treatment of disease, along with countless other therapeutic and diagnostic tools which extended the life expectancy of citizens throughout the world. The automobile and the airplane narrowed the distance between people and nations. The telephone, the cell phone and of course the computer reigned as we entered the digital age. Through it all a precocious, determined, often rebellious young Irwin emerged from the streets of the South Bronx, to ultimately find himself safely and successfully ensconced into the relative luxury of an eastern Long Island community. Nurtured by his immigrant parents from early childhood with unconditional love, they instilled in him a lust for education, ambition and an instinct for success. Both as a graduate student and in his professional career as a hospital administrator, he demonstrated those qualities as he pursued his vision of happiness and life's fulfillment. Now, a retired widower, he has settled in Southern California to bask in the yearround sun and cool breezes. However, his overriding passion has always been family. The memory of his late wife, his four children, his ten grandchildren and his new companion of five years continue to occupy center stage in what has become The Time of His Life.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He spent the first part of his life working as an independent artisan where he developed his practical approach to Spirituality and Shamanism. Be ginning his Spiritual practice at age 16 quickly opened him up to his multidimensionality, and over a 3-year period, be-ginning at age 30 he underwent a profound Spiritual trans-formation and began to receive the vision on which this book is based. This vision, and the pragmatic approach of his Shamanic practice have allowed him to adapt this ancient healing modality to identify, and effectively treat the fragmentation of the self. This fragmentation, which he calls The Sub-division of the Kingdom, caused by the false identification with ego mind is what he sees as the real impediment to wellness facing us today.  His non-academic writing style speaks directly from experience. His words speak directly into, and awaken the heart of the reader, enticing them to embrace their inherent gifts that are described in this book. In 1987 he and his wife founded the Bioenergetic Institute and later Earth Based Healing, both dedicated to the practice, teaching, and research of Shamanism.

Casting the members of the Lobelia Falls Grub-and-Stakers Gardening and Roving Club, the drama begins in Miss Jane Fuzzywuzzy's Yarnery, where an executive at the local mincemeat factory is murdered. Popular novelist Osbert Monk joins in the police investigation. The ensuing shenanigans are hilarious and cleverly conceived--at one point the criminals mistakenly abduct Osbert's aunt Arethusa instead of the murder victim's daughter, Matilda McCorquindale; to outsmart them, Osbert decides that Matilda should attend her father's funeral and pretend to be Arethusa pretending to be Matilda. McLeod threads the suspense surely, and although the quirky character names grow cumbersome, she keeps her story energetic and merry.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When historical research discredits stories that form the basis of cultural identity? When indigenous peoples find their ancestry challenged by population studies? Must we choose between treating the departed as subjects due respect or as objects of research? Is the Enlightenment command, 'dare to know,' a moral imperative or a ruthless warrant for cultural vandalism?

There followed 'Toad's Dilemma' (a sequel to Frank's all time fave kid's book, 'The Wind in the Willows') and a whole host of similarly derivative anthropomorphic master-pieces. Only after a short affair with journalism in his 20's did he write anything with a human being in it (the Financial Times insisted upon it), and only after he went to  India, aged 30, did he stop writing about cats (he only saw one in India).  Frank's first published book (1986) was a travelogue on India – now re-released here on Amazon as Kevin and I in India. 'I wrote it to avoid having to return to a mind-numbing job in Social Services.' There followed a slew of Asian travel guides – India, Thailand, Burma, Indonesia etc – but none of them paid very much and the last one gave him a ten-year writing block: he simply couldn't decide which Delhi hotel had the best bath-room, the Taj Intercontinental or the Oberoi.  Frank returned to writing after breaking his leg in 2005 – his wife nagged him into it. And the first thing they penned together was...another cat book. Thus came into being 'Ginger the Gangster Cat', the story of one fat cat's devotion to Spanish cuisine. For anyone interested, Sparky – their 3-year old perennial kitten and Ginger's shy and nervous sidekick – is real. He really is the cutest cat in the universe. Ginger himself is a composite of every stray tom-cat Frank has had in the past, absolute terrors all of them!", "related": ["B00HQ99DC4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 45.0}

Schultz, being a major animal lover, started 2008 with a short-lived blog about bird care for the fallen Seattle Post-Intelligencer called “BIRDIE BASICS”, but soon resigned due to finding it unnecessarily repetitive, explaining that, “You can’t eternally expand something written in the manner of a textbook. I said what needed to be said for basic information about bird care for beginners. It’s time to move on. The blog is complete. The mission is accomplished.” Throughout much of 2008, Schultz got a gig writing trivia questions for game-show “EASTERN EXPEDITION” before the show was eventually cancelled. In 2010, Schultz released his second novel “THE PACK” and wrote the film “WATCH” which premiered at the Gig Harbor Film Festival in 2012 and was well-received, being listed as the Director’s Choice Awards’ First Runner-Up (2nd Place) for Best Short Film.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Here, the author railroads the venerable Detroit priest into an unredeemable position. When Moe Green's widow insists that Koesler hold a wake at St. Joseph's for her nominally Jewish husband, the priest is reluctant but allows himself to be convinced since he can find no Church law forbidding it. But he is alarmed at the crowd that shows up at the spur-of-the-moment event and regrets having also agreed to say a few words about a man whom he has never met and who was apparently morally corrupt. As Koesler begins to speak, Moe's sister Sophie makes a dramatic entrance, looks at her dead brother-and sees him blink. In the ensuing melee, the coffin falls from the bier, and Moe indicates he wants to be taken home. Now the hapless Koesler must not only explain to his bishop why he agreed to hold the wake, but he must also determine whether Moe's revival was a miracle, as a fellow priest asserts. Despite its wealth of Church law and theology, this latest tale will disappoint fans who have come to consider Koesler as more astute than he seems here.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I also produce all my own illustrations (with one or\ntwo exceptions) through a technique involving photographing toys as\nmodels and matting them against a photograph of a background that I have\n taken myself and then converted using special software into the style I\n desire. I also produce all my own covers using similar techniques. My\nPoetry is accessible, interesting, unpretentious and poignant. My YA\nnovels are thoughtful, timely and exciting for young people to read. My\nshort stories are engaging and unique. I have put a lot of myself into\nmy work and invested many hours drafting, re-drafting, proofing, editing\n and finally producing each book. It is a labor of love.

Book Four begins in A.D. 502 when peace has been established and Camalot rules, but Arthur soon leaves on a seemingly hopeless quest to bring peace to Gallia. In the years of his absence, Guendivar grows in stature and becomes a true queen; Morgause finally finds peace as a priestess of Avalon; Medraut, Arthur's troubled son, attempts to usurp the throne; and the kingdom is once again torn by strife. Ultimately the land itself (\"the stone\") asserts its power to guide the key figures through these cataclysmic events. Though it is the end of one age, spiritual and cultural traditions have been set in motion that will continue to guide Britain's destiny in the years to come. Paxson's vivid retellings of the familiar story bring out the depth of its mythical and magical qualities and should please fans of Gillian Bradshaw, Marion Zimmer Bradley, and other writers who mix historical fiction with fantasy.Christine C.

It's a story about love and lies, power and fear. ~ Kitty, \"Guilty Pleasures\"First Position took my absolutely by surprise. The story-lines and characters were very well written and interesting. It's a book about second chances and how capable we are of handling them. It's a story about love and lies, power and fear.  Emory and Mason met and fell in love in college. It was true love but with decisions that needed to be made by both of them.6 years later ... a possible career-ending injury ... a divorce on the horizon ... Mason walks back into Emory's life. This, right after she breaks her engagement to a stable, respected doctor.  Now, after all this time, Mason is back and in Charlotte looking to play football there. But, how does she live with everything that has happened to her. Mason has another career decision to be made. Stay in Charlotte with the woman he never stopped loving or go to Seattle? Offers are on the table from both teams with Seattle offering more money. He can't do it. He can't leave Em again. He can't ask her to follow him again only to have her turn him down. Charlotte it is. But, how does he carry on his life with the lies that are between them. He can't tell her that he had other offers, he can't tell her that he stayed in Charlotte just for her, he can't get his mother off of his back or Alexis out of his life.Yes, I enjoyed First Position.  This was the first book by Lane Prescott that I have read and I will gladly read others by her.

Starting with the basic dot bead, Mehaffey shares technique tips on how to expertly position dots and make them consistent in size and shape. Flattening, poking, stacking and layering dots are also covered.Using the dot as a foundation, Mehaffey then ramps it up and offers more challenging projects that allow the beadmaker to create beads that are more aesthetically pleasing as well. Her tutorials for making a simple petal bead, the more complicated bubble or eye bead, and masked dots make simple what might seem to be impossible to a new glass artist.Mehaffey also provides the beginner with information about a full range of decorative processes, including frits, foils, enamels, pixie dust, goldstone, dichroic glass, baking soda, and etching. While obviously aimed at beginners, intermediate and more experienced beadmakers are likely to find some of Mehaffey's projects appealing if a process is a new one to the glass artist.Two things really set this book apart from other instructional books: first, the excellent photos. The photographs are numerous and highly illustrative. The second plus is that the book lies flat when open. --The Glass Bead, xv, no. 4 (Fall 2008)One of the most extensive guides to lampwork . . .

Dragons Amongst Men is the first of 7 planned books, plus several other auxiliary books to the series. The precursor to the writing and developing the Dragon Veils series stems from his daughters curiosity and study of the western and eastern zodiacs. Being born in the year of the Dragon on the Chinese Calendar, MD Anderson and his oldest daughter spent a lot of time putting together ideas until it became a an ambition to start writing something “epic,” as his daughter would say.  MD Anderson is the father of three kids, and has lived in the Phoenix valley since 1999. Married and divorced he spends as much time with his kids as he can, and shares plots, characters, and story lines with them for enjoyment. MD Anderson loves meeting different people, and other activities noticeable in the books; like the lake and water skiing, his boat, and fixing things up to usable again.  Instructing people how to set goals and work hard has been his career for 12 years while owning a gymnastics facility. His first writing publication was for Goal Setting and Self-Esteem dedicated to help his gymnasts, but has now been incorporated into the Dragon Veils Series as well. Watching people work and improve themselves gives him great satisfaction, especially if he could help them along their way.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Michael Blumenthal, a leading American poet and novelist, has written a brilliant series of sketches, lyrical, incisive, empathetic, funny, and wise--at once deeply personal and full of insight--about a fascinating world in transition from a haunted and haunting past to the modern Hustle.\"  --Sacvan Bercovitch, Harvard University\"In these reflections on exile, literature, social phenomena and daily life, Michael Blumenthal uses his exceptional powers of observation to look at Central Europe from an America an perspective, and re-view America from a Hungarian vantage point. Mr.Blumenthal has a poet's eye for the telling detail, an expatriate's appreciation for cultural paradox, and the passion to see beyond both, to the salient heart of human and political dilemmas. This is a wise, witty book that, in the guise of occasional essays, throws an unexpected light on many important issues today.\"  --Eva Hoffman, Exit into History\"It's a delight to listen to the voice of Michael Blumenthal in these essays: He is such an astute observer, honest and wry commentator, and reliable companion. His bi-focaled vision of Hungary and America is indeed eye-opening. A satisfying collection.\"  --Phillip Lopate, The Art of the Personal Essay\"Michael Blumenthal went to Hungary almost by chance and now, after several years, he seems to have been almost fatally attracted to her. From the forty essays of this book Budapest emerges not as a casual flirt of a foreigner but more like a major and encompassing love affair. The passionate yet tender evocation of a Central Europe that perhaps only the alien poet can see so clearly elevates these pieces from journalism into poetry. The Hungary of the early 1990s is captured here with the self-invented nostalgia of someone who suddenly realizes that he has found his home there, as have so many American authors in great European cities, from Paris to Berlin and London to Rome. Budapest appears in Blumenthal's mirror as beautiful and dirty, challenging and backward, politicized and poetic, a thing of the past and, increasingly, of the present. Published in book format for the first time, Blumenthal's essays present a reemerging, world-class city and its great culture in an unusual, delicate form. A must for all who have enough of cliches on 'Eastern' Europe.\" --Tibor Frank, Director, American Studies Center, Etvs Lornd University, Budapest\"Some personal remarks - your book is charming, witty, warm and absolutely personal and original. And what is more: it speaks about the truth (local and global). Many thinaks for it. It has made me happy.\" --Excerpt from a letter to the Author by The Honorable Arpad Gncz, President of the Republic of Hungary", "related": [], "rank": 3089604, "title": "When History Enters the House", "author": "Michael Blumenthal", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Life was slower, people were friendlier, more polite, and the world as a whole was a lot more naïve. This is a tale of one family and their adventures and even though Lila is the narrator she figures as only a small part of the whole. After the chaos of raising five children she thought life would be quiet and serene but such has not proven to be the case. Having lived in nine different states she and her husband now operate a business in Garland, Texas, where they reside along with two really big, really dumb Great Danes. Lila privately suspects they are actually members of the Blue Collar Comedy team dressed in dog suits. Although she has had several articles published in national magazines and in the Dallas Morning News she had never harbored secret yearnings to write a book. Even now she is amazed to realize she has done just that. Lila has an avid interest in history and is something of a trivia buff so it comes as no surprise to discover this book is packed with historical trivia. Being a real wacko when it comes to Christmas Lila spends a good portion of each year gathering materials and setting up holiday displays. Then she and her long-suffering husband invite the neighbors in to enjoy the festivities. Her pet charity is the Ronald McDonald House in Dallas, where each December she is fortunate enough to be able to help set up the Christmas decorations for the families who stay there.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The books combine humor and murder into a total package of entertaining and fun southern adventures. At the same time, Jada sketches in addiction/recovery issues and childhood angst with a deft and compassionate touch. Jada spent the first twenty-odd years of her life in rural Kentucky, many of those years without electricity or running water. In her writings, Jada draws upon her early years of deprivation. Jada, along with one of her protagonists, Marisa Adair, did not know people ate three meals a day until she started school. To help her better understand her childhood as well as to \"give back,\" Jada volunteered in a domestic violence shelter. Understanding the puzzle of abusers and their victims involves such complex factors as religion, culture, self-esteem, and cycles of abuse and victimization which may span generations. In her volunteer role, Jada helped abused women work on their job searching, resume writing, and interview skills. When she asked women to name just one positive thing about themselves, it was heartbreaking to see the women struggle to come up with just one good trait or strength. Now, she lives in central Kentucky with her wonderful husband and their cat, rescued from the animal shelter. In spite of her humble beginnings, the cat rules the household and is also a kleptomaniac. Once, she stole a Bluetooth and hid it under the couch. It took her humans several days to locate her ill-gotten booty. In her day job, Jada works in higher education. She strongly believes adults can earn advanced degrees without taking on staggering student loan debt. While working full-time in a gas station and going to school full-time, Jada earned her bachelors degree in business administration. Using the tuition plan at her work, Jada subsequently earned her masters degree in public administration. Jada loves feedback from readers, both one-on-one and through customer reviews on Amazon.com.

If the Fantasy world doesn't deliver, no matter what the plot is or how great the characters are or how stellar the writing is, the reader just won't buy into it. I have to say that this was one of the best, most fully developed and realized fantasy worlds I've visited (literary-wise) in some time.\" - Goodreads reviewer\"The author created such an interesting and fantastical world with vivid scenery, amazing characters you root for (and some who will terrify you), and unpredictable events.\" - Goodreads reviewer", "related": ["B00H2ZKQX2"], "rank": 1489177, "title": "Shadows in the Sand (Empyria Book 1) eBook", "author": "Michael Diack", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 25, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 120.0}

Borden\nhas brought Vivid Brushstrokes: The Overlooked Reality of God in Our\nDaily Lives from a simple observation to a means of inspiring devotion\nto our creator. The author has followed the example which Christ himself\n set when he used the simplest of things in order to teach the deepest\nconcepts of heaven, earth, and spirituality through the use of parables.\n The truths that are so simply brought to life in this book come from\nthe modern world and are the things that tend to be overlooked. However,\n for someone who is open to allowing God's spirit to fill him/her, they\ncan be useful for illuminating even the most difficult concepts.God has indeed used a colorful palette as he painted the portrait of\nheaven and earth. Vivid Brushstrokes certainly brings those colors into\nfocus as Dennis A. Borden reveals some of the deeper concepts of daily\nliving through his delightful and inspiring anecdotes and word pictures.\n This is a simple, down-home, and easy-to-read collection of stories and\n devotions that will not only inspire and encourage, but leave the\nreader thoughtful as he considers the wonders of God's handiwork on a\ndaily basis. An excellent and inspired aid to continued Christian growth\n and daily maintenance of the Christian walk of faith. Pastors and\nlaymen alike will find pure gold liberally painted throughout this book.\n It cannot be overlooked.Reviewed by Bill Howard of Reader's Favorite.Visit my website to view all reviews and connect with my blog:  vividbrushstrokes.com", "related": [], "rank": 2787599, "title": "Vivid Brushstrokes: The Overlooked Reality of God in Our Everyday Lives", "author": "Dennis A.

With the ending of his second marriage and his personal life in shambles, he set out on a path of self-discovery. He began to ask, “What has my life been about? Surely there must be meaning to all of this?” He found the courage to look within for the first time in his life, and what he discovered will help change your life for the better. Greg employed hundreds of people and was deeply involved in numerous lives while on his path to external success. An insatiable reader, he studied Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) in the early nineties, as well as transcendental meditation – which became a workplace ritual. He became one of Australia’s leading business people and entrepreneurs. Finally needing more answers to life, in his late forties and early fifties he undertook intensive work with psychotherapists, psychologists, and counselors, attended numerous group therapy sessions, and shared life experiences with many people. Slowly he connected the dots to life – identifying what is important and how to find the courage to embrace the change that will transform your life. The answers to the questions he’d long been asking were realized after a lifetime! In 2009, he founded Epsilon Healing Academy and the University of Self to help people around the world live lives that in every way reflect who they are and what they deeply desire.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This story was inspired by her life on the island of Whalsay in Shetland. The positive feedback she received from this encouraged her to carry on writing and in 2013 she published Dancing in Phoenix Park. She started writing this book during the 18 months she spent living in Ireland. She completed the novel after moving back to Shetland and finishing her Masters. She now writes a regular column for The Shetland Times newspaper, and teaches creative writing.

Originally an Industrial Engineer like her father, Pino never built any machines. Instead, she dedicated herself to learning everything she could about what drove the most exquisite machine on Earth: the Human Body.  After a decade of executive experience in France, USA and Spain working for Deloitte Consulting and then for French retail multinational Leroy Merlin, Pino decided to focus full-heartedly on leadership development. With an MBA and a coaching certificate under her belt, she spent the following decade building and closing a boutique consulting firm in Spain, coaching CEOs and board level executives, publishing two books, teaching leadership skills at top-ranking IE Business School and directing tailored executive education programs for women aspiring to lead multinational organizations. A builder at heart, she launched many other change initiatives and innovation projects in parallel. Some worked, some didn’t. «You gotta keep reinventing yourself until it works!», she explains. Pino has passionately researched the amazing complexity of human behavior and what drives it ever since she can remember. Her own fierce adventure into the hidden disconnections of her body fueled a tireless quest into leadership literature, coaching tools, evolutionary design, psychology, spirituality, mindfulness, body awareness and any avenue of thinking that could help her improve. Her training is deep and extensive, but she doesn’t care much for titles and certifications to justify herself. «My credibility is in my eyes, in my voice and in my actions. My work speaks for itself» she strongly believes. Today Pino coaches individuals and facilitates CONNECT leadership and personal growth seminars around the world in English, Spanish, French and Italian*. She sits on the board of the prestigious IWF Leadership Foundation (www.iwforum.org). She collaborates with several top-ranking business schools and stars her own coaching program on a Spanish TV channel. Pino is also developing a non-profit initiative to promote a cleaner planet by making personal growth services accessible to all: The Hill of Tara Foundation.  And her new book, «LEADERS OF TRASH: Are you one of them?», promises to raise more than a few eyebrows.", "related": ["B00JR90W6W"], "rank": 3340915, "title": "Leaders of trash", "author": "Pino Bethencourt Gallagher", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

JOE THORNTONCaptain, San Jose Sharks, NHL“I marvel at a young man who has accomplished so much under such adverse conditions, but to see the fortitude and strength that this young man has exemplified, I think it should be a lesson not only to all of Canada or all the people here tonight, but to anyone who can touch the life of such a fi ne young man. He s an inspiration and a credit to a sport that probably doesn t receive the recognition, that say hockey or football or baseball does, but yet he continues to persevere because it s a self-lit flame that drives him. To me he s a true champion. JOE THEISMANNSuper Bowl winning NFL Quarterback“I can t tell you what a privilege it is to know this fella. He stands as an inspiration to everybody, to all the kids out there. PAUL NEWMANActor“Craig MacFarlane is a rare and impressive man. His accomplishments themselves are noteworthy but it is the spirit and attitude with which he lives his life that most command your attention and respect. BOB COSTASNBC SportsCraig s life and his journey has been remarkable and impressive. He is a special person who gives so much to others yet asks for little in return. Craig s life s story is truly a remarkable one.BRAD STEVENSBoston Celtics Head Coach --BRAD STEVENS Boston Celtics Head Coach", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Not having many friends to talk to other than the cats and dogs, she started writing in order to alleviate the excess of words swirling through her brain. And she happened to be none too shabby at it. Her earliest work debuted in third grade with a poem about a brown cat. From there she never really stopped. By high school, her creative writing teacher offered to be her literary agent both times she took the class. Still, feeling like a little bitty fish in a very big pond, she kept her writing mostly to herself and got lost in everyday life. She met people, now and then, that would fan the spark of writing into flame once again. She would share her work with them. She would be inspired to write and write and write some more. But always, after a while, she would let it die back again to embers and return to the day to day grind. Until finally, one day, she realized half her life was gone and she still wasn't what she was meant to be. But now, she is determined enough to finish what she had started and get her work out there. She has published three books featuring her poetry and photography: Where Moonflowers Bloom, The Tincture of a Radiant Madness and In Just a Few Small Words. She has several more poetry books, flash fiction collections and a short story collection in the works. She also has several novels in progress as well and is currently focusing on a science fiction novel entitled Gleamers Madness. She lives in Texas with a man and a menagerie.", "related": [], "rank": 3728132, "title": "Razor Pussy Chronicles: Volume One", "author": "Sreya Bremtin", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The first question that arises the moment she hears of someone passing is, “Did they accept Jesus into their heart?” She will go right up to anyone facing death and ask that life-changing question. And she’ll approach others with encouragement: “Has anyone ever told you God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life?” She knows that God is omnipotent, and that settles it for her.  Born in Alabama, she has traveled and lived in several different states, but has now found her way back home. From her teenage years, she recalled writing love letters for close friends.  Her book focuses on the lives of women coming out of challenging relationships, mainly divorces. Lucille’s writing is not limited to just this type of self-help. Some of her favorite writing includes allegory and short stories.  She also enjoys reaching out to women in prison, where she served as a volunteer prayer counselor.   While assisting with Bible study groups in youth centers, she aided in winning 45 young girls to Christ all, under the age of 21. Lucille is the CEO of her elderly home business, Candlelight Compassions, in her home town. She still awaits any and every opportunity to share the Gospel and to see the lives of people changed. She also enjoys being at home again, where she was raised as a little girl. She remembers this is where it all started in a small little town surrounded by a lot of love and a lot of memories.  “I started this book in 2002 at the age of 47,” says Lucille. “I’m now 58 and published. I mention this to note that it’s never too late to walk in your dream, no matter what it is — as long as you give God all the glory.”", "related": [], "rank": 3426708, "title": "You Are Going to Make It! eBook", "author": "Lucille Ankum", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has written one novella (Ill Wind) and one full-length novel (Dead Reckoning – long-listed in the Mslexia Novel Competition 2011) in the Valkyrie Series, both of which are number one bestsellers in Sea Adventures on Amazon.co.uk. A further Valkyrie novel, Look Sharpe! will be published at the beginning of 2014, followed by Ready About! Both books follow the fortunes of Henry Sharpe, a character we have already met in Ill Wind and Dead Reckoning. Relationships are turned upside down and secrets revealed. Karen Perkins has also written the novel, Thores-Cross. A dark, haunting tale set in the North Yorkshire Moors about isolation, superstition and persecution, Thores-Cross follows the stories of Emma, a present day writer, and Jennet, an eighteenth century witch. Thores-Cross is a number one bestseller in British Horror on Amazon.com.

He comes\n with a secret, a mission that could ruin Ashleigh Carter's life and end\n the Priests.But from the moment he moves to Absolution, Paul is overwhelmed by the\nstrong sense of family among the Priests. The Rabids have\nnothing like it, and Paul has never known love and care like the Priests\n show him before he's even unpacked his furniture. It changes everything\n he knows of the world, and it changes his reason for being in\nAbsolution.Ashleigh is a big part of that. The President's daughter, she's one of\nthe first people he meets, and she captures his attention completely.\nKnowing how his mission would hurt her, he tries to stay away, but he\ncan't. They embark on a torrid, intense love affair.But he still has that secret. Blood in the Water follows Paul's\nintegration into the Priests, his education in the loving ways of\nfamily, his deep love for Ash and her for him, and his crisis as he\ntries to leave his old life and claim his new without taking down the\nvery family he's come to love and value.Johnson creates a vivid world full of lively, real people with real\nrelationships and real problems. And real love and affection. Paul's\nstart in life is heartbreaking, but he becomes a strong, honorable man\ncapable of great love. Ashleigh's life has not been quite so painful but\n has not been without its challenges. They make a wonderful couple with\nsizzling chemistry. The Priests are a family I want to get to know\nmore of.
