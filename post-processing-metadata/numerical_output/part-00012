I was pleased to find myself in a medieval time period with sorcerers, knights, and damsels in distress. Ms. Hilton created a very special group of characters that allowed you to pick your favorite hero and villain. I enjoyed the nuances that Ms. Hilton gave to the primary and secondary characters in the story. The plot flowed smoothly. While we were left with a cliff hanger towards the end, I found that I wasn’t disappointed and the anticipation just makes the story that much sweeter. The love Lucien and Aislan shared was extremely sensual and well written.

[Kaster is] a marvellous scholar at the top of his form.\"--Times Literary Supplement\"This book is a splendid contribution to a field that has recently burgeoned: the study of the emotions in classical antiquity. Kaster investigates a complex of five interrelated Latin emotion terms:verecundia,pudor,paenitenita,invidia, andfastidium; to the chapters devoted to each of these, he appends an epilogue onintegritas. The result is a rich portrait of what these ideas meant to the Romans and how they conditioned their behaviour.... Kaster is an excellent reader, and his elegant interpretations contribute greatly to the value of this gracefully written book.\"--David Konstan,Journal of Roman Studies\"The importance of Kaster's new book cannot be overstated, both as a study of the Roman ideology of self-restraint in its own right and as a model of careful and intelligent scholarship that builds from ancient evidence.

The gap between research and practice can sometimes be bridged by providing teachers with a resource that translates research into a practical \"how-to\" format. Drs. Shapiro and Cole have created such a resource in this text. They have done so through a balance of both scholarly and applied information, so that educators know the \"whys\" as well as the \"hows\" of self-management.\" --Charles A. Hughes, Ph.D., Penn State University\"The problems educators are facing today are enormous. Traditional strategies are not sufficient to address our contemporary challenges. We need to identify and cultivate innovative strategies that hold promise for classroom use.Self-Management Interventions for Classroom Behavior Changeby Shapiro and Cole does an outstanding job of presenting practitioners with a review of self-management intervention strategies. These methods enable students to play a more active role in improving their own academic achievement and classroom behaviors. The authors present in both a clear and useful manner descriptions of various self-management classroom strategies, the empirical support for these strategies, and practical issue involved in designing and implementing these strategies. These authors have done an excellent job of showing how research demonstrations of self-management technology can be translated into effective practice.\" --John W. Fantuzzo, Ph.D., University of Pennsylvania\"Students that are self-motivated, responsible, and self-directed is what everyone wants for their students, but these are characteristics that are hard to attain. These are difficult concepts to define and even more difficult to teach. Ed Shapiro's and Chris Cole's new book on self-management reads like a road map in practically teaching these skills to the most difficult students. This book is scholarly, but at the same time gives step-by-step instructions in teaching self-management for academic performance, problem solving, stress management, and social skills. I highly recommend the book for regular and special educators for classroom. It is also an excellent tool for guidance personnel who want to make a meaningful impact in educating students to be more self-directed and responsible. This book is a practical gem.\" --William R.

It is a joy to read someone who, through practical experience, really knows what he is talking about.\"Professor Tom Schelling, University of Maryland, Nobel-Laureate in Economics\"A fascinating, timely, and important study of risk, harms, and regulatory interventions, with a wonderfully broad range of topics and examples, and a great deal of common sense. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the topic of precautions.\"Professor Cass Sunstein, University of Chicago\"Malcolm Sparrow provides a clear, readable account of approaches to controlling harms, threats and risks in modern society. His skillful combination of academic literatures and practical examples presents a strong argument for evidence based action. In particular his cross domain approach should attract a wide readership ranging as it does from issues of world poverty to harm reduction in individual organizations. It will appeal to academics and practitioners alike.\"Professor Bridget Hutter, London School of Economics\"Today's environmental problems, as Sparrow teaches, really do come in a daunting array of shapes and sizes. At the EPA we have discovered that organizing our compliance programs around specific problems, analyzing their causes and contours and developing customized strategies for each, the way Sparrow proposes in this book, represents a profoundly difficult but highly rewarding departure from traditional operations. The Character of Harms will deeply affect anyone working to make the world safer, better, and more secure.\"Michael Stahl, Director of Compliance, United States Environmental Protection Agency\"Harms have an intricate character that must be studied, Malcolm Sparrow tells us. This is a remarkable book for people whose job is to control harms. It supplies nuanced reflection on how to pick problems apart and fix them. Sparrow is one of our great public policy thinkers. Here he advances the art of being evidence-based in public policy with wisdom about just what kind of artistry is involved.\"Professor John Braithwaite, Australian National University", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Principally, I set out to create what might be called a post-nuclear apocalypse noir series; something considerably different from a \"science fiction\" approach  -- and tried to work out how the elements of noir might function within the framework of what I'd set out to accomplish.To address the second part of your question, I don't really have permanent favorite parts of anything I've written. I might find myself idly reflecting on this scene or that, or this paragraph or that, from time to time, with appreciation or odium, or I might like or dislike some parts as I re-read an earlier effort, but that's pretty much the extent of it.Phoenix #5 ends on a cliffhanger, with Magnus Trench still searching for his family.  Why did the series end with this volume?  Have you considered wrapping it up with a final installment?I'd done an outline for what would have been a final story in which Trench and his family were (in some way, shape or form) reunited (probably with some wicked twist, such as wife and child having become Contams by this point). I've from time to time over the years considered various more permanent wrap-ups as well. One thing this suggests is the way a character, or group of characters, once created, can tend to powerfully and lastingly root themselves to an author's consciousness.

Apocalyptic global climate change fuels Jensen's terrifying near-future tale about the human will to survive or, in the case of Bethany Krall, a psychic psychotic teen who stabbed her mother to death, the will to embrace death. Bethany, a patient at Oxsmith Adolescent Secure Psychiatric Hospital in Hadport, England, forms a strong bond with her wheelchair-bound psychologist, Gabrielle Fox. As Gabrielle treats her patient, the world outside the hospital suffers natural disasters foreseen by Bethany after ECT shock therapy. Meanwhile, Bethany has been traumatized by the Faith Wave views of her father, Rev. Leonard Krall, who believes the Rapture is approaching. Since Bethany is convinced she bears the mark of the beast, she fears she won't go to heaven. Gabrielle seeks help from Frazer Melville, a physicist who takes Bethany's catastrophe calendar seriously. In gorgeous prose, Jensen (Egg Dancing) paints a depressing but oddly hopeful portrait of a modern doomsday scenario.(Aug.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She has appeared in over fifty stage productions within Australia from Shakespeare, Tennessee Williams to writing and appearing in various shows with Kate Champion's Force Majeure and has worked in a number of TV series as well. Veronica has featured in a number of films and has just completed filming as the lead in an Australian film - Girl Clock. Known for her versatility in the Arts industry she is a performer, writer, teacher and director. Veronica grew up in Australia as an army brat, moving every few years to a new post.   Veronica attended drama classes from the age of five which she continued until leaving school.  It was a natural progression then to study drama at University. Veronica trained for three years at the University of Southern Queensland as an Actor receiving a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Theatre. She has worked professionally as an Actor in film, television and theatre in Australia ever since.   After seven years working as a classical actor she decided to merge her acting with physical acting working with Legs on the Wall and Rock and Roll Circus, travelling the world for several years.  Her experiences honed her skills to become more of a specialist performer. Using her training in Yoga, dance and balance acrobatics she became passionate about marrying the techniques of text based theatre and movement. Her wide and varied experience in the arts over the last 21 years has seen her engaged as performer, writer, director, dramaturge and teacher. Growing up Veronica never knew her grandparents; they had all passed away rather prematurely.  When Veronica found out she was Breast Cancer gene carrier at the age of 39 she felt a strange connection to her grandmother Elsie who had died from the disease at age fifty. When her Mother and two sisters were identified as gene carriers as well it seemed right to take up arms against this insidious expression of hereditary character.  She set about finding out everything she could about this gene mutation that had effected generations of women in her family. What unfolded was a myriad of conundrums and ethical dilemmas reflected against a history of struggle and death. Veronica continues to perform in Theatre in Australia and abroad.

Shadows of Enron and assorted villain-companies, and the dire financial situation of the current recession drive the project, which they view even at this early state as a successful effort to clothe business managers with foundational ethics and morality. Now a global movement, the eight-point oath involves promises of responsibility, growth, development, honesty, and respect for the law. The authors dissect it thoroughly, with illustrations from a variety of interesting case studies and tests. As more than 10,000 schools worldwide offer MBA degrees, the writers caution that a business school ranking is influenced by the average compensation of a graduate during his first year after school and that compensation, rather than value, has become the keystone of an education. They also note that a sixty-four-page ethics manual proved powerless in the hands of Enron management. Suggesting that managers operate at a baseline level of doing no harm, The MBA Oath is a strong call for ethical reform.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Undergraduate Research in the Sciences offers a groundbreaking and practical research-based book on the topic. This comprehensive resource addresses how undergraduate research benefits undergraduate participants, including those populations that are underrepresented in the sciences; compares its benefits with other types of educational activities and experiences; and assesses its long-term value to students and faculty as both a scholarly and educational endeavor.In laying out the processes by which these benefits are achieved, this important book can assist faculty and program directors with practical guidance for design and evaluation of both new and existing undergraduate research programs.Praise for Undergraduate Research in the Sciences\"This meticulous, definitive study of the effects of working with a faculty member on research as an undergraduate confirms the overall value of the experience by taking us deep into the minds and actions of participants—both faculty and students. As a result we now have many more compelling reasons to get more students involved with research mentors and ways to optimize the benefits for all parties.\"—George D. Kuh, Chancellor's Professor and director, Indiana University Center for Postsecondary Research\"This timely book offers a unique, comprehensive analysis of undergraduate research in the sciences, based on the voices of college students and faculty mentors who have participated in these voyages of discovery. As our nation struggles to train more scientists, this book will be a valuable resource for designing undergraduate research experiences that can build our country's capacity for discovery and innovation.\"—Arthur B. Ellis, Vice Chancellor for Research, University of California, San Diego\"The text is written in a lucid and engaging style and will be a valuable guide to policymakers, academic administrators, and faculty members who want to find ways to engage undergraduates in the 'real work' of investigation.\"—Judith A. Ramaley, president, Winona State University\"This book is a 'must-read' for anyone who directs undergraduates in research. It presents an impressive and rigorous body of work that brings fresh insights into the field of undergraduate research. The next generation of scientists will benefit greatly from the findings and recommendations!\"—Jo Handelsman, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor, Yale University", "related": [], "rank": 2779030, "title": "Undergraduate Research in the Sciences", "author": "Sandra Laursen", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All governments tend toward greater control and less freedom. He called for armed resistance as the best guard against it.How long have you been writing?Since I was ten years old.What authors have inspired you?C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Stephen King, among others. I'm drawn to  dark stories that pit good against evil in breathtaking, apocalyptic ways. For this series, I especially drew inspiration from Dostoyevski'sCrime and Punishment, Ayn Rand'sAtlas Shrugged, Sinclair Lewis'It Can't Happen Here, and Pat Frank'sAlas Babylon.Where did you get the idea for the novel?I've always wondered what happened to America. I knew something had gone  wrong. Our country wasn't anything like what it had once been. Did something drive us from the vision of the Founding Fathers? And what would happen if we continue down this path? In the last few elections I saw how divided we were as a country. How long the fabric of our civilization will hold together? What will happen when it finally tears apart? Jefferson's Road is my prediction about all this.Who is your favorite character?The characters are all based on \"types\" - bits and pieces of people I've  known, and they are all very real to me. Peter is the hero, or perhaps the anti-hero, of the novel, but Martin has the best lines. Jerry is a lovable doofus who gets caught up in all this, and for that reason is all the more tragic. Grant plays the role of villain, but despite his lies, he is the most true to who he is. There's an air of mystery about him. You never quite know whether or not he's going to shoot someone.Do you want the President assassinated?God no. I think that'd be an utter disaster for this country. But I do think that if change back to the Constitution doesn't come by the ballot, it will come by the bullet. Will freedom-loving Americans really allow us to become a socialist state or a Marxist dystopia? Someone will do something rash, and it'll all explode or, more likely, implode.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There he promptly begins an affair with Mona, a young mother of two. But Tory arrives in the town bent on revenge, Mona and her kids disappear, and Jack's motel room is awash with blood. Jack is promptly arrested and must escape to clear himself. Character is everything in this desert-noir debut, and Jack is the embodiment of fecklessness; without a script, he's simply lost. Rachel, a clever 14-year-old runaway, saves him repeatedly. In the book's best scene, Jack returns to Hollywood, still on the run, for a bit part in a major film. Pyne, who is a successful screenwriter, limns a wonderfully plausible look at a showbiz-sound-stage moment: a clash between a loony director who speaks only quasi-mystical gibberish and an idiot box-office titan channeling De Niro. Twentynine Palms is great fun. --Thomas Gaughan", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It affects the estimated 6 percent of those sent to prison who are actually innocent. It affects the families—parents, children, spouses—of those incarcerated. And it also creates jobs at correctional facilities and a need for volunteers in prison ministry.But there is one more group of people that incarceration affects—a group that, often times, isn't aware it is involved in the process at all. That group is made up of every person in society not mentioned above.Together, that means all of us.Tom and Laura Lagana had all of us in mind when they compiled short stories, poems, cartoons, and quotes for their bookServing Productive Time. As volunteers in prisons, the Laganas share a passion and a vision for reaching out to prisoners, ex-prisoners, and their families to effect positive change. Their work as professional speakers and authors gives them the opportunity to inspire others in society to latch onto that vision as well. Hidden inside the inspirational stories of their book is a hope that America will come to see prisoners as people who—if given the proper support—have the ability to become contributing members of society upon their release.Often the first step toward bringing about positive change is forming an accurate perspective of the incarcerated and their families. In the first chapter of the book, screenwriter and songwriter Bob Pauly challenges readers to realize that people who have been in prison are all around us—including those we might least expect:'I'm the man who bags your groceries, the waitress who brings you coffee, and the kid on the bike down the street. I've been to your house before: as a plumber, an electrician, even the installer of you...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Mr. Taylor is a retired California Peace Officer, educated in criminal psychology and geology. Currently a Biblical teacher and counselor, he offers us some most unique insights into the profound attributes of God. He has also authored 'Hiking Life's Difficult Trails', an in depth look at life's spiritual dilemmas, now in two editions, the second of which is solely for High Country Hikers, whose desire is to learn more about what's behind the wonder and splendor encountered along the high trails. 'Knowing Just Who You Are', is the latest in this 'self-help category', and is for sure an eye-opening look at ourselves as individuals—a treatise on body, mind and spirit.            Mr. Taylor has in addition produced books that he labels, 'a bit of fiction and reality'. Among his bestsellers in this category are, (1) 'Lone Pine'; a story of love undying, (2) 'A High Sierra Christmas'; an untold tale of Jeremiah Johnson, (3) 'Three Days in Lone Pine'; and untold tale of the High Sierra 1873, and his latest western, (4) 'Still Waters'; legend of the white wolf. (Note: 2, 3, & 4 are now part of the new 'Lone Pine Western' series.)            'The Sun, The Glass, and The Leaning Rock'; the secret of the lost Dutchman's gold (also published under the 1984 title, 'A Second Chance'; a daring tale of high adventure), kicks off an exciting mystery series involving characters Rod Florea and Mitch Holland, whose expertise in treasure hunting and route finding are unmatched anywhere in the country. The second book in this series is 'The Secret of Monument Valley'; the Trail of the Anasazi, which solves the mystery surrounding the disappearance of the Anasazi people of the desert southwest.            In the third book of the mystery series, 'Treasure of the High Sierra'; Dead Men's Gold, their treasure hunting and route finding experience leads them on a most enlightening but dangerous journey, where they come to the aid of two teenagers in their quest for old, hidden pirate treasure. Unfortunately they must deal with the ghastly spirits of long dead buccaneers! Expect more great stories in both this mystery series and the new Lone Pine Western series.

His travel account was published in 1924 as The River of Seven Stars.   After returning from the Venezuela trip, many of Friel's stories were set in that environment. He remained a popular writer in Adventure throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Most of his longer works were republished in hardback.

It was Michael's first experience with a wedding, Jinni had confided, and Val sensed strong emotion behind the youth's rather swaggering exterior. Obviously, Michael preferred that no one know how touched he was by this very adult affair.Val understood exactly how the boy felt. She, too, was emotional. She had to bat her lashes every few moments to hold back tears. She didn't want to cry at Jinni's wedding, she wanted to be happy and joyful and smiling. Growing up, the Fairchild sisters had not been close at all, but when Jinni dropped everything in New York and came to Rumor to help out during Val's chemotherapy treatments, it had been the most pleasant surprise of Val's life.Now the sisters were very close, and the frosting on the cake was that Jinni had met Max Cantrell and they had fallen in love; Rumor, Montana, was now Jinni's home as much as it was Val's. It struck Val, while she stood there listening to Pastor Rayburn's kindly voice uniting her sister with the man she so dearly loved, that even when things looked darkest, there was often a ray of light on the horizon. Val's dark days had indeed been brightened by her sister's unexpected appearance. Jinni fairly glowed with her enjoyment of life, and she rarely had a negative word to say about anything. She had bolstered Val's spirits more times than Val could recall, and during their many conversations, hours spent talking and laughing, they had become true sisters.\"I now pronounce you man and wife,\" Pastor Rayburn said. Val sighed inwardly, feeling a spark of regret because the ceremony was over.Max put his arms around his wife and kissed her. At that very moment, a wave of weakness—a backlash from her chemotherapy treatments—struck Valerie. No! she thought frantically. Not now! Given no choice in the matter, she sought someone to lean on. She took two shaky steps and grabbed Michael's arm. He looked at her as though she had sprouted horns.\"Bear with me,\" she whispered, comprehending his dismay. \"I need to steal a bit of your strength… just for a moment or two.\"\"Uh, sure,\" he said, then remembered that Jinni's sister wasn't well. In fact, when he thought about it, there had been several instances of conversation about Dr. Fairchild doing battle with cancer. Just thinking the word sent icy fingers up Michael's spine, but he would crumble to dust right where he stood before letting this nice woman know that he was so easily rattled.The guests in the small church left their seats to congratulate the newlyweds. Val managed to kiss her sister's cheek, then Max's, and to wish them every happiness before the crowd got to them.\"I'm fine now, Michael,\" she told him. \"Thanks for the use of your arm.\"\"You can hang on to my arm anytime you, uh, need to.\"Val saw the red stains on Michael's cheeks and adored the boy for his response. He always acted so tough and uncaring, but underneath his bored-with-it-all expression, his practiced glower, he was a sweet young man.\"You're a dear,\" she said with a soft smile. \"I think you and I might be related now. Let me see. Jinni is now your stepmom and I'm her sister, so I think that makes me your stepaunt. What do you think?\"\"Yeah, could be,\" Michael mumbled.Val wanted to laugh, but for Michael's sake she didn't. The boy was well aware of Jinni's new status. He didn't have to call her Mom, but legally she was his stepmother. Val knew for a fact that Jinni was thrilled at gaining a son along with a truly marvelous husband, but Val could only guess at how Michael perceived the quite serious change in his life. Jinni was positive, and had said to her sister that she and Michael were developing a great relationship.The church hadn't been full; only a dozen or so guests had been invited, as the Cantrell family wasn't exactly riding high these days. Max's mother was there, and Val noticed Michael gravitating toward her. Mrs. Cantrell was torn, Val could tell—happy for her eldest son, Max, and worried for her younger son, Guy, who was in jail, awaiting trial for the murder of his deceased wife, Wanda, and her lover, Morris Templeton.There was not going to be a wedding reception, either. The Cantrells—with Jinni present—had discussed the event and decided that with Guy in such jeopardy they would eliminate any flamboyance. When the trial was over and Guy was freed—they were positive of the outcome, as they knew Guy could never harm, let alone murder, anyone—then they would throw a party that would knock the whole town's socks off. Jinni had ardently agreed with her future family.While the newlyweds were kissed and congratulated by everyone, Val dodged bodies, went to a pew and sat by herself. Watching the gaiety at the front of the church spill into the center aisle, she realized how much Jinni's family had expanded in the past few minutes. Val's family consisted of one person, Jinni, while her sister had Max, Michael, Mrs. Cantrell and Guy.Val sighed quietly. She would never be a bride. She couldn't force herself to let a man get close no matter how clever his attempts. She'd been hit on many times since that horrible long-ago experience that still haunted her dreams. The extended therapy she had undergone after the incident had helped, of course, but she'd known from her first session that she would never regain her old confidence and be the carefree, flirtatious woman she'd been before that terrifying day. Absorbed wisdom from the best therapist money could hire had made her more or less whole again but it had also destroyed her affection for the opposite sex. She liked men, as long as they kept their distance.It wasn't something she talked about; it was just who she was these days, a sexless being with a good career, a handful of friends and a sister that she had come to love very much.But who wouldn't love Jinni? Val asked herself. She was so alive, so vibrant and beautiful. Jinni brought life into any room she entered. Was it any wonder that Max had fallen in love with her? The good citizens of Rumor had never met a sparkling dynamo like Jinni Fairchild, and she'd taken the place by storm. Now, of course, she was one of the townsfolk, and Val would bet anything that once Jinni and Max settled into their marriage, Jinni would become Rumor's leading hostess.It was a pleasing thought, and Val was smiling when Jim and Estelle Worth approached her. These wonderful people had started out as employees, helping out when Val became ill, and had evolved very quickly into good friends. Both Jim and Estelle were retired, Jim from the U.S. Forest Service andEstelle from nursing. Jim was a big man with thick shoulders, a bit of a paunch and a full head of graying hair that would make many a younger man blanch in envy. Estelle was tall and thin—her dark hair also graying—and so full of cheerful energy that she appeared to bounce from one task to another. This great sixty-something couple still worked for Val, Jim in the Animal Hospital and Estelle in Val's home, and Val could talk with ease to each of them. Not about herself, of course, or her disturbing past, but Jim and Estelle had become parental figures to her. She truly loved them both.\"What a precious wedding,\" Estelle said with a nostalgic sigh, as though recalling her own wedding. Jim stood behind her and grinned. Maybe he, too, was remembering.\"Val, you look beautiful in that dress,\" Estelle said. \"And Jinni's gown? Oh, my, I've never seen such lovely dresses in all my days. Where did you say they came from?\"\"From New York City, Estelle. Jinni knows the designer. She called her, described what she would like shipped out, and we received the dresses two days later.\"\"And they fit perfectly.\" Her comment was a statement, not a question.\"With a nip and a tuck here and there, yes.\" Val could see that people were starting to leave the church. Max and Jinni were planning to fly to California and honeymoon at a fabulous resort, and it was time they headed out.\"I'm going to say goodbye, then I'll be ready to go,\" Val murmured while getting to her feet.\"We'll wait in the car,\" Jim called. \"Take your time.\"\"Thanks, Jim.\" Val hurried to the happy newlyweds. Max was talking to a tall, well-dressed man, and Val barely noticed either of them while she took Jinni's hand and said with teary eyes and a catch in her voice, \"You are the most stunning bride this little church has ever seen. Jinni, what can I say, except thank you for everything you've done for me. I don't need to tell you to be happy, because you always are.\"Jinni blinked back her own tears. \"You can be happy, too, sweetie. You just have to look at the bright side of life. We both know it's there, Val, but sometimes it isn't out in the open. You have to do a bit of searching to find it. Now, kiss me and say goodbye. We have to get a move on if we're going to make our flight.\"Smiling through her tears, Val kissed her sister's cheek, then turned to kiss Max. But instead of looking into Max's brilliant blue eyes she found herself looking into Reed King-sley's brilliantgreeneyes. She was so startled that she let out a small gasp.\"Hello, Valerie,\" he said calmly.\"Hello,\" she answered, and twisted a bit to plant a quick kiss on Max's cheek. \"Have a wonderful honeymoon,\" she whispered, then backed away, turned and hurried down the aisle to the church's outer door. She was almost there, almost home free, when Reed caught...", "related": ["B000MAHACY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

McCauley is head of security for Hauser's, a large Chicago department store. Preston Hauser, president of the store, has been receiving threatening letters, and asks McCauley to quietly investigate. At a meeting with McCauley in his office, Preston takes his daily vitamins--and dies: the capsules were laced with cyanide. McCauley tells Preston's wife, Diana, a fetching kleptomaniac, that she is a widow; she finds the news hilarious and tries to seduce him. McCauley resists; he has recently become roommates with Elaine Kluszewski. He and Elaine investigate the various Hauser's executives that Preston had suspected of writing the letters. Brod's settings and dialogue are realistic and believable, more than making up for a repetitive running gag on the difficulty of parking in Chicago. Despite the obvious flag or two pointing the way to the guilty doorstep, this hard-boiled first-in-a-series is solid, satisfying fare.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 1203687, "title": "Murder in Store", "author": "DC Brod", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.2857, "rating_total": 30.0}

Step by step, the text follows the material through its origins to its eventual uses, which include thread, toothbrush bristles, umbrellas, and even hot-air balloons. The bright, well-placed photos intersperse curious kids in wacky poses with vivid shots of materials ranging from jet-black oil (that’s where nylon comes from) and extreme close-ups of knit fabrics. A glossary, here called “Challenge Words,” appears up front to prepare adults and kids for the interesting, well-presented info to follow.

Yet more musician than scientist, she introduces a section called \"Circus Merk\" as \"a figment ... named after the composer Joseph Merk, one of whose cello etudes sounded to me as I practiced like circus music.\" In the book's final poem, \"Cheese Penguin,\" Lindsay brings back one last explorer, who steals penguin eggs for science and accidentally leaves a red tin of cheese behind, from which evolves a penguin made of cheese. The narrator shrugs it off, saying, \"The world is large / and without a fuss has absorbed stranger things than this.\" With such comic understatements,Primate Behaviorat times reads like T.S. Eliot referencingBuffon's Natural Historyinstead ofThe Golden Bough.

Born in Owosso, MI, the youngest of four children, he left high school before graduation, but passed the entrance exam to the University of Michigan, where he enrolled in the English department and studied journalism. After two years, he quit college to become a reporter. In 1900, he sold his first story while working for the Detroit News-Tribune. By 1909 he had saved enough money to travel to the Canadian northwest, a trip that provided the inspiration for his wilderness adventure stories. The success of his novels afforded him the opportunity to return to the Yukon and Alaska for several months each year and allowed him to write more than thirty such books. He died at the age of 48 of an infection resulting from an allergic reaction to a spider bite. At least eighteen movies have been based on or inspired by Curwood's novels and stories including Jean-Jacques Annaud's 1988 film L'Ours, released in North America as The Bear which was taken from The Grizzly King.

(Nathaniel SteinNew Yorker blog2011-11-02)An absorbing, detailed account of books [Spacks] has reread over the years. (Fatema AhmedProspect2011-11-01)Patricia Meyer Spacks, who has taught literature at a number of distinguished colleges and universities over the past half-century--she is now the Edgar Shannon Professor of English Emerita at the University of Virginia--is something of a rarity among those who practice her trade these days: She reads for pure pleasure as well as for professional obligations, and she understands that pleasure is a legitimate, valuable goal in and of itself. Reading fiction has the power to expose one to large truths about human existence, but there is more to it than that...An excellent book. (Jonathan YardleyWashington Post2011-11-18)Spacks questions many of her past literary judgments with candor and harsh self-criticism, emphasizing that rereading explores \"new ground\" and is never dispassionate...An insightful and compelling book that will appeal to all fans of literature and students of literary theory. (Erica Swenson DanowitzLibrary Journal2011-12-01)A book remains the same through time, but the context and personality of the reader don't. Whether the consequence is nostalgia or embarrassment can be the luck of the draw. Some of the most interesting material inOn Rereadingconcerns the bewilderment that can occur upon revisiting a once-beloved work and finding that the thrill is gone. (Scott McLemeeInside Higher Ed2011-12-21)An interesting hybrid of literary criticism and memoir...Spacks' book, particularly her first chapter which I think is her best chapter, is worth the read if you've ever been interested in this question of why we read the same books over and over. But, fair warning, you'll probably feel the urge to pick up an old favorite as soon as you're done. (Aia A. HusseinAustenprose2012-01-21)Spacks is charming and pellucid in recounting her sense of why we reread a book and how frequently we find the experience a shock to our expectations. (Eric BanksBookforum2012-04-01)[A] remarkable meditation…Words such as 'joy,' 'enjoy' and 'pleasure' recur throughout the study; and while it might be refreshing in itself to hear such unfashionable words bandied about, Spacks's true achievement lies in her insistence that they belong in the same world as more rigorously analytical terms and ideas…The analysis of pleasure, the pleasure of analysis: the twinning of these qualities underlies the most illuminating chapters of On Rereading, in which Spacks revisits works that once bored or repelled her, and ones for which her initial enthusiasm may have been ephemeral. (Bharat TandonTimes Literary Supplement2012-04-13)[An] erudite and often surprising book...There is plenty to think about and argue with throughout this book...On Rereading brings a sharp, questing academic mind to its task. It is also deeply personal, honest, clear and engaging.

It is a 'must read' not just for graduate students, but for scholars across fields as Gerring gets to the core of what social scientists do. The bottom line is that readers reach a practical end, which is knowing what approach to use when and how to adapt based on the question posed.\" - Janet M. Box-Steffensmeier, Vernal Riffe Professor of Political Science, Courtesy Professor of Sociology, and Director of the Program in Statistics and Methodology, Ohio State University\"Gerring's book is simultaneously provocative and wise. It is the former in that it advocates for a unified (though not singular) social science methodology. It is the latter in the many ways it recommends that we think about and do science. On the one hand, Gerring has offered a compelling case for what unifies social science methodology. This should be debated for years to come. On the other hand, students of social science will benefit enormously by closely reading this sage volume. They will find particularly valuable his thorough, but nontechnical presentation of causal analysis.\" - Christopher Winship, Diker-Tishman Professor of Sociology, Harvard University\"The second edition presents a remarkable updating and expansion of Gerring's arguments and presentation.

From Wadell’s pen flows a rich fundamental moral theology that is a formative guide for virtuous Christian living. Once again Wadell demonstrates his skill as a masterful teacher and scholar by including important additions, clarifications, and explanations to the chapters of his original, dynamic, and compelling work.(Dawn M. Nothwehr, Catholic Theological Union)Reading Paul Wadell on the Christian moral life is like sharing a conversation with a wise and faithful friend. Through his graceful engagement of Augustine, Aquinas, and a host of contemporary Christian thinkers, Wadell reminds us that the quest for true happiness requires virtue, friendship, and an awareness of the stories that bind us. This second edition of an already superb book is theologically rich and deeply human. One cannot read Wadell without about being challenged and inspired.(Darin H. Davis, director, Institute for Faith and Learning, Baylor University)In this new edition, Paul Wadell has substantially improved what was already a very fine book. While maintaining an engaging and down to earth style throughout, Wadell ably leads readers toward a sophisticated Christian understanding of the relationship among freedom, happiness, and the cultivation of virtue. Theologically rich, yet accessible and clear,Happiness and the Christian Moral Lifewould serve very well as a foundational text for an introductory undergraduate course in Christian ethics.(Christopher P. Vogt, St. John’s University)Happiness and the Christian Moral Lifeprovides an extensive and wonderfully engaging introduction to deep thinking about the moral life. I have never read an introduction to Christian ethics which more warmly invites readers into the profoundly interconnected consideration of virtue, friendship, narrative, and happiness, or which more richly deserves a second edition. The welcoming tone and high precision with which we are invited by Paul Wadell to think about the Christian moral life as \"learning to be happy\" is effective in its approach and transformative in the challenging questions it poses to the reader. This second edition takes Wadell's masterful ability to draw one into bone-deep reconsiderations of ethics through new connections between virtue and narrative, temporal happiness and eschatological fulfillment, communities of friendship and moral development, infused virtues and the natural law, and vocation and daily life. Sitting at the feet of this gentle, confessional, contemplative, and humorous voice for ten chapters is an aesthetic experience, yet always insightfully tied to the daily practice of Christian discipleship.(Carter Aiken, Hasting College)This is a marvelous book, helpful for scholars, students and pastoral workers alike. Wadell brings the richness of the Catholic moral tradition to bear on the contemporary scene with clarity, enthusiasm and grace.Happiness and the Christian Moral Lifeis not merely a work of information, but an invitation to formation, an opportunity to think and feel deeply about the moral life as the locus of deepening our friendship with God.(Lisa Fullam, Jesuit School of Theology of Santa Clara University)Those of us who teach Christian Ethics are always looking for a new textbook that will cover the basics of our field. But if a student came to my office looking for a guide for the journey to the virtuous life, I would put a copy ofHappiness and the Christian Moral Life: An Introduction to Christian Ethicsin her hand, and I would know I had done her a real service. This is a book for the heart and mind yearning for the happiness that comes from becoming fully human.(Patrick T. McCormick, Gonzaga University, Spokane)Paul Wadell'sHappiness and the Christian Moral Lifeis the clearest and most accessible introduction to Virtue Ethics I know of. Wadell makes Augustine and Aquinas come to life in a beautiful, compelling way.(Joel James Shuman, King's College)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I would say there is more than just a little desire for fantasy fulfillment in me, which is probably why I enjoy reading erotica, but I also feel drawn to Sandy.

While Sandy has a goal to accomplish in her travels, as far as opening her own travel agency business after her year of touring Europe, the desire in me wishes she would be swept off her feet by a sexy Mr. or Sr. Right and live happily ever after in an exotic locale.", "related": ["B009Y7KU82"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The close-knit Wilkinson family unit is blown apart when Harry leaves Barbara, deserting the family home to start a new life in Spain with Margery.When Harry dies in strange circumstances, Margery does not know what to tell his family. His children want to evict her from the family home and the only weapon she has against them is the fact that she has recently discovered that, throughout their marriage, Harry and Barbara were keeping secrets from one another. Now that Margery has discovered the truth from an unexpected source, she has to decide whether to use this knowledge to save her home, knowing the devastation it would cause, or whether to let the past lie.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Moreover, the second edition expands our knowledge about organizational leadership, increases case studies and analyses, and examines the transactional processes within and between work groups. To be organizationally effective, social workers must learn how to astutely analyze and effectively participate in agency or organizational work groups.

Having hired thousands of employees over the past 20 plus years one can quickly see why certain individuals always seem to find good quality career positions while others struggle with being able to find any job.Several years back I had the pleasure of operating a large government contract that involved the training of unemployed and economically challenged individuals in career and job search skills. Following the information contained in this very book nearly all of these individuals found good quality career positions and are now moving their financial lives forward.Whether you are someone who has been unemployed for over one year, or just very recently been laid off, this book will help pave the way for a successful job search. It will also give you the tools to move your life in a more forward and future-focused direction than any other job search book that is on the market today.Follow the instructions in the book, stay the course, use all of the recommendations and there is no doubt in my mind you will become employed in a good career position much faster than if you did not follow the advice contained in Get Employed!Dave LaShier", "related": ["B00IFR18Q0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sacrificial and suffering, they devoted their lives to persecuted, demanding, and even tyrannical husbands. But most of these familiar and derivative stories have been told much better in major biographies: Joseph Frank’s Dostoevsky; A. N. Wilson’s Tolstoy; Popoff’s own Sophia Tolstoy, Brian Boyd’s Vladimir Nabokov, Stacy Schiff’s Véra, and Michael Scammell’s Solzhenitsyn. Popoff tends to whitewash the marriages, quoting, for example, Anna Dostoyevsky’s “I would not wish to change anything in it,” which ignores her husband’s epilepsy, gambling, and poverty—and their dead infant. The author also minimizes Tolstoy’s sexual revelations, fanatical religion, irresponsibility with money, intense jealousy, and final flight from Sophia. The Russian-born Popoff tends to be descriptive rather than analytical, and her English is often awkward and unclear. All the wives survived the writers and became keepers of the flame, who “wrote with one hand and wiped tears with the other.” For libraries striving to maintain extensive collections of literary biography. --Jeffrey Meyers", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Emily will be attending Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts in the fall where she plans to major in Elementary Education and Creative Writing.  'A Little Different' is Emily's second novel and the sequel to 'Right Where My Heart Should Be'. 'Right Where My Heart Should Be' and 'A Little Different' are both completely fictional and have no connection to Emily's life, although she feels a connection with the characters, which is why she's been able to put so much dedication into the making of the novel. Emily has two other novels, 'Identity,' which follows the same story as RWMHSB, but tells the story from different perspectives of characters and also offers more insight on characters' back stories, and \"Dear Elliot,\" a romance novel. Aside from writing, she has also always had a love for music, and plays violin, piano and guitar. She finds a lot of inspiration from music. Her family and friends are very important to her, and 'Right Where My Heart Should Be' and 'A Little Different' would not be possible without their love and support.

I began my love affair with cooking when I was very young. As soon as I could reach the counter top my mother gave me free reign in the kitchen. I was allowed to mix and mix and mix, building my masterpieces. They were nothing more that wild combinations of flour, sugar, spices and water, but to me it was creating at its best. When I finished with each endeavor, I tossed it all and happily cleaned up the kitchen, looking forward to the next time. My creative spirit in the kitchen had taken root.  My first adventure in writing came my senior year in high school when I decided to take a writing correspondence course, which was very forward-looking for the time. I experienced the first thrill of putting pen to paper, and all these years later it is still one of the most pleasurable activities in my life.  All my work is non-fiction. Even though I love fiction, it has never been my creative focus. My choice has always been and will continue to be to write about topics that interest and intrigue me and to share what I discover with my readers.", "related": ["B009ZP5JNO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 30.0}

He's a brilliant writer (a sort of anthropologist of his own life), a connoisseur of the human condition, a recovered alcoholic (with many misspent years behind him), an ultra-distance runner, and a rock musician. He's also completely incapable of making a relationship work. He likens a romance to a match between boxers who've taken off their gloves: \"You both need to lower your hands and stand there, completely vulnerable, easily damaged, both believing with all your hearts that the other person could never, would never, hurt you. And then they hurt you. And you hurt them.\" His most recent girlfriend deemed him terminally lonely, deeply unfulfilled, and a person who luxuriates in self-loathing. What does such a man do with his time? Mishka decides to become a contestant on3, CBS's dating reality show. If you've ever wanted to know what a reality show contestant goes through in audition, Mishka is your alacritous—yet slightly reluctant—guide. For viewers, these shows are emotional journeys, or a chance to gawk at another's life. For contestants, says Mishka, they are a landscape of humiliation and ersatz fulfillment. The question is, what will Mishka do if he lands a spot on the show? Get ready for another page-turning episode in the life of New York City's most prolific narcissist.--Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00J8HJW8C"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 14, "rating_average": 3.9286, "rating_total": 55.0}

It's a small book and so easily approachable,\nplus, the poems lend themselves to being read once or studied and\nwritten all over with your pencil. J. Aloysius also has helpful and\nsomewhat conversational annotations at the end of each poem. (The book\nis divided into two parts: half with the author's comments and half\nwithout, inviting you to make your own judgement as well as understand\nhow the poems came about or what their author says of them.) It's\nclear that the poet relishes the musicality of words and lends a\nbalanced importance to both the sound and the sense alike.My favorite poem is Contemplations I. Its beginning rolls off the\ntongue much in the style of its first word:Honeyed is the air where the spring rain's scent lingers.It's a short poem with many luxurious words, some of which I had never\nheard before or never heard in that context, 'as earth nailed clouds\ndew the scirocco/ all lay luxuriant for sieged souls.' The punch is\nwhen these expressive sounds come to a head, all at once the entire\nsense of the poem becomes clear as the poet breaks into simple verbs:\"to heed to hear to stop to wonder atthe heart to say 'how sweet is life today'\"I recommend this book to those interested in writing poetry in meter.\nJ. Aloysius does a great job of using the strength of sound and the\nclarity of speaking simply in this collection.\nDefinitely worth your time. Read the first half without annotations a\nfew times before you dip into the comments. And enjoy!M.

He published over two thousand sermons; his inspiring and challenging messages comprise the largest collection of work by a single author. Spurgeon preached to an estimated ten million people during his lifetime, including notables such as the prime minister of England, members of the royal family, and Florence Nightingale. He appealed constantly to his hearers to move on in the Christian faith, to allow the Lord to minister to them individually, and to be used of God to win the lost to Christ. In addition to his powerful preaching, Spurgeon founded and supported charitable outreaches, including educational institutions. His pastors' college, which is still in existence today, taught nearly nine hundred students in Spurgeon's time. He also founded the famous Stockwell Orphanage.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They have made major contributions to understanding the real, not purely theoretical, world that investors face every day. Gathering their seminal work in one place along with updated perspectives and overviews is a serious contribution.' Cliff Asness, AQR Capital Management'Over the past quarter century, the research contributions of Amihud, Mendelson, and Pedersen have been central to an understanding of the determinants and pricing of market liquidity and liquidity risk. This collection places the best available work on the topic between two covers. It must be read by anyone following this subject area.' Darrell Duffie, Stanford University'The liquidity of financial markets has never been a more important topic of research and policy and this book gives a very accessible way to understand both the traditional and current research. The book reproduces eight papers that range from the seminal work that defined the field starting in the 1980s to the recent research based on the analysis of the financial crisis. A particular feature of the book is the series of extended introductions to each of the papers, written nontechnically to summarize each paper and how it fits into future research - they will transport you to a first rate graduate classroom.' Robert Engle, Nobel Laureate and Director, Volatility Institute, New York University'The term 'market liquidity' means different things to different people at different times. Distinguishing, defining, and measuring the different meanings is an important activity, especially now, after four years of financial crises. This collection of scientific papers by eminent scholars is an important contribution to understanding market frictions and arrangements to manage them.' Thomas Sargent, Nobel Laureate, New York University'The authors have made substantial contributions in microstructure, and especially in the understanding of liquidity, for years. This collection of their best articles on liquidity is particularly timely given the growing realization of the macro pathology caused by a financial-crisis-induced recession. They present strong evidence that a liquidity spiral hurts post-recession real investment.'

Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans.

It brilliantly tackles the subject of bullying through the imaginative tale of its protagonist.  Seth is quite aware of his place in the social class of his school and the so-called \"packs.\"  He has nineteen hidden refuges, but, unfortunately, number seventeen is discovered, forcing Seth to flee.  A hidden entrance in a hedge propels him into a magical dimension, where he is befriended by a giant named \"El\" and initiates the journey of a lifetime. This short novel is an inventive tale offering tweens and young adults alike another way of responding to bullying.  The author presents a delightful, entertaining and heart-warming character who ultimately forms an unlikely friendship. Readers will be kept on the edge of their seats through the use of descriptive imagery and dialogue that keeps the story alive. Finding faith in God and inner strength is a theme explored throughout the book, offering perspective on courage.  This is a highly recommended read for those experiencing loneliness, change and/or bullying.  The book brilliantly displays that turning to the Lord is an extraordinary inner journey.\"  ~Christian Book Review", "related": ["B00K31USUS"], "rank": 1916190, "title": "The Jackal and the Giant (The Spirithaven Adventures Book 2)", "author": "Braden McElroy", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 22.0}

The book is marvelously illustrated by Milena Radeva, whose watercolors\nand color-pencil drawings make the author's ideas and imagery really come\nalive. The narrator of the story has decided to write about his friend Fred,\nand his teacher suggests he start thinking about words that express his friend\nand the things they do together. He thinks about a park they went to, and then\na dog they saw, and the fun they had there. Before he knows it, there's a whole\nstory just waiting to be told.Every so often, I come across a children's story that has me\nsmiling from ear to ear, literally. Terri Kelley's Brainstorming: It's Raining\nIdeas! is one of those books. Kelley introduces creative writing processes to\nchildren in a manner that's exciting and visual, and the illustrations of\nartist Milena Radeva work beautifully with the story. While the book is\nobviously geared to children, it's one of those books that could be on any\naspiring writer's bookshelf, perfect for those moments when the words just\ndon't seem to come and despair begins to set in. Take a moment to enjoy and see\nhow the incredible artwork meshes with the developing story-line, and you'll\nsee what I mean. What a great book this is!

The vast 'blank spaces' of the European imagination in fact sustained complex and ancient civilizations, whose peoples challenged even as they helped produce the explorers' knowledge of the world. (Marilyn Lake, co-author ofDrawing the Global Colour Line: White Men's Countries and the International Challenge of Racial Equality)Groundbreaking and deeply satisfying,The Last Blank Spacesprovocatively argues that the blank spaces on nineteenth-century maps of Africa and Australia actually represented the limits of western knowledge. This marvelous book delivers on the promise of the 'new imperial history' by providing a refreshingly original perspective on imperial power in the age of exploration. (Timothy Parsons, Professor of African History, Washington University in St. Louis)Nineteenth-century explorers did not merely discover the truths about landscapes and peoples they encountered; instead, as Dane Kennedy shows, they created new ways of knowing them, shaped as much by colonial realities as by metropolitan science. A masterful study of exploration. (Felix Driver, author ofGeography Militant: Cultures of Exploration and Empire)Kennedysorts through a far more complicated and messy history of 19th-century British exploration than the record has assumed, taking into account much failure as well as a deep reliance on indigenous help. The author asserts that the first British explorers of Australia and Africa looked to the vast continents much as the seafaring explorers had regarded the sea before them, as great unknown oceans, blank spaces to be 'measured, mapped, quantified, classified, catalogued, and compared.' ...Kennedy teases out a fascinating comparative study of Australian versus African exploration that takes into account the early British settlers' colonies in the former and the richly entrenched indigenous societies and forbidding disease environment in the latter...A wealth of research for the armchair traveler and historian. (Kirkus Reviews2013-01-15)Triumphalist narratives of European trailblazers leave out complexity and conflict, along with the contributions of indigenous peoples, according to this probing social history of 19th-century imperialist British exploration...Kennedyshrewdly dissects the ideology of exploration as the adventurous standard-bearer of progress and sets it against the record of British explorers confronting sophisticated, canny, contentious locals with their own agendas and formidable resources. These locals helped, thwarted, and sometimes even took command of European expeditions. Kennedy's erudite yet highly readable study restores much of the nuance and drama that has been airbrushed out of standard accounts of Western exploration. (Publishers Weekly2013-01-14)As a result ofKennedy's excellent analysis, we see more clearly what Australian exploration was, and what it was not. (Jim DavidsonThe Australian2013-03-09)Kennedy's analysis gains by acknowledging the courage of most explorers and the respect some held for the people whose lives they would change forever. He builds our understanding of their circumstances but less so of their longer-term importance in shaping the futures of two continents. The most significant thing about the explorersfrom Europe is that what they encountered became part of a new worldwide network of knowledge.(Stephen WilksCanberra Times2013-04-13)Considering Australia and Africa together enablesKennedyto dispel the fog of romance that still envelops the figure of the explorer and to make some cogent observations on imperialism, the organization of knowledge, nationalism, and the role of indigenous people in facilitating exploration. (Norman EtheringtonAustralian Book Review2013-06-01)[A] well-written, well-conceived book...[Kennedy] emphasizes what [19th-century British explorers] hoped to accomplish, the logistics involved, and especially their dealings with the indigenous people. (R. E. SchreiberChoice2013-07-01)With publication ofThe Last Blank Spaces,Dane Kennedyhas breathed new life into the well-worn narratives of explorers and exploration in Africa and Australia... Rather than simplification, Kennedy complicates both the process of exploration and the explorers engaged in it by reading primary sources against the grain, by avoiding and questioning heroic stereotypes, by looking for inferences and by examining discourse in a creative but controlled fashion. He writes engagingly and clearly, thus attracting both the savant and those with little detailed knowledge of the field...The differences and similarities of exploring these two continents and the men engaged in this activity are truly illuminating and make for fascinating reading...This book deserves a wide readership.(Jane CarruthersAustralian Historical Studies2013-09-01)It is a rare book that is scholarly, well-written, and accessible--while being enlightening and often fascinating. This is one such andDane Kennedyshould be congratulated…I found this book especially interesting in the accounts of the relationships explorers formed with their key guides and informants--who sometimes even helped plan the expeditions…Dane Kennedy gives human will and effort their due, accords the explorers their humanity, but shows how metropolitan outreach and conquest, followed by latter-day metropolitan nostalgia, are imperial. The terrains and societies they encountered were complex and difficult--not pure and pastoral, not arcadian. But, for the sheer complexity the explorers faced, and how they faced them, in looking at their immediacies, Dane Kennedy shows an astute soft spot.

The character development was great; it was easy to see exactly what they looked like. Their actions and comments were consistent with their characters. The black rain falling from the sky was particularly unsettling, for both the characters and the reader. The people who came into the diner to escape the rain comprised a vast cross-section of humanity, but they each had a secret. Toward the end of the story, their secrets were revealed by Joe, who somehow knew exactly what each of them had done. On top of all the action leading to the conclusion of the story, there were three or more unanticipated twists to add to the fun. Black Rain is a horror story I'd be happy to recommend to anyone who enjoys horror stories. Joshua Caine is a name to remember, and I will keep an eye out for anything else he may write.", "related": ["B00D476O38"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is committed neither to an ideological orthodoxy, whether neo-liberal or neo-Marxist,nor purely descriptive or historical. It is both theoretical and empirical, both firm and nuanced. This small book is worth a whole library of studies on nation-building, fragile states and foreign interventions.\"Survival\"An invaluable analysis which, in addition to imparting a deep insight into the complex nature of fragile states, gives a coherent historical framework which defines political trends in today’s era.\"LSE Politics Blog\"A very readable and practically oriented approach to understanding the issue of state fragility.\"Ethnopolitics\"A valuable contribution to the literature, analysing conflict and development in the modern era. The comprehensive historical information for each case study is of particular note, ensuring a clear and reasoned discussion of highly complex issues.\"Australian Journal of International Affairs\"The authors offer a concise and robust introduction to fragility without falling into the trap of oversimplification.\"Nationalities Papers\"An empirical triumph with policy relevance - truly unique in our field.\"George A. Lopez, University of Notre Dame\"Largely based on the analyses of selected country studies, this important investigation into the roots of state fragility brings out results which question the need for further development assistance and instead find arguments for changes in, for instance, farm policies of rich countries. Particularly noteworthy in this book is the inclusion of cases that have avoided the state fragility that has afflicted neighboring countries.

By reexamining our philosophical and psychological heritage, it traces a framework, a conceptual topology, that underlies the most disparate theories: a framework that presents imagination as founded in the placement of appearances. It shows how this framework was progressively developed by thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant, and how it is reflected in more recent developments in theorists as different as Peirce, Saussure, Wittgenstein, Benjamin, and Bachelard. The conceptual topology of imagination incorporates logic, mathematics, and science as well as production, play, and art. Recognizing this topology can move us past the confusions to a unifying view of imagination for the future. ​", "related": [], "rank": 2571337, "title": "Understanding Imagination: The Reason of Images (Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Book 33)", "author": "Dennis L Sepper", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Feldman still remembers those moments of being overwhelmed when he started college at Wesleyan University.  “I wondered whether I was up to the challenges that faced me,” he recalls, “and--although I never would have admitted it at the time--I really had no idea what it took to be successful at college.” That experience, along with his encounters with many students during his own teaching career, led to a life-long interest in helping students navigate the critical transition that they face at the start of their own college careers.  Professor Feldman, who went on to receive a doctorate in psychology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, teaches at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where he is Associate Dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences and Professor of Psychology.  He directs POWER Up for Student Success, the UMass first-year experience course for incoming students. Professor Feldman’s proudest professional accomplishment is winning the College Outstanding Teaching Award at UMass.  He also has been named a Hewlett Teaching Fellow and was Senior Online Instruction Fellow.  He has taught courses at Mount Holyoke College, Wesleyan University, and Virginia Commonwealth University. Professor Feldman is a Fellow of both the American Psychological Association and the Association for Psychological Science.  He is a winner of a Fulbright Senior Research Scholar and Lecturer award and has written some 100 scientific articles, book chapters, and books.  His books, some of which have been translated into Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Chinese, include Improving the First Year of College: Research and Practice, Understanding Psychology, 8/e, and Development Across the Life Span, 4/e.  His research interests encompass the study of honesty and truthfulness in everyday life, development of nonverbal behavior in children, and the social psychology of education.  His research has been supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute on Disabilities and Rehabilitation Research.   With the last of his three children completing college, Professor Feldman occupies his spare time with serious cooking and earnest, but admittedly unpolished, piano playing.  He also loves to travel.  He lives with his wife, who is an educational psychologist, in a home overlooking the Holyoke mountain range in western Massachusetts.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her adult life consist of many travels and various experiences which brought her to the place of writing this particular book based on what she realized is lacking in many relationships. As she listened intently to other females throughout her travels or just through moments of sharing noticed a common thread and that being a genuine friendship in which to share life events even if it only for a short while. Ms. Grey herself has longed for such a relationship and wondered what that type of relationship would entail. This is when she began seeking the Lord for answers to her many questions. One of Ms. Grey's passions is the fact that teaching is a part of everyday living and should be seized in each opportunity offered. Jesus used a simple method to teach His disciples not only about Him but also encouraged them to be confident in whom they were. Therefore, when we make it a point to fulfill \"Go ye therefore and teach all nations . . . \" we must do so with the simplicity and love following the example Christ left. You will notice the book does not call the main two women by name. Ms. Grey believes with leaving them nameless, allows anyone to visualize a personal interaction with friend/love ones making it a more personal experience as they read through the book. The book was meant to be simple, fun, but most importantly, taking time to share with those who hold significance to us. I believe Ms. Grey has accomplished just that as you will find out in some of the phrases used.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From adolescence to adulthood, his imagination continued to feed itself on a diet of books, movies, and art, all the while growing and maturing--waiting for its opportunity. Then, during a procession of monotonous, physically laborious day-jobs, his imagination leaped into motion, bringing together characters and locationsofa world that would someday come to life on the pages of a book. In late 1998, Jason made his first attempt at writing, managing to complete a whole scene before returning once again to reality. A year and a half later, a spontaneous night-time conversation with his wife encouraged him to take his writing seriously and to keep on dreaming. Over the next seven years, Jason carvedtimeout of the real world to live in an imaginary one of epic fantasy, science-fiction, and military/political conflict. The fruits of this labor would later become the first three books of the bestselling AWAKENED series. Due to the overwhelming support of readers around the world, Jason has continued his trajectory into make-believe, recently jumping from stable employment in the micro-electronics industry into the mysterious abyss of full-time writing. Living in Colorado with his beautiful wife and two children, Jason now spends the majority of his time fusing the best parts of his favorite genres into stories of internal struggle and triumph, friendship, betrayal, political alliances, and military conflict. If you'd like to follow along on Jason's journey or get behind the scenes info on the AWAKENED or WANDERING STARS series, you can find him on Facebook (jasontesar.com), Twitter (@jasontesar), on his blog (jasontesar.com), or send him an email at jasontesar@yahoo.com.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 4.875, "rating_total": 78.0}

It gives information about Honeybee, her home, family, food habits of bees, how they communicate etc. By the time the book is completed, children will have a thorough knowledge about Honeybee and everything related to bees. The colorful pictures convey the author's ideas with clarity to young readers. Children's story books are incomplete without pictures. The illustrations here capture the imagination of readers and attract them to read the story. Hopefully the next volumes in this series will see them increasing the learning value to a higher age group.This educational book has been presented in a manner that is very easy for children to comprehend. The book starts its details right from the beginning when Honeybee lays her eggs. The layout, the pictures, and the short sentences work extremely well with the targeted age group. The word list at the end of the book is very useful. Apart from children learning everything about Honeybees, this book also helps them to expand their vocabulary.The complete series would be an ideal collection for school and children's libraries. Parents can use this book as a bedtime story and teachers can use it for read-aloud sessions, as well as for reading in classrooms. It is a good book that is resourceful for teachers teaching in smaller classes. This book will be a pleasant experience for small children, both in content and pictures. An absolutely delightful book in which. the author has taken one topic and made it an appealing read for children.", "related": ["B00FR6E3GY"], "rank": 3100906, "title": "Science", "author": "Jeanette Vuuren", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Even better news: their main foe is again Mafia capo Sal Immordino, aided and abetted by his sister Cil, a nun. Sal, feigning madness in a New Jersey asylum, schemes to take over the Mistretta family and to eliminate Tozzi, the one person who knows he's not crazy. After a bloody--and funny--mob rub-out, Sal's plan slips when the attack on Tozzi fails. Helped by a corrupt asylum guard, Sal plans to make the hit himself and make a psychopathic young killer the scapegoat, but complications ensue when the psychopath's medication runs out. Meanwhile, Gibbons fights office politics (a female psychologist-agent is brought in over him) and Tozzi broods about nearing 40 and fears continuing impotence. The climax, set at a big Mafia funeral, is hilarious, and features a corpus ex machina. This series dazzles with fast, intricate plotting, terrific characters and humor: Cil, in full ecclesiastical drag, \"turned into a nun, a real nun, like the ones Sal remembered from Catholic school. Brutal.\" Only the FBI won't like this one.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00KL13WXK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

SUSPENDED tells how a woman overcame obstacles and learned Life Lessons in the process. One such story tells how she died in a medical emergency and lived to tell about her experience. Dying helped her learn how to live. When Koko read her own words in that book, she began to notice subliminal messages that made her feel quite uncomfortable. That lead to her next book entitled, THE LIE, in which she learned about a deep, dark family secret. TRUTH BEYOND THE LIE not only explains how Koko came to grips with the unknown truth; it also explores how intuition and awareness played a huge part in that discovery. Her light-hearted collection of down home short stories in the very popular book, BEANS AND GREENS, presents fun and touching tales about unique southern foods and traditions. She invites readers to \"put your feet up and relax while you read tales that will make your mouth water and your heart sing.\" For those grandparents who are separated from their little ones, Koko offers a delightful story called NANA IN A BOX, as a way to send long-distance love to precious children. Now, she introduces you to fictional psychic characters in her Metaphysical Murder Mysteries. The group of friends live a double existence, trying to balance family life with the paranormal occurrences that happen on a regular basis. To them, operating in both worlds is perfectly normal. The stories are filled with a lot of humor, mystery and suspense, with chapter and section titles cleverly joining in the fun.", "related": ["B00I4A380M"], "rank": 4134956, "title": "Mystic Birth (Metaphysical Murder Mysteries Book 2)", "author": "Koko Nervelli", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She gains the love and\naffection of an older woman, Rebecca Garland, who wants Hattie to marry\nher son, Abner. Rebecca is planning to leave all her wealth to Hattie,\nbypassing both her son and husband.This of course leads to deception and betrayal, something to be expected when lives are turned upside down.The difficulties that Hattie goes through show how determined she can be and that she must continue on no matter what happens.According to the author, this story is loosely based on his family history.My take: This is a good story for those who like romances based on some\ntruth, a bit of history and some legends, a book filled with rich\nsettings and culture that is very character-driven.By Pam BrewerIdaho Statesman", "related": [], "rank": 1288321, "title": "Forced to Love (Historical Romance Series) (The Fires of Love & Hate Book 1)", "author": "Sky Alexander", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.7143, "rating_total": 33.0}

Penn, New York Times and USA Today Bestselling author of the ARKANE thriller series  Therapy for Ghostsreview: \"Eric Praschan's book comes with an amusing premise, charting the meltdown of Cindy James, a cognitive behavioral therapist, who is in critical need of...cognitive behavioral therapy. The story quickly turns serious, as Praschan explores her tortured psyche, leading us to the unimaginable trauma that keeps her imprisoned, like a ghost, in a house already haunted by her childhood tormentors. Judging from the crackling dialogue between Cindy and Tony, the therapist who loves and helps her, Praschan is well versed in the challenges of the doctor-patient duet. This is a fine and well-written psychological thriller. And I am partial to any male author who seeks - and succeeds - to create a full-dimensioned woman narrator.\" -Sarah Kernochan, 2-time Oscar-winning screenwriter of \"What Lies Beneath\" and author of Jane Was Here", "related": ["B00K8EV4Y4"], "rank": 687941, "title": "The James Women Trilogy Box Set", "author": "Eric Praschan", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
