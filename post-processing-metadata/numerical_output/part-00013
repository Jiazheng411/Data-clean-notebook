Such is the case with this remarkably researched history of the Guggenheims. Pulitzer Prize–winner Irwin Unger (The Greenback Era) and his wife, Debi (coauthor, with Irwin, ofLBJ: A Life), assemble an extraordinary collection of letters, interviews, memos and contemporary documents to tell the story of the family's rapid rise and slow decline, a saga marked by a combination of \"profound Americanism\" and Jewish \"old world heritage.\" The sheer size of the Guggenheim family—the Ungers note that the \"legion\" descendants of Meyer (1828–1905), the family patriarch, are \"impossible\" to follow through time—means that no one member of the clan stands out, though the feisty Harry, \"fighting entropy\" in the family for much of the 20th century, burns brighter than many of his relatives. The scintillating Peggy Guggenheim, known for her patronage of modern art and her robust sex life, gets ample play here, but her story is told more thoroughly in recent biographies by Anton Gill and Mary Dearborn. Readers looking for a broad, appetizing sweep of American life will find it here, but those hungry for sharp, burning flavors may skip to the next course. 16-page b&w photo insert not seen byPW.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Christopher systematically describes Jordan's career, starting in high school and following through his college, Olympic, and professional days (with the stop off at baseball). The book ends with the Bulls' loss to Orlando in the 1995 season playoffs. Those familiar with the athlete's career will probably already know some of the anecdotes covered in this book. For example, there's the oft-repeated fact that Jordan didn't make the varsity basketball squad in his sophomore year in high school, and his trials as a minor league baseball player are common knowledge. Yet, many fans will find this clearly written title among the most satisfying of all of the Jordan biographies. Although the author mentions controversies involving his subject's gambling and the tragedy of his father's murder, he recognizes that what many sports fans want is the highlights of players' careers and meaty descriptions of their key games.

Photographs of buildings, diagrams, and period art tie in well with the text. Though the focus is specialized, Stalley's book is inviting to both students and general readers.

Nicholson's alternating narrative is split three ways. In the present day, on a transcontinental flight to Los Angeles, Dr. Henry Cadwallader and his budding actress daughter, Dorothy, encounter (and revive) panic-stricken auteur Rick McCartney, who is hoping to get Hollywood to back his production of a movie about the dodo. At the center of Rick's screenplay is William Draper, a 17th-century Oxford University student obsessed with the acquisition and procreation of the bird. As Draper's life story unfolds, so does Henry's L.A. house-hunting and his lust for a sociable real estate agent, Barbara Scott. When Dorothy's acting prospects dwindle, Henry catches the talent agent's eye and decides to try his hand at acting, even though he's much embittered by Hollywood and its formulaic movie treatments. All of this nonsensical wackiness peaks at a mock-Tudor house that Rick has borrowed to produce both a porn movie and his long-awaited dodo film that he's persuaded Henry to star in. Nicholson's transparent characterizations unfortunately aren't strong enough to translate all the rampant silliness into hearty belly laughs, even with the poolside guest appearance of a mechanical dodo. Based on a clever concept that never quite gels, this doesn't reach the giddy heights of previous Nicholson black comedies likeBleeding LondonandBedlam Burning.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Vietnam vet, cofounder ofNew England Monthlyand a media consultant, Nylen, who died last year, shares with punchy humor and tremendous grace his tough approach to taking risks and staring down exacting bosses as well as cancer. Cherishing such stoical role models as Don Quixote and Ulysses S. Grant (as well as his own father, who spent his prime years as a DuPont executive before a traumatic fall altered his life permanently), Nylen celebrates America's admiration with gutsiness, and his own lifetime attempts (frequently foolish) to make the Cool Guys Hall of Fame. The bulk of this memoir is Nylen's facetious though moving account of his stint as an infantry officer in Vietnam in 1968, and the men he loved and lost—the ghastly experience, he assures readers, was never accurately depicted in popular movies. Shell-shocked, married after release from the army, simulating a normal person and appearing unemployable, he began his accidental career as a media ad salesman starting atLookmagazine, dealing with tough bosses like Bill Dunn atU.S. News and World Reportand Mike Levy atTexas Monthlybefore embarking on his own. Diagnosed with colorectal cancer stage III when he was 60, he endured treatments, surgeries, pain and frequent accidents of his own making, but preserves his cheerful, frank, optimistic and ever competitive spirit in the face of mortal adversity.(July)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the second volume of Pathos there is more blood, sex, and passion. Whew!Ace is now eighteen and graduated from high school. He has made the decision to become a vampire to become closer to J. King is not too fond of the idea, but J wants to become one with his lover. Once Ace becomes a vampire, he goes overboard. Soon a rivalry breaks out between King and Ace for J's affection. The way the score is settled is King steps into the sunlight, and quickly burns to ashes. J and Ace are taken aback and soon J retreats into a comatose type state, leaving Ace to fend for himself. Will Ace be able to bring J back to the land of the living (metaphorically speaking of course)?This series is a surprise for me. I love Juné with a passion. One thing I've noticed, they have the tendency to play things safe. After having read both volumes of Pathos, this is a huge step they've taken. Pathos is a dark, bloody, and lustful series. No playing it safe with this title, and I must say Bravo! I have never really been into vampires. For someone who loves classic literature I've never read Dracula by Bram Stoker. Nosferatu was one of the most hilarious pieces of film I've ever seen. I couldn't get into Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I've never read the Twilight series. Vampires just don't interest me. Yet Pathos drew me into the world of Ace, J, and King. I found it interesting that once you become a vampire your fangs now take the place for fulfilling your sexual desires. Whether that is vampire lore, or something from Sadahiro-sensei's imagination, it's pretty wild.Not only was the story riveting but Mika Sadahiro-sensei's art is absolutely stunning. You are able to differentiate between all of the characters. Everything is so lushly drawn and you can tell that sensei has taken great care to illustrate this amazing story. My only complaint is still King's hair. It seriously looks like his hair is channeling Brian May (Queen)/Roger Daltry (the Who)/Robert Plant (Led Zeppelin). It really is quite frightening. Other than that, I have no other complaints.Not only did Juné make an inspired choice on publishing Pathos, but this book is GORGEOUS! I just about passed out when I saw the cover. J and Ace look so exceptionally hot that I need a to take a cold shower just looking at it. Like the first volume, the second volume is wrapped in a matte dust jacket. It seems to give it a classier, more adult look. Good job Juné!I wholeheartedly recommend this series, but be aware that this is pretty hardcore stuff. It defintely earns its M rating. Juné made a wise decision with this title. Just remember, remember, remember that this is a very risqué manga. You may not get the sex you have come to expect from yaoi manga but nonetheless it is very sexually charged. --Manic About MangaIt makes me far too happy to be able to hold a copy of a work by Sadahiro in my hot little hands. She's one of the artists that I swore up and down that we would never see in this country. Now, I'm pretty sure that we're still never going to see stuff like Rub in Love or Under Grand Hotel over here, but at this point, I will be very happy to be proved wrong!As I stated in my review for Pathos 1, part of the beauty of this series is that it's really not graphic at all. Vampires can't get it up, so they get their sexual release from drinking blood. What makes this series unbelievably filthy is the subject matter and how Sadahiro handles it.Come on! It's vampires! By their very nature, it's erotic. Throw in a heavy dose of melodrama, teenage angst, jealousy and you get something that's greater than the sum of its parts. Is it cheesy at times with that heavy dose of melodrama? You bet. Am I complaining? Not a chance in hell.At the end of the first book, King made a deal with Ace. If he waits four years before coming home again, until he's eighteen, King will not stand in the way of J and Ace's affair. So, Ace returns from his exile to awaken his brothers from their sleep and to see if he can be brought over to join them. J and Ace then spend the next few days doing the vampire equivalent of screwing each other blind until their carelessness leads to J being injured.King then rejects Ace's bid to become a vampire. Well, Ace isn't going to stand for that, so he forces King's hand and kills himself. Surprise, surprise, they end up bringing Ace over to save him. Now the question is, is there room for King in the obsessive relationship that Ace and J have forged or is their love going to destroy all three of them.I want more quality stuff like this from June. They've shown us what they're capable of and it's not just school boys. --Boys Next DoorAce Clayton was adopted by the handsome, bestselling author, King Clayton. Ace lived a life of leisure and luxury with his adopted brothers, King and his aloof lover, the arrogant J, who taunted Ace, using all the guile he used to seduce male lovers. King and J are also vampires. J's harassment and teasing of Ace only caused the boy confusion, so King sent Ace to a private boarding school until he turns 18.As Pathos, Vol. 2 opens, Ace has finished school. He s also 18 and can't wait to get back to his meet his brothers. They've been asleep for four years, waiting for the day Ace returns. Now, that Ace is back, he doesn't want things to go back to being the way they were before he was sent away to boarding school. He's ready to become J's lover ...forever, and that means Ace wants to be a vampire. Will his brothers grant him his wish, and will it really mean happily ever after?THE LOWDOWN: I find that Pathos reads almost as if it's a romance novel/historical fiction. Not only does the complete story span centuries; it also feels timeless, as love stories are want to do. Like many romance novels, Pathos story is filled with engaging characters and rich characterization; Ace, King, and J are decidedly different, but creator Mika Sadahiro makes the trio fit in a way that makes for a fine story. Also, like many special tales of romance, Pathos is marked by both searing passion and shocking tragedy, which Sadahiro presents in a way that will have readers racing through this book.Sadahiro's visual storytelling features compositions that are practical in terms of storytelling and lean, but potent in terms of the visual language of yaoi manga. Her draftsmanship features clean, elegant line work that is sparse in toning and shadows (compared to what's found in many manga). Fancy design work and decorations (flowers and patterns) are used only when a moment in the story really needs it, which makes those moments that much more potent.POSSIBLE AUDIENCE: Fans of supernatural yaoi will find Pathos to be an exceptional series that is not to be missed. --Comic Book Bin", "related": ["B00725D7S8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In part one, he explains how, as a young playwright in need of extra work, he got involved in math tutoring and was dismayed by traditional teaching methods. Part two of the JUMP approach gives specific problem-solving examples on such topics as fractions, multiplication and division, ratios and percents, and logic. The emphasis is on providing a support system and building the student’s confidence and self-esteem. Patience and time are the keys to success, not standardized tests. Though he doesn’t belong to the education establishment, Mighton has recently been able to get his program tested in three West Virginia schools.

Criss-Cross drew me into the Psy-Cop world and wouldn't let me go until the end. Yes, Vic and Jacob have wonderfully hot sex, but there's also mystery and intrigue and a roller coaster ride of a story, which ties up most of the loose ends but leaves just enough for another story (which I hope the author is writing...).

He spent 1 year as a DAAD scholar studying International Politics and Business at the Johann Wolfgang von Goethe University of Frankfurt and 1 year as a Monbusho scholar in International Relations at the International University of Japan in Niigata. He then joined FACT Communications in Tokyo, where he oversaw interactive marketing projects for clients such as Heineken, IBM, and Unilever and was recognized with a Japanese Webby award for his work. In addition to executing one of the first email marketing campaigns in Japanese Internet history, he was co-chair of the Ecommerce special interest group at the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. Returning to the US, Jeremy joined Snickelways Interactive in New York City, a leading e-commerce development firm and was instrumental in growing the business from 20 to 150 employees. His clients included Tumi luggage, Rand McNally, and WebLoyalty.  Upon the burst of the dot-com bubble, Jeremy raised over $500k in private financing for an Internet start-up, SilentFrog, a marketplace for services. The company existed for 2 years, was mentioned in the WSJ and Washington Post and generated revenue...but, alas, not enough profit. Moving back to his native Washington, DC, he joined Microsoft where, over the course of an almost 6 year career, Jeremy implemented numerous scalable community building (and revenue generating) programs. His efforts were recognized as US-wide best practices and he authored one of Microsoft s most successful marketing blogs with over 110,000 views per month. Since leaving Microsoft, he has signed contracts with a number of clients including Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft, Yes To Carrots, NYT best-selling author, Dan Pink and #1 New York Times best-selling author, Gretchen Rubin. A passionate technologist, Jeremy prides himself as early adopter with email (1991), a personal home page (1992), and blogging (2000).

Throughout his scholastic career, he wanted nothing more than to tell a good story, get a few laughs or give a few frights. After high school, he joined the US Navy and spent the next four years serving the country in the fighter training squadron VT-86 out of Pensacola, Florida. In college, he majored in Environmental Science and Geography with a minor in Geology and ended up with a teaching certificate for Secondary Earth Sciences. After one year of teaching fourteen and fifteen-year-olds, his desire to inspire young minds was laid to rest and he took up a position serving the State of Texas in the Correctional Field. In his spare time, he has produced over thirty novels which are currently being published in Kindle format as well as paperback at a much slower pace. His one aim is to entertain the reader with a good tale and hope that they may get something more from his work than just a laugh, a fright or a sigh.", "related": ["B00APKQH7K"], "rank": 1916167, "title": "The Red Cross of Gold XXI", "author": "Brendan Carroll", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book would be an excellent reference for the casual model builder that just wants to expand their capabilities in displays, or to the more advanced builder that wants to move into dioramas.

The second half of the book is devoted to a gallery of the works of some of the author's friends and those of some more well known modelers.

Combining prominent names such as Luisa Valenzuela, Elena Poniatowska and Allende with others little known outside their home countries, this anthology shows off the wealth of fiction being written today by Latin American women. Editor Correas de Zapata, a San Jose State University professor of Hispanic literature, has chosen stories from around the continent and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. Brazilian author Clarice Lispector's \"Looking for Some Dignity\" is a bracing tale of an elderly women's creeping senility and waning sense of self. A number of stories, such as \"Sophie and the Angel,\" by Cuba's Dora Alonso, about an old widow visited by an angel playing an electric guitar, show that Latin American men don't hold the patent on magic realism. Others, such as \"Cloud Cover Caribbean,\" by Ana Lydia Vega of Puerto Rico, are firmly in the realist tradition; in this case, a refugee boat heading toward Miami founders because of the mutual mistrust of the passengers. If there's a flaw, it's that the sheer number of authors-31 in all-coupled with the brevity of each selection make it difficult for individual voices to stand out. The editor clearly favors breadth over depth, showcasing as many writers as possible in this appealing smorgasbord.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Based on an actual event, this novel faithfully renders its place and time. The thick Southern heat, and the absolute, unequal balance between whites who mark the social boundary lines and blacks who stay within them in order to survive, make it possible to believe that the few words spoken by Linus Bragg, the scared-silent, 14-year-old black boy who is executed for the crime, could be fatally twisted to mean more than the child who spoke them had ever intended. Forty-four years later, James Willop, an unemployed New Jersey newsman, goes to Alcolu to dig for the truth behind his Uncle Linus's death. He finds the town superficially changed, but when two more murders occur Willop has reason to fear that the same deadly racist tensions running beneath the surface could drag him under as well. Stout, an editor at the New York Times, has produced an accomplished, sadly evocative novel, only slightly marred by loose ends and a somewhat blustery tone in its second half.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 2006, he moved to Arizona to pursue a 200 hour yoga certification at the Seven Centers in Sedona.  This 30 day intensive study changed his life.  In 2009, he opened Peaceful Roots, a Therapeutic Yoga and Holistic Fitness center in Phoenix, AZ., allowing him to finally walk his path.    In 2011, he took his passion and skills to Portland, OR.  Just as he knows there is more than one avenue to a fully lived life, his life experience has taught him the many ways to achieve harmony and peace.  He hopes this book will point you in the direction of your happiness. “Feeling better all starts with changing your mind.  Life is full of amazing adventures, a continual process unfolding to us moment by moment.  There are many paths to full liberation and each of us creates his own path.  We take the best of everything we have learned from the various places we have touched upon, and walk the path that works for us.  No one path is better than another for they all lead us to the same place.  When we use yoga and meditation to help us along that path, the path becomes clearer every moment of every day.” Be Happy.  Be Peaceful.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

(February 21, 1877, Auch, France – February 15, 1964, Rome) was a Catholic theologian and, among Thomists of the scholastic tradition, is generally thought to be the greatest Catholic Thomist of the 20th century. Outside the ranks of Thomists of that sort, his reputation is somewhat more mixed. He taught at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, commonly known as the Angelicum, in Rome from 1909 to 1960. Father Garrigou-Lagrange initially attracted attention when he wrote against the theological movement later called Modernism. He is also said to be the drafter or \"ghostwriter\" of Pope Pius XII's 1950 encyclical Humani Generis, subtitled \"Concerning Some False Opinions Threatening to Undermine the Foundations of Catholic Doctrine.\" He is best known for his spiritual theology. His magnum opus in the field is The Three Ages of the Interior Life, in which he propounded the thesis that infused contemplation and the resulting mystical life are in the normal way of holiness of Christian perfection. This influenced the section entitled \"Chapter V: The Universal Call to Holiness in the Church\" in the Second Vatican Council's Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, Lumen Gentium. He taught many eminent Catholic theologians during his academic career, the most illustrious being the future Pope John Paul II, of whom he said \"Writes much; says little.\" He is also known to have introduced Thomism to fellow theologian and priest Yves Congar, an expert on historical theology who became a Cardinal.", "related": ["B003HC9APE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She inherited from her mother, María Martínez Chávez, her indigenous features and indomitable spirit.Her journey from the remote village of Las Limas, in Honduras to Boston, Massachusetts, in the early 1960s gave Cándida false hope of a newfound freedom. However, she soon discovered that her cultural and religious fall-out did not exclusively belong to Honduras, and she predictably faced countless challenges and obstacles in her new homeland. Nevertheless, in the midst of tremendous struggles, she was able to be a loving wife and raised four children.Having to overcome language and cultural barriers, Cándida's family and friends proudly witnessed her transformation from a timid young lady with only an elementary school education to a highly educated and confident woman. She obtained a master's degree in Spanish literature from Boston College and had an accomplished career as a teacher for Boston Public Schools. She received numerous awards for her excellence and dedication and has appeared in several newspapers, including theNew York Times.The writing of her life story is the fulfillment of a personal dream and an inspiration to all.

During the hundred years\nbefore that, various parts of India were annexed and administered by the East\nIndia Company which filled a power\nvacuum created by the collapse of the Moghul empire.War came to the trading ports of the Bay of Bengal,\nalliances were formed with various local leaders and conflict was carried\ninexorably into the interior. One of the\nforemost names associated with the Anglo-French disputes in India at this time\nwas Robert Clive, who did much to prevent India from becoming French. Clive\nwent out to India as a humble clerk, and the story of his transformation into\nthe most successful soldier of his time is astonishing. He was certainly not a paradigm of\nselflessness. As a young man, he worked\nas a clerk for the East India Company.Fortunately, for him, war broke out - otherwise he would have died young\nand poor. War gives people an\nopportunity to excel and there are many examples of people who are good at war\nand make a name for themselves. Clive\nwas the right man at the right place and the right time. He was probably not a particularly nice\nperson and might have been a gang leader in another world, but he was a great\nfigure in military history not a faultless messiah and he did what he was good\nat.The Flint family are fiction but there would have been\nplenty of people around engaged in doing the same kind of things that I have\nthem doing in Talwar. All the Moghuls,\non the other hand, are real, as are all the battles, and all the political\nmachinations described in the novel are as close as possible to what actually\nhappened. Anyone so minded can track\ndown the various facets of my work and find the origins and primary source\nmaterial that I used to construct the narrative.Thematically, Talwarexplores the clash between pre- and post-Enlightenment modes of\nthought. Beyond that, is there a message\nfor today in the book? Yes. I believe that the \"then\" illuminates the \"now\",\nand that those who remain unaware of our history are like people who have no\nmemory. They are doomed to repeat their mistakes. Also, it's good to correct\nsimple-minded misconceptions about how British control of the Indian\nsubcontinent arose, and why.I want my readers to enjoy their visit to the past. If a\nstory of love and war against a backdrop of the history appeals to you, if you\nwant to see how people meet circumstances beyond their control and, by their\nactions, fashion the turning points of history, then come along. When you finish reading every one of my books\nI want you to feel that you have visited a place you'd like to return to.", "related": ["B00APKQH7K"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Later in life, he also wrote plays and essays. His two most famous works, the novels War and Peace and Anna Karenina, are acknowledged as two of the greatest novels of all time and a pinnacle of realist fiction. Many consider Tolstoy to have been one of the world's greatest novelists. Tolstoy is equally known for his complicated and paradoxical persona and for his extreme moralistic and ascetic views, which he adopted after a moral crisis and spiritual awakening in the 1870s, after which he also became noted as a moral thinker and social reformer. His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him in later life to become a fervent Christian anarchist and anarcho-pacifist. His ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You, were to have a profound impact on such pivotal twentieth-century figures as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At the time of his death in March of 1970, in Ventura, California, Gardner was \"the most widely read of all American writers\" and \"the most widely translated author in the world,\" according to social historian Russell Nye. The first Perry Mason novel, The Case of The Velvet Claws, published in 1933, had sold twenty-eight million copies in its first fifteen years. In the mid-1950s, the Perry Mason novels were selling at the rate of twenty thousand copies a day. There have been six motion pictures based on his work and the hugely popular Perry Mason television series starring Raymond Burr, which aired for nine years and 271 episodes.As author William F. Nolan notes, \"Gardner, more than any other writer, popularized the law profession for a mass-market audience, melding fact and fiction to achieve a unique blend; no one ever handled courtroom drama better than he did.\"Richard Senate further sums up the significance of Gardner?s contribution: \"Although the character of Perry Mason is not unique as a 'lawyer-sleuth,' he is the first to come to anyone's mind when it comes to sheer brilliance in solving courtroom-detective cases by rather unconventional means. Besides 'Tarzan,' 'Sherlock Holmes,' 'Superman' ? 'Perry Mason' qualifies as an American icon of popular culture in the twentieth century.\"Gardner's writing has touched a lot of people including a number of high profile figures. Brian Kelleher and Diana Merrill say in their 1987 book, The Perry Mason TV Show Book that Harry S. Truman was a fan and that it is rumored that when Einstein died, a Perry Mason book was at his bedside. They further describe that when Raymond Burr met Pope John XXIII, the actor reported that the pontiff \"seemed to know all about Perry Mason.\" Federal judge Sonya Sotomayor frequently mentions how Perry Mason was one of her earliest influences.Starting with his first book, Gardner had a very definite vision of the shape the Perry Mason character would take:\"I want to make my hero a fighter,\" he wrote to his publisher, \"not by having him be ruthless to women and underlings, but by creating a character who, with infinite patience jockeys his enemies into a position where he can deliver one good knockout punch.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I immigrated to Africa with my parents when I was 5, completed my studies and graduated as a Mechanical Engineer in the University of Lagos.I got married to my University sweetheart and returned to the United Kingdom in 1986 to complete my postgraduate training at Goldsmith University.For the next 13 years I taught Electronics and Design & Technology; after which I established Dynamic Words Discipleship College (a training institute for Christians who want to deepen their walk with God. My wife and I presently lead The King's House - (aka London's Alive Church).I have written several inspirational books, manuals and training materials, and continue to give my services as a marriage counsellor and motivational coach.How long have you been writing? I wrote and published my first book in 1985 after my wife and I had a traumatic experience at the birth of our first child. So I think it is fair to say that I started writing seriously in 1985.Tell us about your book. Ten Keys to Effective Communication in Marriage (like most of my books) is designed to help people get a hold of their Communication challenges. As Communication failure is one of the main reasons for marriage and relationship failure, I deal with 10 simple things couples can do to improve their Communication and the relationship.What made you write this book? My wife and I had a turbulent relationship when we first got together, but have since both learnt to slow down, grow up and draw closer. Now, we have an awesome marriage and a desire to help other experience what we have. That's why I have been writing books onmarriage and relationshipfor years.  Some of my other books include:HOW TO BUILD A ROCK SOLID MARRIAGE, TEN KEYS TO EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION IN MARRIAGE, HOW TO RESCUE YOUR MARRIAGE FROM BREAKING UP, UNDERSTAND YOUR MARRIAGE VOWS, MAXIMISING YOUR SEASON OF SINGLENESS, and SAY GOODBYE TO DATING.Was it easy for you to write or did you ever get writers block? I find it fairly easy to write from my heart. And, I've learnt to take a break and find something else to do when I experience writers block.What age is your target for this book? I'd say the book is targeting anyone in a serious relationship - from 16 and upward.Have you always seen yourself as becoming a writer? No. I studied Engineering precisely because I preferred figures and making things instead of writing or reading long prose. But I love teaching, and one way to get my message across is to write.Do you write full-time or do you have another job as well? I have a full time job as a minister - shepherding people. I am the principle of a Dynamic Words Discipleship College. And, I teach & lecture in my spare time.How long did it take you to finish this book? Not very long! I don't like fat padded books myself. So when I write, I like to keep it simple, precise and to the point. When I need to use stories, I keep them to a minimum. I leave the waffle to language majors.Do you have a Facebook fan page or Twitter account for your fans to follow you on?You can find me on face book:facebook.com/apeters60", "related": ["B007SO8LP2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They affectionately describe Montserrat as an authentic island experience. It's a place where they meet interesting people, can truly relax and hear themselves think, are continuously fascinated by the island's unique history, and marvel in the presence of the majestic Soufriere Hills Volcano. In Canada, Angie has worked as a television producer and radio news reporter, and currently operates a video production company.

Space is a dimension that has gone unnoticed under the hegemony of the Heilsgeschichte in theology, and Westhelle reveals why it is necessary to discover the importance of the tangential space of the border, the margin, the desert, the stranger, the eschaton (because the latter is also space: \"The Promise Land\"): the eutopia. Along the way he examines the themes of exteriority, foreignness, colonialism, and the space of the Other as periphery, with domination as the center. From the classic theology, theology of liberation, and the postcolonial up to G. Agamben, J. Taubes and W. Benjamin, the author covers several histories to give importance to choratic eschatology. We from the South and oppressed exteriority salute this pioneering work!\" - Enrique Dussel, Emérito UAM-Iztapalapa /Mexico city\"Eschatology and Space is the best book on theology that I've read in the past ten years. Westelle is right: starting with experience and vulnerability as spaces for divine revelation, he builds towards a new vision of eschatology in which salvation and condemnation are not only topics to ponder but rather realities that are already alive.\" - Elsa Tamez, professor at Latin American Biblical University, researcher at Ecumenical Department of Investigation (DEI), Costa Rica\"This is Westhelle at his best! Westhelle overturns the near-absolute priority given to time over space in Christian eschatological thinking, demonstrating that such opposition is not biblical, but rather the outcome of a particularly western view of history. He makes the biblically and theologically persuasive case for 'latitudinal' eschatological categories such as crossing and place that can speak to migrants, the landless and all who experience the eschata at the margins today.\" - Barbara Rossing, author of The Rapture Exposed: The Message of Hope in the Book of Revelation\"Until now Christian eschatology has been interpreted only in terms of its temporal dimension. Vitor Westhelle has undertaken a remarkably creative rethinking of this in terms of its spatial dimension through the effective deployment of post-colonial and post-structuralist perspectives. The book will be indispensable for all who are interested in understanding eschatology and exploring new possibilities of eschatological meaning.\" - Ted Jennings, professor of Biblical and Constructive Theology, Chicago Theological Seminary", "related": [], "rank": 2018329, "title": "Eschatology and Space: The Lost Dimension in Theology Past and Present", "author": "V.

Bauer presents multiple points of view, listing the many names the war has been called, discussing how battle names varied in the North and the South, and providing a succinct but instructive explanation of why the war began. She strikes a balance between major historical points and intriguing details that will maintain interest. Many particulars of ordinary life, such as uniforms, food, pastimes, and medical care, humanize the conflict. The information is realistic but not harsh, and it maintains an age-appropriate tone. The text and images, which complement and expand upon each other, include Caucasian and African-American men, women, and children. No mention is made of Native American involvement.

At the age of forty six, after twenty five years working as a management consultant primarily in the Central Government sector, Ian gave it all up to concentrate on his writing. His first book, an historical novel, 'The First King of England', published under the name IVR Davison, is set in the 10th century and took over two years to research and write. Ian had given up history at school at the age of thirteen but has always been fascinated by the period of English history known as the Dark Ages. His second book, a murder mystery, 'Murder at the murder', published under the name Ian VR Davison and currently available on Kindle, was based on an idea he originally conceived over fifteen years before it was finally written. The notes sat on a dark shelf gathering dust but he always knew that one day he would find the time to write it. Once restarted he completed the first draft of this novel in just over a month. He is currently working on a second murder mystery novel with his regular detectives Alan and Becca Foreman and he is also in the early stages of planning his next historical novel which will follow on from his first novel looking at the period after King Athelstan's death up to the millenium (1000AD).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although they follow a definite pattern (as is the case with episode's)\neach episode is written as a stand-alone story in its own right - so don't be\nafraid to 'jump in' anywhere along the line.Aviemore, the small town at the centre of\nthe story, is very much a real place and certainly worth a visit if you are\never in Scotland. Indeed, most of the places mentioned in the stories are in\nfact real places, though the names may have been altered for privacy's sake.\nThe green lochan for instance is a fantastic place for a picnic - and it is\nactually an opaque green colour. Do fairies really wash their clothes there?Although these episodes are categorised as\ncontemporary romance, I have to admit that there is as much action and\nadventure included, especially in the later stories. Contemporary romance it\nseems, is a little more 'gritty' these days than Sally and Robert would be\nhappy with - the Highland idea of morals a little more adverse to 'getting you're\nkit out' perhaps! Subsequently 'adult' content is only included where it actually\nplays a part in the overall story - if you're looking for gratuitous hot and\nsteamy sex scenes - these stories are perhaps not for you!I have visited and stayed in Aviemore many\ntimes, and continue to do so whenever I get the chance. It is a quiet peaceful\ntown, surrounded by spectacular mountains and beautiful highland scenery. - Ideal\nfor long walks and planning the next Sally book! This Highland town is popular\nboth in summer and winter for the many outdoor pursuits available; with Skiing\nin the Cairngorm Mountains, being the\nmajor draw over the winter period.Through these stories, I invite you to share\nand experience (albeit vicariously) the life of Sally and Robert, along with\ntheir growing family; as they settle into life in the highlands of Scotland. Encountering\nadventure and tribulation as well as love and romance - even murder mystery ! - life's twists and turns ensure that drama\nand intrigue, are never far away from the Lindsey household.", "related": ["B00COAABRG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Christine Larsen has done it again with Almost Unbearable Tales, not\nthat anyone should be surprised at the special gift that this writer has\n for creating a short, simple, and profound story. She has found the\ngreat pearl of wisdom that is hidden inside of the shell of simplicity\nand has a regular habit of reaching out and grabbing the heart of the\nreader's imagination.Reviewed by Jacqueline Ruiz for Readers' FavoriteAs soon as I realized this book was written from the point of\nview of a bear, as told to the author, I knew this had to be something\ndifferent (as well as cute). I was not disappointed. Ted Bear, Esq.\n... is something special to the\nauthor and I find that Larsen is keeping his memory alive (even while he\n hibernates) for posterity.... This isn't Larsen's first foray into writing about her stuffed animals.\nAs you can see in the opening credits, she has dabbled in this before\nand will continue.

Written in a voice reminiscent of Truman Capote's new journalism classicIn Cold Blood,German explores the deep racial issues surrounding the case and the arrest of George Whitmore, Jr., a young black man who was accused of the crime but later released. Whitmore's mistreatment by the authorities would eventually be used as evidence to support the Supreme Court’s landmark Miranda decision.

Her childhood and youth were spent in Frunze (today Bishkek), the capital of Kirgizia, where she was a member of the city’s literary association Gornye Zori (“mountain dawns”) and her first poems were published in a Kirgiz periodical.  In 1975 Sirota and her parents moved to their ancient homeland, Ukraine, where she graduated from the Faculty of Russian Philology at Dnepropetrovsk State University. She directed the literary associations Poisk (“quest”) in the city of Komsomolsk (Poltava oblast) and, from 1983, “Prometheus” at the Energetik Palace of Culture in Pripyat. After the Chernobyl catastrophe and the evacuation from Pripyat, Sirota has lived in Kiev where she worked as an editor at the Alexander Dovzhenko Film Studio until 1992.  The author’s poems, articles, and essays have been published in anthologies, as well as in many journals and newspapers of the former Soviet Union and Ukraine. After her collection of poetry, Nosha (“the burden”), and Rollan Sergienko’s film Porog (“the threshold”) came out, her poems became well-known all over the world. She was the coauthor and a leading character in the film.  Sirota’s works have been translated into English, German, Polish, Spanish, Italian, Japanese and other languages. Thanks to Professor Paul Brians, Washington State University, her poems (in English translation by Elisavietta Ritchie and Leonid Levin) have been heard on the U.S. national radio program Terra Infirma, and were published in the following collections: Life on the Line: Selections on Words and Healing; Perspectives from the Past; A Fierce Brightness: Twenty-Five Years of Women’s Poetry; and Perspectives on Modern World History: Chernobyl.

His parents were both immigrants from Aleppo, Syria, and his father was a prominent player in the New York garment industry. The youngest of six children, Victor chose not to follow his siblings into the family business, and instead attended the College of the Holy Cross and later Georgetown Medical School. He served two years in the United States Navy before completing his post-doctoral training at St. Vincent's Hospital and starting private practice in Greenwich Village, New York. After twenty years in practice, Dr. Keyloun switched careers, helming a highly successful consulting firm that specialized in creating computer-based sales training material and medical education for pharmaceutical companies around the world. Dr. Keyloun is the co-author of THE CORONARY CARE UNIT, a detailed history of the opening of the first coronary unit of its kind in New York City. His memoir, A HOUSE BY THE PARK, is an unflinching account of growing up in a large, loving family ravaged by bipolar disorder. In addition to his two other books, DR. GOOD HAS GONE and MURDER, MADNESS AND ST. VINCENT'S, Dr. Keyloun has written and produced four plays, and is currently working on his first screenplay. He lives with his wife, Carol, in the suburbs of New York City.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book serves up a smorgasbord of anecdotes, explanations and justifications that provide ample food for thought for any ecologically conscious individual pondering our future.

It provides a completely unfiltered view into Watson's mindset.... makes for compelling reading. And Watson certainly doesn't hold back.... In his core, Watson believes there are too many humans on the planet. And there need to be a lot fewer of them for marine life to thrive... If nothing else, this book will force readers to reexamine how human beings are annihilating other species, particularly those that live in the sea. (Charlie SmithGeorgia Straight2013-04-25)Presented as an extended interview, the book delves into a variety of topics revolving around Watson's philosophy and his actions. Watson describes experiences that shaped his attitude and activities... He has witnessed horrible slaughters of whales and other marine life...but manages to convey this without resorting to overly graphic descriptions.... In very simple terms, he states If the oceans die, we die. While other organizations and politicians stay on the sidelines as illegal whaling and fishing still goes on, Watson leads his Sea Shepherd Society into direct conflict with these ships and in the process stands between them and the marine life he has sworn to protect (Terry PetersNorth Shore News2013-05-31)Best Books 2013 (North Shore News2013-12-13)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was born in Fayetteville, NC and spent his childhood summers at Lake Waccamaw, N.C. Stefan’s dream has always been to become a successful published author. While working a variety of jobs for novel research, Stefan became the editor of two weekly small town newspapers. Stefan completed Basic Law Enforcement Training. As an investigative reporter for the Washington Daily News, he rode several nights a week with the k-9 unit sergeant. He covered murder trials, participated with drug raids, and the apprehension of wanted criminals. He won an Associate Press Award for best investigative reporting and taught creative writing at community colleges. In addition, he had signed a six book/movie contract with a casting agency in Wilmington. Unfortunately, he had a near fatal auto accident that left him in a coma for weeks. His parents were asked to donate his organs when it appeared he was dying. During that last minute of life, Stefan woke from his coma. With a dozen broken bones, head injury, and seemingly permanent nerve damage to his legs, writing became a great challenge. As a result, Stefan’s dream of becoming a successful writer was side tracked.    Stefan’s path to becoming an artist is an interesting story. He discovered from a talking goose that he was destined to become an artist as his means of expression. Gradually he made his transition from writer to artist. What he had lost in concentration with writing seemed to have doubled on his art side. Weeks after joining a local art guild, he received attention over a \"glory tree\" painting. He thought that the tree was like him and that he had just discovered what he was destined to do. He was meant to do “works of art that would give the world more Light.”    Now Mr. Duncan is also a novelist in the fantasy genre. His published works include several books in 2013 along with short stories and poetry.

Well, my friends loved the book so much they asked if I had anything else. So I shut the door, and a few months later, I came out with Jumpdrive. I absolutely love this story and the way it flows. It's fun and the characters are just so likable. The story really sucks you right in. Then, my test readers once again said \"We want more\" so once again, I returned to my dungeon and came out with The Watching, another exciting story of a father in search of his missing daughter. So as you can see, I'm having a great time writing these stories, and I hope you enjoy them as much as I have.
