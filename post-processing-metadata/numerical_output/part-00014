Her father, Nick Scott, a former SAS trooper who was captured in the first Gulf War and tortured in Saddam's dungeons, and Sarah's boyfriend, Jed Bradley, a current SAS member, join forces to find her. Naturally, Nick and Jed despise each other, but a lovely and extremely devious female intelligence agent makes sure they cooperate. Ryan, himself an SAS veteran of the first Gulf War, makes his two heroes' actions and motivations credible.

I got your son.\" Michael Hayes has had better phone calls than the one that opens Traum's novel, but at least he's got a couple of things going for him: His daughter is safe, and he's got the gruff-voiced bad guy's phone number on his caller ID. …Well, he's got one thing going for him, apart from the help of a few friendly, efficient cops, some of whom have done this enough to know that you don't have to look at the address to know which house is the victim's: \"It had to be the one all lit up. He grunted, ‘That's gotta be it, Gus,' to his partner.\" Enter Hayes's faithful friend Soo-Mee Yeong, of piercing analytical ability and a habit of remembering bad clients from years past—one of whom, a nefarious mobster from across the seas, bears Hayes considerable ill will for losing a chunk of his change in a bad market, and just may be tied up in the current brouhaha. Traum draws on a career as a real-estate investment banker to lend this procedural a touch of realism. --Kirkus", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

King collected what was known about the Gnostics in this book. At that time there were only three sources of information on Gnosticism: polemics against them by early Christian writers, the Pistis Sophia, and a jumble of confusing images and cryptic inscriptions on Roman-era gems and amulets. In spite of all of the missing jigsaw pieces, King managed to assemble a picture of the Gnostics which is still cited today as authoritative. Rather than one monolithic group, the Gnostics had very diverse beliefs. Some thought that Jesus was a man, while others thought that he was a God, and some believed that he became a God only after he was baptized. Some believed in a struggle between good and evil, others were non-dualistic. Most had widely-varying intricate systems of intermediaries between the ultimate deity and humanity. On the face of it, this looks polytheistic, but instead was an attempt to solve the problem of how a perfect God could create an imperfect world. Many of these Aeons later became the demons and angels of Medieval and Renaissance magic.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

partly because,\nin the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because\nif I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately\nwithCaptain Vorpatril's Alliance) it would upwhack the numbering\nsystem. Nevertheless, the books and\nstories do have a chronological order, if not a strict one. It was always my intention to write each book as a\nstand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with\nthat book that's in your handright now, don't put it back on the\nshelf! While still somewhat true, as the\nseries developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that\nwere richer for each other. I will list the\nsub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats. Shards of HonorandBarrayar. The first two books in the series proper,\nthey detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral\nVorkosigan of Barrayar. Shardswas my very first novel ever;Barrayarwas actually my eighth, but\ncontinues the tale the next day after the end ofShards. For readers who want to be sure of beginning\nat the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two. The Warrior's ApprenticeandThe Vor Game(with, perhaps, the novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" tucked in\nbetween.) The Warrior's Apprenticeintroduces the character who became the series' linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the\nfirst book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by accident; the second\nhow he fixed his mistakes from the first round.Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things\none can best discover for oneself),The Warrior's Apprenticemakes\nanother good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male\nprotagonist. After that:Brothers in Armsshould be read beforeMirror\nDance, and both, ideally, beforeMemory. Komarrmakes another good alternate entry point for\nthe series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read beforeA Civil Campaign. Borders of Infinity, a collection of three of the\nfive currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure\nsampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit\nthemselves to length. (But it may make\nmore sense if read afterThe Warrior's Apprentice.) Take care not to confuse the\ncollection-as-a-whole with its title story, \"The Borders of Infinity\". Falling Freetakes place 200\nyears earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with\nthe main body of the series. Most\nreaders recommend picking up this story later.It should likely be read beforeDiplomatic Immunity, however,\nwhich revisits the \"quaddies\", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in\nMiles's time. The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear\nin italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words\nand 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.  Falling FreeShards of HonorBarrayarThe Warrior's Apprentice\"The Mountains of Mourning\"\"Weatherman\"The Vor GameCetagandaEthan of AthosBorders of Infinity\"Labyrinth\"\"The Borders of Infinity\"Brothers in ArmsMirror DanceMemoryKomarrA Civil Campaign\"Winterfair Gifts\"Diplomatic ImmunityCaptain Vorpatril'sAlliance (upcoming in late 2012)CryoBurn                   Caveats: The novella \"Weatherman\" is an\nout-take from the beginning of the novelThe Vor Game. If you already haveThe Vor Game, you\nlikely don't need this. The original 'novel'Borders of\nInfinitywas a fix-up collection containing the three novellas \"The\nMountains of Mourning\", \"Labyrinth\", and \"The Borders of Infinity\", together\nwith a frame story to tie the pieces together.Again, beware duplication. The\nframe story does not stand alone, and generally is of interest only to\ncompletists.  The Fantasy Novels My fantasy novels are a bit easier\nto order. Easiest of all isThe\nSpirit Ring, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed\nbooks that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are the four volumes ofThe\nSharing Knife--in order,Beguilement,Legacy,Passage,\nandHorizon--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one\ncontinuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks. What have come to be called the\nChalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written,\nlike the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and\ncan in theory be read in any order. (The\nthird book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely\nconnected first two.) Some readers think\nthe world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in\npublication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the\nfirst (but not the third.) In any case,\nthe publication order is: The Curse of ChalionPaladin of SoulsThe Hallowed HuntThe short story collectionProto\nZoawas an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three\n(1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but\nnot in this handy format. The novelette \"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" may be of\ninterest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is the first story in which that proto-universe\nbegan, mentioning Beta Colony but before Barrayar was even thought of. My latest original e-edition isSidelines: Talks and Essays, which is\njust what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of my nonfiction\nwritings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions,\nand some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove an interesting companion\npiece to my fiction.Happy reading! -- Lois McMaster Bujold.", "related": [], "rank": 131508, "title": "Labyrinth (Vorkosigan Saga) eBook", "author": "Lois McMaster Bujold", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Instead, she knew he would be gone for only a couple of nights. Bridget resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Zach and Valentina just seemed so gooey in love.\"Call me if you need anything,\" he told her, then swung his young daughter, Katiana, up into his arms. \"Are you going to be good for your mommy?\"Katiana solemnly nodded.\"Give me a kiss,\" he said.The toddler kissed his cheek and wrapped her little arms around his neck.Despite her earlier reaction, the scene tugged at Bridget's heart. She knew Zach and Tina had gone through some tough times before they'd gotten married.Zach shot Bridget a firm glance that instinctively made her sit up straighter. He was that kind of man, confident with a strong will. Although she was happy Tina had found happiness with him, Bridget knew she would want a totally different kind of man. Charming, average intelligence, playful and most likely Italian.\"You,\" he said, pointing his finger at Bridget. \"Stay out of elevators.\"She laughed. \"I can only promise that for a few days. When I go back to Dallas, I'm sure I'll have to face more elevators if I'm going to complete Stefan's latest job for me. If I have anything to do with it, I'm going to take care of it as quickly as possible.\"Tina shot her a sideways glance. \"Are you saying you're already tired of us?\"Bridget shook her head and walked to give her sister a hug. \"Of course I'm not tired of you. But you know I've had a dream of having a long-delayed gap year in Italy and studying art for years now. I want to make that dream come true while I'm still young.\"Tina made a scoffing sound, but still returned the hug. \"You're far from losing your youth, but I agree you deserve a break. You've taken on the bulk of public appearances since I left Chantaine and moved here. I don't understand why you didn't take a break before coming here. I'm sure Stefan would have let you.\"Stefan, their brother, the crown prince, could be the most demanding person on the planet, but what Tina said was true. He not only would have allowed Bridget a break, he had also encouraged it. \"I want a year. A whole year. And he believes Chantaine needs more doctors. I agree. Especially after what happened to Eve—\"Her voice broke, taking her by surprise. She'd thought she'd gotten her feelings under control.Tina patted her back with sympathy. \"You still feel guilty about that. I know Eve wishes you didn't.\"Bridget took a careful breath, reining in her emotions. \"She saved my life when the crowd was going to stampede me. Pushed me aside and threw herself in front of me. I'm just so glad she survived it and recovered. I don't know what I would do if she hadn't…\" Her throat closed up again.\"Well, she survived and you did, too. That's what's important,\" Zach said and pulled Bridget into a brotherly hug. \"And now that you're in my territory, I want you to think twice before getting on elevators.\"Tina laughed. \"So protective,\" she said. \"It's a wonder he doesn't find some kind of testing device for you to use so you won't get stuck again.\"Zach rubbed his chin thoughtfully. \"Not a bad idea. Maybe—\"\"Forget it,\" Bridget said, the knot in her chest easing at the love she felt from both her sister and her brother-in-law. \"I'll be fine. Think about it. How many people do you know who have gotten stuck in elevators? Especially more than once?\"\"You were a good soldier,\" Tina said in approval. \"And you still showed up for your appearance at Keely's charity event.\"\"She probably wasn't expecting me in my sad state with droopy hair and a dress with baby-food stain on it.\"\"Oh, she said they loved you. Found you charming.Were delighted by your story about the elevator. Most important, the donations increased after your arrival.\"\"Well, I guess baby-food stains are good for something, then. I'll leave you two lovebirds to finish your goodbyes in private. Safe travels, Zach.\"\"You bet,\" he said.Bridget scooped up her cup of hot tea and walked upstairs to the guest room where she was staying. Her sister had redecorated the room in soothing shades of green and blue. The ranch should have given Bridget a sense of serenity. After all, she was miles from Stefan and his to-do list for her. She was away from Chantaine where she was recognized and haunted by the paparazzi whenever she left the palace. But Bridget never seemed to be able to escape the restlessness inside her. That was why she'd decided to skip a short vacation and take care of this significant task Stefan had asked of her. After that, she could take her trip to Italy and find her peace again.No one had ever accused Bridget of being deep. She voiced her distress and upset to her family at will, but presented the rest of the world with a cheery effervescent face. It was her job.Some of the conditions she'd witnessed during the past year and a half, the sights and sounds of children sick in the hospital, Chantaine's citizens struggling with poverty, cut her to the quick and it had been difficult to keep her winsome attitude intact. It irritated her how much she now had to struggle to maintain a superficial air. Life had been so much easier when she hadn't faced others in need. Life had been easier when someone hadn't been willing to sacrifice her life for the sake of Bridget's safety.Even though Eve had indeed survived and thrived since the accident, something inside Bridget had changed. And she wasn't sure she liked it. Eve and Stefan had fallen in love and married. Eve cared for Stefan's out-of-wedlock daughter as if she were her own. On the face of it, everything was wonderful.Deep down, though, Bridget wondered if her life was really worth saving. What had she done that made her worthy of such an act?She squeezed her eyes shut and swore under her breath. \"Stop asking that question,\" she whispered harshly to herself.Steeling herself against the ugly swarm of emotions, Bridget set her cup of tea on the table. She would complete the task Stefan asked of her. Then maybe she would have settled the score inside her, the score she couldn't quite explain even to herself. Afterward she would go to Italy and hopefully she would find the joy and lightness she'd lost.After three days of being unable to meet with the head of residents at Texas Medical Center of Dallas, Bridget seethed with impatience. Dr. Gordon Walters was never available, and all her calls to his office went unanswered. Thank goodness for connections. Apparently Tina's friend Keely knew a doctor at University Hospital and there just happened to be a meet and greet for interns, doctors and important donors at a hotel near the hospital on Tuesday night.Bridget checked into the hotel and her security took the room next to hers. One advantage of being at Zach's ranch meant security was superfluous. Not so in Dallas. She dressed carefully because she needed to impress and to be taken seriously. A black dress with heels. She resisted the urge to paint her lips red. The old Bridget wouldn't have batted an eye.Frowning into the bathroom mirror in her suite, she wondered what that meant. Well, hell, if Madonna could wear red lipstick and be taken seriously, why couldn't she? She smoothed her fingers over her head and tucked one side of her hair behind her left ear. She'd colored her hair darker lately. It fit her mood.She frowned again into the mirror. Maybe she would dye it blond when she moved to Italy.She punched the code for her security on her cell phone. Raoul picked up immediately. \"Yes, Your Highness.\"\"I'm ready. Please stay in the background,\" she said.\"Yes, ma'am. But I shall join you on the elevator.\"A couple moments later, she rode said elevator to the floor which held the meeting rooms and ballrooms. A host stood outside the ballroom which housed the cocktail party she would attend. \"Name?\" he asked as she approached him.She blinked, unaccustomed to being screened. Doors opened at the mention of her title. Not in Texas, she supposed. \"Bridget Devereaux and escort,\" she said, because Raoul was beside her.The man flipped through several pages and checked off her name. \"Welcome,\" he said. \"Please go in.\"\"The nerve of the man,\" Raoul said as they entered the ballroom full of people. \"To question a member of the royal family,\" he fumed as he surveyed the room.Bridget smiled. \"Novel experience,\" she said. \"I'm looking for Dr. Gordon Walters. If you see him, by all means, please do tell me.\"Thirty minutes later, Bridget was ready to pull out her hair. Every time she mentioned Dr. Walters's name, people clammed up. She couldn't squeeze even a bit of information about the man from anyone.Frustrated, she accepted a glass of wine and decided to take another tack.Dr. Ryder McCall checked his watch for the hundredth time in ten minutes. How much longer did he need to stay? The latest nanny he'd hired had seemed okay when he'd left tonight, but after his previous experiences, he couldn't be sure. He caught a glimpse of the back of a woman with dark brown wavy hair and paused. Something about her looked familiar.The dress was classic and on a woman with a different body, it would have evoked images of that actress. What was her name? Audrey something. But this woman had curves which evoked entirely different thoughts. The sight of the woman's round derriere reminded Ryder of the fact that he hadn't been with a woman in a while. Too long, he thought and adjusted his tie.Curious, he moved so ...", "related": [], "rank": 767756, "title": "The Doctor Takes a Princess (Royal Babies series Book 3)", "author": "Leanne Banks", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The autobiography is written with humor, pathos, and great insights into history of politics and medicine during a critical time when the world was changing. This caring man took his professional life futher; during the darkest periods of Aparteid he fought to end it as a member of South African Parliament. He also was a leader in the financial world to help his fellow man's health and welfare, as the one who started critical illness insurance which became a world model.

Empathetic but never apologetic, Pedersen presents a balanced account of what was certainly a very arduous, evenlife-threatening, fieldwork research. . . .[N]ot Quite Shamanswill certainly become a seminal text, not only for Mongolian and Inner Asian specialists but indeed as a detailed and perceptive analysis of postsocialism and shamanism.\"—Franck Billé,Current Anthropology(April 2013)\"Not Quite Shamansis a welcome contribution to the literature of the occult and supernatural, shamanism, postsocialism, and Mongolia. . . . Many anthropologists of modernity, postcolonialism, and postsocialism will find exciting and useful conversations and ideas in this book. . . . [T]he book successfully takes shamanism away from the notion of exotic and traditional but shows its modernities and many ways in which shamanism \"spills over [its] forms\" quintessential and even modern and incomplete.\" —Manduhai Buyandelger,American Anthropologist(March 2013)\"It is tricky to define anything using a negative, especially in a book title. Yet Morten Pedersen has succeeded in making his theme of perpetual transitional instability in Mongolia one that centers on the concept of \"not quite shamans.\" He argues that those Mongolian shamans of the Darhad region conventionally trained to control dark spirit worlds have all but disappeared, given the repressions and pressures of communists, and before them, Buddhists. . . . Pedersen's work is a fine contribution to the anthropological literature on Mongolia. . . .\"—Marjorie Mandelstam Balzer,Anthropology and Humanism(Vol. 37, Issue 2, 2012)\"In this book, the author claims that theagsan atamanis a typical image of a rural village in postsocialist Mongolia. As the instrument of occult forces whose manifestation is beyond his control, theagsanperson is like a shaman, but not quite (p. 4). The author calls his study 'shamanism without shamans', because he studied not proper shamans but half-shamans and shaman-like cases. . . . [T]his work is an enormous contribution to studies deconstructing shamanism.\"—Bumochir Dulam,Nationalities Papers(Nov. 2012)\"A fascinating journey through the hitherto little remarked complexities of post-socialist rural Mongolia, where formerly suppressed and semi-destroyed shamanic and Buddhist traditions have resurfaced to compete with one another and also with modernity. . . . Composed with scholarly erudition, thoughtful reflection, and true storyteller acumen, this engaging account fills a significant void in understanding contemporary Mongolian society. Its wealth of useful ethnographic and linguistic detail offers much to anthropologists and social historians alike. Summing up: Highly recommended.\"—Choice(December 2011)\"Not Quite Shamansis based on original and courageous fieldwork in an exceptional setting; Morten Axel Pedersen develops a sophisticated and very ambitious argument; he brings to life the notion of 'not quite shamans' as relevant for understanding the void in postsocialist Mongolia after very radical purges of Buddhist lamas and local shamans.\"—Peter L. Geschiere, University of Amsterdam, author ofThe Modernity of Witchcraft: Politics and the Occult in Postcolonial Africa\"This is anthropology at its best: full of both theoretical and ethnographic surprises. In northern Mongolia, where the institutions of encompassing social order, both Buddhist and socialist, have collapsed or fragmented into shards, rowdy drunks are almost shamans, jokes are discerning, and elections resemble séances.Not Quite Shamansis a theoretically sophisticated ethnography of one post-socialist hinterland; it is also a provocative evocation of the unsettled spirits that shake all of us in the wake of twentieth-century modernity.\"—Anna Tsing, author ofFriction: An Ethnography of Global Connection", "related": [], "rank": 1604594, "title": "Not Quite Shamans: Spirit Worlds and Political Lives in Northern Mongolia (Culture and Society after Socialism)", "author": "Morten Axel Pedersen", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was also an Olympic sailor and has won the Sunfish World Championship, along with a wide variety of other sailing titles.  In January 2000 he was named by Sail Magazine as one of the 30 most influential sailors of the past 30 years. In his earlier career in advertising, Garry lived for 25 years in San Juan, Puerto RIco, where his two sons were born.  During this period he traveled extensively to Latin America and the Far East, as area manager for Young & Rubicam.  This experience, together with his acquired knowledge of Spanish, has given Hoyt a unique perspective into the complicated world of Latin politics, especially the events in Puerto Rico, where he was a close-up observer. A 1952 graduate of Colgate University, where he majored in English Literature, Hoyt also received a degree from the Thunderbird School of International Management.  He served as a Lieutenant J.G. in the U.S. Coast Guard with Search and Rescue duties in Florida and the Caribbean.", "related": [], "rank": 2308451, "title": "Isla Verde: Adventure, Romance & Political Intrigue in Puerto Rico", "author": "Garry Hoyt", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As she grew, she developed her ability to mentally visualize vivid scenes which she revisited later when she learned to take pen into hand. As an adult, she submitted several examples of her work to publishers, but was disappointed by rejection after rejection. But with encouragement from family and friends, she took that giant leap joining her new family at Fantasy Island Book Publishing.

Well, they're the consumers of ICP's endlessly franchised business interests, yes, but more importantly, as Russell attests: \"You can be a juggalo, or you can be white trash--the first term is yours, the second is somebody else's.\" Befitting the barely veiled chaos of the festival itself, Russell's writing is sloppy, lurching, and pocked with both whiplashingnon sequitursand moments of breathtaking lucidity, ultimately evincing a style that meets the difficult demands of its subject matter.

It's the story of how Julian Assange, the front man of WikiLeaks, worked with three newspapers (The New York Times, The Guardian, and Der Spiegel) to publish simultaneous articles based on the biggest government information leaks in history. One of those leaks was the release of some 250,000 U.S. Embassy cables. The story involves hackers, paranoia, the world's most powerful newspapers, clandestine operations, an internationally wanted man, and almost everyone telling each other lies. Author/investigative journalist Heather Brooke details how soon after she met Assange, her personal and professional boundaries with him began to blur. She draws an intimate portrait of Assange's twin natures. To her, the platinum-haired idealist is a magnetic personality and a charismatic crusader on a mission to expose suppressed and censored injustice. Yet he's also a megalomaniac, a hypocrite of the first order, and a threat to the integrity of his own mission. Brooke's writing is fast-paced, wonderfully descriptive, and remarkably revealing (both about WikiLeaks and the trade of investigative journalism). Readers who admire or detest WikiLeaks will find this 75-page piece a fascinating read, but no one will be more enraged about it than Julian Assange himself. --Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00D5WNXPE"], "rank": 1600778, "title": "Assange Agonistes (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Heather Brooke", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was told by industry \"experts\" not to bother with the original Benji film; that it wouldn't work. He proved the experts wrong and now, after five Benji movies, he's at it again with his latest career as an author. His recent best selling book The Soul of a Horse: Life Lessons from the Herd published in 2008 by the Harmony Books imprint of Random House is in its seventh printing and is changing the lives of horses and people all across the planet. His next book The Soul of a Horse Blogged - The Journey Continues picks up where The Soul of a Horse left off with the adoption of a pregnant mustang and continues through he and wife Kathleen's move from the dry rocky hillside pasture of southern California to the wet grassy hillsides of their new middle Tennessee home.  His new series  of eBook Nuggets from The Soul of a Horse is packed with inspiring new stories and compelling new discoveries.  Joe Camp showed us the heart and soul of a dog when he created Benji. Now, in these engaging, emotional, and often humorous stories, he deftly lures us into the heart and soul of a horse, unlocking the mystery of a majestic creature who has survived on earth, without assistance, for fifty-two million years.  Camp has written, produced and directed seven theatrical motion pictures (including all of the Benji movies) cumulatively grossing well over the equivalent of $600 million in today's dollars, making him one of the most successful independent filmmakers of all time.  Camp ignored the \"experts\" who said the original Benji movie would never work. He raised the money from private sources to produce the film, but when completed the movie was turned down by every major film distributor in Hollywood. Camp and his partner had to form their own distribution company and release the picture themselves worldwide from their offices in Dallas. In spite of the many obstacles, Variety reported that the film was the #3 grossing movie of the year.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sgt. Jack Stallworthy didn't start out as a corrupt cop. He had every intention of protecting the people of Abbotsport.

Now in his 50s and looking at retirement, Jack realizes that his meager pension and the only slightly larger stash of money buried in his backyard won't last long on the tropical island of Ko Samui, for which Lily pines. So when computer magnate Emslie Warnaby tempts him, in exchange for plane tickets to the island and a deed for a hotel there, to retrieve a folder the police seized when a bureaucrat was arrested, Jack grudgingly agrees. His attempts at getting the folder from the fraud investigation officeAwhich range from befriending the charwoman, clerk and detective sergeant in charge to breaking and entering with the help of his archenemy, all the while facing Warnaby's imminent deadlineAmake up the bulk of this well-told tale. Jack, while crooked, is an astute observer of all around him and serves as a bellwether for a small-town cop's lot in life. Keating's low-key sense of humor and his dexterity at making a crooked protagonist sympathetic are firmly in place, as is the story's satirical edge, which explores the disparity between the financial rewards received by criminals and police and the symbiotic relationship between cops and robbers. Readers will come away from this newest by the veteran author of the Inspector Ghote mysteries with an eye-opening look at modern law enforcement.

He rose from a humble background to complete his geshe studies at Sera Je Monastic University in Lhasa with highest honors and was privileged to serve as a debate opponent for the Dalai Lama's own geshe examination in 1959. He moved to New Jersey in the United States in 1963 and in 1967 began teaching in the Buddhist Studies Program at University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he is now professor emeritus. In 1975, he founded the Deer Park Buddhist Center in Oregon, Wisconsin, site of the Dalai Lama's first Kalachakra initiation granted in the West. He is the author of several books in English, including the five-volume comprehensive teaching,Steps on the Path to Englightenment.David Patt received his PhD in Buddhist Studies from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and is the author ofA Strange Liberation: Tibetan Lives in Chinese Hands. He recently served as executive director of the Dzogchen Foundation.Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, is the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. He frequently describes himself as a simple Buddhist monk. Born in northeastern Tibet in 1935, he was as a toddler recognized as the incarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and brought to Tibet's capital, Lhasa. In 1950, Mao Zedong's Communist forces made their first incursions into eastern Tibet, shortly after which the young Dalai Lama assumed the political leadership of his country. He passed his scholastic examinations with honors at the Great Prayer Festival in Lhasa in 1959, the same year Chinese forces occupied the city, forcing His Holiness to escape to India. There he set up the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, working to secure the welfare of the more than 100,000 Tibetan exiles and prevent the destruction of Tibetan culture. In his capacity as a spiritual and political leader, he has traveled to more than sixty-two countries on six continents and met with presidents, popes, and leading scientists to foster dialogue and create a better world. In recognition of his tireless work for the nonviolent liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. In 2012, he relinquished political authority in his exile government and turned it over to democratically elected representatives.His Holiness frequently states that his life is guided by three major commitments: the promotion of basic human values or secular ethics in the interest of human happiness, the fostering of interreligious harmony, and securing the welfare of the Tibetan people, focusing on the survival of their identity, culture, and religion. As a superior scholar trained in the classical texts of the Nalanda tradition of Indian Buddhism, he is able to distill the central tenets of Buddhist philosophy in clear and inspiring language, his gift for pedagogy imbued with his infectious joy. Connecting scientists with Buddhist scholars, he helps unite contemplative and modern modes of investigation, bringing ancient tools and insights to bear on the acute problems facing the contemporary world. His efforts to foster dialogue among leaders of the world's faiths envision a future where people of different beliefs can share the planet in harmony. Wisdom Publications is proud to be the premier publisher of the Dalai Lama's more serious and in-depth works.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The sheer heft of it, along with the sturdy slipcover; the fine, coated stock; and an unusually intoxicating new-book smell, commanded attention. And when a trailer truck packed with 1,300 copies was hijacked during a cross-country run, I was secretly thrilled that discerning thieves had thought40worthy of a heist—and that the book would soon be showing up on the street at people's prices.No such luck. The unloaded truck was eventually located on an interstate off-ramp, presumably abandoned in disgust. I've tried to imagine the reaction of the hijackers' supervisor when he broke into the trailer and discovered 13,000 pounds ofDoonesburywhere palettes of hi-def TVs should have been. Let us hope no one was hurt; it was an honest mistake.Still, after all that excitement, you'd think that the digital reimagining of40would be a letdown. Not so; we can now invite more people to the party. I've come to appreciate that many readers prefer to forego the risk of herniation while picking up a book—no matter that the risk is slight if you push up from your knees and have someone spot you. There was also the problem of where to display the book once consumed, as standard bookshelves could not accommodate it. We briefly considered shrink-wrapping it with four attachable legs, but then worried it might bump us into Amazon's Home and Kitchen category.Clearly the answer lay in rendering the collection in ones and zeros. And to further facilitate the reader experience, we divided the book into four easy pieces—each covering a full decade's worth of strips. Everyone has a favorite decade, although let's face it, it's never the '70s. Especially in my case. Not to wave the reader off, but my opening decade was filled with the uncertain stops and starts of a rank amateur learning his craft in full public view. I was wildly unready, but as the syndicate salesmen assured me, that was the point. The young had hijacked the culture, and with that standing, our voices—raw, impassioned, ungovernable—were in high demand.Besides, all journeys need a beginning, and the early wheel-spinning is part of the fun. To paraphrase the Dead, it's been a long, strange strip, and40comprises the long of it, it ought to retain the strange as well.", "related": [], "rank": 273324, "title": "40: A Doonesbury Retrospective, 2000 to 2010", "author": "G.B.

A larger-than-life figure, Pines has benefited from a series of lucky breaks after his release from prison, including winning enough money at the horse track to buy a house in the town of Kailua on Oahu. Valerie Sabatino, a gorgeous and fabulously wealthy attorney, asks Pines for help tracking down her missing nephew, Danny MacGillicuddy, whose father was Pines's former cellmate. MacGillicuddy, a soldier stationed on the island, has gone AWOL under circumstances that make his aunt fear the worst. After this intriguing set-up, Pines gets on the trail of some violent Mormon fundamentalists but soon finds himself in stock situations involving fire fights and hostage-taking. An abrupt ending reminiscent of Diamonds Are Forever may leave some readers scratching their heads. Still, Holland's prose is good enough to suggest he can deliver more nuanced characters and a less predictable plot in the sequel.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Burke Deveraux let out a curse as a streak of red passed him on the left. His wipers swiped across the windshield, trying in vain to keep the thick snow at bay. Didn't that lunatic driver realize they were in the middle of a blizzard? On a mountain road?Despite the snow chains, the tires of his Land Rover slipped on the icy slush and his hands tightened on the wheel. Just ten more miles and he'd be to the cabin. Give or take a few. He'd driven this road for years, but with all the white stuff coming down, it was hard to gage exactly where he was. The only thing that mattered was that he was long gone from Louisiana and whatever was in the water.There was no other explanation for four devoted bachelors to all find love in the span of five months. And while he was happy that they'd found their mates, and he couldn't wait to become an uncle, he much preferred his bachelor lifestyle.His brother and cousins had started talking to him finding his mate the moment André and Juliette had gotten back together. And over the last few weeks, they hadn't let up. Even the women were in on it. The moment his favorite ski resort had announced an early season opening, he'd high tailed it out of there.Burke didn't want a mate.He just wanted some peace and quiet and to catch some fresh powder. And to forget the memories that clawed at him every time he saw one the women that had infiltrated Deveraux pack.What he hadn't bet on was trading hurricanes for the blizzard bearing down on him now.Or the flash of red that jerked his attention to the side of the road.He stepped hard on the breaks, trying to avoid the red car and the snow bank. For a nauseating moment the world was a streak of white. Burke's hands strangled the steering wheel as he fought to keep the tires on the road.The antilock brakes kicked in and the vehicle slowed, but Burke exhaled too soon.In the blink of an eye the tires slipped in the slick snow and the back wheels swung right. Curses rent the air and his luggage rolled around like a pebble in a tin can. Gin let out a startled bark from the back seat.Finally, when everything was still, the SUV was pointed down the mountain. A gust of wind cleared enough snow out of the air that he could see the bright red car half buried by a pile of snow/half dangling off the side of the mountain.He unclenched his teeth, worked his jaw and huffed out a sigh. So much for a relaxing vacation.The formerly groggy Labrador was now wide-awake in the backseat. Gin let out a deep bark and smacked Burke in the cheek with his tail. He let out another woof, his nose pressed against the side window.\"You all right?\"Gin sighed in that purely canine way that said he wasn't thrilled with the situation.The other driver made no move to back out of the dune and Burke figured that the idiot had wrecked his car. He pulled out his cell phone and flipped it open. He'd report the wreck and wait until the wrecker got here. If the wrecker got here.No signal.Great. He tossed the phone aside and reached behind the passenger's seat for his coat. Maybe the lunatic in the other car had a phone that would work. Tendrils of snow swooshed into the car as he opened the door. Bracing against the icy wind he planted one boot in the ankle deep snow and then the other.Tugging on his thick Northface coat he headed down the road toward the other car once again questioning his decision to try to beat the storm.The collision had killed the engine, mangling what he could see of the front end.Ah hell.A blonde lay hunched over the steering wheel, not moving. Blood soaked the back of her grey sweatshirt. He knocked on the window and wished he'd tugged on his gloves. The woman didn't move. He peered into the car, looking for a phone, and saw a large purse wedged between her chest and the steering wheel.He tested the handle of her door. Locked. Figured. The small window behind the driver's seat was shattered, half the glass missing. He reached through the gaping hole and flipped the lock.Wrenching the door open he checked the pulse at her throat. Still thumping. He braced both hands around her neck and the base of her skull and then, as gently as he could, settled her back in her seat and took stock of her injuries.And arrestingly adorable features. She looked like an angel, a cherub, with glossy pink lips. With a bloody gash across her forehead and -- was that a pink streak in her hair? He leaned closer. And a thick purple stripe too.A fierce wind howled over head, making the trees sway and groan. She gave a soft moan, and then, as if she'd awoken, her body went rigid.\"You're okay, petit. Just relax. Where do you hurt?\"Stunning aqua blue eyes met his for an instant before she closed them again, wincing. The fear he'd glimpsed there shocked him. \"Please,\" she said, her voice hoarse and barely a whisper. He leaned toward her to hear over the roar of the elements. \"Don't let...him...take me.\"", "related": ["B00K8HKI8O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.5714, "rating_total": 32.0}

So, how does he get stuck with a broken-down retired circus horse? Poor Dink. The day has finally come for him to pick out the horse he as been saving up his money to buy. He has his heart set on a real horse, a cowboy s horse , one that must be a boy. He searches the Rocking J Ranch, where Mr. Jackson sells horses, until he finds the perfect horse. It s a six-year-old sorrel gelding named Socks. But, while he s waiting for his father and Mr. Jackson to round up the horse so he can ride it, old Goldie, a broken-down retired circus horse chooses him. He has four sisters and is tired of having too many girls in his life - - all previous pets have also been girls. He wants a horse, a boy, but ends up buying the old mare because his sisters fall in love with it, and deep down, he knows it s the right thing to do. But, that doesn t mean he s happy with his choice. The story is a good one, but it left me with one unanswered question: Why is the lead character named Dink? That is never explained. His sisters all have normal names, like Ruby, Josie, Leigh and Ann; so, why is he named Dink? Anyway, \"Who Needs Girls?\" is a great story with lessons about making the right choices and being happy with who you are and what you have. 5 stars. --Christine Irvin\"Who Needs Girls?\" is a recipient of the prestigious Mom's Choice Award.

Ultimately, Modlin established a solo practice, but this book focuses on what it means to work as a self-employed attorney, including how to get work, how to establish a business infrastructure, and how to do the work. Her advice is wide-ranging and extremely readable. She s honest about the hard work and life choices involved but not condescending. At a time when solo firms and temp agencies have garnered most of the coverage, Modlin presents an alternative, and her book is an excellent and much-needed resource for anyone considering becoming a freelance attorney. --NALP: The Association For Legal Career Professionals", "related": [], "rank": 1687398, "title": "The Independence Track: How To Succeed As A Freelance Attorney", "author": "Marina Modlin", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From this point on, the story of money and its evolution gets quite interesting.Economistwriters Michael Green and Matthew Bishop take readers on an exquisite journey through the history of money and its entanglements with philosophers, physicists, rulers, wars, criminals, the discovery of the Americas, and, later, economists. All forms of money, as it turns out, fail with alarming frequency. Fiat currencies--money that is created and backed by a government such as the US dollar or the Euro--fail when people lose trust in the institutions that backs them. Commodity currencies--such as silver coins and gold-backed notes--fail for many more reasons, such as debasement, supply issues, and politics (governments often outlaw commodity money and switch to fiat currency to ease recessions or to fund wars). So where does gold figure into the monetary system? According to the authors, an oversight by Sir Isaac Newton eventually led to gold-backed paper money--a highly problematic, short-lived experiment. So what's next in the evolution of money?In Gold We Trust?explores that frontier in its last chapter. Both highly engaging and well-crafted, this Kindle Single encompasses technology, economics, politics, history, and psychology as it explores the past and future of money. --Paul Diamond", "related": [], "rank": 1061382, "title": "In Gold We Trust?

The awareness that we are spirits in human form, having a physical experience, came after SAM’s son transitioned on April 4, 2004. Her quest for self-mastery began the following year when his essence led her through the doors of an establishment teaching the Science of Mind. SAM turned her back on traditional medicine after decades of illness and multiple surgeries. Using Eastern medicine, and the teachings of Ernest Holmes, she successfully rid herself of many maladies. SAM’s book series is a personal account highlighting the process of one Lightworkers awakening. It begins with The End of My Soap Opera Life :-) Book One: Death of the Sun and, as of March 2013, extends to Book of One: Volume 1. SAM is administrator of the popular Internet resource, Lightworker’s Log (LightworkersLog.com). She currently concentrates on writing and spreading Spirit’s message of Oneness throughout the globe.

Plimpton passed. Somehow the editor of that venerable and adventurous publication had been shocked by my updating of the Orpheus myth.Lurid, it is, in some ways, as it's meant to be, this darkly erotic stew of a book. I had been toying with the idea of writing a novel based on a myth, as my friend René Belletto had done in his Sur la terre comme au ciel, and because the story of Orpheus and Eurydice was so resonant and so fitting to a kind of noir mentality, I focused on that. I remembered Cocteau's film version of it, made in the lingering aftershadow of the German Occupation, with its enigmatic motorcycle riders and the devastating last glance back at Eurydice in the rearview mirror--the moment when Orpheus loses her forever. I thought, well, in the original myth Orpheus must descend into the underworld to retrieve his lost love, and the notion of \"underworld\" brought to mind the obvious crime associations.I set the book in Paris (as I had my previous one, Body and Soul), where the notion of the blue hour is especially resonant, that brief time just before sunset when the city seems to have a blue cast to it. Guerlain had even named a scent after it, L'Heure Bleue. And then what I did was give the city a high fever, so that everything was heightened through the eyes of the protagonist and the detective who had chosen to help him.I made my protagonists Hungarians, as I wanted characters who were displaced, a bit lost in this other culture, as though Paris were something only sporadically experienced through the static of a foreign language. Adam Füst is an assistant to the famous Hungarian film director, Gabor, a one-eyed wild man whose life and career had been marked forever by a terrifying event in his childhood in Budapest. To some degree, Gabor is based on Roman Polanski (a man marked by violence of various kinds), and in fact Polanski did consider The Blue Hour with an eye to possibly directing it. But he had just come with Frantic, and the stories were a bit too close in concept for him. More about the film in a moment, though. Adam's wife, Honnie (named after an especially addictive treat made by Bahlsen and often bought by me when I was living in England) is a restorer of frescos in old churches. One day she disappears, and Adam goes to the police, where he meets Inspector Cuvillier (named after the author of a standard philosophy textbook used in French lycées), an amoral but exceptionally able cop. The book largely takes place in the lesser-known quarters of Paris--the canals, the outlying districts with their warehouses and garages, the gritty parts most tourists avoid. (When, later, this was being developed as a film, the French investors in the project especially appreciated that; too many American films set there simply linger on the usual tourist landmarks.)As Adam begins his search, both with and apart from the detective, he begins to see the world in a new way. Signs and portents are everywhere, from a diabolical ring seen on a hand in the métro, to glimpses of sadism in uncurtained windows--even to false sightings of his wife; if false they really are. Even his concierge's mother, elderly and babbling, seems to speak of Honnie's absence. Every other person appears to be an oracle in this wide-awake nightmare. Honnie is found, and along with it the lost history of her life in Paris. This haunted woman had lived two lives, and it's up to Adam and Cuvillier to meet up with her--where else?--in an underground parking garage near Orly Airport. There they learn the whole truth; at which point Honnie takes control of the myth, and reverses it utterly.As dark and obsessive as The Blue Hour is, I had more fun writing this than any of my previous novels, and I think that often shows up on the page. When it was published there was immediate film interest. Producers and development executives (and investors, even one from Iran) began calling and sending letters, and I personally received several calls from a man involved with a hit TV show who was desperate to make the movie. Eventually a writer/producer contacted me through my agent and we discussed at length how he wanted to approach the project. He would write the script, which was fine by me, especially as final approval by me was written into the contract, and once that was completed he'd begin to attach talent and start raising money for the film.We actually got pretty far. Some major talent was attached (and some major talent, to my dismay, dismissed by him), lots of stars were interested, and eventually we had a director and all the principals cast save for the male lead. He had someone in mind he wanted very much, and while waiting to hear from him, a director was attached and virtually all the financing was in place.Until it wasn't. Because no male lead was as yet secured, the major financiers backed off, and the project died. Now that the book is back in print, I'm hoping there will once again be film interest. This time I'd like to adapt it, update it, shift the action to Los Angeles, and make the detective the center of the story.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cora is the proud mother of 11 children and over 100 grandchildren.  Cora has always been an avid student of the Word of God but was moved by the eagerness of church members who desired that she share her knowledge of the book of Revelation. Consequently, she began to organize her material and develop in-depth lessons to share. Many credit her teaching with transforming their biblical understanding and inspiring a deeper passion for the Word of God. Cora's humility and willingness to impart her knowledge has been a blessing to a countless number of believers.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bion has taken his place as one of the foremost psychoanalysts of our time, yet it is only within recent years that the impact of his achievements are being felt. His death has stilled his pen and voice but demands a restatement of his view by those who have been most influenced by him. Bion's greatness lay, not only in the odd vertices of his incredible observations, but in the resources of his epistemological vastness, his respect for truth obtained in the disciplined absence of memory and desire, and his paying such scrupulous attention to and interpreting of recombinant constructions he achieved with mental elements their functions, and their transformations. His was the Language of Achievement, which is the tongue begotten by patience. Of note is his introduction of Plato's theory of forms and Kant's categories into psychoanalytic metapsychology, to sat nothing of his mathematical, group and religious theories.The contributors to this memorial all knew him either as analysands, supervisees, or colleagues. Virtually all of the psychoanalysts-analysands of Melanie Klein are represented as well, bearing testimony to his importance as a pathfinder for post-Kleinian thinking, to say nothing of post-Freudian. Their contributions can be thought of as prisms which refract Bion's profound but often recondite Language of Achievement into the differentiated color spectrum of sensible meaning for clinical reflection and practice.Contributors include: Ignacio Matte Blanco, Robert H.

Stoker winner Straub pays a deliciously macabre visit to the universe of his expansive Blue Rose trilogy (Koko, Mystery, The Throat). In attics (\"Blue Rose\"), movie theaters (\"The Juniper Tree\"), sickrooms (\"Bunny Is Good Bread\"), and the jungles of Vietnam (\"The Ghost Village\"), a touch of the supernatural heightens the horror of purely human cruelty that turns innocents into victims and warps victims into monsters. Though newcomers will find the collection easily accessible, Blue Rose fans will especially enjoy the further exploration of familiar characters and their horribly formative childhood years. Readers of dark fiction will not want to miss this chilling addition to Straub's extensive bibliography.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She loves challenging herself and would write on a dare. On a normal day, she would be found in her herb garden collecting spices for her kitchen or ingredients for her potions; in her huge eclectic Provencal kitchen with the big modern oven cooking pots and pans of food for her family of one husband and three kids (an ardent daughter and two boisterous sons) that'll probably last for weeks; in her library with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and an e-reader in her hands as she reads the latest short story erotic hit; or scribbling pages upon pages of different erotic lifestyles, searching for the one that feels like it was inspired by just the right mix of passion, storyline, and sex. She loves going crazy on weekend nights with the hubby. Aside from these activities, the rest of the time she'd be found in front of her laptop typing the latest Sandra Ross concoction for her readers.", "related": ["B00CB719H8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 44.0}

Though the language is lyrical, Winton pares it down, deliberately simplifying his prose in the service of a clearly articulated call for ecological responsibility. Abel Jackson lives in isolated area of Australia between a national park and the sea, where he helps his mother dive for abalone; his father is dead. When he's 10, he encounters a huge, magnificent blue grouper he names Blueback, a fish legendary for its cleverness and daring. Danger arrives in the form of a vicious fisherman whose predatory methods despoil the bay and put Blueback at risk. Though Abel's mother manages to drive the fisherman away, Abel learns that \"there was nothing in nature as cruel and savage as a greedy human being.\" Over the years, unprincipled developers, pollution and other man-made disasters threaten the bay's pristine beauty before Abel's mother persuades legislators to declare the area a sanctuary. Abel, now a marine biologist, decides to abandon his international career to devote his life to the priceless natural domain where Blueback continues to swim?and to bond with another generation of Jacksons. The book is perhaps more suitable for YA readers than adults, but Winton pulls deftly on the heartstrings as he narrates this quiet tale.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Along with his wife, Sharon, he is co-author of over eighty internationally-published novels. Originally born in Chicago a long time ago, Sharon Ahern met her future husband and co-writer, Jerry Ahern, on the very first day of High School, and they became friends for life. They eventually married and had two wonderful kids, Jason and Samantha, and five beautiful grandchildren. Sharon began her writing career in the public relations department of Illinois Bell Telephone and stringing for a local newspaper. Always an avid researcher—Sharon was always eager to do book reports and term papers—she was happy to pull out the Britannica and become an instant expert on whatever information Jerry needed for a story, whether a particular time in history or facts concerning a far away place. Now the musty volumes have been replaced with the internet. She has interviewed people on a wide range of topics such as Voodoo practices and biker gangs. Sharon is also a professional photographer, her works having been published in magazines throughout the world. When not working with Jerry, Sharon enjoys reading, antiquing, and gardening in the long Georgia summers, where they have resided for over thirty years.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This novel was followed by a collaboration with Elly Grant to produce 'Twists and Turns' a book of short stories and flash fiction. Alike his central character in 'Ring Fenced,' (Benjamin Short), Zach Abrams completed his education in Scotland and went on to a career in business and finance.  He is married with two children.  He plays no instruments but has an eclectic taste in music, although not as obsessive as Benjamin. Unlike Benjamin, he does not maintain mistresses, write pornography and (sadly) he does not have ownership of such a valuable company.  He is not a sociopath (at least by his own reckoning) and all versions of his life are aware of and freely communicate with each other. Zach has completed his second novel 'Made a Killing' which has recently been published.  This is a fast moving, gripping novel set in the tough crime-ridden streets of Glasgow. More in keeping with ‘Made a Killing,’ Zach was raised in Glasgow and has spent many years working in Central Scotland", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 4.5833, "rating_total": 55.0}

She likes creating whole characters as well as ‘quickie’ stories where she never names the participants and the reader places themselves in the story.  As her short story readers read and realize the depth of the longer stories and then get introduced to her books she hopes they come to love the characters she has developed.  She has found writing to be a multiple personality experience, these characters live inside of her mind and to exorcise them from her brain she put them down on paper (not literally).  That way, they are preserved for all time.  She is ALL of her characters and yet, NONE of them.  The feedback she has gotten from her readers is amazing, the vested interest in the stories and books, she doesn’t think anyone can NOT love hearing how a story made them laugh, cry, and fall in love, how they felt a similarity in their own lives, how they relate.  It really makes the reader a part of the story they are reading.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a registered Professional Engineer (Saskatchewan), LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Accredited Professional in Building Design and Construction, Certified Energy Auditor and Certified Level One Thermographer, Shane uses his skills to advance the practice of commissioning in both buildings and industrial processes. Shane founded Future Proof Commissioning Solutions Inc./ Future Proof Software Solutions Ltd. with the objective of helping society by promoting the practice of commissioning, educating the public about energy saving/renewable technologies and preparing society for the uncertainties of tomorrow. Shane’s career began as a Programmer Analyst for Saskatchewan Government Insurance. Driven by his passion for the environment, Shane found a job with Honeywell Building Solutions where he worked as an Automation Technician, performing preventative maintenance and service work in over 50 buildings spanning multiple facility types, including hospitals, schools, office buildings, care homes, post-secondary institutions, malls, recreation facilities, pools and even a science center with a live butterfly hatchery.  This led to a project management position at Integrated Designs Inc. where Shane learned how to assist owners and project teams to ensure project success through the implementation of the commissioning process. It was here that Shane project managed and performed the commissioning of several large construction projects, including the Dube Center for Mental Health, Humboldt Hospital, Credit Union Center (re-commissioning), and several LEED projects including Meadow Lake Provincial Court House, Red Deer Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment the Moose Jaw Multiplex, among several others. This experience has also reached into the industrial realm with the commissioning of the Raw Water pumping station for the City of Saskatoon and the commissioning of the Buffalo Pound Water Pumping Station North project. Shane is in the process of partnering with Habitat for Humanity Saskatoon to implement the commissioning process for affordable home construction. By combining his knowledge of energy efficiency and the commissioning process, Shane is set to demonstrate that highly efficient housing can be constructed in a cost-effective manner if the proper mindset is implemented.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice, he wrote his first novel, No Orchids for Miss Blandish. Despite the American setting of many of his novels, Chase (like Peter Cheyney, another hugely successful British noir writer) never lived there, writing with the aid of maps and a slang dictionary. He had phenomenal success with the novel, which continued unabated throughout his entire career, spanning 45 years and nearly 90 novels. His work was published in dozens of languages and over thirty titles were adapted for film. He served in the RAF during World War II, where he also edited the RAF Journal. In 1956 he moved to France with his wife and son; they later moved to Switzerland, where Chase lived until his death in 1985.", "related": ["B00HJUDTHA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Russell regularly contributes to Adoption.com. He also writes his own blog at russellelkins.com to educate others in the struggles and beauties of open adoption. Russell has always been a family man at heart, looking forward to the day when he could be a husband and a father. It took him a little while, but eventually his eyes locked onto a beautiful blonde, and he has never looked away. Russell and Jammie were married in 2004. They had the same goals for their home and didn't want to wait too long before starting their family. However, filling their home quickly with children wasn't in the cards, and they found themselves weighing their options to overcome problems with infertility. Their lives changed dramatically the day they decided to adopt. Russell and Jammie have adopted two beautiful children, Ira and Hazel, and have embraced their role as parents through open adoption. Both are actively engaged in the adoption community by communicating through social media, taking part in discussion panels, and writing songs about adoption. Russell was born on Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, D.C., in the fall of 1977. Along with his five siblings, he and his military family moved around a lot, living in eight different houses by the time he left for college at age 17. Although his family moved away from Fallon, Nevada, just a few months after he moved out, he still considers that little oasis in the desert to be his childhood hometown. Even after leaving home, Russell always stayed close to his family. He shared an apartment with each of his three brothers at different times during his college career. They formed a band together back in the 1990s and still perform on a regular basis under the name of the Invisible Swordsmen. After nearly a decade of college and changing his major a few times, Russell received his bachelor's degree in sociology from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. He later graduated from Ameritech College where he learned the trade of being a dental lab technician. Russell now owns and operates Elkins Dental Lab located in Meridian, Idaho.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lilliana feels that the world should see Australia for more than just it's outback and tries to show characters in more of a city setting.

In Purses, Pearls & Pumps: Straight Talk About Women and Finances, Bonita Vinson PhD talks about the end result of living in luxury when they can't afford it and offers advice for overcoming this powerful grip that has a choke-hold on their finances. She proposes three basic questions and then offers the answers to them. How did we get this way? What can we do to fix the problem? What will it take to change? Bonita then covers the financial myths that often lead to the extravagant overspending lifestyle and gives sound advice on how to cut those tightly wrapped cords which are holding us back from financial freedom. Using stories from her own struggles and those of women that she has helped coach, she clearly and concisely lays out a pattern to follow and practical means for rising above those struggles.There is hope even for the most ruthless offender in Bonita Vinson's book. With a delicate, but straight forward approach, Bonita will coach you toward a lifestyle that is much more practical and offers a great deal more freedom. Informative, encouraging and no-nonsense, Purses, Pearls & Pumps: Straight Talk About Women and Finances is precisely what American women, who find themselves trapped in a financial struggle, need to get them back on track and breathing a sigh of relief.\" ~Reviewed by Bil Howard for Readers' Favorite", "related": [], "rank": 2241559, "title": "Purses, Pearls & Pumps", "author": "Bonita Vinson", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My son Tom is a Native Peruvian born in the Andes Mountains. We were attending a powwow in Iowa, watching a circle dance with chanting and drums, when an elderly Native American woman came up to us. She asked me if my son had a name, and I introduced him as Thomas.“No,” she said. “Hisrealname.”I shook my head, her meaning sinking in. “No, Grandmother.” I explained that Tom was from South America.“North, South, all the same,” she said, waving her hand. She pulled Tom close, looked into his eyes at length, covered his heart with her hand, and rested her other hand on top of his head, where his shiny black hair matched that of the dancers.“His name is Winter Hawk. Make sure he always knows it.”I was too stunned to say anything more than, “Yes, Grandmother.” My son will never forget his real name, and I will never forget the way he got it.", "related": ["B00E3ERICC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In A World of Words by Rafael Lopez, the author creates another planet with life and culture; we see this culture through the poetry of this world, written by the poets of this planet. Even now Rafael seeks to extend the world in his writing, rather than the poetry that we see the world with. James Joyce similarly created (rather re-created) an old world from literature, that of Ulysses, and gave us a surreal experience in this newly formed world. But Joyce is some heavy reading and one must flow with the stream of consciousness writing to appreciate the prose. So has Vincenzo brought us The Horror Show. It is a novel. It is an anthology of poetry. It is prose. It is stream of consciousness nightmare. I selected two \"works\" from the book; a poem and a structured piece of writing that is something between a series of paragraphs degenerating into prose, then what appears to be a stanza. Keep in mind that although there are chapters in this book, they are not conventional. We saw this concept carried out seamlessly in William Cook's Moment of Freedom, but without the structure of a novel; his was poetry. Bilof's pretends to be a story in poem form, a poem in story form, and something in between.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 24.0}

The Predominant Inattentive type demonstrates as difficulties performing tasks, paying attention, organizing tasks and following directions. The person may forget details of performing tasks or may become distracted from the task at hand. The Predominantly Hyperactive or Impulsive type has difficulty sitting still, may run around constantly, and find many outlets for physical activity rather than sit in one place. The person may also interrupt people in conversation, grab things away from people at inappropriate times or speak out of turn. The impulsivity can demonstrate as frequent accidents or injuries. The Combined type of ADHD can show all of these symptoms in approximately equal amounts. Terence has been married for nine years to a wife that suffers from ADHD and it is his self-taught expertise that has allowed him to have a long and healthy relationship. You should pick up a copy of his book The Effect ADHD Has on Marriage to gain more insights into how you can save your marriage and how to recognize the signs in your spouse.", "related": ["B00J39O33E"], "rank": 1438860, "title": "The Effect ADHD Has On Marriage", "author": "Terence Williams", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The creative mind is well known for its explosive imagination and deep thoughts, but occasionally artists are also known for their lack of logic and business savvy. The last thing some of those writers want to do is think about business strategy, marketing, etc. However, it is crucial in today's market of self-publishing, independent publishing houses, and 99 cent Amazon e-books for authors and aspiring authors to understand every aspect of their industry. In Marketing Plans for Self-published Books, Hank Quense leads us through the process, step by step, teaching authors how to be their own personal publishing companies and teaching the basics of marketing, promotions, and editing. Bits of humor sprinkled throughout the book took away the dull edge of a typical self-help book and actively helped keep me engaged as a reader. The content was great. As an aspiring writer myself, this book was very helpful. I learned a lot of tips and tidbits that I hadn't heard before, in addition to getting an overview of the known policies and procedures in getting your book published. I loved a lot of the marketing tips including the discussion about book trailers and blog tours. I also blog, and I know firsthand what a great partnership that can be. I thought that in his Self-Publishing Guides, Hank Quense is very easy to relate to and does a great and thorough job discussing the topic.", "related": [], "rank": 2474584, "title": "Marketing Plans for Self-published Books (Self-publishing Guides) eBook", "author": "Hank Quense", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 27.0}

As a professor who has taught courses on the topic of leisure and aging for over 30 years, I especially recommend this book to those who are planning to retire within the next five to ten years. It could help make the difference between a successful retirement and the depression that so many professionals experience shortly after they retire.(Michael J. Leitner, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Recreation and Parks Management at California State University, Chico)Planning Your Time in Retirementis a book only Robert Stebbins could write. Not only has Stebbins had a highly successful career as a social scientist, rigorously studying leisure at its best, but he is well-known as a gifted story-teller able to communicate his insights by vividly bringing to life the people he studies. The scientist and the story-teller are evident in this book. Stebbins does a wonderful job of describing ways in which serious, project-based, and casual leisure can be mixed and balanced with the demands of the rest of life to create meaningful retirement lifestyles. The ideas he presents help readers understand the diverse ways in which they can construct lifestyles that contribute to successful aging consistent with their financial resources and social and psychological needs.(Roger C. Mannell, Ph.D., professor of Leisure Studies and Public Health; director of RBC Retirement Research Centre, University of Waterloo)Robert A. Stebbins explains how those nearing retirement (or those who are retired) might achieve a \"life of leisure.\" So often, we as leisure scholars bemoan the lack of understanding of the benefits of leisure in society today and we encourage people to learn more about the value of leisure. This book teaches the retiree or soon to be retiree about various forms of leisure and how to cultivate a leisure lifestyle. Stebbins presents the principles of his serious leisure framework alongside his philosophy of \"positive simplicity\" to show retirees how they can make the most of the opportunities presented to them by the freedom from work and other responsibilities afforded people in later life. So rather than dreading retirement, Stebbins encourages retirees not only to embrace this time, but also provides them with a lot of good suggestions as to how they might go about it.(Heather Gibson, professor of Tourism, Recreation and Sport Management, University of Florida)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From her experience in college as a peer counselor and her volunteer work with women's shelters, she was inspired to write contemporary romance with social issues for women, new adults, young adults, and teens.

Looking for a quick healthy way to lose some weight herself, she came across new medical research showing the extensive benefits of intermittent fasting, even beyond what you’d expect from the health improvements one gets from getting rid of unwanted pounds. “What a break through! This makes so much sense!”  But she realized that the real problem that stops us all from succeeding at losing weight is the many times we’ve tried and failed in the past. We have so much baggage associated with dieting.  Looking into the psychology of weight loss, she stumbled upon a seemingly unrelated article describing how each of us usually has a strength and a weakness among the three areas life expertise; relationships, work/finances, and health. (And the third area could be either a strength or a weakness or somewhere in between.) Thinking about that, it occurred to her that if someone’s weakness was health, allowing them to become overweight, then their strength could be either relationships or work/finance, or both. So, why not just remove this process from the category of health, and treat it like work, like a job “that pays really well”!  She tried it on herself, researched it some more, finding many, many people who had the same startlingly strange experiences with it, all motivating her to rush to get the technique into print.", "related": ["B0063IK6UM"], "rank": 2328351, "title": "BLUE SHIRT WEIGHT LOSS: This is Weight Loss with a Real Twist!

Debra also writes fiction--Historial Western Romance, Contemporary Romance, Fantasy Romance, and Science Fiction. Her Montana Sky series, sweet historical Western romances, is published by Amazon Montlake. The Gods' Dream Trilogy (fantasy romance) is available on Kindle. The common publishing philosophy is that an author should take different pen names for different kinds of book or \"the reader will be confused.\" Debra thinks her readers are smart enough to distinguish between her various books. Thus, she's publishing everything under her own name. Debra lives in Southern California and has one dogs and two cats. She's a second degree blackbelt and teaches martial arts.

Along with that illustrious lineage, she was related to vaudeville performers, horse trainers, cowboys, entrepreneurs, teachers, and preachers. With such diversity surrounding her from childhood, she still managed to grow up and develop a deep love of books. It was only natural that along the way, she would write them too. The Survivors: The Time of Chaos is her first published novel. More will undoubtedly follow.  Freak Files: The Unexplained Tales is a collection of stories believed to be true to life. After decades of experimental cooking, much to her family’s chagrin (after all, the family is inflicted with the less-than-wonderful versions that never see print!) Gia began writing food articles and a food blog.  It was inevitable that cookbooks would follow.  This is the fifteenth cookbook.  Previous titles include: All Chocolate—Easy & Economical Recipes Anyone Can Make At Home, 55 Fantastic Fudges, The All American Biscuit, 56+ Marvelous Homemade Mixes, 55 Frightfully Fun  Foods, A Home Style Thanksgiving, At Grandma’s Stove, The Poverty Perspective Cookbook: Recipes for Rock Bottom Budgets , My Precious Cookbook , Dips and Spreads and No Naked Nachos.  Most titles are available in both print and digital editions. Today, after many incarnations along the way, Gia Scott lives in Mississippi with her husband, three dogs, and two cats in a funny little house surrounded by very big and gnarly trees. Having reached that age of privilege, she can often be found in her garden, wearing peculiar clothes and tending her plants. When she can talk her husband into it, they enjoy going for road trips, looking for the elusive town of New Hope. In between road trips and gardening, she manages to fit in an internet radio talk show called the Dawn of Shades, interviewing a variety of people, including other authors, and promoting causes dear to her heart. In addition to all of that, she still maintains blogs on general topics, cooking & food, and camping, emergency preparedness & outdoors activities. She also helps with content for websites.", "related": ["B00JK7QZT4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the early 90's she sold her gallery and moved her central part of life to Europe. At first she lived for a couple of years in Lisbon, Copenhagen, Moscow and London until, in 1999, she decided to move to Berlin for good. Here, she has been living with her family happily and peacefully for 15 years and is leading a successful life as a writer, life coach, consultant and artist.

Instead she lets the story grow with it. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Sandeflay. It parallels our world but some things are so much more advanced just as some things seem primitive in an exotic kind of way. This story is rich in characters, love, eroticism and beautiful fantasy. Linda Mooney has done an excellent job of penning a story that will be fun for anyone who likes to get lost in a great book.\" - Dee Dailey, The Romance StudioA Simply Romance Reviews OUTSTANDING READ! \"Let me tell you, the shocks and wow's in this book are outstanding. Sandeflay sounds like a place I would love to visit or even live. This book is full of life and the people are wonderfully real. Collin is hunk and in a few paragraphs you fall for him hard. Randi is a strong woman, and when she finds that place inside her, the one that she hid years ago, that lady is one that is so easy to like and in time you cheer for her and Collin. Especially when Linda throws one more extra surprise into the mix. Great book, a definite keeper.\" -Grade A- Reviewed by Melisa, Simply Romance Reviews5 Enchantments!\"I loved this story. It had the entire heart-string-pulling you come to expect from Ms. Mooney, but always with a little something extra. She never disappoints her readers.\" - Reviewed by Melanie, Enchanting ReviewsBlue Ribbon Rating: 5\"SANDEFLAY is an absolutely stunning read by Ms. Mooney; her characters are endearing and her fictional world of Sandeflay is a place I would be delighted to visit.

They are reinventing and revitalizing publishing with serialized novels, short stories, novellas, and niche nonfiction. They're also experimenting with creative marketing, promotional ingenuity, and collaborative alliances.Self-publishing releases authors from the shackles of traditional publishing. Never-before-published authors are bypassing the gatekeepers and forging ahead on their own, some earning 'street creds' in the self-publishing world and backing into traditional publishing from the outside in while setting their own ground rules. Established authors are reacquiring rights to their backlist, publishing ebooks under their own imprint, and branching out into other genres.Whether working from the inside-out or the outside-in, many authors are setting their sights on a 'hybrid' writing career, successfully melding independent publishing with traditional publishing. Some are opting out of traditional publishing altogether. And in some ways, indie authors have become the leaders, and traditional publishers and literary agents the followers.If you've been toying with the idea of self-publishing, join the revolution.

A master of the short form, in her lifetime Teffi published countless stories, plays and feuilletons. After her death, she was gradually forgotten, but the collapse of the Soviet Union brought about her rediscovery by Russian readers.

It has everything. Exquisite details, world-weary voice, and people worth knowing. It is truly amazing!MaryAnn KoltonAuthor and Editor of This Literary Magazine Strong, compelling, raw and human in the best sense. Beautifully written.Susan TepperAuthor of Deer and Other Stories Perfect, compact and explosive, closing with the gentlest word. No one should miss it.James Lloyd DavisAuthor of Knitting the Unraveled Sleeves A staggering work of excellence and deserves to see the light of day in the Paris Review or a similar quality publication. It is absolutely worthy of a spot in the New Yorker or Atlantic monthly. It has such an engaging, cinematic quality, and such ferocious language. The quality of this work is so far superior to the best that I can think of.J. A. JohnsonAuthor of Falling The voice here is more sculptor than painter to me--words hammered into place, into the exactly suited shape and shine, and scratches. The fierce language has the smell of metal to it, too, of twisted thoughts fused and rusted with pink water. Dynamite prose. So good it hurts.Barry FriesenAuthor of Hat Trick Wow. Beautiful and wonderful and sad and real.Sally HoutmanAuthor of To Grandma's House, We...Stay Beautiful and moving, wonderfully sustained.Rachael J. FentonAuthor of Escape Behaviours Superbly explosive. The rage escaltes and careens out of control. Amazing.Ajay NairAuthor of Desi Rap Gorgeous language. Well travelled, methodically, memorized paths, used up -- such a perfect description of that universal need to connect and its ugliness, rather than the ugliness of desperate people. What people do over and over to not be alone.Lauren BeckerEditor of Corium Magazine and Author of author of Shut Up/Look Pretty This feels terribly real. Emotional depth, choice of physical/psychological detail, voice is keen. Wonderful writing and real, vivid people. This work is frighteningly good. Meg PokrassAuthor of Bird Envy The language is unbelievable - heady - took me and pulled me into the drama and intensity of feeling, without being saccharine or syrupy. Well done.Yvette Wielhouwer ManaganAuthor and Editor of The Linnet's Wing Let's talk about a cruise, a cruise you don't want to be on, a cruise recommended to you by your analyst, a cruise as recovery from a marriage gone bad. That's what Rose's \"Floater\" is about. What makes it so fun, though, is the voice. Years ago, on first reading Catcher in the Rye, it was the voice that astounded me there. The voice had attitude. Attitude makes for great writing. But it can also make for bad writing, if it's overdone. Finding the balance is harder to achieve than one might initially think. Rosenblatt does that here. And what makes the surly, don't-want-to-be-here voice so much more interesting is that it's happening on vacation. If there's any time to lay off the cynicism, an expensive trip on a ship is it. Not our narrator, though. He really isn't happy to be alive. And somehow we're glad to hear that.Short Story Reader In one of the best moments in Rose's story, the narrator recounts how the life of the drummer is one of numbers, of counting. The passage is beautiful, and this concern--with time, with counting, with the beat of the heart--is what the story focuses on. Rose uses the drumming motif throughout the story to tell a sadder, deeper story of a relationship heading south.Short Story Reader, on The Beat Of Sorrow \"Beautiful and moving, wonderfully sustained.\"Rachel J. FentonAuthor of Escape Behaviors \"I'm usually on guard against the extended metaphor, but you pull it off, and more than once, in the course of a few pages, in second person no less. A merciless character study.\"John MinichilloAuthor of The Snow Whale", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
