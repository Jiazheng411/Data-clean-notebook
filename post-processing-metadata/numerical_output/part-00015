Yet when she died in 2003 at the age of 97, her accomplishment was often mentioned in newspaper obituaries in only a few brief lines. British journalist and historian Mortimer has done Ederle—and sports history in general—a huge service in this wonderfully written book by detailing what was one of the biggest media events of the 1920s: the attempt by four Americans to become the first woman to swim and survive the brutal waters of the channel. He explores in great depth their differing personalities as well as the effects the race had on their lives. He also explains the cultural impact of the great Swim, such as how the revolution in women's bathing suits from a neck-to-knee bathing dress over woolen tights and shoes to a two-piece bathing suit was a key event in getting the International Olympic Committee to begin incorporating more swimming events into its women's schedule.(Feb.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Every detail of Cavendish's universe comes to life, from architect John Smithson's designs for his exquisite home to the job descriptions and diets of the building site's laborers. Also vividly described is a nasty household plot against Cavendish's much younger second wife and a costly entertainment staged by Cavendish to curry favor with Charles I. It succeeded, and the King made William earl, marquis, his heir's tutor and a Civil War general, a commission beyond Cavendish's abilities. After a key battle of the war ended in disaster, Cavendish fled to the continent, lived in relative poverty and was branded a coward, but his fortunes rebounded under Charles II, who minted him duke of Newcastle. Although fascinating, this diligently documented account reveals its roots as a doctoral thesis. 16-page color insert, b&w illus.(Oct. 20)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He was cruising along Highway 191, headed north through the most unpopulated part of Montana, when he saw her.At first he blinked, convinced she had to be a mirage, since he hadn't even seen another car in hours. But there she was, standing beside the road, hip cocked, thumb out, a mane of long, ginger hair falling past her shoulders, blue jeans snug-fitting from her perfect behind down her impossibly long legs.Jack slowed, already having doubts before he stopped next to her in his vintage, pale yellow Cadillac convertible. Just the sight of her kicked up the heat on an already warm May day.She had a face that would make any man look twice. He watched her take in the restored convertible first then sweep her green-eyed gaze over him. He thought of warm, tropical sea breezes.Until he looked closer. As warm as the day was, she wore a jean jacket, the collar turned up. He caught a glimpse of a stained T-shirt underneath. Her sneakers looked wet, like her hair. Her clothes were dusty and the cuffs of her jeans wet and muddy.He'd seen an empty campground in the cottonwoods as he passed the Missouri River, but it was still early in this part of Montana to be camping, since the nights would be cold. It was especially too early to be bathing in the river, but he had to assume that was exactly what she'd done.\"Going any place in particular?\" he asked, worried what she was doing out here in the middle of nowhere all alone. Assuming that was the case. He glanced toward the silky-green pine trees lining the road, half-expecting her boyfriend to come barreling out of them at any minute. But then, that was the way his suspicious mind worked.\"Up the highway.\" She leaned down to pick up the dirty backpack at her feet. It appeared as road worn as she was.All Jack's instincts told him he'd regret giving this woman a ride. But it was what he glimpsed in her eyes that made up his mind. A little fear was normal for a woman traveling alone in the middle of nowhere. This woman was terrified of something.He saw her glance back down the highway toward the river, that terror glittering in all that green.\"Then I guess you're going my way.\" He smiled, wondering what the hell this woman was running from and why he was opening himself up to it. Any fool knew that a woman on the run had trouble close at her heels. \"Hop in.\"She swung the backpack to her shoulder, straightened the collar of her jean jacket and shot another look back down the lonesome highway.Jack glanced in his rearview, half-afraid of what had her so scared. Heat rose from the empty two-lane blacktop. He caught a glimpse of the river below them, the dark surface glistening in the morning sunlight. A hawk squawked as it soared on a current coming up out of the river. A cloud passed overhead, throwing the rugged ravines and gullies choked with scrub juniper and pine into shadow.As he turned back, she was apologizing for her muddy sneakers.\"Don't worry about that,\" he said, figuring this woman had a lot more to worry about than getting his car dirty.As he reached across to open her door, she dropped her backpack onto the passenger-side floorboard and slid into the seat, closing the door behind her.Jack tried to shove off his second thoughts about picking up a total stranger on the run from beside the road in such a remote, isolated place as he watched her settle into the soft leather.He couldn't miss the way she pulled her bulging backpack protectively between her feet. The backpack, like her T-shirt, was stained with dirt and splattered with something dark the color of dried blood.\"Name's Jack. Jack Winchester.\" Then he asked, \"I'm on my way to the Winchester Ranch. You don't happen to know the Winchesters, do you?\"\"I don't know a living soul in Montana.\" She took his outstretched hand. Her skin was silky smooth and just as cool. \"Josey.\" Her eyes widened a little, as if that had just slipped out. \"Josey Smith.\"She'd stumbled on the last name, a clear lie. It made him wonder again who or what was after her. \"Nice to meet you, Josey.\" He told himself he was just giving her a ride up the road as far as the turnoff to the ranch.Shifting the Caddie into gear, he took off. As they topped the mountain and left the river and wild country of the Breaks behind, he saw her take one last look back. But the fear didn't leave her eyes as they roared down the long, empty highway.Josey fought to still the frantic pounding of her heart. She didn't want this man to see how desperate she was. She was still shaking inside as she turned up the collar on her jean jacket and lay back against the seat.She needed time to think. It still wasn't clear to her what had happened back there on the river.Liar.She closed her eyes, trying to block it all out. But the memory was too fresh. Just like the pain. She could still see the car breaking the dark green surface and sinking, hear the gurgling sound as water rushed in, see the huge bubbles that boiled to the surface.She'd stumbled and fallen as she scaled the rocky bluff over the river, then worked her way through the pines, not daring to look back. She'd only just broken out of the trees and onto the highway when she'd heard the growl of an engine and spotted the Cadillac coming up the hill. It was the first vehicle she'd seen or heard in hours.Holding her breath and reining in her urge to run, she'd stuck out her thumb—and prayed. Her only hope was to get as far away as she could. She'd been scared the driver of the Cadillac wouldn't stop for her. She could just imagine the way she looked.But he had stopped, she thought. That alone made her wary. She tried to concentrate on the warm spring breeze on her face, telling herself she was alive. It seemed a miracle. She'd gotten away. She was still shaking, though, still terrified after the horror of the past two days.She opened her eyes, fighting the urge to look back down the highway again, and glanced over at the man who'd picked her up. Under normal circumstances she would have thought twice about getting into a car with a complete stranger, especially out here where there were no houses, no people, nothing but miles and miles of nothing.Jack Winchester looked like a rancher in his jeans, boots, and fancy Western shirt. His dark blond hair curled at his nape under the black Stetson. She glanced down at her own clothing and cringed. She looked as if she'd been wallowing in the dirt. She had.Furtively, she brushed at her jeans and, unable to refrain any longer, turned to look back down the highway.Empty.She felt tears sting her eyes. He wasn't coming after her. He couldn't ever hurt her again. She shuddered at the thought.Not that it was over. By now California criminal investigators would have put out an all-points bulletin on her. Before long she'd be wanted in all fifty states for murder—and they didn't know the half of it.Ahead, the Little Rockies were etched purple against the clear blue sky of the spring day. As the land changed from the deep ravines and rocky ridges of the Missouri Breaks to the rolling prairie, Jack watched his passenger out of the corner of his eye. She chewed at her lower lip, stealing glances in the side mirror at the highway behind them. She had him looking back, as well.Fortunately, the two-lane was empty.As he neared the turnoff to the ranch, Jack realized he couldn't just put her out beside the road. He couldn't imagine how she came to be hitchhiking, but his every instinct told him she was in danger.He could only assume it was from some man she'd hooked up with and later regretted. Whoever was after her, Jack didn't want him or her to catch up with his passenger.He knew it was crazy. The last thing he needed was to get involved in this woman's problems. But he also didn't want her blood on his hands.A thought crossed his mind. He prided himself at thinking on his feet. Also at using situations to his advantage.And it appeared fate had literally dropped this woman into his lap. Or at least dropped her into his Caddie. Josey couldn't have been more perfect if he'd ordered her from a catalog. The more he thought about it, the more he liked his idea, and he wondered why he hadn't thought of it before he'd agreed to this visit to the \"family\" ranch.He glanced over at her. She had her eyes closed again, her head back, her hair blowing behind her in a tangled wave of sun-kissed copper. She was stunning, but beyond that his instincts told him that this woman wasn't the type who normally found herself in this kind of position beside a road, and possibly running for her life.Jack reminded himself that his instincts had also warned him not to pick her up back there.He smiled to himself. Taking chances was nothing new to him, nor was charming his way to what he wanted. He'd been told that he could talk a rattlesnake out of its venom without even a bite. He knew he could talk this woman into what he had in mind or his name wasn't Jack Winchester.But he didn't figure it would take much charming. He had a feeling she'd go for his proposal because she needed this more than he did.\"So, Josey, how do you feel about marriage?\" he asked as they cruised down the vacant two-lane headed toward Whitehorse, Montana.\"Marriage?\"she asked, opening one eye.Jack grinned. \"I have a proposition for you.\"Josey had been taken aback, instantly suspicious until he explained that he was on his way to see his grandmother, who was in her seventies.\"She has more money than she knows what to do with and lives on a huge ranch to the east of here,\" Jack said. \"You'd be doing me a huge favor, and I'd make it worth your while. The ranch is sixty miles from the nearest town and a good ten from the nearest neighbor.\"A remote ranch. Could she really get this lucky? He was offering her exactly what she needed, as if he knew how desperate she was.

From the child on the playground to the lawyer in the courtroom, everybody negotiates at some time. Even the people who say they don't like to negotiate are negotiating. The simple fact is that negotiations affect every aspect of our lives.Children, and certainly my son, seem to be born to negotiate. They know how to negotiate bedtime, a little more television, a little less broccoli, and so many other things. But there is so much more to negotiating than the simple tools we learned as children. In fact, negotiations can be very sophisticated depending on the situation. Yet at the same time, negotiations can be very simple. Negotiations primarily depend on using the right tools at the right time.Luckily, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to be a good negotiator. In fact, being a rocket scientist might make you a worse negotiator because they may complicate matters unnecessarily by over-thinking the problem. (no offense to rocket scientists, including my sister-in-law, who happens to be one). Negotiating well can be very easily accomplished. You only have to keep in mind a few simple concepts:The nature of the negotiation is affected by the relationship with the other person.Each side's interests are more important than each side's positions.In negotiations, just as in life, the little things often count more than the big things.No matter what you do, you cannot convince another person to do things for your reasons. You must convince people to do things based upon their own reasons.There is no magic technique or trick that will make people do things in negotiations.This book is designed to provide you with the tools and techniques that will help you negotiate better in all situations. There are many different techniques. Not every technique will be useful in every situation. However, these techniques will provide you with ways to handle most negotiating situations. Finding out which technique works in which situation will probably require some experimentation on your part.This book is divided into stages of negotiations. Each stage contains different things that can and will happen, and each section is designed to provide specific techniques that may apply in that particular stage of negotiation.It is helpful to think of negotiations like a game.  One of the best game examples that compares to negotiation is the game of chess.  Chess requires planning, strategy, execution, and follow up.  The same is true of negotiations.  In life, the negotiators are the chess pieces.  Usually, in negotiations, just as in chess, a team is required to win the game.  As such, you will see some chess related themes throughout the book.Finally, becoming a successful negotiator requires you to practice your craft. Exercise the new skills you learn in this book--go to swap meets, and take joy in negotiating over a product. Go to a department store and see if you can get a discount. Try some techniques on your family and friends.The more you practice these skills, the more you will find that certain techniques work better in some situations than in others.Happy negotiating!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Arriving in Australia as a ships' surgeon, he abandons his Royal Navy duties and answers the call of the gold rush. Travelling south to the very edge of civilization, he leaves a trail of unfinished business and ill will. When responsibility closes in, he once again runs, this time to the goldfields at Kiandra in the southern alps.Confronted by a huge blaze as the bush becomes an inferno, he stands shoulder to shoulder with the other 'diggers' to fight for their lives. Uncharacteristically, he then again risks his life, dashing back over the mountains in the wake of the fire to rescue two settlers who he knows will be caught in its path.Tragedy awaits, one is dead and the other missing, seeking help for her injuries. His efforts to find her are thwarted at every turn by the consequences of his earlier behaviour. Driven by an emotion stronger than gold fever, he stands and faces his accusers, and in doing so, learns about respect and responsibility, trust and friendship.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

'dutifully report' is a bit harder on the tongue . . . As I continued . . . the meaning of the phrase began to resonate: 'dutifully' means that the speaker did or is reporting whatever, not so much of his own volition, but because as a soldier, everything he does is subject to his being ordered. The difference in meaning is huge . . . there are many other differences that I find reflect better on your translation. I speak German, so the use of the terms 'putzfleck' works MUCH better than Parrott's use of 'batman', which no longer retains much of its original meaning in English thanks to the comic book hero of the same name.

He was born at Somertown near Oxford, the son of the Rev. Stephen Phillips, precentor of Peterborough Cathedral. He was educated at Stratford and Peterborough Grammar Schools, and considered entering Queens' College, Cambridge on a minor scholarship to study classics; but he instead went to a London crammer to prepare for the civil service.   In 1894 he published Eremus, a long poem of loose structure in blank verse of a philosophical complexion. In 1896 appeared Christ in Hades, forming with a few other short pieces one of the slim paper-covered volumes of Elkin Mathews's Shilling Garland. This poem arrested the attention of watchful critics of poetry, and when it was followed by a collection of Poems in 1897 the writer's position as a new poet of exceptional gifts was generally recognized. This volume contained a new edition of Christ in Hades, together with Marpessa, The Woman with the Dead Soul, The Wife and shorter pieces, including To Milton, Blind. The volume won the prize of £100 offered by the Academy newspaper for the best new book of its year,[2] ran through half a dozen editions in two years, and established Phillips's rank as poet, which was sustained by the publication, in the Nineteenth Century in 1898 of his poem Endymion. Sir George Alexander, the actor-manager, moved perhaps by a certain clamour among the critics for a literary drama, then commissioned Phillips to write him a play, the result being Paolo and Francesca (1900), a drama founded on Dante's famous episode from Inferno. Encouraged by the great success of the drama in its literary form, Mr Alexander produced the piece at the St. James' Theatre in 1902.[3] In the meantime, Phillips's next play, Herod: a Tragedy, had been produced by Beerbohm Tree on the 31st of October 1900, and was published as a book in 1901; Ulysses, also produced by Beerbohm Tree, was published in 1902; The Sin of David, a drama on the story of David and Bathsheba, translated into the times and terms of Cromwellian England, was published in 1904; and Nero, produced by Beerbohm Tree, was published in 1906.", "related": ["B00BGCASN0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When he was four he was brought to Wellington, New Zealand, where his father became minister to the Kent Terrace Presbyterian Church. Elliott was educated at Wellington College and spent one year at the University of Otago Medical School. His father then sent him to the University of Edinburgh to complete his medical course. As a senior student he served with the medical corps in the South African War (1899–1902). As a result his father, who was ideologically opposed to the war and upset that Elliott had interrupted his studies, withdrew further financial support. Elliott had to obtain odd jobs and use his savings from military service to complete his medical education. He would later repay his father and the rift was repaired. Graduating MB, ChB in 1902, Elliott returned to New Zealand the following year and was the first house surgeon at Wellington District Hospital. He then began a surgical and general practice, serving also as honorary surgeon to the hospital. On 12 December 1905, at Wellington, he was married by his father to Annie Allan Forbes from Edinburgh; they were to have five children. In 1912 Elliott took the Edinburgh MD degree. He became a fellow of the American College of Surgeons in 1926 and, the following year, a foundation fellow of the College of Surgeons of Australasia.", "related": ["B00AVYSUQQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A likeable down-home narrator, Thurmond is a fount of golfing lore and commonsense, humorous asides. On the negative side, this easy-going tale suffers from an underdeveloped, semi-serious (some might say, ludicrous) ending.

The main characters were engaging and funny, in the quirky way I prefer, and the plot, while straight forward, was nicely handled and interesting. The love scenes were both sensual and bold, which is just the right mix, and both Lyla and Michael had a spot-on 'voice'...

Logan is home of Utah State University and the International Dutch Oven Society (IDOS). Dutch oven cooking has become almost a part of his daily life. When talking to people about ovens and what they can do with them he has often been heard saying \"Anything you can cook on your stove or in your oven, I can do in a Dutch oven, plus I can make ice cream.\" Dutch ovens have been a part of American history since the early settlers came to the \"New World\" from Europe and England, originally with either a flat or rounded bottom. In the mid 1700's, three legs were added to hold the pot above the hot coals. Today the pots are just about the same, with three legs, and a flanged lid has been added to keep ash from falling into the food when the lid is lifted. The aromas of great food fill the air of camp grounds, scout camps and back yards all through the year. The Dutch oven is a year round cooking tool to create everything that your mind can dream up. When cooking, just always keep in mind the quote from Cee Dub Welch: \"If it smells done, it's done. If it smells burnt, it's burnt.

Those who believe the Prophet’s cousin and son-in-law Ali was his legitimate successor are called the Shi’i, and Dabashi’s book is a fascinating look at this tradition viewed through the lens of such thinkers as Freud, Weber, Habermas, and others. Dabashi’s analysis of the foundational events of Shiism, namely the assassination of Ali, the subsequent murder of his son Husayn, and Muslims killing not just other Muslims but also the flesh and blood of the Prophet, lead him to conclude that Shiism is a religion of protest and revolt. But he also claims the moral authority and legitimacy of Shiism are lost when it succeeds politically, an interesting proposition given the political prominence of Shiism today in Iran as well as among the leaders of Hizbullah and some insurgents in Iraq. Dabashi’s book is not an introductory chronicle of names, dates, and events. Rather, it is a scholarly analysis of the tradition, engagingly written, for an advanced audience. --Christopher McConnell", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jim Jones kills an abortion doctor in Oregon and then eludes arrest. In Wisconsin, Barbara Hernandez loses her husband in a bank heist and then her unborn baby in a miscarriage. The bank robber, John Morales, is then sentenced to life in prison without parole. With the help of State Representative Thomas McCormick, Barbara works for the reinstatement of the death penalty in Wisconsin. Faced with what seems like an uphill battle, the two persist and in the process, they also fall in love with each other. In an interesting twist of events, Jim Jones, who is against the reinstatement of the death penalty, surfaces again. And the plot gets more interesting after this turn.This is a fast-paced novel that keeps the readers on their seats until they finish reading the book. Starting with the first pages of the book, we are presented with a police situation that makes us hunger to know the outcome of the events. Mickey Polansky's characters are vivid, showing that he has done his research for his novel. His description of police work and the American justice system is realistic and compelling at the same time. While we are treated with a roller coaster ride of political issues and men with twisted ideals and politicians, a love story also develops. It is amazing how the author can fit in the shoes of the varied characters who are depicted in the book. I get a glimpse of how a criminal mind works and experience the grief and happiness in Barbara Hernandez's life by reading his work.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For many years I’ve been studying their strange modes and functions.I like to think of myself as a bit like the famous wildlife expert David Attenborough--only instead of studying chimps, hyenas and fruit bats, I’m studying my mum, my nan and my Auntie Julie!My studies of them, and of other Grown-Ups I’ve encountered, have led me to write this excellent guide. After all, someone needs to . . . and who better than an expert on Grown-Up behavior like myself? You see, it’s a jungle out there. One that’s full of Grown-Ups. And according to the law of the jungle, you either eat or you get eaten. . . .In this comprehensive guide, I’m going to share with you my secret knowledge of Grown-Ups, gained from years of intensive study and experimentation.You too can become highly skilled at:1) understanding their insane behavior2) predicting their next moves3) operating them to your best advantage.With my help, I guarantee you can stay one step ahead of your Grown-Ups so you can survive their embarrassing weirdnesses. How cool is that?You probably think an (as of yet) undiscovered genius and possible world expert should live somewhere interesting and stimulating--in a huge exciting city or, failing that, in any town big enough to have a shopping center. Unfortunately, I’m not so lucky. I live in Brindleton, voted the Most Boring Village in Oxfordshire in a recent survey (conducted by me).Brindleton’s not the quiet, pretty little village you might imagine it to be. It’s a sprawling sort of a place that’s a mixture of little cottages, posh detached redbrick houses and millions of public housing units--like the one I live in.I live with my mum; my older sister, Mandy, who’s fifteen; and my little brother, Jack, who’s eight. Dad’s no longer around. The final member of our family is Rascal. He’s a West Highland terrier and he’s twelve years old, which is eighty-four in human years! He’s a small white scruffy bundle of a dog with hilarious pointy ears, and his main hobby is licking people’s faces.My enormous extended family also live in the village. For some reason hardly anybody ever leaves. Spooky but true. On one hand, it’s great for research, but on the other, I can’t walk down the street without being attacked by at least one auntie. I can’t go to the town gardens, the park, the local shops . . . or anywhere without bumping into someone from my gene pool.My nan (Mum’s mum) works in the minimart. So I can’t even go there without her sticking her very nosy nose in my business. Nothing’s sacred, believe me.Take this morning, for example. I went in to buy some ice cream. Nan Williams was grimly stacking toilet paper rolls into a huge pyramid. I tried to sneak past without her noticing me, but it was no good.“I hear your brother’s got A BAD STOMACH!” she shouted at full lung capacity, so that anyone within a five-kilometer radius could hear. “Your Auntie Susan told me. How’s he doing; is he getting over it?”“Yes,” I whispered, my face burning hot.“Messy business! How about you, Katie, have YOU got the runs?”There is no such thing as privacy when you live in Brindleton.Still, every cloud has a silver lining, as Nan would say. Being surrounded by so many Grown-Ups who think they have a right to broadcast the tragic details of my life and comment on everything I do is tough. But it’s forced me to develop some vital skills and techniques--all of which I will share with you in this brilliantly useful guide.USEFUL HINTOne way you can stop Grown-Ups figuring out your evil master plan for Grown-Up Domination is by covering this guide in brown paper and writing DIFFICULT MATH EQUATIONS on the front in permanent black marker. Your Grown-Up will be delighted and proud when they see you with your nose stuck in it.This is exactly the sort of fantastic trick that gives you the advantage when dealing with Grown-Ups.You might be wondering why you should believe a word I say, so I should probably tell you a bit more about myself. I’m just your average teenager. I’m five feet tall, with green eyes and straight, shoulder-length black hair, which just hangs round my ears in an uninteresting way. I think my chin is slightly too pointy, which is a family trait. Brindleton’s full of people with pointy chins. And I have hideously skinny legs, which have been compared to Twiglets due to my knobbly knees.Mum says I’m “striking-looking,” which is her way of avoiding saying I’m not as beautiful as my cousin Hannah--who has long blond hair and the perfect nose--but Hannah is also my best friend in the whole world, so I don’t mind.My other best friend in the whole world is Louise, who we call Loops because she’s got very curly red hair. Hannah and Loops are both totally amazing and fab in every way. They make me laugh so hard, stuff comes out of my nose.But now it’s time for a confession. Even though I may consider myself a world expert in operating Grown-Ups (which sounds a bit bigheaded, I have to admit), I’m not always an expert at operating myself.I’m not very coordinated. Or as Hannah would put it, I’m massively clumsy. I’m always tripping on the school bus, or bumping into people when I’m hurrying to my next class and dropping my books all over the floor.And now that I’m a teenager I regularly have “curse of the giant spot” days, when I have to hide my pointy chin or my nose or whichever part of my face is afflicted behind my homework folder.Finally, there’s my tendency to get myself into ridiculously embarrassing situations. For example, in my final year at elementary school I turned up in a costume for charity . . . one week early. I’m still majorly traumatized by the memory of myself in that clown costume--complete with revolving bow tie and giant shoes.But that’s nothing compared with the way I seem to embarrass myself when I’m around one particular person. When he’s anywhere near me, I totally malfunction.This is because I’m Officially in Love.The lucky person (ha ha) is the unbearably, unbelievably gorgeous Ben Clayden, who doesn’t know that I exist despite the fact that me and Hannah constantly stalk him around the village and school. Hannah’s Officially in Love with him too, but we’ve agreed that in the--admittedly unlikely--event one of us gets him, the other will back off and become a bald, toothless nun who lives in the Himalayas.From the Hardcover edition.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lawyer Matthew Hope of Calusa, Fla., stars again as an amateur sleuth searching for evidence to exonerate a client. This time the accused is a visitor from the Midwest, Ralph Parrish, charged with murdering his gay brother, Jonathan, after a wild party at a Florida beach house. Although unhappy over Jonathan's debauchery and sexual orientation, Ralph loved his brother, and Hope believes in his client's innocence. Setting out on a serpentine path, the lawyer comes into the presence of people with secrets he can't pry loose: a priest at the church near Jonathan's house, a pair of married homosexuals, Arthur Hurley and Bill Walker, and their traveling companion, young, pregnant Helen Abbott. At the last turn in the road, Hope meets elderly Sophie Brechtmann and her daughter, Elise, owners of the famous Brechtmann Brewery, where the investigator learns how to make beer (and so does the reader) in the episode that ends a tale as spellbinding as McBain's Goldilocks, Puss in Boots and his other bestsellers.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When Guernsey farmer Dawsey Adams finds Juliet's name in a used book and invites articulate—and not-so-articulate—neighbors to write Juliet with their stories, the book's epistolary circle widens, putting Juliet back in the path of war stories. The occasionally contrived letters jump from incident to incident—including the formation of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society while Guernsey was under German occupation—and person to person in a manner that feels disjointed. But Juliet's quips are so clever, the Guernsey inhabitants so enchanting and the small acts of heroism so vivid and moving that one forgives the authors (Shaffer died earlier this year) for not being able to settle on a single person or plot. Juliet finds in the letters not just inspiration for her next work, but also for her life—as will readers.(Aug.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her latest, \"Lost and Found\" is tickling the funny bone of readers worldwide. She is committed to helping and encouraging everyone she comes in contact with to seek a healthier and more positive quality of life by reaching for their dreams. Her newest fascination has taken root in the Steampunk industry. This tremendously interesting genre based in the Victorian era is helping to feed a minor obsession with the time period. She is currently embarking on her own Steampunk series called Petticoat Junction. With more than a quarter of a century experience in the book industry, she hopes this one will propel her into the bestseller category. Time will tell. Karen recently moved to Orlando, FL with her nearly perfect husband, so they could be closer to Tinker Bell, oh and Mickey Mouse. She has her priorities in order.

And it turns out that everyone with an office job is disgruntled at least some of the time. In a way, Dilbert predicted the current wave of reality entertainment. I'd love to say my writing is what makes Dilbert work, but it probably has more to do with the recognizable workplace situations and the fact that people see themselves in the strip. Dilbert works best when the characters give voice to what employees in the real world are thinking.Amazon.com:The Kindle edition of Dilbert 2.0 is split into four volumes organized by business era. Are there signature characters or themes that mark the essence of each era?Scott Adams:In the early ears, volume one, Dilbert wasn't strictly about the workplace. Dilbert had a job, but the comic was more often based around his home. The next volume involves strips written during the downsizing of the early nineties, at about the same time Dilbert became a workplace strip. Next came the hardest era for any cartoonist -- the dotcom years. During the go-go days of the Internet, when employees felt well-paid and hopeful, it was hard to find humor. Humor prefers dysfunction. We now know that the dotcom era was hugely dysfunctional, but it wasn't obvious to most people who were in it. Then came the modern era, when hope and compensation took a hit, and once again it became easy to do my job.Amazon.com:How did you narrow down your selections from more than 7,000 potential strips to the nearly 2,000 included in Dilbert 2.0?Scott Adams:It wasn't easy! I tried to find the strips that were the funniest while also having some meaning, or a funny story attached. But it felt like I was a mother with triplets and someone told me I could only keep one of them.Amazon.com:What were the greatest challenges and opportunities associated with translating Dilbert 2.0 for the Kindle Fire?Scott Adams:It's a fascinating process. When you change the physical delivery system for a comic, you can also change the pacing. There's a tradeoff between what looks best and what reads most fluidly. I think we found the right balance.Amazon.com:What are you most excited about for the Dilbert of the future?Scott Adams:I'm hoping a Dilbert movie comes together soon. We're working on it, but movies are never a sure thing. A lot of elements have to fall in place. And we'll be doing a lot with Dilbert.com and with mobile phone distribution.

Aptly chosen selections from Washington’s “Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation,” the maxims that he transcribed during his school days and put into practice throughout his life, frequently appear below the text. The illustrations capture the tone as well as the content of the words. Though some of the scenes look as still as tableaux, others recreate motion very effectively. Strong composition and use of light heighten the drama of the scenes. The last page includes an author’s note, an artist’s note, historical notes on the art, and a bibliography. This handsomely designed book presents a traditional view of Washington, which is precisely what many parents and primary-grade teachers will be looking for come Presidents’ Day.

Its well-written, wide-ranging, and accessible chapters make a compelling argument that engaging the public in scientific research is important in order to increase our environmental knowledge and build a citizenry that values and uses what sciences produces. This book inspires the professional to see the scientist in everyone and to broaden our research programs, which will stoke the fire of scientific curiosity that burns within each of us.\"—John M. Merzluff,BioScience(February 2013)\"Not only does this research allow for extensive data collection, but it makes research relevant to the general public and provides additional teaching tools for K-12 education. This book also explores the impact of the increased use of social media on the success of citizen science projects and investigates potential future uses of social media for such projects. It incorporates the views of many subject experts, with each chapter written by those with firsthand experience of the respective topics. An extensive bibliography provides sources for further information. Summing Up: Highly recommended.\"—D.L. King,Choice(November 2012)\"Dickinson and Bonney's volume,Citizen Science, represents an important foundation text to launch the burgeoning arena of citizen science. . . . This book provides the 'recipes’ for all scientists to undertake an aspect of citizen science as part of their research portfolio.

His parents, converts to a Calvinistic sect, led an austere life, ill-suited to their dreamy and sensitive son. During adolescence, he became fascinated by hypnotism and the supernatural and, on leaving university, studied Hindu philosophy and occultism. Later, he was to draw on these beliefs and experiences in his writing. Sent away to Canada at the age of twenty, his attempts at making a living were wholly unsuccessful and shortly after his return to England, he began to write. The Empty House and Other Ghost Stories, published in 1906, was followed by a series of psychic detective stories, featuring John Silence, 'physician extraordinary'. His reputation as one of the greatest exponents of supernatural fiction began to grow. Chiefly known for his ghost stories, Blackwood wrote in many different forms within the genre. His most personal works, however, are his 'mystical' novels, for example The Centaur, where he explores man's empathy with the forces of the universe. Blackwood also wrote children's fiction. A Prisoner in Fairyland was adapted into the play (later the musical), Starlight Express. Later in life, Blackwood turned to writing radio plays, and in 1947 he began a new career on BBC TV telling ghost stories. He received a knighthood in 1949.", "related": ["B00EK5T7J6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 3.7778, "rating_total": 34.0}

I enjoy anything that a masterful hand creates. Writing is one of those and cooking is another. They both captured my interest and imagination at a very young age.The \"Mama's Legacy Series\" was a pleasure to create because it allowed me to tap into my interests and to publish cookbooks that my audience can use and enjoy time and time again.I began my love affair with cooking when I was very young. As soon as I could reach the counter top my mother gave me free reign in the kitchen. I was allowed to mix and mix and mix, building my masterpieces. They were nothing more that wild combinations of flour, sugar, spices and water; but, to me it was creating at its best. When I finished with each endeavor, I tossed it all and happily cleaned up the kitchen, looking forward to the next time. My creative spirit in the kitchen had taken root.My first adventure in writing came my senior year in high school when I decided to take a writing correspondence course, which was very forward looking for the time. I experienced the first thrill of putting pen to paper, and all these years later it is still one of the most pleasurable activities in my life.All my work is non-fiction. Even though I love fiction and read it voraciously, it has never been my focus and there are others who do it so much better than I. My choice has always been and will continue to be to write about topics that interest and intrigue me and to share what I discover with my readers.", "related": ["B009ZP5JNO"], "rank": 2154968, "title": "Mexican Favorites - 21 Traditional Recipes (Mama's Legacy Series Book 5)", "author": "Nancy N Wilson", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 25.0}

My diving into writing started way back in 2006, after failing Sophomore English in high school, both semesters. During summer school I ended up with a teacher who twisted his rhetoric slightly to incorporate a section on \"Creative Writing\" something that I had never experienced before then. I instantly fell in love with writing and my stories since then have never ended. Six years after that fatal 21 days of summer school and I had flipped my entire world upside down. I went from a prospective business major with AP Calculus, and AP Physics in his Senior year of high school to a graduating English Major in 2012. I literally made it my goal to turn English from my (by far) worst subject to my best, spending countless hours in \"self-research\" mastering grammar, sentence structure, details, and description. I continued to fail in English despite this, scoring \"below average\" on the College Entry exams and being forced to take \"Pre-English\" classes, even failing the first Pre-English class and taking another. I Also failed the WPA during my third year of college, making me take two more classes. Even so by the end of it all I had maxed out my English credits with my degree and graduated with a 3.3 overall GPA (3.7 in upper division English). Now people come to me to learn how to write, and I work as a Professional Editor. Ironic how things switch around. To-Date I have written several novels, starting with \"The Human Xenocide\" which is not yet published. I dove into Erotic Fiction back in March 2012, publishing I Survived the Witch (Freelove Series) shortly after. As of now I am working on book two of the Freelove Series. I plan to continue writing and hopefully publish more erotic novels as well as my non-erotic, probably under a pen-name simply because I'd rather not get the two types of writing confused.", "related": [], "rank": 1784411, "title": "I Survived the Witch (Freelove Series Book 1)", "author": "Cameron Cook", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Together they find a way not just to handle the challenge but grow from it. The son is coaching his mother to find her power to move on, find extraordinary strengths, and sue her entrepreneurial skills to work toward a purpose close to her heart.

Here, [Ruth Dudley Edwards] takes a swipe at the world of conceptual art, with her heroine, the magnificently monstrous reactionary libertarian Baroness \"Jack\" Troutbeck, on splendidly splenetic form.' GUARDIAN 'For some people, the inanity of contemporary art is depressing. For Ruth Dudley Edwards, it's hilarious. I devoured 'Killing the Emperors' because I'd rather laugh than cry.' LIONEL SHRIVER, AUTHOR OF WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN 'Ruth Dudley Edwards is a master of satirical comedy writing. The Baroness Troutbeck is a wonderful invention and as a central character provides most of the humour. She is both classy and classless... This hilarious series, that points its funny finger at a corner of society, comes highly recommended, they are all very entertaining, and this is one of her best.' LIZZIE HAYES, MYSTERY WOMEN 'Teasing the cultural establishment is pure joy for Ruth Dudley Edwards. In KILLING THE EMPERORS, it is the art lobby that incurs the wrath of her alter ego, Baroness Troutbeck, a boisterous, fun-loving academic who is the epitome of political incorrectness... Fans of Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin are advised to steer clear of this book but those of us who believe that real art has nothing to do with pickled sharks or unmade beds will cheer every page of an exhilarating read.' DAILY MAIL 'An entertaining polemic against the abuses of modern art, very funny and should be required reading in the nation's art colleges, not to mention for Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Charles Saatchi and Sir Nicholas Serota (or, as Lady Troutbeck prefers, Sclerota).' THE SPECTATOR  'Marvellously entertaining ... Ruth Dudley Edwards is a crime writer whom we should treasure - sharp, intelligent and gloriously politically incorrect' MAIL ON SUNDAY 'Ruth Dudley Edwards is a fearless and serious journalist. She is also one of the most entertaining crime writers around, the author of a series that satirizes special interest groups and the political correctness that makes other commentators look away politely... Whatever posterity's verdict may be of conceptual art, this send-up should be applauded for its vigour and humour.'

There are so many standards, and all require students to engage in high levels of inferential, critical-thinking, and reasoning skills. Fisher and Frey have made the implementation of this goal-not easy-but definitely attainable. Chapters on each strand begin with an example of teachers working together in a PLC to plan lessons to help students meet the standards. After teaching the lessons, teachers reconvene and share the results of their formative assessments to decide who learned what and plan their next lessons so that all students meet the standard. Using this practical, down-to-earth book as a guide, teachers can navigate the complex world of the CCSS and provide instruction that will work and have one less thing to worry about! --Pat Cunningham, Professor of Education, Wake Forest University, Winston Salem, North CarolinaThis book is a must-read for every new or experienced teacher and administrator involved in or starting a PLC! Fisher and Frey provide a clear, in-depth, and thoughtful examination of the way the CCSS for English language arts play out in grades 3-5 classrooms. They include just enough relevant research and theory to support the CCSS and collaborative planning without overwhelming readers, who will walk away understanding how to provide more effective classroom instruction and assessment. --Karen Bromley, Distinguished Teaching Professor, Graduate School of Education, Binghamton University, SUNYThis remarkable read gives us an uncommon look at the Common Core!

I kept thinking about my kids: \"They're not gonna believe this.\" But by the time I finished the book, I realized I had also written it for the 70 million American Baby Boomers still living.The novel is the almost-completely-true story of the first month of my marriage to Michael Sweet. Someone said to me, \"You must have kept some thorough notes.\" Nope. Not at all. These are just funny stories that Mike and I have told, and repeated, and told, and repeated, for forty years.The book is a road trip in more ways than one. The subtitle is A 1972 Adventure on Wheels. It's true that Max and Ginny (the stand-ins for Mike and me) do see a lot of America as they head south from Wisconsin. But they also explore an even stranger terrain: the land of the newly-married. They learn to choose their battles, as all newlyweds must.As I wrote, I re-lived our encounters with some interesting people, places, and things during that first adventurous month. But I also realized how our early relationship adventures have echoed across our four-decades marriage.I came to see how antique our lives then seem to me now: five-cent coffees, pay phones, and the Vietnam War. Those were the early days of the back-to-the-land movement, and Mike and I were a part of it - as seen in Ginny and Max's desire to find a place where you can \"grow stuff in March.\"It's true that there is a lot of funny stuff in Don't Worry Baby. But there is serious stuff, too. Things we wondered about then - faith, family, and miracles - we still wonder about now.

This is an excellent  choice for anyone who loves the fantasy genre, especially if they're interested in a modern twist on old legends.\"-- Long and Short Reviews, longandshortreviews.com\"Jada and Jinny are spunky and very  human, and they're pitted against a world of dark and light. And, true to all really good stories, they have abilities they didn't know they had, and advisors who make them laugh, and love for each other and the adventure they've found themselves to be on.\"  -- Karen Heuler, O. Henry  Award winner and author ofThe Inner City\"This book took my imagination on a roller coaster ride. I found myself envisioning the world the author created and only a great writing style could accomplish this in a novel. This book is great for children, but I think that adults will also enjoy it. It brought back a lot of childhood memories of playing in the backyard and wishing that elves and fairies existed or some magical world right below my feet, too small for the human eye.\" -- Crystal Crichlow, author,Winter Rose\"What a lovely little book this is.  I don't believe I will ever walk through Central Park again without thinking of about this book. I originally purchased this for my daughter as part of our flight home, the book delivered as I didn't hear a peep.  The only problem is she now wants to return to central park to look for them :-).  She loved the journey the two main characters, Jada and Jinny and the things they discovered on their magical journey.  The pictures are beautiful and perfect illustrate the magic of the book.       \" -- Vanessa Vallely, author,Heels of SteelNicely illustrated with occasional full-color images, \"The Crowded Kingdom\" is a deftly written and thoroughly entertaining modern fairytale adventure that will fire the imagination of young readers and hold their full attention from beginning to end. \"The Crowded Kingdom\" is very highly recommended for school and community library fantasy collections. -- MBRWatch,Midwest Book Review, midwestbookreview.com/", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After having her daughter Talia, Kim became a stay-at-home mom, devoting all her time to raising her only child. Just after her thirteenth birthday, Talia was killed when the small private plane she was on crashed into the side of a volcano. The event devastated Kim's heart and shattered her entire belief system-and from the moment of Talia's death, Kim's motherly devotion shifted from raising Talia to learning to comminicate with her in the afterlife. Kim now spends her time writing about her experiences surrounding the death of Talia and the many communications between Talia from heaven and the spirit world to us here on earth in the physical. She is learning how to heal others from the grief of losing a loved one, as well as studting primitive living skills. She currently resides in Nevada, where she enjoys the peaceful desert scenery and continues on her path of healing, learning, and spiritual awakening.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Five of those were romantic suspense because she loves a good mystery as much as a good love story. In subsequent years, while attempting to write a godawfully serious and tragic historical nonentity, she sold short fiction to Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine and Fantasy and Science Fiction. To keep food on the table, she became a corporate communication consultant and ended up quite enjoying that too.

He holds a journalism degree from the University of Wisconsin, a MBA from Otterbein University, and a PhD in Communication from the University of Florida.  His research focus has been on the measurement of involvement among consumer groups related to media effect and social messaging. As part of his MBA study at Otterbein, Mueller participated in an international economics study in Helsinki, Finland and St. Petersburg, Russia.  It was during this trip that Mueller drafted a topical paper on free-market Russia and the opportunities that have emerged since the country formed independent republics in 1991.  He returned to Russia on an academic and business speaking tour the following year and traveled in the southwestern region of the country, where he interacted with students and business leaders in several communities. Mueller’s international experience began in the early 1980’s as a writer/photographer for Cycle News East, where he covered business and sporting events in the United States as well as Europe.  He later formed his own PR agency and was a subcontractor to the Wrangler Brand in Greensboro, NC.  Mueller was responsible for Wrangler’s promotional work in NASCAR with Dale Earnhardt, prorodeo, and stadium Supercross motorcycle racing. Mueller was also a marketing director at Mercury Marine and then became Director of Professional Competition for the American Motorcyclist Association.  He earned an accredited sporting steward’s license with the internationally recognized Federation Internationale Motocyclisme (International Motorcycling Federation) and went on assignment for FIM business in South America and Europe.  Mueller was later employed by Wasserman Media Group, a Los Angeles - based entertainment company.  He was an account supervisor for a wide variety of sport and entertainment events and was responsible for integrating Rally America auto sport racing into the ESPN X Games. Mueller completed his PhD in 2009 and that same year assumed his current role as assistant professor in communication at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina.  He teaches a variety of courses in advertising, media planning, research, and the social effects of media.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Setting aside the classical theory of probability measure spaces, the book utilizes a mathematically rigorous version of the theory of random variation based exclusively on finitely additive probability distribution functions.In place of twentieth-century Lebesgue integration and measure theory, the author uses the simpler concept of Riemann sums and the non-absolute Riemann-type integration of Henstock. Readers are supplied with an accessible approach to standard elements of probability theory such as the central limit theorem and Brownian motion as well as remarkable, new results on Feynman diagrams and stochastic integrals.Detailed numerical examples and demonstrations guide the reader through the abstract mathematical exposition. In addition, numerous diagrams and graphics provide vivid illustrations of the theory, from the elementary level to the more advanced.A Modern Theory of Random Variationis suitable for courses on mathematical analysis, probability theory, and mathematical finance at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. The book is also an indispensable resource for researchers and practitioners who are seeking new concepts, techniques, and methodologies in data analysis, numerical calculation, and financial asset valuation.", "related": ["B00HAZATEU"], "rank": 4949598, "title": "A Modern Theory of Random Variation: With Applications in Stochastic Calculus", "author": "Patrick Muldowney", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Coming from Nigeria, she found herself\n abandoned by her husband and his family and left with three children.\nShe worked and found ways to go to school, continually improving\nherself, until she achieved a Master's degree in the U.S. and long-term\nemployment.Success Against All Odds shows that, with a bit of creativity and a lot\nof hard work, people can bring themselves up from bad situations and\nlifestyles to become effective, contributing members of society. Like\nalmost everyone I know, Regina Ozoemela made some poor choices and was\nin quite a pickle when she resolved to turn her life around.I found this book to proceed slowly at first, but in retrospect this is\nprobably necessary to lay the foundation and background so that the\nreader can fully understand what Ms. Ozoemela has been through. Marriage\n laws and customs are apparently very different  in the US and it\nmight have been helpful to have even more of that background information\n to make the story flow. Ozoemela targets young single mothers and any\nothers who may feel trapped in their lifestyle or job, to help realize\nthat they do have choices and should not spend a lifetime doing\nsomething they hate.", "related": [], "rank": 4214143, "title": "Success Against All Odds", "author": "Regina Ozoemela", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has served as an editor for fiction and non-fiction projects, and his first book, \"The Gospel of the Phoenix,\" was published in the summer of 2012. This work, based on years of research into the political and pagan origins of Judeo-Christian thought, follows in the tradition of such writers as Kahlil Gibran, Thomas Jefferson (\"The Jefferson Bible\") and Robert Graves (\"King Jesus\"). It examines the life of Jesus in biblical style through the lens of sources including the canonical gospels, the Jesus sutras, the Gnostic gospels and the Egyptian Book of the Dead. His second book, \"Requiem for a Phantom God,\" provides a critique of monotheism from a historical and philosophical perspective. Most recently, he has published \"The Phoenix Principle: Pagan Birthright of the Christian God,\" a comprehensive look at the pagan and political underpinnings of the Judeo-Christian tradition. This exhaustive 736-page work will appeal to readers of Sir James Frazer's \"The Golden Bough.\" It offers a look at the strand of mystical tradition that runs from ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, through Jewish and Christian lore to the legends of Robin Hood and King Arthur. Also in the non-fiction category, he produced \"Undefeated,\" a series of vignettes focusing on individuals who have triumphed over bullying, bigotry and oppression. More recently, he has published three works of fiction: * \"Feathercap,\" a new fairytale for children and adults. * \"Identity Break,\" the first installment in a new \"Identity Quest\" YA/science fiction/adventure series and the author's first novel. * \"Artifice,\" a novella in the \"Identity Quest\" series. The author has lectured occasionally on the pagan origins of Christianity and continues to research the development of religious traditions. He has worked as an editor, columnist, educator and reporter and serves as editor of the young adult novels \"Mad World: EPIDEMIC\" and \"Mad World: SANCTUARY\" by Samaire Provost. He lives in California with his wife, stepson, one cat and one dog.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The thesaurus lists word roots alphabetically and identifies for each the source language (primarily Greek or Latin), meaning, and words that use the root as an independent, prefixed, leading, or trailing element. Whereas the analysis in William Haubrich's well-regardedMedical Meanings: A Glossary of Word Origins(2nd ed., CH, Oct'97, 35-0667) proceeds from words to roots and offers concise essays, Danner's thesaurus moves from roots to words with glosses and occasional comments. His approach brings together words with common elements to aid in comparison, association, and memorization. The thesaurus would make an excellent companion toDunmore and Fleischer's Medical Terminology, by C. Walker-Esbaugh, L. H. McCarthy, and R. A. Sparks (3rd ed., 2004), or other textbooks that employ word analysis and etymology to teach vocabulary. For those who love words and want to learn more, browsing the thesaurus is interesting and informative. Included are English-to-root, prefix, and suffix indexes. Summing Up: Recommended. Academic medical libraries and libraries supporting semantic programs; lower-level undergraduates and above, and general readers.(CHOICE)New medical students, medical practitioners, and students of language will benefit from using this resource for their work. It can also be a source of fun for curious word lovers who will no doubt discover many surprises in the meanings of the roots, prefixes, and suffixes listed in the book. With the help of 17 medical dictionaries, encyclopedias, and several Internet resources, Danner compiled this reference of medical word roots. The presentation is clear and concise. As the author states, 'this thesaurus is designed for a user to refer to when an unknown medical word of mainly Greek or Latin origin is encountered. By seeing other words in the same family, users can better associate, and therefore better remember the meaning of the root.' . . . .This thesaurus would be a valuable addition to large public, community college, science, and medical library reference collections. In addition, medical practitioners would benefit by having a copy in their private offices.(American Reference Books Annual)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She loves going crazy on weekend nights with the hubby.

You're\ndropped right into the crux of the problem, which I appreciated (some\nstories seem to belabor \"an ordinary office worker and his ordinary\nfamily, living in the suburbs\" to the point of slowing things down). You\n see the decisions they make and how their narrow perspective and lack\nof overall knowledge makes it difficult for them to make the best\nchoices along the way, especially at first, and how loss, experience,\nand picking up skills and know-how greatly improve their chances. I love\n how this tied into the earlier short story you wrote, Terry, about \"W\"\nand how she came to be.One thing I genuinely appreciate is the overall theme that there's a\nresponsibility to do more than simply not die. Helping others when you\ncan - and, if possible, getting rid of people who endanger other good\npeople - are also things that survivors in a post-apocalyptic world may\nhave to deal with. And people need more to focus on than day-to-day\ntasks, but they also need hope and a purpose that is bigger than\nthemselves.

But knowing how to use it properly is very important because an overdose can cause an allergic reaction and there are misconceptions floating around out there about that and other thing in relation to.

People want zombies not a bunch of back story explaining what's been going on since the last book regarding the characters.I bet many people will agree that his infantile obesession with Gilligan's Island is too sophmoric and stupid. There are funny parts that don't suck but everytime I read about the Voodoo shaman guy named Gilligan I wanted to scream.And why does almost every one of the main characters get so abused and hurt by the author? Doesn't he recall that book by the guy in Maine where an author kills off a beloved character called Misery or something like that and then gets the snot kicked out of him by his number one fan?  Ooooh, here's another thing sure to grind people's gears. Bebb rambles about alot of social issues from one of the character's perspective. Yo, Mr. Bebb, people want zombies and fighting not political crap. What's wrong with you? Are you trying to alienate a lot of people? What a shmuck.Is it a bad book? I don't know but some of the undead and infected scenes were much too gross.

Teachers of undergraduate Middle East Politics have been waiting for this one.Emma C. MurphySchool of Government and International Affairs, The University of DurhamThis is an expansive survey of Middle East politics that takes into account not only novel topics, such as human rights, environment and democratization, but also geographies that are generally neglected in such studies.  Benjamin MacQueen captures the dynamics of continuity and change in the region and does so in a quite accessible manner to students and general readers.  This is a comprehensive view of the region in the post-Arab uprisings era and an essential textbook on Middle East politics.Meliha Benli AltunişikDepartment of International Relations, Dean of the Graduate School of Social Sciences, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, TurkeyTeaching Middle Eastern politics during the throes of the so-called Arab Spring is both exciting and daunting. Exciting because the peoples of the region seem closer to genuine democracy than ever before, and daunting because we have few scholarly guides to this new reality. For decades, scholarship on the Middle East tended to focus on the longstanding continuities in that region, leaving students ill-equipped to fathom the sources of and possibilities for change. MacQueen's textbook is thus a welcome companion to any course that seeks to help students understand the region's newfound political dynamism. Written with insight and verve, and covering a vast amount of terrain with efficiency and accuracy, this is likely to be the single best textbook in the field.Tarek MasoudAssociate Professor of Public Policy, John F.

By the time I did, we had moved to our own little horse farm, named it November Hill, and brought our wonderful pony and horse to join us here. I do not know exactly what it is about horses and ponies that steal the hearts of so many of us - but I can say with certainty that once you are smitten, it never goes away.These books are one way I can explore the phenomenon.

Devan, totally \"normal\" and totally clueless about witches and their powers, comes into her life, they fall in love quickly and foolishly, Cherry agrees to marry him, putting a bullseye on his back for possible coven retaliation. When Cherry is betrayed and attacked by the coven, she must make a decision, assume her role as coven leader or follow her heart.Larissa Ladd put a lot of action into this short, but good novella. Do I wish there were more in-depth world and character building? Yep, but that said, she has definitely conveyed what she wants the reader to feel with her clean writing style and hook at the end that left me wanting to know what would happen next in the battle of wills and power between the coven, Cherry and a surprise betrayer who is egging the coven on.

Seances with strange women\nin turbans were a way of life, especially during World War 2. &\n\"Writing about those times seems natural to me\" she says. \" The\nforeword to my book might best explain who I am and why I chose to write the\nstory.\" Foreword My parents, Don and Bernice Hardy, were Bonus Marchers;\ntheir stories loomed large in my young life. They told me about the hot summer\nof 1932 in the midst of the Great Depression when they joined 20,000 destitute\nWorld War veterans in a march to Washington, D.C. to lobby Congress for passage\nof a bill that would pay their wartime service bonuses immediately. Years\nlater, they were still outraged when they talked about how President Hoover\nordered the forced eviction of the peaceful, unarmed Bonus Marchers from the\nstreets of our nation's Capitol. They never forgave the arrogance of General\nDouglas MacArthur swaggering in his bemedaled dress uniform as he led U.S. Army\ntroops in an attack against these American war veterans. They witnessed the\ncavalry charges by saber swinging horse soldiers. They were tear gassed and\nhelpless to stop the troops torching their camps along with everything they owned.\nLike most kids, I sometimes listened. Sometimes I didn't, and sometimes I\ndidn't believe them. As I grew up, veterans issues were part of our everyday\nfamily conversation. On Armistice Day, the house bloomed with red American\nLegion poppies. A large American Flag was a permanent fixture. On December 8,\n1941, my father tried to enlist in the Army but was turned away because he was\nover 40. I recall the day in 1944 when I came home from school and found my\nmother, the family skeptic, crying. \"Roosevelt has died,\" she said.\nLater that afternoon, my father, ex-reporter turned tough-guy detective, came\nhome early from a stakeout, and the two of them sat at the kitchen table where\nthey held hands and cried together. They credited FDR with saving America. Years\nlater, when President Truman fired General MacArthur for insubordination in the\nKorean War, my parents celebrated his dismissal. \"It's about time that\narrogant bastard got what was coming to him,\" my father said. More than a\ndecade ago when I began to write fiction, I decided to tell this story from my\nparents' point of view. My main characters, Bonnie and Will are drawn from my\nparents' lives. My maiden name is theirs, Hardy. But Tom Jenks, my writing\nteacher and mentor, reminded me that the Bonus March was bigger than my\nparent's personal story; it was an important historical event that couldn't\ndepend on their anecdotes or my sometimes faulty memory. That's when my\nresearch began with multiple trips to Washington and the Library of Congress. I\nwalked the Death March, I sat where they sat on the Capitol steps, visited\nAnacostia and experienced the awful heat and humidity those marchers\nexperienced that summer. And I read and read and read. In the 10 years it took\nto write The Bonus, history repeated itself. Now, this story of the systemic\nneglect of veterans, hard economic times, environmental disaster and the\nconsequences of a failed presidency is more relevant than ever. In 2008, as in\n1932, a new President who campaigned on the twin promises of hope and change,\nwas elected. After leaving southern California, I married and with my husband,\nraised a son and daughter while we owned and operated a family resort in the\nHigh Sierra. After 25 years, I retired, turned to my lifelong dream of writing\nfiction. Now, I work and live in a small community on the Eastern slope of the\nSierra with my 2 \"highly intelligent\" Golden Retrievers. At present,\nI am hard at work on my 3rd novel Paradise Court, after The Bonus and its prequel The Kid.", "related": [], "rank": 3888920, "title": "The Kid", "author": "Georgia Lowe", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She believes cats are evil, and also detests dogs with a bitter passion--mainly because she'd been bitten over a dozen times on separate occasions by the rambunctious creatures in her formative years (she's got the scars to show!). A lover of all things 'romance', Ann has always been a writer of poetries and songs of any kind. All who's acquainted with Ann can attest to witnessing her write her way through life: through destruction, devastation, hardship, sadness and disappointments, her coping mechanism has always been writing. Having an obsessive and unquenchable affair with the written word, she's naturally a recluse who dwells inside her imagination and has to suffer continual bashings from her friends for being a neglectful pal who does nothing but sit around the computer all day, writing. Her top list of people-obsession includes King Solomon, Anne Boleyn, Chris Brown, Jonathon Rhys Meyers... When she's not abusing her computer keyboard, you can find her nosing a novel, watching anything on television that makes her laugh out loud, studying the Bible, or nursing any of the three alcoholic beverages: Black Label and Coke, Heineken, or a glass of Merlot.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 28, "rating_average": 4.4643, "rating_total": 125.0}
