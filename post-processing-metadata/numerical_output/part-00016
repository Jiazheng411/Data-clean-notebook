Kate has given up her rich clients and is now writing a book about the New York School of painters of the 1930s. After someone slashes a painting by Willem de Kooning, which was loaned to a museum by Kate's late husband, she reluctantly returns to police work. She decides to help Det. Monty Murphy, the NYPD's entire art squad, find out who's behind this and other slashings, which include a Jackson Pollock, a Franz Kline and finally the collectors who owned the spoiled pictures. Kate and Monty make a believable pair of colleagues, and Santlofer's own black-and-white artwork advances the plot. His writing and plotting are no match for his superior brushwork, however, which makes for an inventive and curious book.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She could almost feel the familiar smoothness of the barre beneath her hand and almost see the glint of bright lights in the mirrors and hear the regular scuff and thump of other dancers leaping and landing and twisting and turning around her.She needed the comfort of the familiar very badly right now.The double doors to the Sydney Dance Company's rehearsal studio A came up on her left. She pushed through them and the scent of warm bodies, clean sweat and a dozen different deodorants and perfumes and aftershaves wrapped itself around her.Home. She was home.\"Maddy! How did your doctor's appointment go?\" Kendra asked the moment she spotted Maddy.The other dancers turned toward her, faces expectant. Maddy forced herself to smile and shrug casually.\"It's all good,\" she said. \"No problems.\"She couldn't bring herself to say the other thing. Saying it out loud would make it real. And for just a few more minutes, she wanted to lose herself in the world that had held her enthralled since, at the age of four, she first saw a picture of a ballerina.Kendra flew across the room to give her a hug, her slender arms strong around Maddy's back.\"Fantastic. Great news. The best,\" she said.The other woman's gauzy rehearsal skirt flared around her legs as she returned to her place in the center of the room. Kendra was only twenty-two. She had her whole career ahead of her. She was a beautiful dancer—powerful, delicate, emotional, intense. She would soar.Maddy felt someone watching her and lifted her gaze to find Stephen Jones, the choreographer, eyeing her closely.She turned her shoulder, breaking the contact. Stephen had been watching her a lot lately, checking her range of movement, testing the capabilities of her injured knee. Had he known, or guessed, what she'd been told today? Had everyone known except her that she was over? That she would never dance again?Her heart pounded against her ribs and again she couldn't quite catch her breath.She threw her bag into the corner and slid off her street shoes, bending to tug on a pair of slippers with shaking hands. The ribbons whispered through her fingers as she wrapped them around her ankles and tied them neatly. She shed her skirt to reveal tights and leotard and took a place at the barre to begin warming up.Pliés first, then somerond de jambes,keeping her head high and her arms relaxed. Every time she rose upen pointe,she felt the seamless, fluid glide of her body responding to her will, saw her reflection in the floor-to-ceiling mirror, posture perfect, form ideal.Her heartbeat slowed. She was a dancer. Always had been, always would be.\"Maddy.\"She tore her eyes from her own reflection to find Andrew McIntyre, the company director, standing behind her. He, too, had been studying her perfect form in the mirror.\"Why don't you come to my office?\" he said. His voice was gentle, as was the light in his eyes.He knew.He'd spoken to Dr. Hanson. Of course he had. Hanson was the company's doctor, after all. When she'd come on board four years ago she'd signed a contract agreeing that the company could access all health matters pertaining to her career.\"After rehearsal,\" she said. \"I'm warm now. And the rest of them are waiting for me.\"\"I think we should do this now, don't you?\" he said.He was frowning, as though what she'd said pained him in some way. He moved closer, reached out a hand to touch her.She took a step backward. Risingen pointeon her bad leg, she lifted her right leg ingrand battementto the side then up, up, up, until her toe was pointing toward the ceiling, her thigh straight beside her ear.She held the position in a blatant display of skill and strength, her eyes daring Andrew in the mirror.He held her gaze, never once looking away. And when her muscles began to scream and shake from the pain of holding such a demanding, strenuous position, he stepped forward and rested his hand on her shoulder.\"Enough, Maddy. Come to my office.\"She let her leg drop and relaxed onto her flat feet. Her knee throbbed, as it always did these days when she demanded too much of it. She hung her head and stared blindly at the polished floorboards.She felt Andrew slide his arm around her shoulders. Then he led her toward the door. The other dancers stopped mid-rehearsal to watch her. She could feel their silent stares as she and Andrew stepped into the corridor. Andrew didn't let her go until they were in his office.\"Sit,\" he said.He crossed to the wooden built-ins that spanned one wall of his office and opened a door. She heard the clink of glass on glass as he poured something.\"Drink this.\"Brandy fumes caught her nose as he lifted a glass to her lips.\"No,\" she said, turning her head away.Andrew held the glass there, waiting. Finally she took a token mouthful.\"And again,\" he said.She took a bigger mouthful this time. The brandy burned all the way down her throat to her belly. She shook her head firmly when he offered a third time.He took her at her word and placed the glass on the coffee table in front of her. Then he sat in the armchair opposite her.In his late fifties, he was a former dancer, his body slim and whippet-strong even after years away from the stage. His tanned skin was stretched tightly across high cheekbones, and thin lines surrounded his mouth from smoking. His eyes were kind as he studied her, a rarity from a man who was known throughout the dance world as a perfectionist first and a human being second.\"We will look after you, Maddy. Please know that. Retirement pay, any teaching work you want—you name it, you can have it. You've been one of our greatest dancers, and we won't forget you.\"Maddy could feel the sweat cooling on her body in the air-conditioned chill.\"I want to keep dancing,\" she said. \"That's what I want.\"Andrew shook his head decisively. \"You can't. Not for us. Not professionally. Your spirit might be willing, but your body is not. Dr. Hanson was very clear about that. We always knew that complete recovery from such a significant tear to your cruciate ligament was going to be a long shot. It's time to hang up your slippers, Maddy.\"She stared at him, a storm of words closing her throat.Anger, grief, resentment, denial—she didn't know what to say, how to react.\"I want to keep dancing,\" she said again. \"Give me more time. I'll show you I can do it. I'll do more rehab work, more Pilates. Whatever it takes.\"Andrew's face went slack for a moment, and he leaned back and closed his eyes, rubbing the bridge of his nose with his hand. He looked defeated, sad.\"Maddy. I know how hard it is to give it up. Believe me. It nearly killed me. But I made a second chance for myself.\" He paused a moment to let his words sink in. \"You're a beautiful, smart, resourceful woman. There's another life out there waiting for you. You just have to find it.\"I don't want to find it.She almost said it out loud, but some of the numbness and shock were leaving her as the brandy burned its way into her system.The doctor had handed down his decision, and Andrew had made his, too. She was broken, old. They had no use for her anymore.\"We'll throw you a party. A real send-off. And we'll help you any way we can. Retraining, or, as I said earlier, if you want to teach…?\"The thought of a party, of standing in front of her peers while people made toasts to her former talent made bile rise up the back of her throat.\"No. No party,\" she said.Suddenly she didn't want to be here anymore. When the doctor had given her the news an hour ago, the company had felt like home, like the safe place to be. But now she knew it would never be her home again.\"People will want to say their goodbyes, pay their due respects,\" he said.\"I'm not dead,\" she said, standing abruptly.She strode to the door. She hesitated for a beat outside the rehearsal studio, then braced herself to duck in and collect her bag. Head down, she did just that, not responding when Kendra asked if she was okay.They would hear soon enough. Another dancer would be promoted into her role in the latest production. Maybe Kendra. Maybe one of the other soloists. Life would go on.Outside in the warm summer air, she took deep breaths and fought tears.She had never been more alone and scared in her life. Her entire world had crumbled around her—the discipline and passion that had formed the boundaries of her days and nights had dissolved into nothingness. She had no future, and her past was irrelevant. She was the owner of a broken body and broken dreams and precious little else.She found her car keys in her handbag, but she had nowhere to go. No current lover to offer his shoulder, and no former lovers to call on, because her affairs never ended well. Her mother was miles away in America, enjoying the fruits of her third marriage. Maddy had never known her father. All her friends were dancers, and the thought of their ready sympathy had the bile rising in her throat again.Where to go?Where to go?Out of the depths of her subconscious, a face rose up. Clear gray eyes, dark hair, a smile that offered mischief and fun and comfort and understanding in equal measure.Max.Yes. She needed Max. Even though it had been years. Even though their friendship had been reduced to occasional e-mails and Christmas cards.He would understand. He always had. He'd hold her in his big, solid arms, and she'd feel safe, the way she always had with him.And then maybe she could think. Imagine a world without dance. Construct a way forward.Max.Max shut the flap on the box and held it down with his forearm. He reached for the packing tape and used his thumbnail to find the leading edge.\"I'm all done in here. How about you?\" a voice asked from the doorway.He glanced up at his sister, Charlotte, taking in her smug expression and the way she'd planted her hands on her hips.\"Don't even think it,\" he said, tearing off a p...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Their village is located in a world much like the ones found in European folktales, with a few magical features such as giant hedgehogs with magical spines and the wooden people to whom Barkbelly belongs. When he accidentally kills a younger playmate, he runs away, sure that the villagers will turn on him. Barkbelly has adventures in an industrial city, on the road with a circus, and on a pirate ship. When he discovers that he is not unique, but a member of a group of wooden people, he goes searching for his own birth family, a search with unexpected and unhappy results. The resolution seems convenient rather than convincing. Weatherill is a performance storyteller, and there is an oral storytelling feel to the characters and their reactions, as well as to the circularity of the plot.

She works for Margaret, an elderly photographer, in the small mill town Dyers Corner, where most residents are caught in a cycle of poverty and violence. Jamie arrives in the town, her grandparents' former home and her mother's birthplace, in search of her roots, but she becomes embroiled in a nasty debacle after she frees a disturbed young boy who was lashed to a tree. Wallace's prose is lush and spare (\"unrepentant after his absences, unrepentant in drink, bridging with his body the chasms that lay between one unkindness and the next\"), and she handles both the grotesque and the gorgeous with equal skill. A tender, tragic love story between Jamie and Galen, a trapper twice her age, together with a suspenseful pursuit story, brings the novel to a dramatic close. In the hands of a lesser writer, the novel would devolve into melodrama, but Wallace never lets its chilly, destitute atmosphere lapse.(Apr. 7)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Thanksgiving is right around the corner and Sydney and Lauren should be focusing on planning their holiday bash, but instead they are preoccupied with attempting to clear their father's name in the murder case of Lauren's boyfriend's brother. All of their detective work has to be on the sly because by proving their father's innocence they just may be exposing their stepfather's activities. Is Altimus's used car business lucrative enough to keep the girls swathed in Gucci and Prada or is he involved in illegal activities? Uncovering the truth is not going to be easy, nor without consequences, for the sisters. The mystery element sets this story apart from other novels in the overdone subgenre of books about wealthy youth, and, even though it's a sequel, it stands on its own.—Robyn Zaneski, New York Public LibraryCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Grade 6–8—Growing up in Canada with her white South African mother, Kim van der Merwe does not know who her father is. Now, at 13, she goes to Cape Town for the first time, shortly after independence in the mid-1990s, because her mother, a journalist, is going to report on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Visiting and meeting her family for the first time, she decides that her mission will be to discover her father's identity. When Kim becomes involved in a friendship with the family who works for the van der Merwes', especially Themba, whose father was murdered by the police during apartheid, her life becomes more closely entwined with South Africa's political and social realities. As she gets closer to the answer she seeks, her mother becomes more and more unhinged by the horrors she hears about in her work. The climax packs a powerful emotional punch as the author dovetails Kim's personal odyssey with the pain, contradictions, and hopes of the country as it carries its devastating history into the future. The realities of the society are carefully and skillfully portrayed, so that Kim's story is truly the emotional heart of the book, and not a vehicle for ideas. Kim herself is a believable and likable character, and her relationship with Themba is tender and realistic. The author does not sugarcoat the realities of South Africa, or the details of torture that are revealed at the Truth Commission. Not just another multicultural title, by any means, this novel will really grab readers who appreciate realistic fiction about young people searching for their place in the world.—Sue Giffard, Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York CityCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The use of real programs in page-size (or less) chunks that can be easily understood is a real plus. The figures, programs, and tables are a significant contribution to the learning experience of the reader; they make this book distinctive.--William A. Ward, University of South AlabamaThis edition of Robert Sedgewick's popular work provides current and comprehensive coverage of important algorithms for Java programmers. Michael Schidlowsky and Sedgewick have developed new Java implementations that both express the methods in a concise and direct manner and provide programmers with the practical means to test them on real applications.Many new algorithms are presented, and the explanations of each algorithm are much more detailed than in previous editions. A new text design and detailed, innovative figures, with accompanying commentary, greatly enhance the presentation. The third edition retains the successful blend of theory and practice that has made Sedgewick's work an invaluable resource for more than 400,000 programmers!This particular book,Parts 1-4, represents the essential first half of Sedgewick's complete work. It provides extensive coverage of fundamental data structures and algorithms for sorting, searching, and related applications. Although the substance of the book applies to programming in any language, the implementations by Schidlowsky and Sedgewick also exploit the natural match between Java classes and abstract data type (ADT) implementations.HighlightsJava class implementations of more than 100 important practical algorithmsEmphasis on ADTs, modular programming, and object-oriented programmingExtensive coverage of arrays, linked lists, trees, and other fundamental data structuresThorough treatment of algorithms for sorting, selection, priority queue ADT implementations, and symbol table ADT implementations (search algorithms)Complete implementations for binomial queues, multiway radix sorting, randomized BSTs, splay trees, skip lists, multiway tries, B trees, extendible hashing, and many other advanced methodsQuantitative information about the algorithms that gives you a basis for comparing themMore than 1,000 exercises and more than 250 detailed figures to help you learn properties of the algorithmsWhether you are learning the algorithms for the first time or wish to have up-to-date reference material that incorporates new programming styles with classic and new algorithms, you will find a wealth of useful information in this book.0201361205B08282002", "related": ["B00890OBFI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Thorpe uses the story of \"perhaps the greatest all-around male athlete in American history\" as a lens through which to examine the effects of racism on Native Americans, adroitly placing Jim Thorpe in the larger context of Native American history. Lipsyte is particularly good at outlining the chilling effects of the white-run government schools on Thorpe, who later had to fight against an image of himself as \"a great performing animal.\" The same measured approach raises the Schwarzenegger book above the ordinary as well. Here Lipsyte situates Arnold among the famous strong men of history (Samson, Hercules), then places Schwarzenegger's bodybuilding fame in the context of fitness crazes of the past 150 years, skillfully synthesizing some of the important recent work in sports history and sociology. Schwarzenegger emerges warts and all, with Lipsyte touching on reports of the hero's father's Nazi sympathies, Schwarzenegger's steroid use and bullying of weaker people. Both works offer balanced portraits of memorable individuals. Photos not seen by PW .

As an avid hunter and fisherman, many of the events involve activities and stories from his personal outdoor adventures. As a business executive, and extensive traveler, he gives us some playful observations accumulated from the millions of miles he traveled across the US. As someone who loves animals and adventure, he offers thoughts and observations that are probably outside most reader's imagination.Not a 'tell all' narrative, real names and real people are included. If you know the author, you might find yourself - or one of your adventures - included. If not, I'm certain you will find a real familiarity with the stories and the times chronicled in the book.

She provides information about some of \"craniology\" 's founders, the oddest stories and contradictions, but leaves the reader to synthesize it all. The first half of the book is largely devoted to the work of Samuel George Morton, a 19th-century naturalist who amassed almost 1,000 skulls and used them to argue that there were five distinct races of humans. While Fabian reports on Morton's passion and methodology, and frequently says his work was the basis for the field of \"scientific racism,\" she doesn't allow readers to get inside Morton's head to understand his perspective. Fabian writes most eloquently about the post–Civil War national dissonance, when the government was working aggressively to bury the war dead, while also promoting the unearthing of Native American graves so skulls could be collected for \"scientific\" use. However, by presenting more anecdotes than insights, Fabian will leave readers unsatisfied and searching for the big picture. 30 illus.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He serves up very brief interviews with 32 openly gay and lesbian comics to accompany longer examples of their material. Some of the pieces are hysterical and very biting, but many of the routines fall flat on the printed page. The book is well organized by place and time, covering the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, mostly from the obvious locales of San Francisco and New York, and contact and booking information for selected comedians is provided. A good complement to Growing Up Gay (Hyperion, 1995) and Out, Loud and Laughing (Anchor, 1995), both of which include only contemporary works, this book will benefit curious readers and those without cable television or comedy club access.

DeVries, who's black, says he was framed for a murder committed during the robbery, and Walker believes him. DeVries also considers the $200,000 never found after the robbery as his due: \"I paid for it, and now it's mine.\" He identifies a rising auto executive as the \"revolutionary\" who got him to throw the fire-bomb. Soon Walker finds himself involved with a hotshot, would-be car magnate, his \"ex-model\" wife and a centenarian auto pioneer. By the violent ending, Walker has uncovered a computer scam and some ugly, 20-year-old secrets.

Deary's eventual suicide provoked his family to pursue Bissonnette through a wake of victims that crossed the United States and spanned decades, despite the Church's repeated efforts to deal with Bissonnette by simply transferring him to new parishes, where--time and again--he found new victims and in some cases, even collaborators. The story is as abstractly familiar as it is uniquely dismal, but girded by Margolick's in-depth research and interviews with most of those involved, it offers a singular look behind the screaming headlines. --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B00IGDSWYO"], "rank": 303421, "title": "A Predator Priest (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "David Margolick", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 20, "rating_average": 4.15, "rating_total": 83.0}

This was to be the scene of Evelyn’s happiest childhood memories, and the beginning of her lifelong devotion to all animals – particularly the farm horses. Evelyn and her husband Russell (a ‘horseman’, naturally) later set up home in Metfield with their two children, becoming immersed in village life and particularly the life of the church, to which they gave many loyal hours. Horses remained their first love, and in later years they were frequently to be seen bowling along (dressed for the part) in their brightly turned-out pony and trap.", "related": ["B005NR6TFU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This work, a beautiful distillation of his thought, is like an intimate conversation with the wisest of the wise, the kindest of the kind. Reading it, I wanted to shout with joy that the book exists and that he is in our midst.””In this intimate portrait of Michael Eigen's encounter with colleagues in Seoul, Korea, we see the man we have valued as scholar, therapist, and mystic in a new role: teacher. Few meditations on psychoanalysis--or on life itself--have the simplicity and depth, passion and compassion of these conversations that reach across continents, generations, cultures. Read this book and grow wiser.””There is something rightfully alluring about any thinker engaging with a live audience. We can think of Lacan and Bion in the psychoanalytical world. Eigen enters this realm and his freedom to speak his mind--to me the essence of what it means to be psychoanalytical--is so refreshing, so necessary. He has inspired the other, here in the form of the Korean audience who are clearly caught up in the intellectual intensity of his presence. So too will any open minded reader who joins the Oriental in hearing from the Occidental.””Michael Eigen is an extraordinary psychoanalytic writer. The more I read the better I feel. In this seminar we get engaged in an intense exchange between Freud, Klein, Winnicott, Bion and Eigen on madness in psychoanalysis, in society, in each of us. Eigen succeeds with the feat of bringing us to the depths of human pain and craziness and yet coming out wiser and enriched.”", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I especially praise Kathleen's straightforward writing style, which results in a very reader-friendly book that is also densely packed with useful information. Personally, I enjoyed his candid story of how he was pushed out of conventional medicine and instead, fortunately for all of us, championed natural health care. He is a strong critic of orthodox medicine, but his book offers the reader so much more than that: detailed, practical instruction on how to use natural treatment approaches to improve your heath. This is education, not medication, and I applaud it. --Andrew W. Saul, author ofDoctor YourselfandFire Your Doctor!I highly recommend this book as one of the best I have seen on educating people about the important differences between disease care and health care. The authors not only take a holistic approach on teaching us how to solve our chronic health conditions; they model that approach by combining the substantial medical knowledge of Walt Stoll with the cogent and articulate writing abilities of Kathleen Diehl. Rather than government legislation, this book would much better serve us in improving America s health care problems. --Bill Manahan, MD, Past President American Holistic Medical AssociationBeyond Disease Carelifts you above the confusion of the medical marketplace to understand why you have chronic health problems and what you can do about them. This book helps you understand and navigate the medical disease-care system in the United States and discusses viable alternatives for health care. You will also learn reliable natural treatments that you can apply yourself at home with little cost to reverse chronic ailments and symptoms.Dr. Stoll's clear vision and passion for helping others help themselves are a defining characteristic of this work. He believes in combining conventional and alternative medicine to provide the best of all options. This book offers over five decades of his professional knowledge and experience. Kathleen M. Diehl's dedication to bridging the gap between doctor and patient make this a reference book easy to understand that you will want to have as part of your personal library. This is an excellent volume whether you are wishing to reverse a chronic condition or just wanting to enhance the good health you already have. --From the Publisher", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From a Kushite to A Thug\"By Steve JohnsonReview by Talk Magazine　Who among us today is willing to stand up and fight to regain our communities and children? Great minds throughout history have tried to analyze and create a cure to the violence we see today in Americas inner cities. Author Steve Johnson with his latest book in stores Winter 2011 titled, \" How Did I Get Here? From a Kushite to a Thug.\" aims to carry on that tradition. The book takes the reader to a journey back in time to the Ancient African Kushites and makes its way to todays modern day thug.In the introduction of the book Mr. Johnson assures his readers that his consistent study of world history combined with the fact that he grew up in one of the worst crime field neighborhoods of Pittsburgh allowed him to analyze the thugism epidemic properly. The book mentions everything from the roots of poverty, to the pre-gang and gang bang era, to the lack of proper parental guidance and much more. It is a recommendation to anyone who truly wishes to get a different perspective on what Mr. Johnson believes is an epidemic called thugism.

Dunkin talks with great passion about the beautiful game in a language football fans will appreciate. This is not a book solely for Liverpool supporters; anyone who worries that clubs have become highly prized assets should read it and realise that is not an inevitable state of affairs - The Birmingham Post. A fascinating relationship between travel and sport exists only in the heart of the true fan. There is a real sense of this unique perspective in Dunkin's passionate ode to Liverpool FC, which culminates in the \"sublime\"  Champions League victory in 2005. The ups and downs in the club's and the city's history and heritage are cleverly and lovingly charted in the year that Liverpool is the European City of Culture. Football lovers will lap this up but Dunkin's passion and fine line in anecdotes make the book worthy of a much wider readership - Michelle Stanistreet, Daily Express. All I can say is get this book if you see it - Once you start reading it you'll be transported back to a time when life was harsh but so much fun and you'll be brought through good times, bad times sad times right up until the final whistle in Istanbul.

Having grown up censored and restrained by the Fairhaven educational system, and spending time as a teacher in the People’s Republic of China, Pauline developed a deep frustration with censorship and the effect it has on a people, and crafted her unique voice as a direct opposition to that.   An accomplished writer overflowing with stories for most of her life, Pauline added film to her repertoire as she discovered the profound change a visual aspect can have on a story.  Her work as a documentary filmmaker has been focused on working with others to tell the stories that the world would otherwise not hear.  For her work, Pauline has been celebrated with the Library of Poetry Editor’s Choice award, as well as receiving a third place Library of Poetry prize.  A member of the Screen Actor’s Guild, Pauline was a quarterfinalist in the Hollywood’s Next Success Screenwriting Comedy contest, and in 1993 was awarded as an American Association of University Women Educational Foundation Eleanor Roosevelt Named Gift Honoree.

A\npesar que en la vida real mi hijo Ken es muy ágil en muchas cosas, por ser el más\npequeño, a veces no podía y en ocasiones todavía no puede estar al nivel de sus\nhermanos. De\npequeño, empezó a decir cosas como que él era un tonto, porque él no sabía leer\ny sus hermanos ya lo hacían. Ken no podía\nescribir y sus hermanos ya lo hacían. Por más que le explicaba que sus hermanos\neran más grandes y que él pronto iba a poder hacer todas esas cosas, Ken muchas\nveces terminaba triste.Me di\ncuenta que a Ken no le gustaba perder, bueno probablemente a la mayoría de\nnosotros no le gusta perder. Pero la\nrealidad es que muchas veces perdemos para poder aprender y poder triunfar. Esa\nes la misión de este cuento, es decir, que el fracaso no es tan malo, es\nsimplemente una forma de enseñarnos que debemos esforzarnos más para ser\nmejores.Mi hijo\nmenor tenía 5 años aproximadamente, cuando escribí este cuento corto. Pero esta es una historia que les repito una\ny otra vez a todos mis hijos por igual. Con el más grande seguimos trabajando\nen superar la derrota (porque se pone muy triste cuando pierde), pero a raíz de\neste cuento y de sus enseñanzas empezó a atreverse a hacer cosas nuevas o que\nle resultan difíciles.Por\notra parte, Ken ha aprendido a jugar por diversión, ha aprendido a luchar hasta\nel final. Cada vez que se presenta la oportunidad de repetirles fragmentos de este\ncuento, lo vuelvo y lo digo, porque es importante no que aprendan a fracasar\nsino que aprendan de sus fracasos.

Milton's poetry and prose reflect deep personal convictions, a passion for freedom and self determination, and the urgent issues and political turbulence of his day. Writing in English, Latin, and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime, and his celebrated Areopagitica,(written in condemnation of pre-publication censorship) is among history's most influential and impassioned defenses of free speech and freedom of the press. -wikipedia", "related": ["B0093M15D2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He's amazing. He can actually still remember the names of the people he helped that day.\"Fayer was referring to the passenger train, which traveled from Jersey City to the Jersey Shore. It derailed in 1939 due to bad weather, killing one and injuring several people.He said Brower's knowledge of history, along with the Fayers' current ties to the community, helped bring the book to fruition. The authors were also aided by Donna Horner and Diane Sooy, who helped out with the genealogy and the large map of the town that is featured in the middle of the book.The book is filled with illustrations of early Chatsworth settlements with detailed descriptions of each picture.Stan Fayer said it was a tricky process of deciding which photographs to use.\"It's funny because when the book was finished, people would complain that we didn't use their photos,\" he said with a laugh. \"But we went through a lot of them. The good thing was I could take my laptop and scanner right to people's houses and scan their photos so they didn't have to worry about losing them. We could scan them right there in their living rooms.\"The book is available at local bookstores and on Amazon.com.Ellen Fayer said she was happy to complete the book and has taken pleasure in seeing it in stores since July. She said she was proud to accomplish writing the book about her hometown.\"I love it here,\" she said. \"I love the woods. We don't have any neighbors, just lots of deer and eagles and peace. It's the perfect place to live.\"Title: Book on Chatsworth highlights glory daysAuthor: Paula ScullyPublisher: APP.comDate: 07/29/2010CHATSWORTH -- Chatsworth, known today for its Cranberry Festival, was once the site of the elite Chatsworth Club, whose members included the Astors, Morgans, Vanderbilts, Biddles, Drexels, Goulds and Levi P. Morton, who served as vice president of the United States from 1889 to 1893These prominent families were attracted to the town because Prince Mario Ruspoli de Poggio-Suasa was an attache at the Italian Embassy in Washington, D.C., and lived here with his wife, a daughter of land speculator Joseph Beers Curtis.The history of Chatsworth is celebrated in a new pictorial book \"Chatsworth: Capital of the Pine Barrens\" by Ellen V. Fayer, Stan Fayer and Walter A. Brower, published by Arcadia Publishing.The three plan a book signing from 2 to 4 p.m. July 31 at \"Hot\" Diggidy Dog at the corner of routes 532 and 563 in Chatsworth.The Fayers owned and operated Island Camera Center in Surf City for 15 years.Brower, who was born and raised in Chatsworth, is Professor Emeritus of Education and Dean Emeritus of the School of Education at Rider University where he serves as an adjunct professor. He has written professional publications for McGraw-Hill Book Company and historical publications about Rider College, with another history in progress.The three Chatsworth residents received help from the Woodland Township Historical Society, from neighbors and former residents who shared family photographs. Proceeds from the book will be used to beautify Woodlawn Cemetery with wrought-iron fencing.Settlers first came to the area in the 1700s. Shamong, renamed Chatsworth in 1901, was a stagecoach stop between Philadelphia and the Shore. Travelers stayed at the Peacock Inn on Main Street. Visitors and workers lodged at The White Horse Inn. The railroad arrived in 1850.Chatsworth was instrumental in the development of the cranberry industry from the early to mid-1800s. In the next century, Chatsworth became instrumental in the development of the blueberry industry because many residents owned blueberry fields.Brower, who once traveled on The Blue Comet, an elegant commuter train, was one of the first on the scene when it wrecked at 5:30 p.m. Aug. 19, 1939, a mile from Chatsworth Station. The roadbed had washed away after an all-day rain.\"There were injuries and one death and that was the cook in the dining car,\" he said.Fayer said the residents are thrilled to see their family histories in print.\"Chatsworth has been portrayed as a rough and rascally town,\" Fayer said. \"A lot of people who came out of here became doctors and lawyers and have gone on to be very successful: Dr. Brower, for example.\"Brower called the book a labor of love. \"It had to be,\" he said, \"because it has to do with my town.\"", "related": ["B0099U5GVU"], "rank": 2021352, "title": "Chatsworth", "author": "Ellen V.

It finally occurred to me that what I was going through at that point in my life was a little thing we all like to call: KARMA Of course, I never believed in things like what comes around goes around. To me that was some idle threat coming out of the mouths of those too defeated to come up with anything better to say.But there I was. Getting my go-around. Or is it come-around?Whatever.The universe, God himself and all the people I'd hurt (whether accidentally or purposefully) were finally getting their revenge.Even if they didn't know it.I was hurting now. I was feeling the pain of losing. I was facing a future that would eventually include having to deal with the fact that the man I loved -- now loved someone else. That I, wasn't good enough. I wasn't what he wanted. I was yesterday's news and it was onto better things for him.And then I thought of the men I'd cast aside for the next best thing, and how I didn't bother to think twice about how my actions effected them.Which led me to remember the men, three of them to be exact, who had wives and families and a little Angie on the side.Back then, when I was the The Other Woman, I didn't give any thought to those wives, lives or families. Not once. I was doing what was right for ME and didn't bother to consider how it felt to be them.And suddenly here I was, aching from a torn out heart and an eyes-wide-open look into what real emotional pain felt like.I was experiencing the destruction of my marriage -- and it didn't matter the \"Why's\" of it's demise -- the hurt and shock and regret and desperation and fear and loneliness was all the same.And it made me want to go back and shake that Angie and warn her of what was yet to come. Sort of like my very own Scrooge-ghost-of-the-future type thing.And it made me want to write.So I did.I wrote \"HOME-WRECKER How to be The Other Woman.\"Not so much as a \"guide\" to wrecking homes but more as a guide to dealing with the situations Other Women get themselves into and the reality of what it's like to live the life of a woman on the side. I wrote it because cheating husbands and their mistresses and their betrayed wives are often in something bigger than they realize.I wrote it as my way of dealing with my coexisting pain, grief and guilt.I wrote it because KARMA really is a BITCH.", "related": ["B00E3ERICC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The voices here describe the perpetual challenges and change of farm life and its personal impacts. Commentary follows the script, accompanied by black-and-white photographs evoking times past. Testimonies cover the struggles and opportunities of three different (at times antagonistic) types of agriculture: direct-market farming, undifferentiated commodity-market farming (one or two bulk commodities sold to food chains), and differentiated, branded-product farming (Eden Farms, Berkshire Pork). All this comes alive in the stories of a middle-aged failed family farmer, an organic vegetable truck farmer, a senior citizen winery owner, and a twentysomething slaughterhouse worker. As this chorus of disparate voices somehow connect, Swander creates a unique achievement: a volume that records how this oral history and theater project “has helped fuel positive change and dialogue” in Iowa. Now, in book form it just may do the same on a national level. --Whitney Scott", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fleeing childhood sexual abuse and two medically unsupervised backwoods abortions by the perpetrator, I lived under a bridge, painting signs in exchange for meals, and washing myself and my clothes in the river—even on the coldest days of winter. What doesn’t make you bitter makes you better. You really can’t make lemonade without lemons. And thank God, I’ve made the transition from atheist to Christian. My two favorite Bible verses are: in everything give thanks, and all things work together to good to them that love the LORD. The worst day in my life was the day I lost my job; my mother died and I couldn’t make plans to attend her funeral because my husband was sent home from the hospital to die; our sheepdog died, and my truck caught on fire in downtown San Antonio, Texas. Things could only get better! Thanks to Jesus, they have! I’m now married to Alan McKean, also an author, with the best-selling The Scent of Time, The Scent of Home and The Scent of Eternity to his credit, all published by Black Rose Writers. We live in lovely Scotland with our rough collie, Angel Joy. My mystery-romance-suspense books Bridge to Nowhere and Bridge Beyond Betrayal have been released by Sunpenny Publishing. They are the first two in a series featuring forty-something Texan “Miz Mike,” whose attempts to mind her own business are foiled by her motto: “never let an adventure pass by unmolested.

For as long as she can remember, reading has been a big part of her life, taking her out of a sometimes harsh reality to wonderful new worlds. When she was in high school, writing became more prevalent. She worked for three years on the newspaper staff as the Arts and Entertainment editor. After graduation and a few bumps in the road, she enrolled at Penn Foster College with a focus in freelance writing. It took several years before she realized she wanted to give writing a book a shot. In 2011, she was diagnosed with cancer. That fight and becoming a survivor gave her new insight and motivations toward her goals. With the realization that none of us are guaranteed tomorrow, she started work on that elusive book. Vampire's Eve is her first publication. Today, Jez still resides in Tennessee with her boyfriend, cat, and dog. She is currently working on her next book. Feel free to like Jez on Facebook.

From India, he went on to serve in Germany, Switzerland, China and Hong Kong. He shares intrigues of State and lets us participate in the dynamic world he observed as it evolved over the course of his postings. His book traverses the cut and thrust of trade diplomacy, with anecdotes about dignitaries and other folk who touched his life. It offers insights into life in the Foreign Service, evoking a good belly laugh whenever it can. His observations attack the senses in a delightfully readable way, bringing to life the pungency of India, the guttural, ordered society of Germany, the Maosuited throngs and ringing cycle bells of China as it opened its doors to the West, and the frenetic business climate of Hong Kong. He also explores deeper issues, like the demands a Foreign Service career can make upon marriages, the ever lurking danger of trade protectionism and the challenge of building new trade alliances and winning new markets.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She aids her clients in a variety of areas; weight loss, relationships, personal accomplishment, overcoming stress and performance anxiety, creativity, and accompanies them in a life-changing experience that does not require techniques or hard work, nor motivation and willpower but rather in assisting her clients in accessing their own Wisdom, Resilience and Innate Well Being. Rachel has been practicing and working with the Three Principles specifically for over a year with extraordinary results both for herself and for her clients. She first came across the Principles and the Inside-Out understanding of the human experience on joining Michael Neill’s “Living from the Inside-Out” program. Recognizing the power of this understanding, she pursued her learning with Michael Neill’s “Coaching from the Inside-Out” program, and the recent 2013 “Living from the Inside-Out” programs, deepening her knowledge further through the teachings at Tikun London (Innate health Conferences of 2011 and 2012) and with the recorded and written teachings of Sydney Banks, the founder of this new approach in psychology, along with materials provided by other eminent Practitioners in the field. She lives near the French town of Nantes with her husband, her two children Alistair and Colleen, two kitties Harry and Ron and a baby girl due to be born in October 2013.", "related": [], "rank": 1707682, "title": "The Gentle Path to Definitive Weight Loss", "author": "Rachel Norwood", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I actually wrote “Tiny Mouse and the Big Spiders” years ago and even submitted it to a publisher. I did receive an offer to publish it, but at the time I was not really sure what I would do with the book and the characters. I felt then as I do now, that it’s a great story with a really exciting premise and would be as much fun to read as it was to write.  I still remember how badly I wanted to learn to read. Once I did, I read everything I could get my hands on, encyclopedias, magazines and books. I had very good  parents who were big readers as I grew up so my family would often make trips to the public library. My parents encouraged my hunger for knowledge and I would have to make two trips to get all my books to the car, as there was no limit. To speak specifically of  Tiny Mouse and the Big Spiders, it came from a desire to write a fictional book about an exciting character who lives in an interesting world that is all around us. Unseen and often unnoticed, small animals and insects live facinating and sometimes violent lives. I have always been amazed by that. It’s always there if we only care (or dare) to look. Tiny Mouse, of course, is a young man (mouse) who gets to take a closer look at that world than I ever could. Although I cast spiders as villains, I have been amazed with them all my life. My family had one species of tarantula in a large terrarium as a pet while our children were growing up. Well cared for, it lived out it’s natural lifespan with us. It brought a little mystery and exotic flair to a normal family home. I hope everyone who reads “Tiny Mouse and the Big Spiders” will share my affection for the secret world of small living things.

The rumblings in the rock were like the movements of its digestive system, and hot steam curled around me like its breath, metallic and sharp.Sweat soaked my hair and ran down my back. At the bottom of the South African Mponeng Mine, five kilometres below the Earth's surface, the dense air compressed under its own weight to generate heat, the temperature increasing by about five degrees for every thousand metres I had descended. The rock face before me was at an average temperature of sixty-five degrees Celsius, 150 degrees Fahrenheit. If the mine's ice plant had been working it wouldn't have been so bad, but they had shut down the feed to the Ultra Deep Levels to encourage the birds to come. I wouldn't be able to survive longer than about twenty minutes in these conditions.And I probably wasn't even going to make it that long, I thought, for the first time hearing the sound of a million tiny wings beating in the distance. Though the sweat poured out of my shoelaces, the screech of the creatures still turned me cold.I pressed myself into the hard rock face, picking up the piece of tubing lying at my feet. I gripped it with both hands, steadied myself and gritted my teeth. If the birds thought they had found an easy target, they were sorely mistaken.I wasn't going down without a fight.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the most colourful South American tradition, the events are often violent and tragic, but the prose is vivid, fast-moving and often dazzling, and he has a cynical eye for the awful comedy of everything ... The pace leaves you breathless Kate Saunders, The Times If you haven't heard of Acosta, he's ballet's new Nureyev - but not only is he a dervish on the dancefloor, he's also a dazzling storyteller ... A tale that sizzles with atmosphere and a sense of place Glamour Jumpy with incident and memorable characters such as Melecio, the child genius who extemporises poetry and designs the Bacardi building and logo, Kid Chocolate, the young boxer KO'd by Oscar's grandfather and the bestial El Mozambique. A little pressure cooker of a novel Daily Express Heat, history and hooch ... Vivid storyteller and ambitious scope Tatler The multitalented Acosta is set to win even more fans with his atmospheric first novel Irish Mail on Sunday In Frank Wynne's skilful translation, Acosta's novel has an earthy charm that makes it more than a mere literary curiosity Sunday Telegraph Impressive Guardian A rich stew of magical realism ... All is related in exuberant, theatrical prose Daily Mail Throughout Pig's Foot, Acosta remains in control of his narrative strands and large cast of characters. Subplots are introduced, pursued and resolved with an awareness of detail that seldom appears contrived. There is an ease about this book that will impress ... Like so many coloured plates in the air, Acosta keeps his narratives spinning furiously yet also cohesively. It is an exciting yarn, often hilarious. One of the many set pieces is a brilliant confrontation in the filthy shack of a vicious outcast ... Acosta is a natural storyteller, with an obvious love of theatre. This gusto is evident in the telling. His prose is simple and descriptive, and he loves exasperation as a medium and uses it to sustain the narrative pace. His characters scream, emote and battle with their feelings. The sex is symphonic, tempers flare and settle, and the dialogue is undercut by humour and a few confessional interludes. It seems unfair that instead of being assessed as another debut novel, Pig's Foot, with all its verve, will be treated as a celebrity foray into fiction by one of the world's finest ballet dancers ... There is no denying Acosta's achievement in creating a world that lives and breathes, one that is vibrantly expressed through Frank Wynne's translation from the original Spanish. It may not seem quite fair that Acosta, who danced Spartacus and so many other roles with such grace, power and majestic artistry, should now also write a lively, delightfully engaging novel, yet he has. Pig's Foot is as catchy as a piece of Cuban music, defers to Latin America's literary tradition and shimmers with a likable swagger all its own Eileen Battersby, Irish Times For all its manifest debt to Latin American so-called \"magic realists\" (Marquez, Borges, Vargas Llosa), the novel stands triumphantly on its own. In pages of salty-sweet prose, it traces five generations of a black family through Cuba's tumultuous recent history ... A narrative by turns lewd and poetic ... The novel, very nicely translated by Frank Wynne, conjures the salt-eaten arcades and collapsing promenades of Havana wonderfully ... A host of sharply drawn characters Spectator It is no doubt a charismatic voice ... Acosta does have an ear for a beautiful phrase, though. His descriptions of the Cuban landscape are elegant and seductive, and he brings the village to life with sensory evocations of eagle feathers, linden tea, sickle bushes, coconut rind and maracas. His huge array of characters, if fleeting in the throng of their melodrama, are at times exquisitely caught ... Acosta also manages to weave in astute and heartfelt observations of Cuba's socio-political story ... The novel does have a gripping quality, which deepens towards the end as we are drawn towards the truth of Oscar's tale. It is a wild, heady flight of imagination, and Acosta makes good use of his natural understanding of sequence and grace and suspense. He dances well on the page Guardian Acosta evokes the sweltering rot of tropical poverty very well and he has a facility with the bizarre and fantastical ... Acosta's translator Frank Wynne captures the energy of Acosta's prose with meticulous and sustained flair ... This knockabout epic marks an impressive further stage in Acosta's emergence as a writer Independent As salty and pungent as Saturday night in the docks of Havana. It's a cocktail of forbidden lust, murder and santeria, or Cuban voodoo ... The surprise of Pig's Foot is that a dancer can write fiction and write it well ... Pig's Foot proves that the celebrated hoofer knows a thing or two about telling stories ... A breezily self-confident voice Evening Standard An act of dance on the page: high-wire, electric, springing between place and time and character ... The achievement of Pig's Foot, its depth and range, history and humour, will assure him a wide and thrilled audience, entraced by the dancer's agility with words Harper's Bazaar An enormously warm-hearted novel: tearful at times, triumphant at others. Acosta's unflinching descriptions of his native country are so rich you feel you've been there. He's a natural storyteller, weaving together the strands of a history that manages to be intimately personal and a vivid portrait of an emerging nation Mail on Sunday A novel as salty and pungent as Saturday night in the docks of Havana. It's a cocktail of forbidden lust, murder and Santeria, or Cuban voodoo ... With Pig's Foot Acosta proves a dancer can write fiction - and write it well Scotland on Sunday Spellbinding ... Acosta does for prose what he has done for the ballet, bringing to it a muscular sexiness and a rural saltiness that is translated with evident relish by the award-winning Frank Wynne ... The rude jokes and the outlandish characters in Part One are magnificent ... Despite my fears, this multi-talented individual turns out to be infuriatingly good at writing fiction, too Independent on Sunday Acosta has as much a winning way with words as he ahs charm and presence on the ballet stage ... Translated from the original Spanish by award-winning translator Frank Wynne, Acosta's prose is poetic and raw. He conjures evocative landscapes ... And conveys sympathy ... Passionate and uncompromising to the end, Oscar exerts a powerful charm on the reader The Lady When an acclaimed ballet dancer makes a foray into writing fiction, be prepared for it to be hailed as \"sure-footed\". The good news is that Cuban star Carlos Acosta does, indeed, barely put a step wrong in his debut novel, Pig's Foot, an exuberantly enjoyable tale Financial Times", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The writing is visually stimulating, allowing me to easily picture the action that goes on. She creates a fantastic main character with Lucy Jennings, who is actually carrying some hurts from her childhood that cause her to be a bit guarded, and very realistic, which makes her a likable character. Her mindset over being cheated on was spot on. Her sharp wit is laced with just the right amount of humor. Romance was the last thing she really wanted, but the spark turns into a flame between her and Duncan! Creative plot twists really kept the momentum going, making for a page-turning read. Ms. Watts blends together just the right amount of humor in this action packed, romance-laced, who dun-it of a murder mystery to keep me guessing who the bad guy was. Anyone who enjoys a good, suspense-filled, mystery along with romance will certainly enjoy A Bundle of Deceit.", "related": [], "rank": 4705354, "title": "A Bundle Of Deceit", "author": "Stacey Watts", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The topics in my blog that you can expect to see are blog tours & cover reveals, book reviews, critical thinking, poetry, psychology, writing, free books and more. Every negative experience I have had over the course of my life has taught me a critical lesson, and my goal is to help others learn from those experiences rather than having to face the traumas that I have to do so. One simple lesson that I have learned is that knowledge is power, and with that power it may be possible to prevent the worst from happening. I also would like to offer support to those that have had similar situations (or even unrelated ones) and would like to see a way to move on from those experiences, knowing that the future is much brighter than the present when facing dark times.I welcome any and all discussions on my blog posts (so long as they remain appropriate), so feel free to comment whenever you have something that you would like to add or discuss. If there are any other topics that you would like to see from me, email me anytime and I will implement any ideas that I can.Kindle blogs are fully downloaded onto your Kindle so you can read them even when you're not wirelessly connected.

Both Nathan and Julia\nwere in love earlier and circumstances forced them apart when Nathan\ndecided to leave Julia. It was heartbreaking for the both of them and\nthe memories of their time together haunted them both. Now they are\nworking together and Nathan is her boss. Their hidden feelings and\nattraction for each other resurface. Will Julia be able to control her\nfeelings for him? Will Nathan be attracted to Julia again like before?Both the characters of Nathan and Julia are very attractively portrayed.\n The heartbreak that Julia goes through when Nathan leaves her is\ntangible. The conflicting emotions that Nathan goes through when he\ndecides to leave Julia is woven well into the story. The emotional\nstates of the lovers are different yet they are intertwined with each\nother. The author has done an excellent job in setting them apart, at\nthe same time linking them with their emotions. The book is sensual and\nthe romance between them is portrayed strongly enough to make readers\nwish that they get back together.The story is romantic and there are some moments which seal the\nintensity of what the lovers feel for each other. Julia's character is a\n bit more dramatic than Nathan's and she is more expressive. Nathan is\nintense and deep. The other characters lend good support to these two\nmain characters to make it an exciting love story for readers.", "related": ["B00L82ZVYE"], "rank": 196814, "title": "Serendipity (Inevitable Book 1)", "author": "Janet Nissenson", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.1333, "rating_total": 62.0}

She attended a two-room schoolhouse beginning in 1st grade and had the same teacher until she changed schools after 7th. Beginning at about age 12, Sibylla discovered historical romance, feeding off of work of Jude Deveraux and Lisa Kleypas. She loves a book that can make the reader run the gamut of emotions, from the sweet glow of new love to gut-wrenching heartache. She is a true romantic and always has stories floating around in her head, living in a fantasyland until she writes them down to free them. Music is her emotional trigger. Growing up with a Wagnarian-loving mother, Sibylla was raised to treasure music that digs deep into the psyche, drawing out elation, sorrow, grief, desire. The soundtrack to her life includes many genres spanning centuries. She looooooooves Thirty Seconds to Mars (rather obsessively, actually... but, really, how can you NOT be crazy about those guys!?) and pimps them out to all her friends through Spotify. She also delights in Met Opera HD broadcasts at her local movie theater and hopes (listening Met?) to someday see Diana Damrau reprise her role as Mozart’s Queen of the Night in Die Zauberflöte. Sibylla lives with her husband and hero who saved her from her own calamitous, young-adult self. He makes her laugh daily, even when things are tough. He’s proved to her that love really can heal a shattered soul. In 18 years, they have never had a fight, although they argue regularly with their two teenage kids who have, unfortunately, inherited their father’s quick wit (unfortunate as it is a quick wit that Sibylla, herself, definitely does not possess¬¬—there is a reason she is a writer and not a stand-up comedian). They live a quiet life with their two weird little rescued Chiweenies. Wait… teenagers & little yap-dogs? OK, maybe not so quiet.", "related": [], "rank": 606610, "title": "In the Firelight", "author": "Sibylla Matilde", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 45, "rating_average": 4.4222, "rating_total": 199.0}

Yoga\nfor Health and Happiness by Julie Bernier is an excellent guide to\nhelping you to develop those elements. Beginning with an understanding\nof the true purpose of yoga, Julie explains the origins and the\ntraditional purposes which reach beyond today's fitness classes and goes\n into the deeper meanings which affect mind and spirit. Yoga is more\nthan the 40 postures and movements that Julie demonstrates and she\ncovers those additional aspects as thoroughly. Learning to breathe\nproperly and to focus the mind while moving through the poses, helps the\n reader become more in touch with their inner being and is also clearly\ndemonstrated and discussed. There are very clear photos to help guide\nthe reader as well. Through this guide, beginners or ongoing students\nwill be able to fully understand and move forward toward both health and\n happiness.Having been introduced to Iyengar Yoga as a\ntherapeutic treatment for a lower back injury, I have desired to\ncontinue in the other forms of Hatha as a calming and relaxing means of\nfocusing my entire outlook. Julie Bernier has made it easy for me to\nmove back into the practice with Yoga for Health and Happiness . . .

She’s always had her nose in a book, has traveled the world over, and even tested the time-space continuum, thanks to the awesome power of the written word. One of her writing quirks is that she loves to include bits and pieces of her ancestors and ancestry in all of her books. Her family centers her and keeps her sane, which is why she enjoys adding elements of family, hearth, and home in all of her romances. C.H. has penned two contemporary romance trilogies for Sourcebooks: The Secret Life of Cowboys, featuring the Garahan brothers; and her Small Town USA trilogy, featuring the Mulcahy sisters. Also available are the first five books in her Amazon Bestselling Historical Irish Western Series: The Marshal’s Destiny, The Rancher’s Heart, Pearl’s Redemption, A Gift From Home, and the short story For Love of Flynn. C.H. is currently writing Masterson’s story, book 6 in her Irish Western Series and will travel further back in time to Regency England for the re-release of the first book in her Three Vices Trilogy: Patience. Look for Charity and Prudence’s books later this year.     With 8 short stories and 15 novels to her credit, this award-winning, multi-published author’s books are available in paperback, hardcover, trade paperback, magazine, and e-book.

I am a proud wife and stay at home mom.  After my first child was born, I started to focus on the ingredients used in our everyday health and beauty products. The more and more research I did, the more nervous and upset I became towards companies and their lack of care towards consumers.  Fast forward two years, shortly after having my second child, I was diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer. During my fight against this disease, I began researching possible causes. I soon began to learn just how many harmful ingredients were not identified on product labels.  I vowed once I recovered to share my knowledge through my newly established company producing all natural products, that include soaps, balms, bath salts, etc etc.  My books are intended to not only educate, but also to share the knowledge and passion that I have gained through my struggles over the last few years.  I hope you enjoy my books.

It represents a state-of-the-art mapping of the parameters of social work research. Both structure and content lend themselves to what will certainly come to be regarded as a benchmark statement within the field... the editors of the Handbook have undoubtedly fulfilled their ambitions by producing what by any standards is a benchmark text which is well worth the investment - time, effort, money (!) - entailed in getting to grips with the stimulating and rewarding debates within. It is hard to envisage how this undertaking could have been more impressive...'Qualitative Social Work JournalThis is a highly ambitious, well thought out, carefully constructed, and thought-provoking volume that 'maps' social work research past and present. It differs markedly from most edited texts in its combination of diversity, coherence, and comprehensiveness... an original, stimulating and readable book in which not a single chapter is a rehash of the writer's previously published papers, as happens all too often in edited volumes. The modest term 'handbook' in its title hardly does justice to the book's depth, scope, and quality. While it can certainly serve as a ready reference guide, its thoughtfulness and questioning make it much more than a compendium of information, however rich. It is highly recommended for social work professionals throughout the Western world.International Social Work Journal'This is an internationally relevant handbook in the real sense of the word, as it provides a holistic and thorough overview of social work research in its current state... I have had the book for some months now and it fills me with optimism every time I pick it up. It has had a similar effect on nervous final-year social work students studying research, as they have expressed a huge sigh of relief afterexamining this text because it offers so much knowledge and expertise in one place. It is clearly a must-have textbook for all final-year undergraduates, postgraduates, post-qualifying and research students because there is something for all inside. I would even go as far as to say it is an unrivalled international text that practitioners should also have if they feel serious about transforming the profession that they are part of.'British Journal of Social Work", "related": [], "rank": 3884592, "title": "The SAGE Handbook of Social Work Research", "author": "Ian Shaw", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
