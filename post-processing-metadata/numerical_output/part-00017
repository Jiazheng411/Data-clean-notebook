This one isn't. And my goodness doesn't it show. The prose sings, the story flows effortlessly, and the exposition is refreshingly centred on humanitarian aspects. The character, lifestyle, social context, and motivation of the subject spring into life. The book is an absolute joy, not only for its insight into the accomplishments of one of the world's greatest scientists, but also for its historic review of the scientific turmoil caused by relegating planet Earth from its religious and philosophical position at the centre of the cosmos to its present-day role as a rather insignificant member of the Sun's family of eight planets.The Observatory: a review of astronomy, vol. 126, no. 1190, p. 55 (Feb. 2006) [by David W. Hughes].[...] Naess weaves an excellent account of the story of Galileo. Addressed to the sophisticated general reader, it is an account that is alive, articulate, and well constructed, and one that provides the important larger context that surrounds the drama itself. This reviewer recommends it highly to anyone interested in a succinct and comprehensive look at the \"saga\" of Galileo.MAA Online book review columne, Alexander J. Hahn, October 2005 The complete review can be found here: http://www.maa.org/reviews/naessgalileo.html[...] Atle Naess knows how to write a readable book. He wastes no time on padding. He weaves the history, the personalities and the technicalities together expertly, with a sure eye for an interesting detail and an ability to cut through the myths, propaganda and speculation that surround the Galileo case. [...] The aim of the book is a short introduction to introduce the man and whet the appetite for his ideas.

Again. It wasn't a downpour, but a gentle rain, wet just the same, and chilly.Becca, shoulders hunched with exhaustion, trudged back to her lodging, such as it was in the tiny African village that everyone, including God, seemed to have forgotten.After over eighteen months in the village, Becca was beyond weary. There were times when she wasn't sure she could keep going, but the people needed her as much as the small hospital, which had been built by the generosity of American philanthropists. And she had come to love the people, especially the children, with their sweet faces and innocent dark eyes.Rebecca Jameson had been an O.R. nurse at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital for several years before volunteering to go serve in this small hospital in Africa. Working ten, twelve and sometimes as many as fourteen hours a day, every day, was beginning to wear on her.Becca knew she should heed the advice of just about everyone urging her to accept a replacement and go back to the States for a long rest. But since Dr. Seth Andrews, the very talented but equally arrogant surgeon, had all but demanded she go, she stubbornly refused to leave.Grateful for about the hundredth time for being advised to bring boots with her, Becca slogged along the squishy ground, her mind replaying the long shift she had moments ago completed. She sighed. For some reason Dr. I'm-The-Boss-And-You're-Not Andrews had been exceptionally cranky throughout the entire day.Head lowered, concentrating on putting one foot in front of the other, Becca frowned as her sight became gray, darker than the overcast sky. What—It was her last thought as darkness closed in, enveloping her. The next moment, she toppled over onto her face, out cold.…Becca surfaced slowly from unconsciousness.Her head ached. Her entire body hurt. Her mind felt fuzzy, as if it were stuffed with cotton.Her first thought wasn't,where am I?It was,pain, so much pain.She made a soft moan of protest.\"Oh, finally awake are you? I told you that you were exhausted.\"Even with her mind cloudy, Becca recognized the barely civil voice of Dr. Andrews. \"I guess so,\" she replied, her voice an unfamiliar croak. \"So, I suppose I'll live to irritate you another day.\" She decided her brain must have been rattled, or she'd have never had the nerve to speak to the Great One that way.\"No, you won't, smart mouth.\" His tone was menacing.\"I'm going to die?\"\"No, Rebecca, you're not going to die.\" Now his tone carried a note of amusement. \"You're going home.\"Home?No!The word rang loud and clear inside her muddled head. Despite his obvious dislike of her, and his equally obvious desire to get rid of her, Becca didn't want to leave. She just couldn't leave the children. And, secretly, she didn't want to leave him, and not see him again, either.Besides, as grumpy as he was, Seth Andrews was the very best physician and surgeon she had ever worked with, in and out of the O.R.\"I…don't…want…\" she began, her throat tight with anxiety.\"I don't care what you want,\" he said, his voice flat and adamant. \"You are worn-out. The next time you'd go down…\" He paused, drew a sharp breath. \"Well, there's not going to be a next time. I've called for transport. You're going stateside, like it or not.\"\"But…\" she tried to protest.\"Nobuts,Rebecca. You're going home. Period. Now, shut up while I examine you.\"Becca closed her eyes to hold back the tears welling behind them. Damn him. She flinched slightly at the cold feel of the stethoscope on her bare flesh.Her bare flesh.A sudden, unwanted tingle slid the length of her body at the realization of her breasts being bared to him. He's a physician, for pity's sake, she reminded herself, gritting her teeth to contain the sensation. She sighed with a mixture of relief and disappointment when she felt her gown once again covering her.\"You're a little congested.\" He frowned. \"Still, you're good to go.\"Her eyes popped open. \"Can I get up?\" She stared at him. He appeared exhausted, strained. Lines of weariness scored his thin, chiseled face. If anything, he looked worse than he had the last time she had seen him. When was that, she wondered… yesterday, maybe?\"No.\" He shook his head, setting his too long thatch of dark hair in motion.Becca had always thought he had beautiful, shiny hair. But now, he badly needed a decent haircut. She wasn't about to tell him that. She wasn't up to his scalding rebuke.She closed her eyes again.\"That's right. Sleep, you need it.\"As if he didn't. Becca kept the thought to herself. His lack of rest was his problem.She was out again in moments. This time she fell into a deep, normal sleep.When Becca woke the second time, the headache was gone, or mostly gone, very likely from whatever medication he'd ordered running through her IV. Her body still hurt all over, but not as much as before.\"Feeling any better?\"Not his voice. With a sigh of relief, Becca opened her eyes, smiling at the pretty, coffee-colored face of the young nurse standing by her bed. \"Yes,\" she answered, her voice still a dry croak. \"I'm thirsty.\"The nurse, Shakana, smiled back. \"I'm not surprised. You've been asleep a long time.\" Her English was flawless, not only because she had attended an American university, but also because she had diligently practiced it…with Becca's help ever since she had come to Shakana's village.Watching as the young woman filled a cup with water for her, Becca asked, \"How long have I been here…I mean since I keeled over in the road?\"\"You went down the day, or evening, before yesterday.\"\"Two days.\" Becca croaked, gratefully excepting a few sips of the cool water from the straw Shakana offered her. \"I'm concussed?\" It was obvious, of course she was concussed. She had done a header, hadn't she?\"Yes, a mild concussion.\" Shakana smiled. \"How's the headache?\"\"Better.\" She managed a faint smile. \"But the memory lingers on.\"\"You were exhausted, Becca, or you wouldn't have collapsed. You simply couldn't go anymore.\"Becca sighed, and blinked at the tears misting her eyes. \"And now he's sending me home,\" she said, her voice still faint, but hard-edged with bitterness.Grabbing a tissue from a box next to the bed, Shakana wiped away the tears running down Becca's face. \"Don't cry,\" she said. \"It's for the best.\"\"Best for who?\" Becca cried in a croak. \"For me or him?\"\"Whom.\" Shakana smiled.\"Who, whom, what the hell difference does it make?\" She was crying harder. \"I don't want to go, and he knows it. I want to stay here, work with you…\" She was now sobbing. \"He doesn't like me, so he's using my fall as an excuse to get rid of me.\"\"Oh, Becca, no,\" Shakana said, still mopping away the tears. \"You didn't fall, you collapsed. Dr. Andrews doesn't dislike you…\" She hesitated, bit her lip. \"I think. He is a physician, and he is right about your condition. You're worn-out.\"\"But I could rest here,\" Becca protested. \"A couple days of rest and I could—\"\"No, Becca, you couldn't,\" Shakana interrupted. \"It won't be enough. Have you looked at yourself in a mirror lately?\"\"Well, of course I have, every morn—\"Shakana again cut her off. \"No, I don't mean a quick glance while brushing your teeth, or your hair. I mean really looked, stark naked.\"Becca shook her head, wincing at the stab of pain. \"No, why in the world would I do that?\" she asked with sharp impatience.\"Why indeed?\" the nurse drawled. \"Gee, you don't know you're practically down to nothing but skin and bones, do you?\"\"Oh, come on, Shak,\" Becca protested, using the nickname she had given her friend. \"I know I've lost a little weight, but…\" In truth, she was well aware she had lost a lot of weight, but still she felt compelled to deny it.\"A little weight?\" Shakana repeated in astonishment. \"Becca, you are skinny, hardly any flesh on your bones at all. Your clothes hang on you.\" She gave Becca a shrewd look. \"Oh, I know you've been wearing smaller tops, but your scrub pants literally hang on your hips, and despite the elastic waistband, I think the only thing holding them up is your protruding hip bones.\"Becca bit her lips, admitting, \"I was going to get a smaller pair of pants, when I got around to it.\"Crossing her arms over her ample breasts, Shakana gave her an arch look, murmuring, \"Uh-huh.\"Becca couldn't help a weak smile. \"Well, I thought about getting a smaller pair.\"Shakana shook her head, her dark eyes sad. \"Oh, Becca, I'm going to miss you so much. But it's time for you to go home, rest, put on some weight. Dear friend, it hurts me to see you like this.\"Tears welled in Becca's eyes. \"Come with me, Shak, please.\"Those sad dark eyes grew misty. \"I can't, Becca. You know that. This is my home.\"\"I know.\" Becca heaved a deep sigh, coughing with what she thought was the emotional tightness in her chest. \"I know,\" she repeated, accepting another tissue from her best friend.Crying softly after Shakana had left to check on her many other patients, Becca fell into a deep dreamless sleep once more.At the jostling of her body, Becca was startled awake. What…? she thought, her eyes opening wide as she realized she was being moved onto a litter.Shakana was there, and Dr. Andrews, directing the procedure, of course.\"Shakana?\" she croaked from her dry-as-dust throat. \"Why am I being moved?\"\"The plane is here for you,\" Dr. Andrews said, his voice devoid of inflection.\"But, my stuff…\" she began.Shakana squeezed her hand. \"I packed your things for you, Becca.\"\"But…\" Heaving a long sigh, Becca gave up, knowing protest was pointless. She glanced around at the men handling the litter. From their uniforms and insignia, she could tell they were an American rescue team.\"I'm so thirsty, can I have some water, please?\" She looked to Shakana, but it was Dr. Andrews who moved, holding up his hand to halt the crew. Taking the cup Shakana handed him, he put the s...", "related": ["B00E1V5U68"], "rank": 367941, "title": "The M.D.'s Mistress (Gifts from a Billionaire Book 1892)", "author": "Joan Hohl", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I loved how Shantay and Loran teamed up to help Mikah get through his doubts. Shantay's ability to be a submissive or a little on the dominate side depending on which of her mates she was with gave her more depth. While she was raised to be a pampered princess, Shantay showed that when needed she could in fact find some inner strength. The voyeurism and M/M scenes are written with understated class and Ms. James allows you to share her characters' close emotional bonds.\" -- GJM, RORR Reviews5 CHERRIES: \"The Family Jewel is a book that every man should read when learning how to treat a woman. The men are loving, caring, respectful, and most importantly true to their word. Although the sex is scorching hot, the men cherish Shantay, their Family Jewel, in all the ways a woman should be cherished instead of treating her like a servant or a slave. The emotional bond that develops between all of the characters brings the story full circle. The spirit and warmth of the heroine and heroes have the ability to ease whatever troubles you’re struggling with and bring a sense calm, peace, warmth, and love to your heart.

Beka Valentine is being stalked by a bounty hunter skilled at blending in with the Drift's many attractions; irrepressibly promiscuous engineer Harper is poisoned by a former lover who tells him the antidote can only be found back on Earth; and Dylan discovers his ship is being targeted for takeover by an approaching Nietzschean warfleet.

Her Grace's penny pinching ways heighten the threat of highwaymen attacking the carriage as they journey from Bath to London for her great-granddaughter's wedding. They have only their driver and the postilion armed with an ancient fowling piece for protection. It proves woefully inadequate. They are attacked by the highwayman known as Captain Macheath and his henchman. However, things don't go entirely the Captain's way. The Duchess suffers a heart spell during the course of the robbery and he is forced to take them to a poacher's cottage until her strength returns. The wily old lady sets Marianne to recovering her diamonds, while she \"recovers\". The Captain is a formidable opponent. His speech and manner are that of a gentleman. His good looks and charm are that of a man few women could resist. Marianne soon finds it is her heart she must recover. A Highwayman Came Riding gives us the lighter side of Joan Smith. The style is informal and the wit rapier sharp. Joan Smith's familiarity with Regency England is evident as she gives us a glimpse of the other side of society and the political reality of the common soldier after war. But then, things are not always what they seem!Joan Smith has added another jewel to her crown ... and it's a diamond! Vastly entertaining and impossible to put down!

Meg Hazard has big troubles. She's trying to keep her family's bed-and-breakfast in Bar Harbor, Maine, afloat. Then handsome former Chicago cop Tom Wyler moves into the neighborhood looking for peace and quiet, and becomes infatuated with Meg's gorgeous sister Allie, a recovering alcoholic. To top it all off, the reclusive town eccentric, Orel Tremblay, summons Meg to his side, eager to impart details of a dark and tragic past before he dies. Meg finds herself caught up in the mystery surrounding the Great Fire of 1947 and her grandmother's death. When Meg begins to see visions from her grandmother's past, she is forced to take Orel's hints of murder and thwarted love seriously and soon becomes determined to dig up the long-buried truth. Undeniably attracted to Tom, Meg tries to deny her feelings for Allie's sake. By seamlessly alternating the suspense of a growing romance with that of an evolving mystery, the author keeps the reader hungry for more.

She was cheerful and loving and her house always smelled like fresh baked bread.  She had a 'snuggle up' lap and plenty of affection to go around for all of her grandchildren\", Adele comments.  Her passing was difficult, but did not dim the wonderful memories Adele still carries in her heart.   One night, many years after her Grandma Tony's death, Adele woke to the sound of her grandmother's voice in her head.  She got up, went to her computer and typed what was streaming through her mind.  The end result, How The Fox Got His Color.  Less than a week later, Adele awoke once again in the pre-dawn hours and went to her computer.  By daylight, Where Hummingbirds Come From was complete. After her son-in-law immigrated to America from Beijing, she watched him struggle to learn the English language.  It became apparent that prepositions are one of the most difficult concepts to comprehend.  Upon his request, she began to write a children’s book using a number of prepositions.  The end result is The Dance of The Caterpillars.  Adele has used twenty three prepositions, 1 two-word multiple, and 2 three-word multiples in this story. Adele’s children’s books have become popular for English as a second language students all over the world and are on the top 10 list of ESL study material on Amazon.  At the time of the publication of this book, How the Fox Got His Color is available on Kindle and Nook in twelve languages, Where Hummingbirds Come From is available in ten languages, and The Dance Of The Caterpillars in ten languages.

He was the author of the Shahnameh, the national epic of Persia (Iran).Ferdowsi was born in the Iranian province of Razavi Khorasan, in a village near Tus, in 935. His father was a wealthy land owner. Ferdowsi was a pious Muslim.His great epic, the Shahnameh (\"The Epic of Kings\"), to which he devoted more than 35 years, was originally composed for presentation to the Samanid princes of Khorasan, who were the chief instigators of the revival of Iranian cultural traditions after the Arab conquest of the seventh century.When he was just 23-years old, he found a \"Shahnameh\" written by Abu-Mansour Almoammari; it was not, however, in poetic form. It consisted of older versions ordered by Abu-Mansour ibn Abdol-razzagh. The discovery would be a fateful moment in the life of the poet. Ferdowsi started his composition of the Shahnameh in the Samanid era in 977. During Ferdowsi's lifetime the Samanid dynasty was conquered by the Ghaznavid Empire.After 30 years of hard work, he finished the book and two or three years after that, Ferdowsi went to Ghazni, the Ghaznavid capital, to present it to the king. There are various stories in medieval texts describing the lack of interest shown by the new king, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, in Ferdowsi and his lifework. According to historians, Mahmud had promised Ferdowsi a dinar for every distich written in the Shahnameh (60,000 dinars), but later retracted and presented him with dirhams (20,000 dirhams), which were at that time much less valuable than dinars (every 100 dirhams worth 1 dinar). Some think it was the jealousy of other poets working at the king's court that led to this treachery; the incident encouraged Ferdowsi's enemies in the court. Ferdowsi rejected the money and, by some accounts, he gave it to a poor man who sold wine. Wandering for a time in Sistan and Mazandaran, he eventually returned to Tus, heartbroken and enraged.He had left behind a poem for the King, stuck to the wall of the room he had worked in for all those years. It was a long and angry poem, more like a curse, and ended with the words:\"Heaven's vengeance will not forget. Shrink tyrant from my words of fire, and tremble at...\"(Quote from wikipedia.org)", "related": ["B0067BDG6Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is quite similar to the Law of Attraction, and gives steps on changing the beliefs that you currently have, so that your dreams can come shining through. Make Your Dreams Come True is a written in a very easy to read format. However, the subject matter may not be quite as easy for people to grasp. Changing your belief system isn't always easy, and if you haven't tried any positive thinking or Law of Attraction type of work, it might be hard for you, at least at first. The steps and processes that Pamala Oslie provides in this book really need to be used while reading the text. These are the steps that will help you to change your beliefs. Of course you could read the book in full, and then read it again practicing these lessons along the way. However, just reading the material isn't likely enough to allow you to fully \"get\" the material. If you are on a spiritual journey, at a loss for what to do in your life, or are looking for ways to make your dreams come true, this is a fantastic book for you to read to hopefully make some (if not all) of those dreams of yours come true. I highly recommend it. * Thank you to the publisher of Make Your Dreams Come True, Amber Allen, for providing me with a copy of this book for review.

After Mo arrives, a meth laboratory is found in the town, and two area residents are murdered, thought to be the result of a drug deal gone bad; complicating matters further, Aidan is one of the suspects. Believing her nephew is not a drug user or a murderer, Mo sets out to prove his innocence. Personal issues intervene, as Mo finds that her mother's memory is slipping, and her old high-school boyfriend, now the sheriff, still has feelings for her. And then there's the matter of whether her husband will still be there when she finally returns home. The importance of family and faith permeate this mix of mystery and family drama, the third in a series.Sue O'BrienCopyright © American Library Association.

In the mid-1990s, British author Ritchie and his Japanese wife sojourned for more than two years in Sora, a fishing and farming village on the Japan Sea coast peopled mostly by the elderly. Through his own rambles around the countryside and conversations with his neighbors, whose foibles and idiosyncrasies he sketches sympathetically, Ritchie steeped himself in local customs, festivals, lore, and religious practices centered on Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples. Although his book is filled with keen observation and fascinating detail, it is not an anthropologist's village studyAit is a Buddhist meditation, an elegy.

She is currently at work on a novel tentatively entitled, The Last Place, and various essays. Jane teaches restorative practices--a body of communication and violence-prevention skills-to students and teachers in public schools and at universities. Jane survives her husband, Dwight, who was murdered in his office at the University of Iowa in 1991, along with five others. At the time of his murder, Dwight Nicholson was serving his third term as Departmental Chair of the Physics Department. The mass slaying ricocheted through the community of Iowa City and far beyond, touching Jane's and Dwight's family, friends, students and colleagues. Jane and Dwight met in high school and married after graduating from the University of Wisconsin. They lived in Berkeley, California, Boulder, Colorado, and Iowa City. In each place, they studied, taught, and wrote. At the time of Dwight's murder, Jane was directing a women's studies program and teaching comparative literature in academia. During three years of engaging in healing therapies, Jane appeared in public to talk about violence prevention. Marking this time, and not rushing life or grief, Jane then changed her work life to engage in violence prevention.

Much to my husband's dismay I really\ndidn't want to put this book down.  From the first page to the last page\n was an excellent read and would love to read more books like these.  A\ndefinite must for your library!!\n-Amazon reviewer, UK**** ScaryThe story was well constructed, bringing in three separate strands and\ndrawing them together, and I liked the way it was written.  I found it\nhard to put down, partly because it was pretty scary, also very gory but\n the story line was intriguing. Although there are paranormal aspects to\n it, it is largely a thriller with a story line to keep you hooked\nthroughout.  I give very few 5* ratings and thoroughly enjoyed this book\n - happy to recommend it - to those with strong constitutions.\n-Amazon reviewer, UK***** So intense, keep holding your breathAs soon as I dived into Red Mountain, I was swimming into a myriad of\nemotions. Fear, self doubt, anticipation and a feeling that failure was\nnot an option. The story is so well written that it keeps you captivated\n from the first word and you need to know what happens next. Admittedly,\n it is not the easiest read, because the story is  so intense, and so\nmany  past events are linked to the present that you have to keep alert.If\n you do not believe in the spirit world, malevolent beings and shamans,\nthen the plot may seem far fetched and this is may not be the book for\nyou. If, on the other hand, you think everything is possible, then\ndip into Red Mountain. It will leave you breathless and on edge, even\nafter you have turned the last page. -Amazon reviewer, UK", "related": ["B00J4VZQ4Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 3.8, "rating_total": 57.0}

When Mizani was just Eight years old he walked in on two heroine addicts getting ready to shoot up, he never realized the danger that he was in at that very moment, he has been quoted as saying \"I could feel a dangerous electricity in the air and a force field that kept me out of harms way.\" He became intoxicated by the danger and he often sought out and watched people that were in that world to find out what made them tick. Mizani was first introduced to the world of books at an early age which sparked his imagination and lit a fire under him prompting him to let his mind wander. He often said that the story and characters in his novels enter him and take on a life of their own. His ultimate goal is to educate the reader on the dangers of living a fast and corrupt life and also what can happen when you choose to make a better life for yourself after being put threw hell.  Mizani researched and interviewed Hustlers, Prostitutes, Drug Addicts, Trans genders, Men on the Down low and many people suffering from Mental illness so he would have a better understanding of what he was writing about.

With age, her writing has evolved to more grown-up topics, like love and the complicated relationships between people. As a life-long lover of cheerful fiction, she strives to tackle real-world issues with wit, hope, and lots of humor. Her short stories have spanned many genres, but her full-length novels stay firmly planted in happy endings, via both romance and women’s fiction. In 2009, Stephanie joined the Romance Writers of America to celebrate her addiction to perfect plot resolutions with other writers just like her. Combining a passion for the human condition with a penchant for the romantic, Stephanie strives to write every story as though it is a conversation shared between friends. As she balances new motherhood, a freelance writing workload, and an independent publishing career, Stephanie continues her work on a planned three-book women’s fiction series, a collection of romantic urban fantasy short stories, and several single-title romances. Her first novel, A Previous Engagement, was released in July 2011. She lives, loves, and writes near Boston, MA, the home of all of her novels.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

How do you think up those stories? Where do\nthe ideas come from? And every writer will probably answer the same way--from\neverywhere. But I think a particularly fun story about how the ideas spring to\nlife comes from my brand new book,Fire\nBalls. So let me tell you where this story came from.Some of you may know\nthat last year I wrote a novella calledVolley\nBalls. That idea was inspired by a friend who sent me a video of an Aussie\nBums swim trunks ad. I created a story\nof a gay art gallery owner in beautiful Laguna Beach, California who meets two\nAustralian volley ball players on the beach. Since the setting of the story is\nso great and people liked the book, I decided I wanted to write a sequel toVolley Balls. Clearly, the title had to\ninvolve balls! LOL. So I sorted through the words that go with balls.\nFortunately, I had lots to choose from. Fire Balls leaped out at me. Oh boy, I\ncould write a story with a firefighter. YUM! I love contrast in my heroes so I\ndecided to make my point of view character as unlikely as possible. InVolley BallsI had introduced a\ncharacter I loved named Rodney who is my hero's best friend. We don't learn a\nlot about him inVolley Ballsso I\nknew I could create a whole story for him. But we do know that he is small and\nfeisty. Here was a perfect contrast to a hunky alpha firefighter. But what's\nthe story?I decided to make\nRodney a painter. Since David the gallery owner was his friend that would make\nsense. Then where does the conflict come from? I know Rod is self-assured but\nhe's small. What if he paints gorgeous men and considers himself unattractive?\nSuddenly I thought of the famous play, Cyrano de Bergerac, in which the great\nswordsman is also a poet and artist but thinks of himself as unworthy of love\nbecause of his huge nose. He tries to set up his friend with the woman he\nhimself loves. Bingo. There was the framework for a story--minus the nose. An artist who is also a black belt in karate\nadores a hunky firefighter but thinks the man could never love him back so he\ntries to play matchmaker between the man he loves and his good friend, the\nhandsome surfer. Cyrano and the firefighter. That's where this book idea came\nfrom.", "related": ["B00LMMBYMS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 27, "rating_average": 4.4444, "rating_total": 120.0}

Now, with Congress's vote on the Vampires Rights Act just days away, most vampires (sanguivores is the PC term) are on their best behavior. In this relatively gore-free, stand-alone sequel to Suck It Up (Delacorte, 2008), Morning wants out of the spotlight. He just wants to spend time with his human girlfriend, Portia, and focus on training to be a fireman for the NYFD. The advancement of vampire rights and Morning's desire to lead a quiet life are jeopardized when the evil vampire he and Portia killed in the first book comes back to life bent on revenge. It does not help that Becky-Dell Wallace, an outspoken and powerful anti-vampire congresswoman, is doing all she can to fan the flames of vampire phobia. It is up to Morning, Portia, and a few of their friends to fight back before the nice vampires lose the political ground they have gained. This book defies any efforts to give it a genre label. Action and suspense abound, with a little romance thrown in for good measure. In addition, between the soy-based blood substitute favored by vegan vampires and faux terms such as \"dentis eruptus,\" Meehl fabricates a vampire experience that is not only laugh-out-loud funny but nuanced as well.-Jennifer Prince, Buncombe County Public Library, NCα(c) Copyright 2011.

Ex-cop Bill Fogarty's Long Island retirement plans are rudely interrupted when a strange nightmare brings on a psychotic episode and lands him in a mental hospital. The dream's author is charismatic Justin Gabriel, a Manson-esque cult leader whom Fogarty busted for murder several years earlier. Intent on killing everyone who helped put him away, Gabriel has been using his psychic powers to visit his enemies in their dreams and provoke deadly panic attacks. The task of stopping him falls to Fogarty's friend, medical examiner Josef Tanaka, who uses his own ESP to connect the dots in the case. But Tanaka soon finds himself a target of the diabolical Gabriel: Tanaka is forced to kidnap Fogarty from the hospital and make him mentally revisit the bust that led to Gabriel's quest for vengeance. La Plante props up a questionable conceit with an engaging cast of characters, writes believable \"imaginary\" murder scenes and makes a home for both paranormal and normal suspense in this briskly plotted tale.

The chemistry between these two excellent\ncharacters is riveting and has the perfect makings for a romance.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Howells would use the canal for a morning swim during the warmer months and then, perhaps, go off to his office.For a young nineteenth-century American who had left school at age nine in order to work, the hardest part of his sinecure was that-no doubt for the first time in his experience-he had almost nothing to do. \"I dreaded the easily formed habit of receiving a salary for no service performed,\" he wrote. \"I reminded myself that, soon or late, I must go back to the old fashion of earning money, and that it had better be sooner than later.\" And so-\"though for some strange reasons it was the saddest and strangest thing in the world to do\"-Howells left Venice. While he was on the whole happy to do so, Howells said upon his departure, \"Never had the city seemed so dream-like and unreal as in this light of farewell.\" Venetian Life flows from the enchantment, the magical improbability of the years Howells spent in that magnificent city dining with the rich, mingling with the humble, and reporting on it all with a uniquely American wit and curiosity.", "related": ["B00AS5N3ZG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I took up gymnastics at the age of 4 and would cartwheel, handstand, or do the splits wherever I could. I was not athlete standard by any means but I always loved to move and balance.  I qualified as an aerobics instructor and then a personal trainer during my degree. I travelled around gyms in the North East of England, between my university lectures teaching dance classes and flexibility.  In 2005 we opened a personal training studio called Be-Fit and in the early stages I was working for 'kids get fit' in different schools.  I taught dance, yoga, drama, cheerleading, core stability and any other movement class possible to kids. The classes ranged from 3 years old to 18, in main stream and special needs schools. This is where my passion for children's stories began.  I quickly learned that the formula for adults fitness did not translate to children. Children have the most amazing imaginations and can conceive of such unbelievable things. I was in awe of how creative the kids were in the free time of the dance classes. My classes taught me to use my imagination to communicate my fitness knowledge.  I was asked to produce a national campaign for 'Flexi-Bar' to be used in schools and I applied the imagination principles. Since teaching my children's classes, I have trained in pre and post-natal exercise and 'freestyle fitness yoga'. I have also qualified as a health kinesiologist, recognised by the kinesiology federation.  I now have the pleasure of training mummies, children and adults out of be-Fit and I also work on bumps with acupressure points to balance and relax the baby.  In my spare time, I get to use my imagination and write my children's stories. I love to doodle and get lost in my writing.  I hope to bring the excitement the children taught me in my classes to my books.

In\n her past lives she's been an Import Broker, a Communications\nSpecialist,   a US Navy Civilian Contractor, a Bartender/Waitress, and\nan actor at the Michigan   Renaissance Festival. She also spent a summer\n touring with the Grateful Dead-though she will deny to her children\nthat it ever happened.From a young age she's been fascinated by\n myths and fairytales, and the romance that   often  was the center of\nthe story. As Ann grew older and her hormones kicked in, she\n  discovered trashy romance novels. Great at first, but she soon grew\ntired of the endless   stories with a big wonderful emotional buildup to\n really short and crappy sex. Never a big fan of purple prose, throbbing\n spears of fleshy pleasure and wet honey pots make her giggle, she\nsought out books that gave the sex scenes in the story just as much\ndetail and plot as everything else-without using cringe worthy\neuphemisms. This led her to the wonderful world of Erotic Romance, and\nshe's never looked back.Now Ann spends her days trying to tune\nout cartoons playing in the background to get into her 'sexy space' and\nhopes to one day be able to use the bathroom without interruption from a\n kid, cat, or dog.Ann loves to talk with her fans, as long as\nthey realize she's weird and that sarcasm doesn't translate well via\ntext.

As fans of the first two books know, Northland is the author’s fictional stand-in for Doggerland, the ancient land mass that was consumed by the North Sea, an offshoot of the Atlantic Ocean, about 8,200 years ago after an ice age. Doggerland connected the island of what is now Great Britain to mainland Europe, and in Baxter’s fictional world, the people of Northland built an enormous wall that kept back the rising waters. A civilization grew and prospered, but now, in the trilogy’s final installment, nearly 7,500 years later (roughly 1315, by our calendar), a new ice age threatens to destroy Northland. Baxter’s history is considerably different from our own, and as always, his characters, including the scholar Pyxeas, the bearer of probably the worst news any civilization wants to hear, are beautifully drawn. Fans of the first two books are strongly advised to read this one. Newcomers may want to start at the beginning to get the full, epic sweep of the story. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I stayed at a luxury resort on the island of Langkawi over ten years ago, with my employers and their children (this was back in my nannying days). It was the most beautiful place I had ever visited and almost ridiculously romantic! So when, a few years ago, I sat down to write my first novel, I knew exactly where it was going to be set!\nWhen I wrote the character of Gabriel, I had in mind a young Antonio Banderas (I'd seen him in the movie 'Evita' just prior to my trip to Langkawi and, while I was there, visions of him kept popping in to my head) and although initially this impossibly good-looking and wealthy businessman gives my heroine a hard time, I wanted to present him sympathetically - hence the novel's dual-perspective narrative. I felt that it was important to give Gabriel an equal voice.\nAs for Evangeline, although she is a very capable and independent working mother, the memory of the night she spent with Gabriel five years previously still haunts her - and the burden of the secrets she is forced to carry weighs heavily on her young shoulders.\nI loved writing this book - the process consumed my every waking hour for an entire summer - and along the way Gabriel and Evangeline became real people to me. Having read hundreds of Harlequin romances from the age of fifteen, I set out to write for that genre and when I typed the last word I felt that I'd achieved my goal. 'Evangeline's Secrets' is a book with heart, passion and some plot twists along the way. At its core, it's the story of two people who simply have to be together - I found myself rooting for them as I was writing the novel and I hope you find yourself doing the same as you read it!\nThank you for taking the time to read this - and I hope you enjoy 'Evangeline's Secrets'!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Things begin prosaically enough, when Dr. Tim Sherringham is called away in the middle of the night to deliver a baby. When he subsequently goes missing, his wife, Daisy, also a doctor, calls in the police. They find two headless and handless bodies along Sherringham's route to the hospital and hear reports of a man in a pierrot costume in the vicinity at the time when the murders must have occurred. Neither of the bodies turns out to be Tim's. Suspense builds as Daisy waits for her husband's body to be found and the detectives, the gentle Trevor Joseph and the misanthropic Peter Collins, puzzle out the significance of the clown and several other missing-persons cases. John creates a sinister atmosphere, especially in scenes taking place at a crumbling seaside pier, and she clearly knows her way around a hospital. But those assets don't entirely make up for some overly lurid descriptions, a conclusion that tardily details the past and the implausibilities of the far-fetched plot.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 17, "rating_average": 4.3529, "rating_total": 74.0}

She has firsthand experience dealing with multiple myeloma cancer through the treatment of her cat Dopey. She spent over a year getting educated about multiple myeloma through veterinary medical journals and direct veterinary contact. She also worked for several veterinarians for more than five and a half years, gaining knowledge in small animal and exotic animal care and handling. This experience taught her the proper care, feeding, treatment, and vaccination protocols for small animals. Darlene Simonian is currently a sales and marketing director for ManorCare of Hemet. She has more than twenty years of experience in the field of human and veterinary health care. She has recently completed her MBA with National University School of Business. She has earned her bachelor of science degree from Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, in adult education in 2003. Darlene has had articles printed in various newspapers over the years due to her sales and marketing experience. These employment articles were distributed through local newspapers, such as the Press Enterprise, the Californian, and The Bugle. Her extensive marketing experience will prove to be helpful with the promotion of this book. Though she has never written or published a book in the past, she believes this book can be successful as it taps into real life experiences and focuses on issues people can relate to, whether or not they have experienced cancer with their own pet. Darlene lives in Wildomar, California, and is still raising Dopey's brother Simon who will be twenty years old on May 10, 2012. She loves to run and has completed several half marathons, snowboard, geocaching, bike ride, and visit with her nine-month-old nephew Kaleb.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When you are encouraged, then take\nthat encouraging word and share with someone else who needs a pick-me-up and\nbreathe encouragement into their soul. Remember the time when you needed help\nand someone poured love into you? Take the time to share that same love,\ninsight, and encouragement into the heart and life of one who needs a boost.Author Carol Freed in her book: Encourage-Mints: Give a Mint, Refresh a Life\nhelps the reader find ways to encourage others. Maybe we think what we have to\noffer is small, but encouragement seems to multiply when we offer to give it\naway. The book encourages the reader to believe that what they have to offer is\ngreat and supportive for someone in need. Sometimes we must even give from our\nneed, not when everything is perfect and going well. Author Freed gives\nencouragement to give away refreshing hope and praise to others around you, and\nin doing so things within your life will be lifted as well.While this is a very short book, it is one that gives great ideas on how to be\na difference maker. It would be an excellent tool to be used for hospitals,\nchurches, counseling, etc. Everyone needs encouragement, so why not start with\nsomeone today and determine to make a difference right where you are planted.\nEncourage-Mints brings together the positive for a lasting difference. posted September 17, 2013Reviewed by Darin Godby for Readers' Favoritereadersfavorite.com/book-review/12901", "related": ["B00CIADR82"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Each day thousands of subscribers in 160 countries get it by email, Facebook, and Twitter. Subscriptions are free. The blog posts vary from day to day, and include jokes, satire, books, music, films, videos, food, unbelievable but true news items, and anything that brings a grin, chuckle, laugh, guffaw, or just a warm feeling to readers. Most are new, and some are classics. A long-term devotee of Jewish humor, Al has collected it even before there was an internet. For the last 25 years he has been editor and publisher of The Kustanowitz Kronikle, originally a family newsletter that went public when the Purim editions became too popular to keep private. Now they're all available on the internet. In 2012, Al wrote a series of seven interactive eBooks with the series title Jewish Humor on Your Desktop. The seven volumes are subtitled: Volume 1: Old Jokes and New Comedians Volume 2: Israel is a Funny Country Volume 3: Humor in Jewish Life - You Can't Make This Stuff Up Volume 4: Jewish Traces in Unexpected Places Volume 5: Yiddish is a Funny Language Volume 6: Jewish Holiday Hilarity Volume 7: Yiddishe Nachas All seven volumes and the complete collection in a single volume are available at Amazon.com. In 2013, Al will be delivering lectures on Jewish humor at synagogues, Jewish Community Centers, and other locations. If you are interested in booking a presentation on the general topic of Jewish Humor on Your Desktop or on any of the topics covered in the volumes of the series, you can reach him by e-mail at akustan@gmail.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Since then a further seven STAC Mysteries have been published by Crooked Cat, more titles are planned for 2013 and 2014.  He also produces darker, edgier thrillers, such as The Handshaker and Voices; titles which are aimed exclusively at an adult audience and which question our perceptions of reality.  In a more light-hearted mood again, he uses the sledgehammer humour of his alter-ego Flatcap, to reflect on the absurdities of the world at large. Two Flatcap volumes are currently available, exclusive to Amazon, and more are planned.  As at June 2013, he is working on the ninth STAC Mystery, Costa del Murder, and the first of a new series with amateur sleuth, Maddy Chester.", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": 819372, "title": "Murder at the Murder Mystery Weekend (#5 - Sanford Third Age Club Mystery) (STAC - Sanford Third Age Club Mystery)", "author": "David W Robinson", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I wrote these stories during my downtime to help pass the time.  They are all based around my mustache that I grew while overseas.  If there is one thing to be said about me it is that I grow an exceptional mustache, and it quickly grew popular with my company overseas.  These stories made for a good laugh and helped boost our morale.  While many of the jokes are better understood if you know the actual people being portrayed, I still think the stories are funny and wanted to share them with everyone.  They have become collectively known as the Flood Stache Sagas, and while they can be enjoyed individually they are best read in the order of How the Stache Saved Christmas, Love, Loss, and the Stache, and The Night of the Living Stache.

Shad feels obligated to track down Toby, a 16-year-old runaway, before Shad dies, and the trail takes him to the gold camps of northern New Mexico. Just five years after the Civil War, the West is populated not only by good folks looking to make a fresh start but also by desperate men whose time in the war spawned bitterness and a propensity for violence. As Shad and his pal Abe Featherstone struggle to find the boy, they learn of a scheme to rob a gold shipment. Before they can act, the shipment is stolen, and lives are taken. Shad and his crew follow the thieves but are stonewalled when it appears the booty disappeared into thin air. In some ways, this is the standard road-trip western, with the good guys out-thinkin' and out-shootin' the baddies, but veteran western author Stewart supplies enough originality and storytelling skill to keep it moving at a crisp pace. An enjoyable western adventure.Wes LukowskyCopyright © American Library Association.

Miniature masterpieces, these verses are testimony to the richness and variety of ancient life and to the wry dignity with which the ancients commemorated their loved ones. They gleam anew in their unaffected and forceful translations by Michael Wolfe.(Raymond P. Scheindlin, author ofThe Book of Job: A Verse Translation)Michael Wolfe has done a beautiful job of tracing, in clear and straightforward translations, the development of old Greek grave-inscriptions into a major literary mode. His renderings of the epitaphs are simply stunning.(Richard Wilbur, Pultizer Prize-winning poet, Bollingen Prize-winning translator)A fascinating trove that reveals the occupations, obsessions, passions, fears, drudgeries, shortcomings, and victories of ordinary Greeks—those who rarely appear in the spotlight that Athenian playwrights, philosophers, and historians shine on the legendary, the famous, and the notorious. The Greek poets hired to memorialize the deceased did so with artful tact and compassion, and often with astringent irony. Michael Wolfe's translations capture them all with equal art, populating our personal agora with voices once again pungent, and fully present.(Robert Bagg, poet and translator)Michael Wolfe's magnificent new book is the latest word on the Greek phenomenon of epitaphs. These chiseled gems range from the mournful to the humorous. Together they are a rhapsody on the theme of the memento mori, the reminder of death as a goad to the well-lived life.(Phil Cousineau, author ofWho Stole the Arms of the Venus de Milo?)For something to read in normal circumstances? Today it's Michael Wolfe's wondrous set of translations of ancient Greek epitaphs,Cut These Words into My Stone. A book Keats would deeply appreciate. A book to keep handy by bed or bath.(Bill BerksonHarriet)Cut These Words into my Stoneis not a long book, but its short pages have a great balance between education and emotionally touching poetry. The translator’s note, introduction, and chapter introductions are all deeply researched, but still accessible to a lay reader.(Elizabeth FranklinPortland Book Review)This pleasing volume should introduce a new generation of general readers to the important poetic tradition of the ancient Greek grave epigram... No previous English study of quite this scope exist.(Choice)A wonderful short volume on Greek epitaphs which will appeal both to the general reader and the specialist... I highly recommend this book as a solid introduction to the reading and translating of Greek epigrams, and as a useful reference for illustrating how poetic translations of ancient Greek can be beautifully rendered for the modern audience while still remaining loyal to the ancient Greek use of language(Philip J.

Thankfully, she is married to the most supportive, loving husband. He even believes her when she promises to be both a best seller and the next week's lottery winner. With two young children, two hyper puppies and a household chock full of laundry to fold- a supportive husband comes in handy when she forgets to defrost something for dinner because she is wrapped up in her work. He is the true inspiration to her romantic soul. Rebecca takes great pride in coming from a long line of strong, determined women. She credits (blames) them for encouraging her to pick up her first pen and writing down what was on her mind. Unfortunately her first artistic endeavor was \"I will not hit my brother, even if he did call me Bucky Beaver\" one hundred times. She sincerely hopes her writing has improved since those days.

We won't give too much away, but Miles, along with his loyal pals, E.R., (the muscle) and Herb (The street savvy savant) tackle the FBI's Most Wanted for reward money. This is well done and written from the perspective of the protagonist in which entries from his personal notebook are latched together after the opening chapters and after their adventures grabbing up each criminal. Quirkiness is the feather in their cap and they soon become very good at what they do.American Freakis a refreshingly odd debut novel.

I've always loved reading paranormal, and without quite realizing it, I've\nwatched pretty much every vampire movie and TV series made in the last twenty\nyears. When I finally finished writing Dark Child, the book was a crazy mish mash of genres - closer to\nurban fantasy than anything else, but not quite fitting the mold. It had\nromance, and touches of epic fantasy, and suspense. It wasn't YA, but it wasn't\npurely adult either. It was a combination of all the elements I loved, in a somewhat unholy alliance. It was\nthe product of letting inspiration run free, and I ended up with something\nthat I'd poured my heart into. Something that I loved.

The magic began at the young age of eight years old, when Kyle stumbled upon a bookstore in Southeastern Massachusetts and a book called Good Magick. For the next few years Kyle practiced Witchcraft \"in the broom closet\" until he was fourteen, when he gave his aunts a tarot reading for the first time, surprising himself, and especially his aunts. This ignited a passion for the Old Religion in the young man, and thus his training began. He has now practiced Witchcraft for over two decades, being trained in - and now teaching others - the Old Ways of Witchcraft in five Traditions of Wicca and Witchcraft. At the age of eighteen he received his Certification in Crystal Healing Therapy. He is acknowledged as a Certified Clairvoyant by the School of Theology, and has privately worked for numerous local police departments along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. Though he began offering psychic readings professionally in Boston as a Boston Premier Psychic, he quickly became nation-wide.  He is the author of \"Firewolf's Book of Spells Book One,\"  \"Firewolf's Black Mirror Magick,\" and\"Simple Spells for a Happy Home.\" Kyle is also a popular and out-spoken lecturer and teacher on the Ancient Craft of the Southeastern Mediterranean Religions, The Science of the Craft, Herbalism, Tarot, Divination, Love Magick From Around the World, Benedicarian Witchcraft, and has been featured on talk-shows, radio interviews, magazines and popular publications such as The Union Tribune, City Beat Magazine, Channel 8 News with Larry Himmel, The Espresso, and much more. Since 2003, Kyle has founded three Witches' Covens in the United States, spanning throughout the country from the East Coast to the West.﻿", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But if you want to go into details, let's take it one at a time. Dragos Roua was born in Romania, in a town called Ramnicu Valcea, in the center of the country. But after he finished high-school, he moved to Bucharest where he stayed to pursue his studies. He finished the University of Bucharest with a degree in French Literature. After that, he worked as a radio host for 7 years. At some point, around his thirties, he decided it's time to start his own company. The founding was easy, even if there was no money around: he used the 3F technique: family, friends and fools. He managed his projects from scratch and in 10 years he become leader on several niches (cars and lifestyle). After going with his company through all the 7 stages of a business, he decided it's time to sell. Which he did, for a profit. After he sold his company, Dragos' new project was his personal development blog at http://www.dragosroua.com. In a very short time the blog become quite popular, being visited by tens of thousands every month. Many of his books are inspired by articles initially published there.", "related": [], "rank": 3843494, "title": "Being A Digital Nomad eBook", "author": "Dragos Roua", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His second was entitled Lethal Assumed; Lost Tome Found.  Three more books in the Entity Saga, written dually, fall under his and coauthor Kate Taylor’s rubric. Three thousand miles apart is no deterrent to the creative bond that he and Kate share. He currently resides in Mountlake Terrace, Washington, a suburb of Seattle and again hopes that those who read soon to be published, Eyes of a Pagan Queen, also co-written with Kate Taylor, will relish the brand new characters and plot in what could very well develop into a brand new saga. Kate Taylor collaborated with Jeffrey Underwood on five prior novels, entitled: Treason’s Truth; Mac Alpin’s Scotland, Eagle’s Eclipse; America Before Columbus and Tasman’s Travail; The Journey Down Under and most recently, Eyes of a Pagan Queen and White Scream.  Kate has award winning history working in Activities in long term care and is a Licensed Nursing Assistant, as well.  Highland Gals becomes one of an expanding library of serious efforts at writing as her first work is entitled The Pink Eraser. She has contributed to books in the Activities profession. Kate resides in the small town of Jaffrey, New Hampshire. She has much in the way of writing to share.  She hopes that all who read this tale of fiction will want for more. Kate and Jeff have also combined playfully in writing Rule of Thumb & Fingers, a texter’s bible with lots of laughs and Sock Monkey Life which is full of sheer creativity. Jeff and Kate met online and found that their collaborative interests meshed splendidly and this novel is an example of that blending of gusto for writing that they certainly both have.", "related": [], "rank": 3083587, "title": "Highland Gals", "author": "Kate   Taylor", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A real delight -- William Boyd Spectator Hook's view of the art world is that of the professional auctioneer. In an A-Z format, it is an entire art education contained in under 350 pages. Wry, dry and completely beguiling -- William Boyd Guardian, Books of the Year 2013 An auctioneer's alphabet of quirky reflections and off-beat lists such as 'middle-brow artists' and 'fictional artists': an ideal volume for the art-lover's bedside -- Martin Gayford Spectator, Books of the Year How to nail the mad, bad, crazy contemporary art world in print? Sotheby's senior director Hook draws on 35 years' experience in this informal memoir. He unravels, with humour, piquancy and erudition, what drives the economics of taste Financial Times, Books of the Year It's very hard to write an amusing book about art that has some serious things to say. But Philip Hook has done it. It's more a kind of Lonely Planet guide, written from the perspective of an auctioneer. In places it's a hoot, but it's also very wise here and there, and refreshingly irreverent. Sir William Russell Flint, for example, \"painted like Augustus John commissioned by Playboy magazine\" Sunday Times, Books of the Year His delightful Breakfast at Sotheby's is a house sale of a book, a chance for him to clear out 35 years of memories as an art dealer and auctioneer, first at Christie's and then Sotheby's, a rival auction house. Besides the colourful stories, Mr Hook offers various theories about the art world, and keen insight on that vexing question of what gives art value. Amid the well-known answers (provenance, colour, \"wall power\") are some less obvious observations, both relevant and delightful The Economist I absolutely adored Breakfast At Sotheby's: An A-Z Of The Art World by Philip Hook. Very funny and often touching, it teems with vivid observation and anecdotes about artists, paintings, nude models, dealers and critics. Hook also provides wonderful insights into The Antiques Roadshow, on which he appeared for 25 years, and the rivalry of Christie's and Sotheby's. My favourite tale is about the camp telephonist at Sotheby's who, when asked by an important male caller 'May I have John Brown?' replied: 'I don't see why not, everyone else has.

At the age of 15 he went off to join the British Royal Air Force ... and never looked back. These were exciting times to be part of a Hi-Tech military unit with the cold war in full swing and the possibility of a nuclear strike against the west imminent. After leaving the Air Force and with a restless outlook, he took on several jobs that took him travelling across Eastern and Western Europe and then into Africa. Nurturing an unfortunate ability of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, Quentin finally found himself caught up in the horrific Biafra conflict in Nigeria and with a certain amount of scarred memory tissue to prove the point, he decided to travel East in search of less wearing adventures. In the early 70's, Quentin headed for Dubai: for the smell of the spice souk, the sail of the Dhow outlined on a distant horizon and the promise of a fortune at the end of a Middle Eastern rainbow. For the next 25 years, he was fortunate enough to witness and become part of the extrodinary growth of a place that literally rose out of a desert wasteland like a golden Pheonix ... accompanied by the continuing horror of yet even more war. After returning to the UK in the late 90's, still restless, Quentin decided to spend some 'writing time' in Spain, a decision that has served him well with the completion and publishing of eight books to the middle of 2013 and another full length novel on the drawing board.   Books by Quentin Cope: Fiction: Nostradamus: The Last Christmas The Geneveh Project.

Writer's Ink co-founder Anne \"Bunty\" Loucks wrote a novel titled \"In a Rosedale Garden\" over 20 years ago. Although it was released as a newspaper serial, it was never published as a book. The challenge accepted by the authors was to use \"In a Rosedale Garden\" as the plot, and each author would re-write their own chapter in their own style. The result is a novel titled \"Through a Glass, Darkly\". Both novels have been combined together and published in one book. The book is titled \"In a Rosedale Garden\", but it also contains the author collaborative titled \"Through a Glass, Darkly\". Read \"In a Rosedale Garden\" and experience a mystery that transports you to the post-war era of the 40's and 50's when a family tragedy buries secrets for future generations to find. Then read \"Through a Glass, Darkly\", where the same story takes on twists and turns from the six authors. This collaboration illustrates the difference between material written in a gentler time and that of the 21st century.

The heat can be difficult during the summer, but I try my best to spend most of my time during the hottest months indoors writing. I would love to travel someday and I hope that my writing will take me many places and hopefully not just in my head. My favorite vacation spot right now is San Diego California, but my dream places to visit are all overseas. Although, since I have only seen a fraction of the United States, I would love to travel the nation someday as well. First on my bucket list however is to explore the historical landmarks in Greece and Italy, and the castles all over Europe. Up until recently, I have spent most of my adult life in college and working in sales and customer service type positions, while also raising my two incredible kids and serving three years in the Army National Guard. Recently I decided to pursue my dream of becoming a published author and I have begun to work on my writing full time. I am currently working on my first book in an eight book series which I have titled Reborn. Writing for me has always seemed like an unattainable dream, but now I realize that some dreams are only unattainable if we do not attempt to reach them. I completed my Master of Science in Psychology in the spring of 2013 and I have also taken some graduate courses in Ancient and Classical history. I believe that the knowledge I have gathered from my life experiences as well as my education has assisted me in creating some interesting and complex characters.

An abundant, almost screenplay-like use of\nstreet language lends great authenticity. It's the language of young adult\nreaders. And in-between the dialogue, the first-person account of\nscholar-turned-drug dealer Milton Lusser is coarse and edgy, as a\ntwenty-something in his situation would tell it. Milton graduates from high\nschool in Knoxville, Tennessee with great promise, with a full scholarship to a\ncollege in Alaska. But he soon veers off course. Lured by easy money, he begins\ndealing weed. Later, back in Tennessee, the business flourishes and he sinks\ninto a heady lifestyle of nightclubs, women and indulgence. Then everything\nfalls apart. Ultimately, he finds a new, healthier road. Life, at this age and in Milton's situation,\nis about the here and now, not the why or how or what comes next. Milton is\nreal. Luster nails that. Young adult readers will appreciate the authenticity.RECOMMENDED", "related": ["B00HVJNS7A"], "rank": 4199550, "title": "Money, Power, and Betrayal (The Paths that Lie Ahead Series Book 1)", "author": "Melvin Luster", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She also discovered apple-scrumping, and how to jump out of a hayloft without breaking any bones, but no-one’s ever offered to pay her for doing those. Since publishing in  paperback for the first time in 2002, Terri has appeared in both print and online fiction collections, and is proud to have contributed to the Shirley Jackson award-nominated hardback collection: Bound for Evil, by Dead Letter Press with her short story The Truth Inside the Lie. Her first novel, Maid of Oaklands Manor, was published by Piatkus Entice (little, brown Book Group) in July 2013.

Every author is incredibly talented and skilled and we are honored to have their stories and poems in our book. The new things we learn about these authors through interviews with them is great as well.It is our hope that every reader will find a story or poem that touches their heart and catches their interest.

He sees trends and solutions where others see chaos and uncertainty.The Frugal Innovatoris a challenge to us as well as a guide to the future.\"-David Miliband, President and Chief Executive Office, International Rescue Committee and former UK Foreign Secretary\"With a deep understanding of emerging forces,The Frugal Innovatorprovides excellent insights for those who want to win long-term, with a purpose driven business in an increasingly resource scarce environment.\"-Paul Ploman, CEO, Unilever\"Frugal Innovation is a vital contribution to our understanding of the decades ahead. The analysis is compelling; the solutions to the challenges of the 21st century, which sometimes seem overwhelming, are less likely to be found in western laboratories and more likely to be found in the rough-and-tumble suburbs of Lagos, Karachi or São Paulo. Charles Leadbeater has found a wonderful cast of characters innovating in places such as this and turned them into a story of hope for us all.\"-Sir Michael Barber, Chief Education Adviser, Pearson\"If you feel that the word 'innovation' is now so overused it has become boring, this book is a great antidote.\"-Bruno Giussani, European Director, TED\"Charles Leadbeater is an inspiring and engaging story teller. His enthusiasm for innovations of all hues reflects in his narration that weaves easy to see patterns. He has seen the world of frugal innovation closely, and world over. He does not defend frugal innovation, he promotes it. Following his journeys over more than a decade can leave the reader breathless, wide-eyed and undoubtedly inspired.\"-Madhav Chavan, Founder and Chief Executive, Pratham\"Much about our modern economy is profligate and wasteful, and that includes how we do innovation, whether in the form of vast R and D labs or the almost instant obsolescence of digital consumer products. Charles Leadbeater once again brings together eloquence and a multitude of fascinating global examples to show us a better way, far more suited to an era of austerity and ecological constraint.\"-Geoff Mulgan, Chief Executive, Nesta; Author of The Locust and the Bees\"This book is a celebration of ingenuity and creative magic; bringing to our attention great ideas that have bubbled to the surface from the most unlikely places. It celebrates a climate change of ideas and possibilities; promoting novel solutions to people's most pressing problems. The book is a joy; it is also an admonition. We are left grateful, knowing what is possible; and cautious, knowing how close to the edge we are all unknowingly living.\"-Mitch Besser, Founder, Mothers-2-Mothers", "related": [], "rank": 1714807, "title": "The Frugal Innovator", "author": "C.

Instead, I found my imagination ignited by the books I read, the drawings I made, and the natural world surrounding me. My love of books never waned. I majored in English in college and later found myself working in the travel industry and traveling the world, visiting places I had only read about in novels and history books. Those life experiences continued to fuel my imagination and I finally began to spin those stories in my head into books. I write books that are outside of reality as we know it. My worlds are as unique as the characters that inhabit them; the Underworld of Vampires, Weres, and Witches, a futuristic world with mind-bending Technology, and the secret world of Undercover Agents. Sometimes it is just the fantasy of falling in love, which is always full of magic. When I don't have my nose in a book or ebook, I enjoy all types of music, movies with HEAs, going to the beach, traveling, yoga, and hanging out with my rescued mutt. I hope you enjoy reading my books as much as I enjoyed writing them. Sign up for my Updates on my website, and I will drop you a note when my next book comes out. Visit me at http://susannahgautier.com/ And please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.

After several years spent overseas and working his way to executive positions in biotech, he returned to his true passion of storytelling.
