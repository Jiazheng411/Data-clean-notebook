Minow, an early organizer of the televised debates and the current vice chairman of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, is the debates' greatest champion and most clear-eyed critic. Minow and LaMay readily admit to the debates' imperfections: the frequent omissions of third-party candidates and inquiries from the public. The authors suggest that in order for the debates to be more useful for voters, candidates must be more spontaneous, present fewer canned speeches and be open to answering questions from the audience (as in the YouTube debates) and from each other. Furthermore, the authors urge radio and television broadcasters to provide affordable public-service time to presidential candidates and that information be made available on the Internet to supplement comments during the debates. Although the book suffers from its lack of chronology and needless reiteration, Minow's perspectives are peerless, and the timeliness and importance of the topic make for worthwhile reading.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Olivia suspects that she is not, but luckily there is plenty going on outside of school to distract her—a trip into New York City's ancient and haunted subway system; the impetuous, old Princepessa Christina Lilli, whose impending marriage to ex-cave-dweller Arthur Vondychomps is throwing everyone into turmoil; eccentric Ansel Plover, who runs the Exit Academy for newly departed souls in which Olivia and her father live; and so on. The characters are zany and over-the-top, but Olivia has enough realistic concerns—her inadequate, mostly absent mom and a confusing relationship with a boy named Ruben—to give a solid base to all the wacky events. With so much happening, there are a few loose ends and intriguing but abandoned characters, but Olivia's fans will dive right into the story and won't emerge until the last page.—Eva Mitnick, Los Angeles Public LibraryCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I would highly recommend it to faculty and graduate students in the fields of educational policy, sociology of education, comparative and international education, higher education, and curriculum studies. The book has inspired me to see the complexity and transformative possibilities in analyzing and responding to education policy dilemmas in a globalized context.\"—Comparative Education Review'This book is one that resonates with the recent work of other scholars who have also called for new approaches to understanding and promoting educational change. Rizvi and Lingard’s work is both instructive and provocative bringing key issues to light, challenging assumptions, and pointing out that as the social, political, and economic contexts of education shift, so to must theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of educational policies.'-Minori Nagahara, Journal of Educational Change'Theoretically, the book is grounded in some of the rich theories of culture and society developed over the past few decades amid the ‘‘linguistic turn’’ that has challenged simple ‘‘rationalist’’ ideas of influence and power. Key theorists include Michel Foucault and Nikolas Rose with their concept of ‘‘governmentality,’’ Pierre Bourdieu and his vision of social ‘‘fields,’’ Arjun Appadurai with his nuanced interpretation of neo-colonialism, and David Held with his broad-ranging discussions of globalization. Given Rizvi and Lingard’s interest in nuanced intersections between culture, language, and material contexts, their chosen theoretical frameworks seem quite relevant.' -Aaron Schutz, Journal of Educational Change", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Native Australian David Tredinnick's narration is spot-on. His vocal variety and pacing enhance the story, and his characterization of the main character dramatizes his humanity and vulnerability. Tredinnick's African tribal accents are somewhat uneven, but that's easy enough to overlook. Overall, the novel provides an exciting and multilayered glimpse of Africa.

Capacious, humanistic, and provocative.\"-Voices in Italian Americana\"Jennifer Guglielmo offers a commanding corrective to earlier images of immigrant women as weak pawns in a larger scheme of American immigrant history with this exacting study.\"-Fra Noi\"Guglielmo provides a fresh look at the connections among labor militancy, migration, gender, and race.Living in the Revolutioneffectively challenges the traditional narrative of early twentieth-century activism among Italian American women and therefore should be of great interest to labor historians.\"-Labor\"Meticulously researched and with a remarkable command of the bilingual archives.\"---Women's Review of Books\"A critically important addition to the field. The author is expansively original in her understanding of the subject and the accomplished integrative analysis of primary and secondary research is of the first order….This work is sure to become one of the fundamental historiographical classics of our era.

My Asian parents would approve since it's educational as well. I'm exposed to actual words on the SAT tests, while being completely and utterly lost (happily) in this fantasy world. The teens at first appeared to fit into gamer stereotypes, but as they move forward into the story, the masks all come off. You will root for these teens. You will feel what each of them feel. As is shown by this experimental fiction book, Ms. Gow is an author to watch. She is not afraid to try a new perspective or point-of-view. Characteristic of the young adult books I've read of hers, this one is fast-paced, highly-imaginative, and contains amazing plot twists and turns throughout. Gem is a heroine teen girls would like. She's smart and resourceful. She reminds me of Katniss in Hunger Games, although the Wordwick Games is more of a fantasy game than the Hunger Games --Naya's Girl's Night OutAs usual Kailin Gow rocks out the YA genre with her work. I absolutely adore her books and think she's one to watch. This book, of course, was great! I love the world building that she did...For me, it's always just right. The characters in this one were great and I loved the storyline. Here's a sneaky little thing that Kailin did with the book...she made it educational. *shhh Don't tell anyone!* LOL! In it you learn a lot of new words along with definitions but it's combined so well into the story that you don't really think about the fact that you're learning. It was awesome! Besides all that though, it really was just an excellent story...I always manage to get lost in her writing and I'm through the books before I even realize it. If you haven't checked her out yet then I think you should! --Kris, Cajun Book LadyAddicting. The trailer made me curious. I'm usually not a fantasy reader, but I enjoyed Ms. Gow's other young adult books enough to give her young adult fantasy book about a game a try. I was glad I did. Like a role playing game you end up with favorites, but I found myself cheering for all the teens. I wanted Gem or Sparks to win! The love story is swoon-worthy, too. Gem is a lucky girl, but if I had to choose one, it would be Rio. How she can even consider Goolrick is beyond me. He is yicky. Again, I love Ms. Gow's characteristic twists and unpredictable endings. --Melissa Nunez, GoodreadsAs usual Kailin Gow rocks out the YA genre with her work.

She is careful, attentive, dynamic, disorienting, and exhilarating as she reads political and cultural events, literary and theoretical texts, and the nuances of language use for a complex cultural subject in process. A fabulous read.”-Judith Butler,Maxine Elliot Professor at the University of California at Berkeley“Mapping slippery subjects outside of fixed identities, this book is always against closure: Queer Latinidad at its best.”-José Quiroga,author ofTropics of Desire: Interventions from Queer Latino America“Rodríguez furthers her work . . . with an engaging writing style that is poetic, personal, philosophical and theoretical. . . . This book is highly recommended.”-Reforma Newsletter,“A fascinating critical approach to the development of the so-called latinidad, i.e., the identity of Latinos in the US. Unlike that in other ethno-queer studies, Rodríguez's data and primary texts of analysis are not literary works. Instead, this refreshing, funny, and daring book takes the reader through unexplored queer Latino communities....

He left school at seventeen with two 'A' levels and went straight into the theatre. Two years in regional theatre as an actor and stage manager led in 1959 to the writing of his first play, The Square Cat, for Scarborough's Theatre in the Round at the instigation of his then employer and subsequent mentor, Stephen Joseph. Some 75 plays later, his work has been translated into over 35 languages, is performed on stage and television throughout the world and has won countless awards. There have been English and French screen adaptations, the most notable being Alain Resnais' fine film of Private Fears in Public Places.  Major successes include Relatively Speaking, How the Other Half Loves, Absurd Person Singular, Bedroom Farce, A Chorus of Disapproval, The Norman Conquests, A Small Family Business, Henceforward ..., Comic Potential, Things We Do For Love, and Life of Riley. Surprises was first presented at the Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough, and subsequently at the the Minerva Theatre, Chichester in 2012.  In 2009, he retired as Artistic Director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre, where almost all his plays have been and continue to be first staged, after 37 years in the post. Knighted in 1997 for services to the theatre, he received the 2010 Critics' Circle Award for Services to the Arts and became the first British playwright to receive both Olivier and Tony Special Lifetime Achievement Awards.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Harmony Simmons, 18 and newly orphaned, arrives in Victorian London fresh from an American cattle ranch. Her sour older sister, Agatha, is none too pleased to have a beautiful, spirited redhead to chaperone. A laughing-eyed highwayman who holds them up is curiously appreciative of Harmony's defiance. He promptly follows them and kidnaps her, and the interlude that follows has some of the novel's most fully imagined and tender writing. When the highwayman releases Harmony and then shows up in a coach and four, calling himself Lord Farmington, Agatha's simmering envy becomes vengefulness, and the plot froths with preposterous twists. The meager historical detail and unraveling story don't stand up to scrutiny, but Rosburg's talent for character-building keeps the silliness fun.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He was educated and was later a pupil-teacher at Grosvenor United School, Tunbridge Wells. In December 1884 he became junior clerk with a local brickworks where, in a locomotive accident, he lost his right foot, necessitating the life-long use of a stick. Late in 1887 he went to work as a clerk in London, becoming increasingly involved in church, debating and writing activities. Although his family was Anglican, he was baptized at Stockwell Old Baptist Church in 1890; he preached from pavement and pulpit and published \"Won to Glory\" in 1891. He was admitted to Spurgeon's College, London, in August 1892, serving as a student-minister at Theydon Bois, Essex, where he met Estella Maud Mary Cottee. In 1894 Boreham was called to the Scottish community at Mosgiel near Dunedin in New Zealand, and was inducted on March 17, 1895. Stella, then 18, followed to marry him at Kaiapoi on April 13, 1896. Boreham became president of the Baptist Union of New Zealand in 1902, and published \"The Whisper of God and Other Sermons.\" He wrote editorials for the Otago Daily Times, contributed to theological journals and, as a keen temperance advocate, participated in liquor polls in 1905 and 1907. In June 1906 Boreham was called to the Baptist Tabernacle, Hobart. He edited the Southern Baptist and later the weekly Australian Baptist and in 1910 became president of the Tasmanian Baptist Union. His \"George Augustus Selwyn\" was published in 1911. He wrote a biographical series for the Hobart Mercury, which in 40 years covered 2000 persons; in 1912-59 he contributed 2500 editorials to the Mercury and the Melbourne Age.

The year is 1931 and the Arnolds have moved to Deere County in West Texas from East Texas; Josh is to be principal of the local school and Lucy will teach first grade. The Arnolds are not given a universal welcome; there is an element in town hostile to all educators and Josh's predecessor met with an unfortunate accident which resulted in his precipitous departure. But secure in their commitment to each other, to their son and to education, Josh and Lucy are determined to make a success of their new lives. Then a summer of grueling work clearing fields and preparing a new home gives way to unforeseen trials during the school year and a tragedy that threatens both their solid marriage and Lucy's sanity. Wood's narration is seamless, and she is especially masterful in creating believable characters, whether they're her protagonists or secondary figures like the befuddled athletic coach torn between two women or the illiterate curmudgeon who becomes Lucy's advocate. This is a touching, often humorous novel and a vivid portrait of the scorching solitude of West Texas.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He began his career as an actor, over twenty years ago, studying in Los Angeles. Stephen's acting career has been grounded in television and theater, landing co- starring roles on various sitcoms, and appearing Off-Broadway in the hit The Crumple Zone both in New York and Los Angeles. It was soon after that, that he decided to take hold of his career and began writing. Stephen wanted to write material that meant something to him, in a very personal way. In hopes that the stories would resonate with others, and encourage them to think about their own lives. He likes to develop characters that people relate to, or at least, can emotionally invest them selves in. Stephen's first attempt at this was a full-length screenplay titled, Dear John. Two things inspired him to write Dear John. First, he wanted to tell a story of love, to show people that the experience of finding love is no different, no matter whom you are. The second was freedom-the freedom to make our own decisions. Then Stephen decided to tell the story of Journey. Journey is a story of the lengths one will go to in search for freedom: the simultaneous desire to find our own place in the world, and the guilt we feel over separating ourselves from our family. I want to say to anyone who is reading this book is, \"never give up on your dreams\". This book is living proof that dreams do come true, not only for me the Author, but also for Tomas Castellano, the main character in this story. And if it weren't for his courage . . . there would be no JOURNEY.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rescher's work opens up new perspectives in a woefully understudied but major field in epistemology. It will be required reading for everyone concerned with understanding the anatomy of knowledge.”—George Gale, University of Missouri-Kansas City“The cumulative effect of Rescher's examination is the conclusion that our understanding of ignorance may be more important in a practical sense than our efforts to understand or define knowledge. The many reasons that lead Rescher and us to that conclusion are ultimately pragmatic, reaffirming once again that he is our most important living pragmatist. This is a must-read for anyone interested in escaping from the standard contemporary approaches to epistemology.”—Joseph C. Pitt, Virginia Tech“Rescher has written an exciting and provocative book that will be of interest to epistemologists and philosophers of science alike.

afternoon?) you were\nconceived. And the same goes for JFK,\nBenny Goodman and me. So maybe your\ngreat-great-grandparents were alive during the Civil War era, and maybe they\nstill got together even though the South won.Then what?  If a two degree drop in the ambient temperature or a slight shift in the\nviscosity of the bed sheets could prevent the conception of the DNA-specific humans\nwho became your great-grandparents, certainly a change as significant as the\ndissolution of the USA would be enough to do so. And it is even more unlikely that your\ngrandparents or parents would have been conceived, let alone you. The fragileweb\nof circumstances that led toyourconception never would have\nhappened. So, while playing the \"what\nwould have become of JFK\" game is great fun, the fact is if the South had won\nthe Civil War these past three generations of humans (with perhaps a very few\nexceptions)wouldnot exist. Threegenerationsof strangers would exist in our place because allourquantumwebs would have been made impossible by such a\nmassive alteration in history.  The good news is, withCrossing theLine you can have your cake\nand eat it too. While I have some\nnudge-nudge, wink-wink fun (mostly between chapters) exploring what became of\nsome folks who are famous inourhistory,\nall of the main characters in the story are entirely fictional, products oftheirhistory, a history that was decisively\naltered by the South's victory. I've tried to create an exciting\nand intriguing story, well told, with protagonists who are admirable without\nbeing super heroes and antagonists who are criminally malicious without being cartoon\ndemons. There's plenty of espionage\nskullduggery and action, a little romance, a little fun, and lots of alternate\nhistory brain candy. I hope it's your\ncup of tea and you enjoy reading it as much I as enjoyed writing it.", "related": ["B006OEVRGC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.8333, "rating_total": 23.0}

Ginny's estranged husband, Wiley, a die hard reenactor who believes in 100 percent authenticity and willing to look war torn gaunt, will play a Confederate soldier at the event.\"\"At the gala, Wiley is accidentally shot and soon after dies of cardiac arrest, which is surprising since he had no heart trouble. While Ginny grieves her loss, Miranda makes inquiries among the Civil War participants after learning that the person who shot Wiley is also dead following a motorcycle-truck incident. As Miranda digs deep into what is going on at the reenactment, she is in jeopardy of being the next victim of the Civil War though it is a hundred and forty years since Appomattox.\"\"Though the homicide occurs towards the middle of the book, readers will enjoy how MURDER AT GETTYSBURG provides insight as to what happens behind the scenes at a reenactment. The first half of plot also sets the tone on relationships between the key players. Once fans adjust to Miranda investigating a potential murder (a difficult issue of acceptance with most of the sub-genre tales), the entertaining amateur sleuth story line grips the audience until the heroine risks her life confronting the killer.\"--Thebestreviews.com, June 2005 (Doody Enterprises20050601)", "related": ["B0054HXO3O"], "rank": 1813226, "title": "Murder at Gettysburg (Miranda Lewis mysteries Book 2)", "author": "Leslie Wheeler", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As I sit and write I think about what the charcter would want to say and how he/she would react to the situation. Then I go in bringing my story to life. It's what I do and can't stop. I was rasied by Dreamer Poindexter, my younger sisters maternal grandmother. I went to C.S. 61 Elementary School where I meet a taecher who would change my life. Mrs. Brooks took me under her wing and moled me into a lover for writing and music. I stared in the Black Wizard of OZ in school staring as the Lion. I loved the role just to sing and act is what I always wanted. My dreams was crushed once my mother hooked up a man who had molested me and pushed all my dreams to the back of my mind. At such a young age when it all started I believed in a higher power GOD! My aunt Billy Jean took me to church where I was baptist and had GOD instilled in me. In Junior High I meet another teacher who would give me back my dreams Mr. Sintra, he asked to write a play and I did all by myself.

This is about what happens when she says no, she wants to lead her own life.(4 stars - by A Customer)\nThis was the first Elizabeth [Aston] I've read, and will certainly read more. It was sharp, funny and slightly off the wall ... a very enjoyable read.(5 stars - by Damaskcat)\nI have read Brotherly Love several times and still find it just as good as the first time.

Her work often includes paranormal themes. It always features plots based on history and archaeology. While she doesn’t write comedy, she believes in characters with a sense of humor. Her fantasies are set in a mythological, alternate-history Mediterranean and India. Her contemporary novels are set in Texas, in Ohio, in Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia, and in England and Scotland.  Of her Lucifer’s Crown, Library Journal says: \"Blending historical mystery with a touch of the supernatural, the author creates an intriguing exploration of faith and redemption in a world that is at once both modern and timeless. Of her Shadows in Scarlet, Publishers Weekly says, “Presenting a delicious mix of romance and supernatural suspense, Carl (Ashes to Ashes) delivers yet another immensely readable tale. She has created an engaging cast and a very entertaining plot, spicing the mix with some interesting twists on the ghostly romantic suspense novel.” Among many other novels, Lillian is the author of the Jean Fairbairn/Alasdair Cameron cross-genre mystery series: America’s exile and Scotland’s finest on the trail of all-too-living legends. Of The Secret Portrait, Kirkus says: “Mystery, history and sexual tension blend with a taste of the wild beauty of the Highlands”. Of The Burning Glass, Publishers Weekly says: “Authentic dialect, detailed descriptions of the castle and environs, and vivid characters recreate an area rich in history and legend. The tightly woven plot is certain to delight history fans with its dramatic collision of past and present.” With John Helfers, Lillian co-edited The Vorkosigan Companion, a retrospective on Lois McMaster Bujold’s science fiction work, which was nominated for a Hugo award. Her first story collection, Along the Rim of Time, was published in 2000, and her second, The Muse and Other Stories of History, Mystery, and Myth, in 2008, including three stories that were reprinted in Year’s Best mystery anthologies.

They are offering products to sell. Products that don't work! I never wanted this. I wanted to create CHANGE!A question you probably have on your mind is, why should you believe that we can help you?As you already know quite well, there are a lot of people running around trying to convince you that they have all the answers. Well, unfortunately for you, we don't have ALL the answers. But we do believe that we have SOME of the answers (and I think the answers are very powerful). And my answer to you is that you SHOULDN'T just blindly believe me. In fact, I would recommend that you PRACTICE my materials with a healthy skepticism. PLEASE PRACTICE MEETING PEOPLE. I want you to TRY what you learn from us. Only after you've seen that this stuff is REAL do I want you to believe us.We think our courses are the best in the world, and we stand behind them. I honestly hope you get incredible value from each one. Modeling is the best way to learn because you get to see it and then you get to mimic it... AND THEN turn it into something based off of you. Based off of your motives, based off of who you are. You will experience our courses online, but the best of the best is the Dating Mastery Course, where I work with you. IT IS BASED ON MENTORSHIP AND COURSE-WORK. I FAIL WITH YOU. I SUCCEED WITH YOU. You will connect with someone sexually just about anywhere- within about 5 minutes or even with 30 seconds. It is that easy.Go to catchherandkeepher.orgI will not let you fail. I will get you the results you desire. I love doing this and this is my passion. I want to be apart of the experience and experience with YOU. If you are ready to change....This is not for everybody, but if you're ready to put in the work YOU CAN DO IT. Don't be ashamed to live the sexual life of your dreams.*Bottom Line - You will get Results - I will make sure of it! Sign Up Now!

An expert in human behavior and motivation, Dr. Esonis specializes in the burgeoning field of Positive Psychology, the scientific study of optimal human functioning and the core strengths that can lead to the achievement of one's personally-defined goals – what we call \"the good life.\" Dr. Esonis earned her Bachelor and Masters degrees at Ohio University and her doctoral degree at Boston College. While at BC, she studied under a preeminent psychologist who was renowned in the field of Cognitive Behavior Therapy and was an early proponent of the Positive Psychology movement. Dr. Esonis is licensed in psychology in Arizona and Massachusetts, and in addition to her many years of private practice as a clinician and life coach, she supervised masters and doctoral students in their clinical work at Arizona State University. She has served as a hospital staff psychologist and has lectured on topics ranging from stress management, meditation and relaxation training to assertiveness and sleep management. Today, her private practice in San Diego is dedicated exclusively to Positive Psychology Coaching. Her first book, It's Your Little Red Wagon… 6 Core Strengths for Navigating Your Path to the Good Life was Dr. Esonis’ initial contribution to the field of Positive Psychology, presenting proven success factors and strength-building techniques that can lead individuals to a life of purpose, motivation and personally-defined happiness. In 8 Crazy Beliefs That Screw Up Your Life. Change These Beliefs and Become a Healthier, Happier Person, Dr. Esonis identifies eight “Thematic Belief Systems” that, in her experience as a psychologist and life coach for over 30 years, prevent individuals from building healthy, long-lasting relationships and extracting maximum happiness from life. She examines these “crazy beliefs” with all their negative implications and offers practical, persuasive arguments for why – and how – they can be replaced with healthy alternatives. Dr. Esonis is a member of the Association for Behavior and Cognitive Therapy (ABCT), the San Diego Professionals Coaches Alliance (SDPCA) and is a Founding Member of the Centre for Applied Positive Psychology (CAPP).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He’s been walking an emotional tightrope his whole life. As a gay teenager, he struggled to fit in, only finding a semblance of solace when a new student named Edward showed him that much joy could be had living outside the norm. But even as an adult, he still feels uncomfortable in his own skin, until the day he stumbles upon the circus and a Romanian trapeze artist named Vlad. He falls head over heels for the talented aerialist, much to the chagrin of the other performers, who see him as nothing more than a stalker obsessed with sex. But when his relationship with Vlad runs its course, he can’t let life in the Big Top go. He builds a trapeze in his home and devotes endless hours to twisting and contorting his body in hopes of setting his spirit free. Davis serves up an offbeat, if occasionally wearying, spin on the coming-of-age novel. --Allison Block", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After escaping to the United States in the early 1980s and becoming a successful accountant (and polygamist) in Southern California, Chhun grew \"doughy\"--physically and, it seems, emotionally. He became a slight, soft man who wore thick glasses above his chubby cheeks. Then, at the age of 42, something clicked: Chhun decided his former countrymen deserved the freedom he had achieved. When diplomacy and protests failed, he turned to weaponry and force. Like a character out of a Graham Greene novel, the accountant became the \"Thumb,\" the enigmatic head of the Cambodian Freedom Fighters, whose guerillas Chhun recruited to join in his attempted coup of the Cambodian government. As told by former Newsweek correspondent Adam Piore, Chhun's story is that of a willful man haunted by survivor's guilt and by \"the demons of his past.\" He is idealistic, headstrong, charismatic—and naïve. In 2000, dozens of Chhun's armed Freedom Fighters attacked the Ministry of Defense building and military police headquarters. Chhun, stationed at a secret base near the Thai border, waited to learn whether his small band of fighters had overthrown the government, which he hoped would soon need a new leader--himself. -–Neal Thompson", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 1335048, "title": "The Accidental Terrorist", "author": "Adam Piore", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I started buying and studying jewelry design books and set up a small studio in the sun room of our apartment and showed my wares at street festivals. The University of Chicago offered a class in welding so my friend, Annie Kleboe, and I decided to sign up. Annie was doing stone sculpture at the time; she's now into collages. My other crafts include woodworking and sewing (quilt design and construction). I owe whatever sewing skills I have to my mother. She was very patient with me. Sometimes I'd get so frustrated at not being able to do it I'd be ready to quit. But she sat with me and she showed me and finally I'd settle down and try again. Another skill this taught me was how to follow directions.  I mainly enjoyed cutting out the patterns and seeing how much material would be left over from what the pattern recommended we buy. Sewing the pieces together was just another kind of puzzle and it taught me how to visualize and think things through so I could end up with something that was half-way decent looking. Woodworking is still another kind of puzzle only in order to put this puzzle together, you first have to design and make the pieces. It's fun. I definitely recommend any kind of craft as a worthwhile pastime and learning experience. My professional writing career began in 1980 with the publication of Jean's Arizona Fan Palm, cutting directions for a 3.2 carat citrine (you can see it in the Handcrafted Jewelry Photo Gallery book in the Kick-Start Creativity series), in the January issue of the Lapidary Journal Gem Cutting Magazine. Many years later my step-by-step articles for original jewelry designs were being published in various international magazines including Jewelry Artist, Step by Step Beads, and Wire Jewelry magazine just to name a few. And now, 2012, I'm enjoying the writing and publishing of various kinds of books for Kindle. (How To Eat Healthy - foods to eat...foods to avoid, No Work Vegetable Gardening, Psychology of Success - how to have success when trying to change how you look, The Trust - a cautionary tale, Little Mysteries - a short story, and many others.) I'll be 70 years old this year. It's been quite a ride. I hope you enjoy my offerings. Again, thank you for your interest.

I eventually decided to head off to (actually I commuted) nearby Shepherd College. I graduated in 2003 with an Elementary Education degree and taught kindergarten for three years (two in WV and one in Hillsboro, OR). Although I loved teaching (most of it), I had a desire to have a greater effect of kids becoming avid readers and learners.  I wrote Joe and the Ten Wishes in 2006 and opted to substitute and write some more. I also found myself visiting 15 schools as a Guest Author and talking with over 4,000 kids about reading, writing, and chasing their dreams.  In addition to writing, I have returned to teaching elementary school and am always a dad. I love watching football, playing golf, coaching basketball, running, comedies, day dreaming, and traveling (although I hate parking).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

(The latter is three pages longer and less fun to read.) Fueled by Orwell's intense disillusionment with Soviet Communism,Animal Farmis a nearly perfect piece of writing, both an engaging story and an allegory that actually works. When the downtrodden beasts of Manor Farm oust their drunken human master and take over management of the land, all are awash in collectivist zeal. Everyone willingly works overtime, productivity soars, and for one brief, glorious season, every belly is full. The animals' Seven Commandment credo is painted in big white letters on the barn. All animals are equal. No animal shall drink alcohol, wear clothes, sleep in a bed, or kill a fellow four-footed creature. Those that go upon four legs or wings are friends and the two-legged are, by definition, the enemy. Too soon, however, the pigs, who have styled themselves leaders by virtue of their intelligence, succumb to the temptations of privilege and power. \"We pigs  are brainworkers. The whole management and organisation of the farm depend  on us. Day and night, we are watching over your welfare. It is for your  sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples.\" While this swinish brotherhood sells out the revolution, cynically editing the Seven Commandments to excuse their violence and greed, the common animals are once again left hungry and exhausted, no better off than in the days when humans ran the farm. SatireAnimal Farmmay be, but it's a stony reader who remains unmoved when the stalwart workhorse, Boxer, having given his all to his comrades, is sold to the glue factory to buy booze for the pigs.

She took my baby!\" Sarah's wailing pierced Alex's ear, even through the phone.\"Calm down, Sarah,\" Alex said and waved off a nurse who had paused during her rotation to see if Alex needed help. \"Take a deep breath and tell me everything.\" She hurried down the hall and into her office to escape the normal noises of the busy hospital. \"How long has Erika been missing?\"\"Since this afternoon. She went down the street to play with her friend.\" The hysterical tone in Sarah's voice continued to rise with each sentence. \"She was supposed to be home at three, but she never came. I waited and waited and she never came.\"\"What did the friend's mother say?\"\"That Erika left in time to get home. She's gone, Alex, and no one will believe me. My baby! What happened to my baby?\" Sarah began sobbing. \"I called and called but you never answered.\"Alex grabbed her purse from her desk drawer and locked her office. \"I'm on my way. Sarah, can you hear me?\"The sound of frantic sobbing was all Alex heard as she rushed into the elevator. As soon as the elevator door closed, the call dropped. Alex looked at her display and cursed when she saw the list of missed calls from her cousin. She'd been tied up all afternoon giving a videotaped statement for a commitment hearing and had turned off her phone, but now she wished she hadn't.Mentally, she willed the elevator to move faster and as soon as the door opened to the parking garage, she ran to her car, pressing in Sarah's number as she ran. The busy signal had her cursing again.She jumped into her car and tore out of the parking lot toward the highway. Even with a fast car and a lead foot, it would take her at least an hour to get to Sarah's house. She pressed redial, and the busy signal sounded once again. Glancing in her rearview mirror, she merged onto the highway and immediately moved to the fast lane.Out of options, she dialed 9-1-1.\"This is Dr. Alexandria Bastin. I'm a resident psychiatrist at Memorial Hospital in New Orleans. I have reason to believe that a patient is suffering from a serious mental episode and I cannot get her to answer the phone. I'm on my way, but I need someone to check on Sarah Rhonaldo at 152 Cypress Lane in Vodoun.\"She pressed her foot down harder on the accelerator and prayed that Sarah hadn't done something foolish. Her cousin had separated from Erika's father three months before, and it hadn't been pleasant—especially not for Sarah's husband, her best friend, or the bed she'd caught them having sex in, as it had met a tragic end, hatchet style.Alex had managed, with the help of a great attorney, to get the charges reduced to destruction of private property, but Sarah's Paul Bunyan routine hadn't scored her any points with the local sheriff. Given that their families had been warring since the dawn of time, the bed-hatchet escapade cemented Sheriff Conroy's belief that Sarah was worthless trash.She could only hope Sarah hadn't done anything to jeopardize her health…or her parole. Alex didn't even want to think about what might have happened to Erika until she got face-to-face with Sarah and heard the entire story.A truck displaying the sheriff's logo on the side was in front of Sarah's house when Alex pulled up just before seven p.m.This can't be good.She pulled in behind the truck and parked. She'd been hoping for an ambulance, but there was no sign of a paramedic anywhere. Which meant whatever had happened to Sarah, her health was fine, but given that the sheriff was still there, her freedom might be in question.She grabbed her purse and hurried into the house without bothering to knock. \"Sarah,\" she called, scanning the rooms as she rushed down the hall.\"Back here,\" Sarah answered, her voice weak.Alex ran the rest of the way down the hall and into the kitchen and ran straight into the last person in the world she expected or wanted to see.His shoulders were wider, his upper body harder and leaner than she'd ever seen him. And she'd seen every inch. \"Holt,\" she said, trying to keep her voice steady. \"I didn't know you were back.\"Ten years ago, he'd run away to war—the one place he could be certain his past couldn't follow him.His hands were still on her shoulders, and he stood so close she could feel the heat coming off his body. The smell of his aftershave tickled her nose, and instantly she remembered the last time his hands had been on her body. The last time she'd been completely absorbed with Holt—mind, body and soul.\"Been back for a month now,\" he said, and looked down at her with those sexy green eyes that had been the cause of many a weak moment on her part.But no more.She stepped back so that he was forced to drop his hands, and that was when she noticed the badge on his belt. \"You're working for your uncle?\"\"I'm just filling in until I figure out what I want to do next and until his broken leg heals.\"\"Is Sarah okay?\"Holt moved to the side and motioned her into the breakfast nook where Sarah sat, staring out the back window. \"You tell me.\"Alex walked over to the table and slid onto the chair next to Sarah. Her cousin took one look at her, flung her arms around her neck and began sobbing. \"They don't believe me. My baby's gone and they don't believe me.\" The volume of her voice increased with every word until she was shouting.Alex untangled Sarah's arms from her neck and studied her cousin. Her skin was pale, but normal, given the situation. Her eyes were red from crying, but Alex didn't see any disconnect from reality in them.\"Who doesn't believe you?\"Sarah pointed to Holt. \"The sheriff's department. They think I'm crazy.\"A flash of anger washed over Alex like a tidal wave and she turned to face Holt. \"A six-year-old is missing from her own neighborhood in broad daylight. Exactly what does it take for the sheriff's department to become concerned?\"\"My uncle said—\"\"Your uncle wouldn't have a nice thing to say about Sarah even if it meant avoiding eternal damnation.\" Alex turned her attention back to Sarah. \"I need you to take a deep breath and tell me what happened.\"Sarah nodded and took a deep breath, blowing it slowly out. \"Right after lunch, Erika went to her friend's house up the street to play. I stood outside and watched her until she went inside their house. She was supposed to be home by three.\"\"But she didn't come home?\"\"No. At three-fifteen, I called her friend's mother to remind Erika to leave, but the mother said Erika had left at five 'til, just like she was supposed to.\"\"Did the friend's mother watch her walk home?\"\"No. Erika walked with her friend all the way to the house and then her friend crossed the street to go to her music lesson.\"\"Did her friend see Erika go in the house?\"Sarah shook her head. \"She said when she was closing the door, she saw Erika checking the mail. But when I came outside to look for her, the mail was lying in the street.\" Sarah began to cry again. \"They think Bobby took her. He's a lying, worthless, cheating waste-of-a-husband, but he's a good father. Bobby would never take Erika away from me.\"Alex blew out a breath, trying to make sense of everything Sarah had said. Her cousin's story didn't fill in all the gaps and she had a feeling those gaps were important. Unfortunately, the one person who could give her the answers she needed was the last person she wanted to talk to.She opened her purse and took out a prescription for antianxiety medication that she'd filled for Sarah the day before. Ever since Sarah's split from Bobby, she'd had trouble sleeping and concentrating. The meds took the edge off and allowed her to act normal even though she didn't feel normal. \"I want you to take this,\" she said, and placed a pill in Sarah's hand. \"I need to know everything you can think of. In order to be helpful, you need to be refreshed and calm. While the medicine is doing its job, I want you to take a hot shower.\"Sarah opened her mouth to protest, but Alex held up a hand to stop her. \"I'm saying this as your doctor. No arguments.\"Sarah looked at Alex, her expression wavering between wanting to comply and wanting to argue, then she glanced over at Holt and sighed. \"Fine.\"Alex rose from the table and pushed a glass of water closer to Sarah. Sarah placed the pill in her mouth and took a big drink, her hand shaking a bit as she lowered the glass back to the table. Her cousin rose from the table and hugged Alex.\"I feel better already because you're here,\" Sarah said. \"You're the smartest person I know. You'll find Erika.\" Sarah broke off the hug and trudged down the hall toward her bedroom.Alex stared after her, trying to keep her own heart from breaking over the situation. She and Sarah had been born only a month apart and were more like sisters than cousins. She and Erika were the only family Alex had left since her own parents had died in a car wreck twelve years before. The day Erika was born, Alex had been almost as proud as Sarah, and to think of that little girl, taken from her home, was beyond upsetting. But one of them had to remain calm and collected, and that role almost always fell to Alex.She looked over at Holt, who was leaning against the kitchen counter. \"I need you to tell me exactly what is going on. No speculation or your uncle's gossip. Cold, hard facts are all I'm interested in.\"Holt smiled.&#...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.625, "rating_total": 37.0}

While these three men have known one another separately for a long time, it was not until they were all three together in Heiligenkreuz, Austria teaching students from eastern Europe and central Asia at Haus Edelweiss (TCMI) that the three men sat together for the first time and shared their concerns for the health of congregations and the health of its leadership. We are convinced that a healthy leadership builds a healthy congregation. From these conversations over coffee came the idea for this series, designed to strengthen the health of elders as the congregation s leaders. While individuals were assigned their own chapters to write, the final form of each chapter was reviewed and reworked by all three authors sharing a common table, typically in Indianapolis, Indiana. Hence, the work is a tri-authored resource for the equipping of congregational leaders who serve as elders of the Church.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I am 70 years old, a retired high school teacher of English, Drama and Special Needs, and have been writing off and on for as long as I can remember.  My old school, Walbottle High School, always puts on a musical as the main production every summer. In 1997  I wrote the book, music and lyrics for my musical Ghostwalk. It is a rock and roll musical set in an American high school, circa 1955. It is loosely based on my favourite play, Hamlet, by the greatest writer who ever lived - William Shakespeare - and also refers in some of the events and names to my other hero, Elvis, the greatest singer who ever lived. I have also written a horror novel for children 11 to 12 years old. This came about because I wanted something that would work as a class reader when I was Head of English at my previous school. I even had one of the top agents for children’s books at the time but the offers I received meant mangling my book to fit into a series and I simply wouldn’t do that.  GLOBE came about because a dear friend of mine got me started writing again when he came up with the idea of a molecular computer. We couldn't afford to build it - but Craig Venter is now making great strides in this area - so we decided to write a novel about it. GLOBE is actually the first part of a planned trilogy so if sales go well on Kindle then we will have to get cracking and write the next part. Annie's Ghost is a romance, something entirely different for me. It is more of a novella than a novel but, I hope, expresses something eternal about the human condition and the need for love and companionship. Sylvia’s Sonnets is a collection of Petrarchan love sonnets written originally for my wife.  The Alchemist’s Daughter is part one on a series of seven novels. It follows the adventures of 12 year old Freya Vanaheim in 1900 Edinburgh when her father, a pharmacist but also secretly an alchemist, makes Freya his apprentice. This is against all the rules and unleashes terrible and terrifying forces against which Freya has to battle in order to save her family and friends and ultimately far more. The saga roams across time and history and alert readers may recognise a variety of allusions to different parts of the British Isles and historical events.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Telander was born in Málaga, Spain. He started writing with a vested interest at the age of fifteen with short stories both for class and for personal enjoyment. In his last few years at his high school, he started his own newspaper, the St. Anthony’s Gazette, where he published some of his stories, as well as a wealth of other material that he mostly wrote for the paper. With a love for America and its ways, he attended San José State University, in San José, California, majoring in biology with a concentration in marine biology. Deciding this wasn’t as concentrated as he wanted, he transferred to Long Beach State, where they offered a marine biology major. It was at the end of the first semester that he decided marine biology and, realistically, the math and physics wasn’t for him, and he would be honest and follow his real passion, creative writing. He took a number of writing classes with many talented professors, working closely under Lisa Glatt (author of A Girl Becomes a Comma Like That) and Brian Alan Lane. He also worked for four years at the student-run newspaper, the Long Beach Union, starting as a staff writer, then News Editor, Literature Editor (which he created, getting contacts and requesting review copies from publishers), Associate Editor, and in his last year as Editor-in-Chief.  Apart from various articles and book reviews, he had some short prose pieces and poetry published in the creative arts section. Alex is a writer, book reviewer, and interviewer.  He’s been seriously writing for about fifteen years, starting when he was a teenager.  He has finished three novels: a young adult fantasy, a mystery/thriller, and a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel he recently finished, the first in a four-book series.   He is currently working on a big historical fiction epic set in fifth century Britain called Wyrd (which is Anglo-Saxon for “fate”).   Alex is also a reading addict, finishing an average of 100 books in the last three years, and reviews just about everything he finishes.  In addition to reviewing for the San Francisco Book Review and the Sacramento Book Review, he puts all his reviews up on his website, Bookbanter (www.bookbanter.net).  BookBanter began as a dream that became a reality: you can now find more than fifty exclusive interviews on the site, both audio and written, as well as more than 600 book reviews.  To get in touch with Alex, just shoot him an email at alex@bookbanter.net.", "related": [], "rank": 3995254, "title": "KYRA", "author": "Alex C.

I never even told my best friend about it\" After years of denying her natural talents, she arrived in New York City to open an antique and jewelry concession in the World's Fair. Still in denial of her natural talents, Mary fell in love with Manhattan. Its energy and culture provided the stimulus she needed to prepare for her life's work. At an Association of Humanistic Psychology conference she met other healers for the first time. A spontaneous healing of lung cancer compelled her to finally accept her own gifts. In gratitude, she committed the rest of her life to healing. Extensive studies with leaders in the field, here and abroad, enhanced and multiplied her natural talent. As an empath, spiritual coach and healing energy channel, she has worked with celebrities, business executives, artists, ambassadors and \"just people\" In her spiritual development and self-mastery classes she works as catalyst to unleash and develop the latent talents of others. Mary is convinced that \"paranormal\" and \"extra sensory perception\" are mankind's birthright that civilization has repressed and denied. Mary considers Multi-Life Therapy her greatest achievement. This book tells the story of its beginning and the excitement, the drama, the freedom it offers. Everything in this book happened . . . to real people.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A guide to spiritual growth and personal transformation, Forgotten Wings was the product of her many years of work as a healer and spiritual seeker, and a powerful pull to share her knowledge and soul wisdom more widely. She is a warm, inspiring writer and speaker whose own spiritual voyage of discovery began over 15 years ago. Ever since, her quest for a deeper spiritual connection and understanding has led her on a heart and soul awakening apprenticeship.In the summer of 2011 Dawn's work took another new turn when the crystal skulls and star beings of light suddenly and unexpectedly entered her life. Since that time, she has been working almost exclusively with them. Inspired by this contact and the messages they were bringing her she turned to writing fiction and in April 2012 she published her debut novel, Lost Legacy, the first in a series entitled The Skull Chronicles. Her writing embraces her interest and passion for these crystal skulls and ancient mysteries. She is currently deep into the sequel to Lost Legacy, which is due for release in late spring 2013.It was while Dawn was on an extended visit to Sedona in November 2012 that her guides asked her to temporarily put this work aside and to compile as a book the messages she has channelled since they began contacting her. The result is Starspeak - and it is certain that there will be more volumes to follow as the messages continue.Dawn lives in the beautiful county of Wiltshire, surrounded by its mysterious ancient landscape and stone monuments, which are an important source of inspiration for her writing. She has a grounded, earthy spirituality which is based as much in the appreciation and enjoyment of our physical existence as in the unseen world around and within us.OTHER BOOKS BY THE SAME AUTHORNon-fiction:Forgotten Wings; O-Books 2009Fiction: (written under the name D.K.

Wilkinson's sixth novel is based on a combination of interviews she did for her oral history of early stock-car racing ( Dirt Tracks to Glory ) and her own experience as a timer for various race teams. Set in rural North Carolina in the early '60s, the novel concerns Tom Pate and his younger brother Zack. Although Tom's obsession with race-car driving is supposedly the primary story, it is Zack and his rich, warm and hardly predictable evolution that is the better one. Lacking a clear plot line, this overly long novel takes the reader around and around, not unlike a race track going nowhere. Wilkinson does occasionally score, as in her hauntingly beautiful description of the death of a young child, his mother's grief and the women who comfort her. The world seen through the eyes of male characters, on the other hand, is typically superficial, although the dialogue is grittily authentic. Unfortunately, what Wilkinson says of one of her characters could be applied to her novel as a whole: \"Words ran out of her mouth like a radio disc jockey who was afraid of a moment of silence. . . .\" Author tour.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 3912747, "title": "On the 7th Day God Created the Chevrolet", "author": "Sylvia Wilkinson", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Chief Insp. Neil Paget (after 2009'sThe Cold Hand of Malice), Paget looks into a 13-year-old case after new information comes to light. Scrawled notes, written by 19-year-old Barry Grant before he blew his head off with a shotgun, reveal that Barry was the getaway driver for a gang that committed several robberies and killed two people in the last one. Paget directs a finely drawn cast of supporting characters, including Det. Sgt. John Tregalles and Det. Constable Molly Forsythe, as they begin the arduous task of re-interviewing the many victims and witnesses and re-examining evidence and files. The cold case heats up when an arsonist tries to destroy Grant's old home and a potential witness is almost beaten to death.

Bhikkhu Bodhi, além de seu incansável trabalho frente à BPS, é também escritor de várias obras e tradutor de dois grandes volumes das escrituras, o Majjhima Nikaya, o Samyutta Nikaya e o Anguttara Nikaya, juntos compreendendo mais de 6500 de páginas traduzidas, como também de outros suttas isolados.", "related": [], "rank": 2950873, "title": "Pensando o Buddhismo", "author": "Bhikkhu Bodhi", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We root for her not only because she's naughty and funny, and not because she's just been fired by her agent for writing a crappy book, but because she's an endearing mess, a windmill slayer who just won't quit. She’s like those inflatable boxer dummies that keep popping back up after you bop them. Like others plowing those middle acres of life (30s and 40s), this self-confessed \"praise junkie\" is desperate to succeed, preferably at something difficult and ideally at something she loves. When it turns out her dreams of literary celebrity are, let's say, premature, she turns boldly, somewhat crazily to standup comedy. And it turns out the lessons of standup are a lot like the lessons of life: Don't f**k it up; Know your f**king material. (Yes, comedians adore the f-word.) Perhaps the best advice, paraphrased from the foul-mouthed club owner: No one laughed at your precious joke? So what? Do it again. With great characters, some wonderful moments, and a narrator/heroine who's desperate for our applause, this is a sneak-up-on-you blast of a story: self-mocking and gutsy, raunchy and sweet, funny and wise and, though it risks giving Altman dirty joke material, it's quite touching.--Neal Thompson", "related": [], "rank": 434481, "title": "That's What She Said (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Mara Altman", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 2.375, "rating_total": 19.0}

Lived in the city until I was nine, when I moved away from every thing I’d known, to live in a small town called Paeroa.  It was there that I grew to love the countryside, the pot belly fire place, my ‘Anne of Green Gables’ home. My mother home schooled my three brothers, sister and I until high school, which made us a close knit family.  After graduating from Waikato University, we had all moved over to live in the suburbs of Hamilton.  Soon after I got married and moved to South Korea. It’s been a long time coming, but I’m on my new adventure of writing and self publishing books.  My husband, Saveth, and I now are back in NZ and raising our son, Ezra.  Saveth has been exceptionally supportive and Ezra has been a big inspiration for my writing.  I aim to continue writing children’s stories because I love it, so I hope you enjoy reading my stories.

Patience had never left her crowded, rural home in Plimouth, Massachusetts, until she got the news from Boston. Her best friend Anne Wentworth's broken leg would heal, the doctor said, but she'd be confined to her bed for months. Could Patience come to Boston? Soon Patience is in the Wentworths' elegant carriage on her way to comfort her friend. Once settled, Patience hears political rumblings rolling through 1773 Boston: Anne's father sympathizes with the colonists' frustration with the new taxes on tea, but Anne's loyalties are split because of her romantic interest in Oliver, a young British officer. Patience stands by as the history unfolds, becoming an unwilling witness and, at times, a terrified participant in the goings on. The authors' make an important piece of the past accessible to today's readers through a successful blend of fiction, historical research, and detail.Kelly HallsCopyright © American Library Association.

I was equally motivated by the deadline for Dragons' Den (Ireland) to stay with it. I can reacall some very fluid days of writing and some forced days when nothing was going right.  I had a very clear blueprint of what I wanted to say. Beside me on the wall i hung the chapters. Within each chapter were the Pillars. I didn't get them right the first time. I moved them around a few times until I felt they flowed.  The cover of the book came to me in a dream.

I'm from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. After leaving an academic career in English literature to pursue a successful career in corporate finance, I've now returned to my roots, writing full-time. In my books I hope you find not only erotic titillation, but also enjoyable storytelling and a bit of human truth. Why do I say that I write the \"thinking man's\" romance and erotica? I don't go for the easy stuff, and I try to challenge my readers. I want to make you think. I try to write something you wouldn't be embarrassed to be caught reading. With or without sex scenes, the writing is all there; I'm not producing the literary version of a low-budget porn flick. I take great pride in crafting something special for you, and that means that there's not a sentence of lazy writing in my books. It's unfortunate that erotica is often written in a slapdash fashion, but that's not how I create my work. I'm a man, and I write primarily for men. Ironically, all-male romantic fiction is dominated by women writing for women. That female focus engenders portrayals of men -- and of love and sex between men -- in conformance with women's ideals and fantasies, rather than with the reality of men's thoughts, feelings, and lives. I've tried reading some of the bestsellers in gay romance, and they read like women's fantasies about their ideal boyfriends, who just happen to be gay, presumably having jettisoned the flaws of straight men. That's fine for that audience, but it leaves out the male audience, who wants to read about real men, not about fantastic castrati. I bring that male voice to all-male romantic fiction, writing real stories for and about men, how we are and how we see ourselves. I've talked too much already. Maybe that's the writer's curse. Thanks for reading all this. I hope you enjoy my books.", "related": ["B00KFKXV10"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Back in 2010 he was in grad school full-time and working a job at a trash can factory. He had quit his corporate job and went back to school because he was tired of the cubicle world was looking for opportunity. Unfortunately the only opportunities he found were in the form of massive students loans that would take a lifetime to repay and a job at the trash can plant. In order to save what little money he had, he rented a room with peeling paint and stained carpet in the basement of a townhouse. A few short months after he moved into that basement room, he was informed that he no longer had the job making trash cans. Jobless, lonely, overwhelmed with endless class assignments, $50k in student loans, $30k in credit card debt, living underground and just plain unhappy... This was not what he had envisioned for his future. It was at that time, sitting in the basement, that he realized something had to change. He started searching for ways to really start his own business and do it successfully. His final decision was to never go back to corporate world he had just been shown the exit to. That was at the end of 2010. Eventually he graduated in May 2011 and did not even consider looking for a job. He was already making a decent living running an online business and it was growing. He kept on going and the business ended up bringing in 6 figures that first year in operation. That was 2011. In 2012 and beyond, the business has skyrocketed and continues to grow.

After caring for Lokey and finding him a home, they realized they needed to bring a new canine friend into their lives. They adopted a 9 1/2-week-old German shepherd, Sabrina, and Landy felt overwhelmed by the love he felt for, and received from, this very special animal. When it came time for Sabrina to “cross the Rainbow Bridge” due to cancer, Landy was distraught beyond anything he could have imagined. He spent eight months trying to understand his extraordinary grief and pain, but when he brought home a baby shepherd named Tia, a new romance began. At the tender age of 4, though, Tia was diagnosed with inoperable cancer, and Landy swore he would do everything possible to help her beat the odds—despite a 10 percent chance of survival. At times, this memoir serves as a tribute to both Tia and Sabrina; Landy’s nightly ritual includes an entreaty to the late Sabrina to watch over her “sister” and give her the strength to keep fighting. Overall, this slim volume is a very personal, articulate account of the author’s journey through the grieving process, and it may help readers through the loss of their own four-legged family members. “Don’t let anyone tell you that the healing process doesn’t take time,” Landy writes. “It may be difficult for some to understand the everlasting bond that was created.”A poignant, sometimes-heartbreaking love song to Landy’s special pets.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Writing was only abandoned when she left home and real-life took over from the fiction. She did not go to Oxford or Cambridge, but at sixteen - with the minimum qualifications necessary - went to Croydon (its art college). Gilli did not work on any of the broadsheets, in TV, or in publishing. Instead she did a variety of jobs - shop assistant, beauty-consultant, barmaid and picking up American tourists in London, in order to sell them real estate in Florida. She worked longest and most happily as a commercial artist. Gilli married Geoffrey, and when their son, Tom, was a toddler she resumed writing. The first full-length novel she ever completed, Just Before Dawn, was quickly picked up by a small independent publisher. Her second, Desires & Dreams, was published within a year of the first. Sadly the publisher failed to achieve the marketing push and wide distribution necessary to ensure success for its writers, or for itself. It ceased to trade within five years of establishment. Gilli’s novels are unconventional, surprising and subversive. Although she writes under the banner of contemporary women’s fiction, she is incapable of following a bandwagon. There will always be a love story at the heart of every story, but it will never be one of those join-the-dots plots. Her novel, TORN, first came out as an ebook in 2011. LIFE CLASS came out in 2012. FLY or FALL in 2013. All are now available in paperback. Gilli has been a school governor, a contributor to local newspapers and a driving force behind the successful establishment of a community shop in the village where she lives with her husband. Still a keen artist she draws and paints, design the family’s annual Christmas card and accepts art commissions. In 2013 Gilli undertook the illustrations for the children’s book, THE TALE OF KING HARALD - THE LAST VIKING ADVENTURE, written by her son, Thomas J T Williams, and published by The British Museum Press, in March, 2014.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The rest of Lovecraft’s life is shrouded in mystery. His parents were killed in a freak hairdressing accident, allowing him to use his vast inheritance to protect himself from the outside world forever.

My auntie used to send me boxes of her books and I would devour them one after another. Every so often, I would read a mystery or a suspense or a paranormal novel as I love those genres too. But romance is still my favourite. :) For many years, I wrote technical and non-fiction materials for professional use and had only dreamt about writing a novel. Then, one day, after a period of binge-reading sexy romances, I decided to sit in front of my computer and start writing my first fiction book. The result? My debut novel, \"Will To Love\", the first in the hot and sexy Lifestyle by Design series. After that, I knew that I would love to tell more beautiful love stories through my books. I live in Sydney, Australia with my amazing husband who lovingly cheers me on in my journey as a novelist. I would love to connect with you!

Vamik Volkan explores this intriguing and very timely question in a most unique psychoanalytic study. From his vantage point as the supervisor on this case, the patient’s hard exterior and inner turmoil come alive in startlingly clear detail. From the still elusive phenomenon of intergenerational transmission of trauma to the challenges of working with severe narcissistic psychopathology, the reader becomes a witness to the profound changes that can only occur with a psychoanalytic process. Volkan’s almost telepathic attunement and clinical wisdom offer something for therapists and social scientists at all levels. This book is a rare treat and will take its place among the best clinical monographs in our field.\"\"Dr Vamik Volkan’s book takes on special meaning in the wake of the horrible murder of innocents in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14, 2012. Volkan describes his supervision of the difficult but effective psychoanalysis of Peter, a mass-murderer of animals and civilians during war, who provides a glimpse into the complex causality involved with a man consumed by the urge to kill. Peter’s successful treatment also makes vivid the important concept of transgenerational transmission of trauma. This book will stir important conversations among psychotherapists and all those concerned with the prevention of lethal violence.\"\"InAnimal Killer: Transmission of War Trauma from One Generation to the Next, Vamik Volkan offers the reader a brilliant insight into the human soul – its frailties, its power, and its historical integrity – as seen through the disparate lenses of war and clinical psychoanalysis. He demonstrates in simple, lucid, compelling prose how wartime exposure to violence wreaks havoc with a person’s sense of self and of order in the world. He shows how the transgenerational effects of torture, isolation, terror, and loss of moral grounding can come forward and may be resolved through psychoanalysis. From a clinical point of view, the book is a master lesson in both doing and supervising psychoanalysis. The difficult work of treating a person with malignant narcissism is rendered understandable and deeply interesting. The basic principles and also the poignancy of supervising such an endeavor are gifts to the supervisor. In the context of recent acts of terror in places like Newtown, Boston, and Mogadishu, the experience of societal horror is portrayed in a way that will make this book accessible and helpful to the concerned bystander as well as every mental health professional.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Trained as a biologist at the University of California-Santa Cruz, he received his master's degree in 2004 and is now working as a science teacher in Oakland, CA. After years of writing for Internet mailing lists and a small circle of friends, in September 2007 Chris launched The Metamor City Podcast as a way of bringing his fiction to a broader audience. The show soon drew praise for its engaging characters, imaginative world-setting, and superior production values. Metamor City's first \"season\" ran from September 2007 to May 2009 and featured several short stories and novelettes and one full-length novel, MAKING THE CUT, which was presented as a full-cast audio production with music and sound effects. MAKING THE CUT won the 2009 Parsec Award for Outstanding Long-Form Audio Drama, and Metamor City's first season also garnered a 2008 Podcast Peer Award for superior audio production. In 2009-2011 Chris released three additional novellas on The Metamor City Podcast: \"Whispers in the Wood\", \"Dreams of Change\" (written by Nobilis Reed, and available in print as part of his QUICKSILVER BRIDGES anthology), and \"A Lightbringer Carol.\" In March 2011 Chris put the podcast on hiatus in order to focus on completing the second full-length Metamor City novel, THINGS UNSEEN. This book is now available on Smashwords as an e-book and will be released soon on Amazon. The podcast version of THINGS UNSEEN will begin releasing on September 22, 2013. When he isn't writing or planning lessons, Chris enjoys playing guitar, swing dancing, and hiking in California's many parks.

Here's the third in a pointedly cute series featuring the ghost of \"Aunt\" Dimity, the dead friend of heroine Lori Shepherd's mother. Lori plans a second honeymoon for herself and her overworked husband, lawyer Bill Willis, in the idyllic English cottage Lori inherited from Dimity (Aunt Dimity's Death, 1992). When a case keeps Bill in Boston, Lori heads overseas with her father-in-law, William Willis Sr. He suddenly disappears, taking Lori's pink flannel bunny, Reginald, and leaving an enigmatic note about family business. Further clues come from Dimity's ghost via her leather-bound journal, in which Lori observes Dimity's handwriting materialize on the page. Lori tracks Willis Sr., accompanied by her friend Emma's precocious 12-year-old stepdaughter, Nell, and Nell's teddy bear, Bertie, through the picturesque countryside to London. There she finds the British Willises?including sexy Gerald, efficient Lucy and bumbling Arthur?who are at odds, their family law firm in disarray. The plot hangs on an 18th-century feud that divided the family, resulting in murder and theft, and leading to present-day blackmail; the villain is easily identified. At the end of this amusing but silly tale, Bill and pregnant Lori move to England, delighting Aunt Dimity's ghost.

Although his own high school football career was cut short by a knee injury, he never lost his passion for the game. Thus began a 34-year coaching journey through youth football, Junior Varsity Football, and ultimately 13 years as a head coach of two high school teams. Over this period of time, Coach Reid has coached over 1000 young men, and made a nearly successful run for Michigan State Senate on a \"common sense\" platform based on duty, responsibility, and putting public service before politics. Coach Reid is married with two teenage children and lives in Midland Michigan, where he works as a Technical Advisor at the Dow Chemical Company Ethocel plant. Now retired from coaching, he spends his Friday nights watching the local kids play the game he loves.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is an invitation to the search for substance.\"--John Ortberg, senior pastor of Menlo Park Presbyterian Church; author ofWho Is This Man?Your life is not a reality show.It's actual reality.But too many of us spend our lives discontented with reality and focused on trivial pursuits--media, money, perpetual youth, and a culture of constant entertainment. We try to avoid the realities of pain, depression, loneliness, and mortality by filling our lives with diversions. Even worse, our churches that might use the reality of pain and suffering to point us to the cross instead dress the gospel up in the world's clothing so that it will seem more \"relevant.\"With pinpoint accuracy, LA club DJ-turned-pastor Ian DiOrio diagnoses the problem and gives us the cure. Exposing our most common empty attempts to find meaning apart from God, DiOrio points us back to God and calls us to find meaning in our identities as followers of Christ, as shapers of culture, and as people who participate in communities of worship.\"This book promises to liberate many from the entanglements of our culture. It is a wonderful offer to join Jesus in finding our lives by giving them away and to laugh when folks try to convince us that happiness has a price tag.\"--Shane Claiborne, activist and author\"My friend Ian DiOrio hits the nail on the head.

Bravo, Ms. Fideler!(David McCullough, historian and author of John Adams)Should you work beyond “normal” retirement age?Men Still at Workanswers important questions and offers encouragement for people who want to remain in the workforce for years. . . or decades.(Douglas Goldstein, Profile Investment Services, Ltd)Elizabeth Fideler has written a fascinating book on the experiences of older working men in today's rapidly changing economy. A follow-up to her study of older working women, Fideler once again demonstrates the value of compiling the personal stories of older Americans who remain on the job well-past traditional retirement age. Her insights will prove valuable, not only to policy makers and human resource managers, but also to older workers thinking about what to do in the next stage of their careers.(Carl E. Van Horn, director of Heldrich Center for Workforce Development, Rutgers University)Dr. Fideler’s powerful profiles of men who have remained hard at work provide us with more than stories. The descriptions of these men’s lives underscore the need for our society to get ready for 'what is coming next' as increasing numbers of baby boomers follow the lead of the men introduced to us inMen Still at Work.(Marcie Pitt-Catsouphes, Boston College; director, Sloan Center on Aging & Work; co-director, Center for Social Innovation)I, like many elders I know, am still working because I love what I do and I feel I have knowledge and experience to offer anyone interested. It's a beautiful thing to be a musician still able to perform, compose, and educate at the age of 87. This is a must-read for someone looking for a road map.(Jimmy Heath, Professor Emeritus, Queens College; Jazz Saxophonist, Composer, and Arranger)We will need to know more about the labor force involvement of Americans over age 65– because this segment of the population will continue to grow, because this stage will represent a greater portion of our lives, and because this group will increasingly impact our economy and culture. Elizabeth Fideler offers us engaging and highly readable stories of men who continue to work while the majority of their cohort has retired, which complements her earlier study of working women in this age group. These accounts remind us of the importance of meaning and engagement at work, and not just for the elderly.(Jerry A.
