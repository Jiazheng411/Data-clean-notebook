As time ticks down in short snippets, lengthy flashbacks depict the hunt for a newly resurfaced serial killer thought imprisoned decades ago. While Zach and partner Terry investigate the convict originally held responsible for the crimes, a former suspect and his daughter cope with the media spotlight, retrained on them following the new round of killings, and what may be the watchful gaze of the killer himself. Despite some bland dialogue and generic, B-movie-ready characters—wise-cracking buddy lawyers, a riddling serial killer, an enigmatic crime boss—Gaffney jerks the plot in enough different directions to keep readers alert and entertained. In addition, Gaffney's dry wit and willingness to make light of his more absurd plot twists keep this over-the-top stunner afloat when it threatens to capsize. The legal thriller equivalent of a James Bond flick, this guilty pleasure is best enjoyed with the more discerning half of the brain turned off and the adrenaline turned all the way up.(Apr.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book is well written with realistic dialogue that ends in a crescendo of action and excitement, leaving a few threads for a continuation of the series.  SOUND OF A VOICE THAT IS STILL is a satisfying romance and thriller that readers are sure to enjoy. --Marilyn Heyman, Romance Reviews TodayFans of this series will get to revisit characters from the first two books, while at the same time being introduced to characters that will surely play a pivotal role as this series continues to develop. Readers will rejoice in the tender moments between the various couples, while at the same time they will remain wary as hints and innuendo imply that everything is not a peaceful as it would appear. The ending is action packed and ensures that readers will want to pick up the next in the series. --Amanda, Angels ReviewThis is the stand-alone-third of a series. I haven't read any of her Oberon books although I want to after reading this one. Sound of a Voice That is Still has romance, multiple plots, the paranormal, humor, friendship, and a couple of on-going mysteries, so it has something for almost every reader.

Shesodidn't need this right now. Exhaustion pressed on her shoulders with heavy, punishing hands and she wanted nothing but to slip into a warm bath with a mind-numbing glass of wine.The day had been beyond ghastly. She could imagine few activities more miserable than spending an entire humiliating day sitting in a Lincoln City courtroom being confronted with the unavoidable evidence of her own stupidity.And now, despite her battered ego and fragile psyche, she had to go inside and make nice with a stranger who wouldn't even be renting the top floor of Brambleberry House if not for the tangled financial mess that stupidity had caused.In the backseat, Conan gave one sharp bark, though she didn't know if he was anxious at the unfamiliar vehicle parked in front of them or just needed to answer the call of nature.Since they had been driving for an hour, she opted for the latter and hurried out into the wet cold to open the sliding door of her minivan. The big shaggy beast she inherited nearly a year earlier, along with the rambling Victorian in front of her, leaped out in one powerful lunge.Tail wagging, he rushed immediately to sniff around the SUV that dared to enter his territory without his permission. He lifted his leg before she could kick-start her brain and Anna winced.\"Conan, get away from there,\" she called sternly. He sent her a quizzical look, then gave a disgruntled snort before lowering his leg and heading to one of his favorite trees instead.She really hoped her new tenant didn't mind dogs.She hated the idea of a stranger in Sage's apartment. If she had her way, she would keep it empty, even though Sage and her husband and stepdaughter had their own beach house now a half mile down the shore for their frequent visits to Cannon Beach from their San Francisco home.But after Anna vehemently refused to accept financial help from Sage and Eben, Sage had insisted she at least rent out her apartment to help defray costs.The two of them were co-owners of the house and Sage's opinion certainly had weight. Besides, Anna was nothing if not practical. The apartment was empty, she had a fierce, unavoidable need for income and she knew many people were willing to pay a premium for furnished beachfront living space.Army Lieutenant Harry Maxwell among them.She gazed up at the lights cutting through the twilight from the third-story window. She was going to have to go up there and welcome him to Brambleberry House. No question. It was the right thing to do, even if the long, exhausting day in that courtroom had left her as bedraggled and wrung-out as one of Conan's tennis balls after a good hard game of fetch on the beach.She might want to do nothing but climb into her bed, yank the covers over her head and weep for her shattered dreams and her own stupidity, but she had to put all that aside for now and do the polite thing.She grabbed her laptop case from the passenger seat just as her cell phone rang. Anna swallowed a groan when she saw the name and phone number.She wasn't sure what was worse—making nice with a stranger now living in her home or being forced to carry on a conversation with the bubbly real estate agent who had facilitated the whole deal.With grim resignation, she opened her phone and connected the call. \"Anna Galvez speaking.\"\"Anna! It's Tracy Harder!\"Even if she hadn't already noted Tracy's information on the caller ID, she would have recognized the other woman's perky enthusiasm in an instant.\"So have you seen him yet?\" Tracy asked.Anna screwed her eyes shut as if she could just make those upstairs lights—and Tracy—disappear. \"I just pulled up to the house, Tracy. I've been in Lincoln City all day. I haven't had a chance to even walk into the house yet. So, no, I haven't seen him. I'm planning to go up to say hello in a moment.\"\"You are the luckiest woman in town right now. I mean it! You have absolutelynoidea.\"\"You're right,\" she said, unable to keep the dry note out of her voice. \"But I'm willing to bet you're about to enlighten me.\"Tracy gave a low, sultry laugh. \"I know we didn't mention a finder's fee on top of my usual property management commission, but you just might want to kick a bonus over my way after you meet him. The man is gorgeous. Yum, that's all I have to say.Yum!\"Just what she needed. A player who would probably be entertaining a long string of model types at all hours of the day and night. \"As long as he pays his rent on time and only needs a two-month lease, I don't care what he looks like.\"\"That's because you haven't met him yet. How much longer will Julia Blair and her kids be renting the second floor? I might be interested when she moves out—I'd love to be beneath that man.\"Anna couldn't help her groan, both at Tracy's not so subtle sexual innuendo and at the idea of the real estate agent's wild boys living in the second-floor apartment.\"Julia and Will aren't getting married until June,\" she answered. With any luck, Lieutenant Maxwell would be long gone by then, leaving behind only his nice fat rental check.\"When she moves out, let me know. That might be a good time for us to talk about a more long-term solution to Brambleberry House. You can't keep taking in temporary renters to pay for the repairs on it. The place is a black hole that will suck away every penny you have.\"Didn't she just know it? Anna let herself in the front door, noting that the paint on the porch was starting to crack and peel.Replacing the furnace the month before had taken just about her last dime of discretionary income—not that she had much of that, as she tried to shore up her faltering business amid scandal and chicanery. The house needed a new roof, which was going to cost more than buying a brand-new car.\"Now listen,\" Tracy went on in her ear as Anna opened the door to her apartment to set down her laptop, Conan on her heels. \"I told you I've got several fabulous potential buyers on the hook with both the cash and the interest in a great old Victorian on the coast. You need to think about it, Anna. I mean it.\"\"I guess I didn't realize there was such a market for big black holes these day.\"Tracy laughed. \"When you have enough money, no hole is too big or too black.\"And when you had none, even a pothole could feel like an insurmountable obstacle. Anna swallowed another sigh. \"I appreciate the offer and your help finding a tenant for the attic apartment.\"\"But you're not interested in selling.\" Tracy's voice was resigned.\"Not right now.\"\"You're as stubborn as Abigail was. I'm telling you, Anna, you're sitting on a gold mine.\"\"I know.\" She sat down in Abigail's favorite armchair. \"But for now it's my gold mine. Mine and Sage's.\"\"All right, but when you change your mind, you know where to find me. And I want you to call me after you meet our Lieutenant Maxwell.\"As far as Anna was concerned, the man wasn'touranything. Tracy was welcome to him. \"Thanks again for dealing with the details of the rental agreement,\" she answered. \"I'll let you know how things are going in a week or two. 'Bye, Tracy.\"She ended the call and set down her phone, then leaned her head back against the floral upholstery. Conan sat beside her and, like the master manipulator he was, nudged one of her hands off the armrest and onto his head.She scratched him between the ears for a moment, trying to let the peace she usually found at Brambleberry House seep through her. After a few moments—just when her eyelids were drifting closed—Conan slid away from her and moved to the door. He planted his haunches there and watched her expectantly.\"Yeah, I know, already,\" she grumbled. \"I plan to go upstairs and say hello. I don't need you nagging me about it. I just need a minute to work up to it.\"Still, she climbed out of the chair. After a check in the mirror above the hall tree, she did a quick repair of her French twist, grabbed Conan's leash off the hook by the door and put it on him, then headed up the stairs to meet her new neighbor.As she trailed her fingers on the railing worn smooth by a hundred years of Dandridge hands, she reviewed what she knew about the man. Though Tracy had handled the details, Anna knew Lieutenant Maxwell had impeccable references.He was an army helicopter pilot who had just served two tours of duty in the Middle East. He was currently on medical leave, recovering from injuries sustained in a hard landing in the midst of enemy fire.He was single, thirty-five years old and willing to pay a great deal of money to rent her attic for only a few months.When Tracy told her his background, Anna wanted to reduce the rent. She was squeamish about charging full price to an injured war veteran, but he refused to accept any concession.Fine, she thought now as she paused on the third-floor landing. But she could still be gracious and welcoming to the man and hope that he would find the healing and peace at Brambleberry House that she usually did.Outside his door, the scent of freesia curled around her and she closed her eyes for a moment, missing Abigail with a fierce ache. Conan didn't let her wallow in it. He gave a sharp bark and started wagging his tail furiously.With a sigh, Anna knocked on the door. A moment later, it swung open and she forgot all about being kind and welcoming.Tracy had told the God's-honest truth.Yum.Lieutenant Maxwell was tall—perhaps six-two—with hair the color of aged whiskey and chiseled, lean features. He wore a burgundy cotton shirt and faded jeans with a small, fraying hole below the knee.He had a small scar on the ...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 22.0}

Then an injury forces them to prolong their stay. When a girl, Mora, finds a pony wandering the beach, Alec and the stallion are drawn into a mystery involving a kelpie. At first, he dismisses the tales about these shape-shifters but when Mora disappears, his search for her leads him and the horse into a deadly struggle to save her from this legendary creature. This is a carefully crafted novel, with Irish legend and daily life woven throughout. The suspense builds slowly but steadily. The lightly drawn characters support the story line, and Mora is typical of many girls whose greatest wish is to have a horse of their own.

First published in 1911, the story is (as the translators note) Pinocchio in reverse, with the main character, Perela, being made of light smoke rather than heavy wood. Appearing from nowhere at the age of 33, this strange man becomes an instant celebrity in the unnamed realm where he finds himself, taking the countryside and the king by storm. Caught up in an almost religious fervor, government officials ask Perela to reform their legal code, hailing his arrival as the beginning of a golden age of justice and harmony. Eventually, though, the fervor dies and people turn against their erstwhile messiah, bringing him to trial. The only defense he offers is his claim that \"I am light.\" This theme makes Palazzeschi's work a haunting precursor to that of Milan Kundera and others who have explored the theme of lightness and being. Its deft social commentary and irony have been well-preserved in translation. The introduction by the translators, both on the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley, provides a valuable context.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bull began his writing career as an ad and book jacket writer for Word Books, where he was privileged to interview notables like Jeb Magruder – refugee from President Nixon’s Watergate scandal, and 1960s hoodlum-turned-civil rights activist Eldridge Cleaver, as well as authors who had come back from the dead. He worked as an ad agency copywriter, convenience store clerk, high school teacher, construction worker, TV weatherman, radio announcer, apprentice cook under a world-class chef, waiter, bread delivery man, speech writer for a state legislator, branch manager for a national stock brokerage firm and financial advisor. Bull moved to California in 1982 to study parapsychology in the unique masters program at JFK University.  Bull was business editor and columnist for the FRESNO WEEKLY newspaper, and he co-hosted the nationally syndicated WEBMASTER RADIO SHOW, an interview show that featured the giants of the high tech world during the climax of the Dot-Com bubble. He is currently a financial advisor, a columnist for THE FRESNO BEE, and a sometimes announcer for KVPR – national public radio in Fresno.

I am so impressed I can barely find the words. Well I can find them; I just don’t have time for that lengthy a review because I’m on deadline. But I will say this: I predict this will be THE book that is used in art schools/colleges and will endure as being such. I am not even half of the way through and I’ve learned so much already (including what mistakes I’ve already made with at least one client). The client questionnaire (on pages 32-33) alone is worth the price of admission.      As I began to read, my first impression was that it is beautifully written and eloquent. My other first impression is how thorough, thoroughly informative, instructive and hugely helpful it is to anyone trying to fulfill the needs of the professional logo designer. Jack Gernsheimer has offered what seems to be all he knows, all his secrets, all that it took to make him the consummate professional designer he is. It strikes me as gift he is giving the world (at least the graphic design world). It’s as though he is passing on his very essence - all he has ever learned and done - for generations to come, really for the ages. Reading this is as good as taking a top level college course in logo and graphic design. It is written through a voice that quite resembles a sage elder-statesman college professor. But it is also written with warmth and almost an avuncular human touch. It’s as though you feel the presence and support of someone who really cares that you succeed and will hold your hand through the process.      I have been readingDesigning Logos – The Process Of Creating Symbols That Endurevery slowly, trying to absorb the enormous amount of essential information, and yet I can’t wait to get to the end, to get to all that awaits me. Oh, did I mention that the book’s page layout and overall design is beautiful? This is a gorgeous book and one I will treasure. Highly recommended!

Claire, 30-something, is wealthy and well connected; Henry, who's in his late 40s, eats junk food and dresses badly. What they share is a keen desire to find the fiend who neatly cut the throat of Beth Valentine, a young party girl, and to stop a serial killer from slaughtering another victim. After a somewhat sluggish start, the pace picks up as Claire demonstrates that her rich-girl persona brings more than pearls and Prada to the mix—the girl has a positive talent for connecting with sleazy Hollywood types. If the repartee between the two sometimes lacks fizz, that may be because Claire's distracted by her attractive and enigmatic neighbor while Henry seems to have left his heart at homicide. Solid plotting and characterization bode well for any future sleuthing adventures featuring this incongruous pair.(July)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Anders, Distinguished Professor 2009-05-21)\"Grant and Fisher’s book talks to teachers, not just sharing the current research but actually drawing connections between research and practice. The authors use their own extensive teaching experience to take the reader into the classrooms of exceptional teachers and present scenarios of how to teach science concepts in engaging, motivating, and research-based ways. At last we have a book that recognizes that science teachers are not reading teachers, but they are promoters of science literacy, communicators of their field whose ultimate goal is to inform, enlighten, and foster strategic thinkers who have the potential to take our society to even greater heights.\"(Karen D. Wood, Professor and Graduate Reading Program Coordinator 2009-05-21)\"Finally, a book that uses real ideas about science literacy and shares those in interesting and informative ways. The idea that science teachers are teachers of language—instead of the usual argument of reading—brings literacy to the forefront in using instructional routines that fit the context of science. Grant and Fisher understand that there is more to science instruction than just the content.\"(Julia Reynolds, Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction 2009-05-22)\"Students of science need both content knowledge and discipline-specific literacy skills to participate in rigorous science content.

It is the equivalent of water skiing while juggling chain saws--impressive if successful, a bloody mess if not. Thankfully for readers and author alike, R. G. Chandler managed to ski the course scarred, but mostly unscathed.Surviving Xcarion is a mix of a moody, under-class thriller with a sci-fi alien invasion. Blues music played with ray guns. Chandler's novel starts with the moody thriller as Rheannon, a back-street young woman with an addiction to needles and blues guitar, has her world fill with unknown threats while she herself is being pursued for ...what? Rheannon doesn't know, we don't know, and the chase is on.When the sci-fi element is first introduced, my first reaction was a distinct, 'Uh oh.' I worried that I   had run across another book where a writer had tried to jam two ideas into one novel. But the result is quite good, saved by two crucial factors. One, Chandler can write--there is a strong hint of Raymond Chandler to R.G. Chandler; and second, the author manages to keep the focus on the characters rather than the shiny things that go beep. In sum, a trip from alleys to planets that is well worth taking. -San Francisco Book Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is the product of decades of   work: reading liturgical manuscripts, discussing them, teaching them.  Its strength is not only in many historical insights into the religious  culture of medieval England, but in its assured usefulness as an  essential reference book for medieval historians of religion, Anglo-Saxonists, historians of music and liturgy. Early Reformation scholars will also find it a necessary tool in evaluating English  religious life on the eve of Reformation.\" Miri Rubin, Queen Mary,  University of London'... this book is a valuable and important work ... it is commendable in presenting church history as not only led from the top by bishops and cathedrals, but shaped at the bottom by those who used the books.\" -Church Times\"Pfaff's prose is clear, frequently humorous, and free of academic jargon.' Times Literary Supplement\"This study of regular formal public worship in England c600-1535 is a work of immense scholarship and the fruit of decades of research.\" -Jane E.A.Dawson, The Expository Times\"a wide-ranging, yet detailed, survey of the liturgy in medieval England approached primarily through surviving liturgical books, written by a scholar of quite exceptionally wide experience of the books and of earlier commentaries on them. Thus it will be a gold mine to the expert liturgiologist...It will also serve as a guide to all medievalists who have to come to terms with liturgical evidence; to them it is an answer to prayer...To cover the whole story in this manner from the age of Bede to the eve of the Reformation in a single volume is a tour de force.\" -Christopher N. L. Brooke, Speculum\"The book will serve for many as a standard reference; its self-contained chapters and ample cross-referencing are designed to facilitate this kind of use... As the first comprehensive survey [of what can be known about liturgical observance in England], the book will be an invaluable resource to many scholars who will be able to avail themselves of Pfaff's vast knowledge.\" -Katherine Zieman, Journal of British Studies\"[a] magisterial overview... This is the book that it has been Richard Pfaff's to write, and it has grown out of forty years of work on the primary manuscripts. It should find a hungry audience...it will become the essential work of reference for Medievalists seeking to understand the changing forms of Christian worship in England\" -James Willoughby, The Library\"Pfaff is to be congratulated on an excellent and informative work which will be an essential companion to medieval liturgical study for many years to come.\" -Gordon Jeanes, Anaphora\"Magisterial is a word often debased by overuse, but one can think of no other characterization for this book, despite its remarkable modesty of tone.  It will be teaching medievalists interested in the liturgy for many, many years.\" -Milton McC.

When Molly, Albo's wife, sees the diary of one of his accusers detailing their encounter, Molly orders him from their home at gun point. With his life falling apart, the academic devotes himself to proving that he was set up, with smarmy TA Buddy Elder, the boyfriend of one of the co-eds, as his prime suspect. Albo's troubles only get worse after one of the women disappears, a possible victim of foul play. Smith (The Painted Messiah) writes smoothly, but many readers will tire of the disagreeable Albo early on. (Feb.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

That's why this third volume in the continuing series (after The Crown Jewels and House of Shards) about Majistral, the Number One-rated allowed burglar in the Human Constellation, is such an amusing find. In this adventure, Majistral is taking a vacation from burglary and is spending his leisure time on Earth. Unfortunately, no one believes he is not on the planet to steal something. His unusual profession does not deter several women from suing for his hand, including Roberta, the Dutchess of Benn, and Nicole, an intergalactic celebrity. They are both attractive women (and relatively intriguing characters), and what would be a most pleasant dilemma for Majistral is only overshadowed by the deadly duels to which his wealthy hosts keep challenging him. Moreover, his unswervingly loyal Khosalisk servant, Roman, is in a rotten mood because he's molting. But it is not until his father's coffin?from which the deceased manages to retain a tenuous grasp on current events?is stolen that things really become absurd. The plot moves briskly from underwater palaces to holy Graceland (a marvelously silly land practically overflowing with Elvii of all species, genders and sizes), and the whirlwind pace helps keep the novel entertaining, if not intellectually overtaxing.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It should be useful to students learning about the cultures of the ancient world as well as to teachers in allied specialties. Both length and price are just right.”— Jack M. SassonVanderbilt University“Schneider’s state-of-the-art introduction is bound to become a standard textbook on Mesopotamian religion.”— Karel van der ToornUniversity of Amsterdam“Scholars of the ancient Near East have only recently begun to attempt syntheses of their material for the public. Not only does Tammi Schneider take the very complicated topic of Mesopotamian religion and make it understandable to the beginning student, but she also provides a solid framework for understanding the wider context of the Judeo-Christian religious traditions. In addition, her detailed and erudite notes will help the reader who is interested in pursuing further research on the subject of comparative religions. She is to be commended!”— Mark W.

Despite this aggravating behavior, her parents always encouraged her love of literature and her dream to write. Michelle is a hopeless romantic and an insatiable people watcher. Currently she is a stay-at-home mom where she cares for her three children, who are at once adorable and exasperating. In the midst of the domestic whirlwind that is her life, she enjoys crafting, cooking, art, and reading. Despite these other hobbies, Michelle’s brain is always set to writing mode.  Sometimes she mutes the talking characters in her head, but they’re always there, waiting for her to set them free. http://novels-and-novelties.blogspot.com/ https://www.facebook.com/MichelleLPennington http://twitter.com/#!/MLLPennington", "related": ["B00IQ7T98I"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From the depths of poverty during the Depression to standing alone firing at Japanese bombers during the attack at Pearl Harbor to eleven spine-jarring submarine war patrols during WWII. Wounded in Vietnam. Counter espionage work at the American embassy in Prague during the Cold War. Avoided daily assassination attempts by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.

Moore attempts nothing less than a synoptic account of the ways in which leading philosophers since Descartes have viewed metaphysics. But the book is not a survey: a strong narrative thread, plus a novel and powerful conception of the task of metaphysics, links Moore's discussion of such diverse thinkers as Hume, Kant, Frege, Nietzsche, Lewis and Deleuze (to take only a few examples) into a coherent picture of the development of the subject. The book is written with Moore's customary clarity and panache, full of penetrating insights, lucid exposition of difficult ideas, and provocative challenges to the conventional wisdom. There will be something here to stimulate everyone interested in metaphysics, whatever their philosophical background. The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics is a quite unique work: original, bold, and fascinating.\"- Tim Crane, University of Cambridge\"Not since Russell's History of Western Philosophy has a major Anglophone thinker attempted to make accessible sense of the many kinds of obscurity that philosophers have contrived to produce in their efforts to write under the title of 'metaphysics.' Russell's book hails from a generation which was famously dismissive of everything it called 'continental' in philosophy. Among the many achievements of A. W. Moore's remarkable book is that it shows why we can leave that behind us. The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics should make a real contribution to the formation of a philosophical culture better informed of its history and no longer riven by absurd and absurdly simplistic divisions.\"- Simon Glendinning, European Institute, London School of Economics\"One might fairly say that Adrian Moore's telling of the story of The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics represents a truly monumental achievement, as extraordinary in the generosity of its scope and the breadth of its learning  as it is in its sensitivity to the many possibly shifting nuances of its own self-expression. But if the term 'monumental' is suggestive of something carved out of heavily immovable stone, it would be utterly misleading.  Moore, no mean meta-metaphysician himself, constantly challenges his readers to join him and his exceptionally varied cast of fellow seekers after meaningfulness in thinking always anew as to what sense there may be to the deeply human project of 'making sense of things' -and about why such sense as may be there to be found, may turn out not to be statable in terms of truth-seeking propositions. It is a story that makes for an inevitably long and at times undeniably strenuous read; but the effort is infinitely worthwhile.\"- Alan Montefiore, London School of Economics\"Ambitious\" is a word that crosses one's mind as one reads A.W. Moore's The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics: Making Sense of Things.... The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics represents an extremely impressive achievement. It largely succeeds at a dauntingly difficult task, and should become one of the go-to books for graduate students preparing for prelims. It can also serve as a useful reference work one can dip into for refreshers or guidance into unexplored territory. Finally, it stands as indisputable evidence that the barriers separating contemporary philosophers only do so with our support.\"-Lee Braver, Hiram College, Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews\"...an unusual book.... Those who know the history of modem philosophy, plus a good part of recent professional commentary, may find some insightful, always learned exposition and critical appraisal.

I have a degree in Early Childhood Education from Kennesaw State University.  I teach Pre School part time and write the other part along with taking care of my family and the house, so not a lot of spare time. I have been married to a wonderful man for ten years.  We have two amazing children ages eight and five.  Most of the time my life is a mix of chaos and complete nonsense that is both invigorating and exhausting.  In short I absolutely love it! I was born in Dalton, Ga.  I still live in Georgia in the little town I grew up in.  Although I always said I wouldn’t stay, I just couldn’t leave it. I write because I enjoy it.  It allows me to escape from the normality of life and weave romantic stories the way I choose.  I love strong men with a soft center, just like a tootsie pop.  I admit that some of my heroines are sappy, but I also like strong quippy women as well.   I like to vary my characters in attitude and personality, so you never know what you might get when you open one of my books. I admit that when I started writing I thought it was crazy how authors said that their characters ‘speak to them,’ but now I understand.  The story unfolds in the mind and the characters build themselves and the events in the story.  So… I really don’t know exactly what will happen in the story until it is finished.  Of course I have an idea of what I want, but it may or may not turn out that way in the end.   I enjoy hearing from you.  I do read emails and I try my best to reply if necessary.  I would love to hear your ideas and all about the types of books you enjoy most.  Who knows, you may give me a great new book idea?   amandaanderson2@tds.net", "related": ["B00E3LZF9I"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.2857, "rating_total": 30.0}

She is a native of this area and is tied to the Smoky Mountains through her maternal grandparents (John Marion Sparks and Elizabeth Shuler) who lived in Cades Cove, Tenn., now part of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Palmer is dedicated to preserving the history and cultural heritage of those who lived in all the various communities that became GSMNP. She is working on a series of books that will tell stories of individuals who lived in the Smokies, how they made their living, how bad things sometimes happened, some through no fault of their own, others through consequences brought on by choices they made. This first volume tells of how the Park came into being, how individuals who owned the land reacted to the state taking their land for a national park, who fought the takeover and the result, how Park personnel shaped and managed the area, how it's doing now and how it might do in the future. The Smokies have been a coveted land, first by Native Americans, then by European settlers and their descendents and by the U. S. Government. No wonder many of those living in this area in the early 1900s dragged their feet, not wanting to give up the homes they'd fashioned out of the wilderness. And yet, many of those same individuals have said they were glad their beloved land is now part of a national park, preserved so that all can visit and enjoy.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bobby, by way of these study guides, has taken this teaching and delivered it to the person in the pew. I am unaware of any other tool that so thoroughly and practically helps Christians understand God’s plan for the local church. I can’t wait to use these studies in my own congregation.”—Jeramie Rinne, Senior Pastor, South Shore Baptist Church, Hingham, Massachusetts“Bobby Jamieson has done local church pastors an incredible service by writing these study guides. Clear, biblical, and practical, they introduce the biblical basis for a healthy church. But more importantly, they challenge and equip church members to be part of the process of improving their own church’s health. The studies work for individual, small group, and larger group settings. I have used them for the last year at my own church and appreciate how easy they are to adapt to my own setting. I don’t know of anything else like them. Highly recommended!”—Michael Lawrence, Senior Pastor, Hinson Baptist Church, Portland, Oregon; author,Biblical Theology in the Life of the Church“This is a Bible study that is actually rooted in the Bible and involves actual study. In the9Marks Healthy Church Study Guides Seriesa new standard has been set for personal theological discovery and corresponding personal application. Rich exposition, compelling questions, and clear syntheses combine to give a guided tour of ecclesiology—the theology of the church. I know of no better curriculum for generating understanding of and involvement in the church than this. It will be a welcome resource in our church for years to come.”—Rick Holland, Senior Pastor, Mission Road Bible Church, Prairie Village, Kansas“In America today we have the largest churches in the history of our nation, but the least amount of impact for Christ’s kingdom. Slick marketing and finely polished vision statements are a foundation of sand. The9Marks Healthy Church Study Guides Seriesis a refreshing departure from church-growth materials, towards an in-depth study of God’s Word that will equip God’s people with his vision for his Church. These study guides will lead local congregations to abandon secular methodologies for church growth and instead rely on Christ’s principles for developing healthy, God-honoring assemblies.”—Carl J. Broggi, Senior Pastor, Community Bible Church, Beaufort, South Carolina; President, Search the Scriptures Radio Ministry“Anyone who loves Jesus will love what Jesus loves. The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus loves the church. He knows about and cares for individual churches and wants them to be spiritually healthy and vibrant. Not only has Jesus laid down his life for the church but he has also given many instructions in his Word regarding how churches are to live and function in the world. This series of Bible studies by 9Marks shows how Scripture teaches these things. Any Christian who works through this curriculum, preferably with other believers, will be helped to see in fresh ways the wisdom, love, and power of God in establishing the church on earth. These studies are biblical, practical, and accessible. I highly recommend this curriculum as a useful tool that will help any church embrace its calling to display the glory of God to a watching world.”—Thomas Ascol,Senior Pastor, Grace Baptist Church of Cape Coral, Florida; Executive Director, Founders Ministries", "related": [], "rank": 324358, "title": "Reaching the Lost: Evangelism (9Marks: Healthy Church Study Guides)", "author": "Bobby Jamieson", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I am happy that they have enlisted a superb team to produce a helpful book that will truly serve those thinking of global involvement in mission.\" (Ajith Fernando, national director, Youth for Christ Sri Lanka )\"Don't look here for a scripted, mapped-out program of how to become a standard-issue missionary. It's packed with practicalities, helping you discover your distinctive part in God's mission. The stories of how others have been finding their way in God's mission means that you are no longer alone in figuring out your own journey. Essential equipment for anyone coaching others to live effectively for God's purposes.\" (Steve Hawthorne, coeditor, Perspectives on the World Christian Movement )\"This book is a unique and special selection of essays and exhortation for anyone interested in global missions. I am amazed at the huge list of contributors, and many of them I know as people who walk the talk. I strongly recommend this book.\" (George Verwer, founder and international director, Operation Mobilisation )\"God is still calling people to serve as missionaries, but this process can be confusing and even intimidating. TheGlobal Mission Handbookdemystifies the call to missions while capably exploring and unpacking its spiritual essence. With sound practical advice and profound insight from a wealth of global voices, I can think of no better preparatory resource for those considering service in the fields that still remain white unto harvest.\" (Jason Mandryk, editor, Operation World )\"It's with great delight that I commend to any pastor, organizational leader or trainer, missionary candidate, or missions executive the bookGlobal Mission Handbook.The authors--Steve Hoke and Bill Taylor--are among the most experienced, respected and beloved missions practitioners of our generation, and they truly provide a serious, comprehensive guide for crosscultural service. The handbook divides the missionary preparation process into ten phases to guide the missionary-hopeful through the rigors of the many steps to the field. Nothing like this handbook exists to date, and it fills a huge hole in the missionary training process for churches, schools and agencies alike. It is my prayer that thousands of copies are used in the coming years to guide the next generation preparing for missionary service to honor God with their lives.\" (Dr. Monroe Brewer, president, The National Association of Missions Pastors, and director of Church Connections, CrossGlobal Link, Wheaton, Illinois )\"Do you want go somewhere and do something that counts for God? If so, this book will help you count the cost and weigh your options. It's practical, it's wise, and it's passionate!\" (Floyd McClung, All Nations, Cape Town, South Africa )\"There is no other resource equal to theGlobal Mission Handbook. The combination of topics, authors and approaches stands alone as a comprehensive compendium related to crosscultural action.Global Mission Handbook guides the reader through stages of preparation and involvement--all toward the goal of helping each reader investigate and discover the unique ways that we belong in serving the world in Jesus' name. I recommend it to every person who wants something larger out of life--a sense of understanding where we fit in God's global purposes.\" (Paul Borthwick, senior consultant, Development Associates International )\"This is not a book to be read in one sitting; it is richly and profoundly more. It brings innumerable specialists together, producing what in my opinion has never previously been written. It is a comprehensive reference guide for those who seek global service for Christ. Spectacular!\" (Ralph D. Winter, general director, Frontier Mission Fellowship )\"We want the world to know Jesus, but how? Here's a book to show the way. It sparkles, it encourages, it informs, and it makes the steps to get there not so impossible to take. You can make a difference, and this book can be a pivotal part!\" (Patrick Johnstone, author, Operation World )", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I have a degree in Early Childhood Education from Kennesaw State University.  I teach Pre School part time and write the other part along with taking care of my family and the house, so not a lot of spare time. I have been married to a wonderful man for ten years.  We have two amazing children ages eight and five.  Most of the time my life is a mix of chaos and complete nonsense that is both invigorating and exhausting.  In short I absolutely love it! I was born in Dalton, Ga.  I still live in Georgia in the little town I grew up in, Jasper.  Although I always said I wouldn’t stay, I just couldn’t leave it. I write because I enjoy it.  It allows me to escape from the normality of life and weave romantic stories the way I choose.  I love strong men with a soft center, just like a tootsie pop.  I admit that some of my heroines are sappy, but I also like strong quippy women as well.   I like to vary my characters in attitude and personality, so you never know what you might get when you open one of my books. I admit that when I started writing I thought it was crazy how authors said that their characters ‘speak to them,’ but now I understand.  The story unfolds in the mind and the characters build themselves and the events in the story.  So… I really don’t know exactly what will happen in the story until it is finished.  Of course I have an idea of what I want, but it may or may not turn out that way in the end.   I enjoy hearing from you.  I do read emails and I try my best to reply if necessary.  I would love to hear your ideas and all about the types of books you enjoy most.  Who knows, you may give me a great new book idea?   amandaanderson2@tds.net Visit me on the web too amandaandersonbooks.com", "related": ["B00IFRN0VG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The storyline of Callie and Daniel is believable and\nhad me reaching for tissues a few times. She wrote an\nexceptional story of two people who needed healing inside and with the love and\nhelp of each other they were able to make that commitment.... Ms. Marell has created an\namazing work that truly shines. This book is a winner!~Sheryl atEcataromance  -5 starsSomething Worth Fighting For is a tender, delightfully\nprofound contemporary tale that tugs at the heartstrings. I fell in love with Daniel and his emotionally torn\ncharacter.. The relationship between Daniel and Callie was\nso extraordinary, tender, sweet but so sensually delicious.  Alexandra Marell gave me\nsomething to think about in this story and characters who have endeared\nthemselves to me but mostly I think this author has done a fabulous job of\nbalancing out the emotions and the relationships that occur.

Besides, the CEO of the other company took quite a shine to Rebecca at their last meeting.  Businessman that he is, Gabe contacts Rebecca and suggests a deal.  She'll play the loving wife for a week, and he'll cough up seed money for her planned daycare center.  But Rebecca drives a harder bargain.  She'll agree to Gabe's plan only if he agrees to donate sperm so she can have the baby she's always wanted: his baby. Gabe's sure he can keep his emotions out of the deal, so he agrees.  But from the minute he watches Reb emerge topless from his grandmother's swimming pool, Gabe finds he's in way over his head.  And Rebecca intends to keep him that way.  If only she can remind him of what they've both been missing before they say goodbye forever.Reconciliation -- with a great new twist!

Robeson’s life as a touring concert singer, musical stage performer (Show Boat), as well as dramatic actor (Othello) are, of course, well detailed, but Lubasch goes beyond these facts to depict Robeson’s personal life with honesty and a keen perspective, describing him as a committed humanitarian, generous friend, and complex individual. Robeson excelled in college and in athletics, rose above pointed racial prejudice, navigated a somewhat challenging marriage, devoted himself to continuous learning, and cultivated a wide network of associations on an international level. His staunch advocacy for equality and human rights on a larger scale, as well as his support of the Soviet Union during the McCarthy era drew negative attention that damaged his professional career and personal life and ultimately contributed to his failing health.VERDICTThis thoughtful and well-researched work examines the core of Robeson’s character and his often delicate relationships with the social, cultural, and political issues of his era. It will have profound appeal for both academic and general audiences.(Library Journal)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I immigrated to Africa with my parents when I was 5, completed my studies and graduated as a Mechanical Engineer in the University of Lagos.I got married to my University sweetheart and returned to the United Kingdom in 1986 to complete my postgraduate training at Goldsmith University.For the next 13 years I taught Electronics and Design & Technology; after which I established Dynamic Words Discipleship College (a training institute for Christians who want to deepen their walk with God. My wife and I presently lead The King's House - (aka London's Alive Church).I have written several inspirational books, manuals and training materials, and continue to give my services as a marriage counsellor and motivational coach.How long have you been writing? I wrote and published my first book in 1985 after my wife and I had a traumatic experience at the birth of our first child. So I think it is fair to say that I started writing seriously in 1985.Tell us about your book. Say Goodbye to Dating... isn't suggesting that every form of dating is wrong or inappropriate. It is simply trying to show the reader that the modern form and purpose of dating isn't really doing what it's purposed to do. In fact, it is doing quite the opposite. It is turning undiscerning young people into liars, cheats and promise breakers.What made you write this book? My wife and I had a turbulent relationship when we first got together, but have since both learnt to slow down, grow up and draw closer. Now, we have an awesome marriage and a desire to help other experience what we have. That's why I have been writing books onmarriage and relationshipfor years.  Some of my other books include:HOW TO BUILD A ROCK SOLID MARRIAGE, TEN KEYS TO EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION IN MARRIAGE, HOW TO RESCUE YOUR MARRIAGE FROM BREAKING UP, UNDERSTAND YOUR MARRIAGE VOWS, MAXIMISING YOUR SEASON OF SINGLENESS, and SAY GOODBYE TO DATING.Was it easy for you to write or did you ever get writers block? I find it fairly easy to write from my heart. And, I've learnt to take a break and find something else to do when I experience writers block.What age is your target for this book? I'd say the book is targeting anyone in a serious relationship - from 16 and upward.Have you always seen yourself as becoming a writer? No. I studied Engineering precisely because I preferred figures and making things instead of writing or reading long prose. But I love teaching, and one way to get my message across is to write.Do you write full-time or do you have another job as well? I have a full time job as a minister - shepherding people. I am the principle of a Dynamic Words Discipleship College. And, I teach & lecture in my spare time.How long did it take you to finish this book? Not very long! I don't like fat padded books myself. So when I write, I like to keep it simple, precise and to the point. When I need to use stories, I keep them to a minimum. I leave the waffle to language majors.Do you have a Facebook fan page or Twitter account for your fans to follow you on?You can find me on face book:facebook.com/apeters60", "related": [], "rank": 2561710, "title": "FIND YOUR SOUL MATE THE GODLY WAY: And Say Goodbye To The Dating Game (Rock Solid Marriage Series)", "author": "Tony Peters", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When Marva Malin, the drama teacher at an exclusive Manhattan prep school, is found strangled in the auditorium, Liz is on the scene searching for clues. The fact that no one is upset about Malin's death indicates that suspects will be abundant. Liz's fiance, homicide detective Ike Eichle, interviews witnesses and searches for the weapon, while Liz divides her time between work and planning their upcoming wedding. When members of an al-Qaeda cell kidnap her, hoping to exchange her for their leader, who is imprisoned in Iraq, Liz finds a link between one of her captors and the crime at the school. The plot is a bit far-fetched, but it is very timely, and Liz and her friends make good company.

Epstein, Landes, and Posner go beyond the artificial divisions amongst these fields, and show how their different perspectives can be combined into a powerful model that not only makes enormous sense theoretically, but is backed by a mountain of data across all levels of the federal judiciary. I have little doubt that, in the years to come, this book will be seen as having begun a new type of scholarship on judicial behavior and institutions. (Mitu Gulati, Duke University School of Law)The Behavior of Federal Judgessets out to be the definitive book on the subject of judicial behavior. The authors establish a new mainstream in this exciting field—a unified model of judicial behavior that incorporates legal, economic, and political perspectives. There is no question that this book is a major work, providing both a benchmark and an agenda for future work. (William H. J. Hubbard, University of Chicago Law School)[The Behavior of Federal Judges] provides the most comprehensive and detailed empirical analysis yet of the role played by ideology and political affiliation in judicial decision making...It collects and analyzes a daunting amount of data. (Adam LiptakNew York Times2012-11-26)The most detailed and elaborate quantitative analysis of the federal judiciary to date... [The authors] show that the role of judicial ideology gets a lot bigger as we move up the judicial hierarchy...Epstein,Landes, andPosnerhave produced the best and most comprehensive study of judicial behavior by reference to quantitative measures and statistical analysis. Their book will almost certainly define the field for many years to come...Epstein, Landes, and Posner have performed an important service in establishing the truths, and the limits, of both legalism and realism.

They were given nursing training before boarding a steamship to cross the ocean in March 1918, going to war on behalf of the United States and The Salvation Army.  Within two weeks of arrival, Salvationists 132 men and 109 women raised canteens and began serving American soldiers. They established a courier service, nursed the wounded, hauled water and wrote letters for the injured.   They were charged by their commander in that much greater art, the art of dealing ably with human life in all its varying conditions and phrases, wrote Lettie Gavin in American Women in World War I: They Also Served.  With guitars in hand, the McAllister sisters performed for the troops, set broken bones and immunized for tetanus, but they became known for a simple luxury while at war the doughnut.   They made do with the simplest of supplies a grape juice bottle for rolling pin, tin cans to cut the shape, a coffee percolator tube to make the hole. The day a line of 800 from the 26th Division lined up for the first 150 [doughnuts], they knew they had found their calling, Judy Vaughn wrote in The Bells of San Francisco. The young girls, both in their mid-20s, were undaunted in their service to the soldiers, as a November 10, 1918, New York Tribune article records: Yesterday Captain Violet McAllister and her sister, Lieutenant Alice McAllister, took possession of what less than twenty-four hours before had been a German canteen. Above the entrance a large sign reads: Kamerad Tritt ein. ...The girls brought with them three tons of supplies which were unloaded while the village was still under shell fire. While water was heating in preparation of hot chocolate, Captain Violet McAllister requisitioned a soldier to knock the head off a barrel of flour and was soon busily kneading up a big batch of dough for doughnuts.  Alice McAllister kept a diary of her experience, presented here with clarification from Mildred Mendell (the McAllister s niece) after a first transcription by William Francis. According to The Salvation Army s officer records, Alice McAllister served on the front lines in France from March 31 to November 1, 1918, and again from February 8 to September 26, 1919.  Upon her return from the war, Alice McAllister served as a corps assistant in Philadelphia before her commissioning in May 1920 and appointment as the Philadelphia No. 11 corps officer. She was transferred to Trenton, N.J., in June 1921, and moved to the Western Territory in August 1923 where she worked in the women s social office before being named corps officer of the San Francisco No. 1 Corps.  In March 1927, Alice resigned as a Salvation Army officer to marry Frank Baugh. They eventually moved to Placer County, Calif., where later Alice died on August 25, 1980.", "related": [], "rank": 2048344, "title": "The Doughnut Sweethearts", "author": "Alice McAllister", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They are teaching us religion, one student complains,when we need IT. Drawing on her experience as an American journalist in the Saudi kingdom from 2008 to 2011, Ms Murphy depicts a generation subject to a host of new influences, from the internet to the Arab spring, yet trapped in a society of stultifying conformity. Young Saudis want change, but not revolution. They want jobs, affordable homes and sports clubs. They suffer from boredom, depression, obesity and drug abuse. They adhere to Islam, but are less respectful of the clerics than their elders are. Young women increasingly demand the right to work and to choose their husbands.The youth has started thinking,a student tells her.Before,thinking was something forbidden. --The Economist - January 26, 2013Veteran journalist Caryle Murphy presents a nuanced portrait of Saudi youth and explains the challenge they pose to the government and society of a pivotal economic and regional power...[She] does not foresee an end to the monarchy or rejection of the country s conservative Islamic faith and traditions. But she does predict more pressure for acceptance of individuality, growing rejection of official interpretations of Islam and increasing demands for economic justice...Overall, Murphy predicts a challenging future for a pivotal Arab and regional state. --Barbara Slavin in Al-Monitor - Jan 7, 2013Murphy, who lived in and reported from Saudi Arabia between 2008 and 2011, conducted in-depth interviews with 83 twenty-something year-old Saudis. Representing a broad cross-section of society and geographic diversity across the country, the interviewees candidly discuss with Murphy their views on religion and politics, the always touchy subject of gender relations, their career hopes, and how they see their country evolving in the next decade.  One thing that comes across clearly in the interviews is a growing impatience with the status quo. Connectivity to the rest of the world is encouraging critical thinking, and leading to doubts among Saudi youth. As one interviewee puts it, everyone is questioning everything. --Isobel Coleman, Council on Foreign Relations, March 20, 2013", "related": [], "rank": 1711863, "title": "A Kingdom's Future", "author": "Caryle Murphy", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Finding an escape from the outside world by creating one of his own became his greatest gift. He believes that the ability to create a story out of nothing isn't just a gift but a miracle and it's a miracle he believes was given to him. In a time where everything is being remade, he also believes creativity is at an all time low and so now he has stepped up to bring creativity back to a world that's just sticking to used up ideas.  Anthony Labson began his writing career attending Nova Southeastern University with The Knight Newspaper as a freelance film critic and being published in the NSU magazine Digressions. After graduating in 2008 he frequently self published poetry and prose on networks and gained momentum from readers. In December of 2011 he realized that he had more to offer so now here he is taking the next step to being a recognized author. He is currently self publishing his works hoping to gain attention from readers everywhere and become a successful author.  He strongly believes that the reboots and the remakes are getting old and cliché. The people want to see something fresh and new, not new versions of old ideas. This is his first step and hopefully you will give him the time to see his works and give your feedback. Enjoy and until the next is written.

Lawyers know it as \"the Great Writ,\" and the myth holds that its availability from time immemorial is the chief reason that Anglophones have long been free.Anthony Gregory here does the estimable service of showing that the Great Writ was not always what we now understand it to be. He also lays out in excruciating, nay shocking, detail the 150-year trend, accelerating in our day, of reducing the Writ's importance.\"--Kevin R. C. Gutzman, Western Connecticut State University, author of James Madison and the Making of America\"In his insightful and timely account of habeas corpus, Anthony Gregory illuminates not only the promise, but also the limitations of what for centuries has been known as the 'Great Writ.'  His treatment of this important subject is both eloquent and persuasive, enhancing our understanding of the relationship between law, power, and human liberty.\"--Jonathan Hafetz, Seton Hall University School of Law, author of Habeas Corpus After 9/11: Confronting America's New Global Detention System\"Habeas Corpus is arguably the most important tool for peacefully repelling tyranny and effectively holding the government accountable for its interferences with personal freedom. It can reduce the government from a gang of armed thugs on its chosen turf to a gaggle of supplicant litigants in a neutral forum. In The Power of Habeas Corpus in America, Anthony Gregory reduces 400 years of Anglo-American legal and political history to a readable, thorough, compelling study of this natural and constitutional right. This book is so well researched and written, it will soon become the bible on all things Habeas Corpus for generations.\"--Hon. Andrew P. Napolitano, Senior Judicial Analyst, author of Theodore and Woodrow: How Two American Presidents Destroyed Constitutional Freedom\"Especially now, as individual rights are increasingly trampled with impunity by the state, Anthony Gregory's combination of engaging historical narrative with astute legal analysis and impassioned moral advocacy provides an overview of issues surrounding the Great Writ that is simply invaluable.\"--Gary Chartier, La Sierra University, author of Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society\"a 'must-have' for judicial and legal studies shelves, worthy of the highest recommendation especially for college and university libraries\"- James A.

Happily married (or at least content) for three years to a perfectly nice man, and through hard work and long hours, she has worked her way to the top of her department in a multi-billion dollar company. Now, she and her colleagues are finding their inner creative cores, and vying for the envied position of Director of European Affairs. Caroline, always sweet and typically downright innocent, is seemingly possessed by her need to be true to herself. What does this mean? Getting up close and personal with her own body in the hotel pool, helping a colleague get over his sexual issues, and becoming free and wild with another colleague in the Spanish countryside? But what does this all mean? It turns out that the leader of this \"conference\" has been looking for one person in particular to help bring down the head of a rival corporation. She needs someone to catch him in a compromising position, and it looks like she's found the red-head who could do it. While there were certainly way more sexual situations than I had anticipated, Shameless Ambition was an interesting mix of head games and flirtation. While I am now absolutely terrified of going anywhere for a conference with my colleagues, it was a truly fascinating story. Robert wrote with an excellent degree of poise and clarity, and nothing ever seemed to cross the boundaries into vulgarity. I quite enjoyed my little romp around Europe. It was a quick and entertaining read for those who aren't afraid to see...or read...about a little skin.", "related": ["B00C781SLS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While Oswald takes off on a humanitarian medical mission, Milagro must escape the subversive clutches of clan weirdo Willem Dunlop and Silas, Willem's \"aide de corpse,\" whose terrifying Project for a New Vampire Century features a juicy sacrificial role for Milagro.

This single volume, epic horror offering is far and away my most ambitious work to date...both in terms of its length and its scope. I'll begin by divulging that the novel's title is a deliberate misnomer.Circle of the Witchis a novel about witchcraft only in the most peripheral sense of the concept...nor is this novel intended to be a scholarly treatise on the subject of ritual magic. The novelisintended to a pure deluge of the elements that make horror such a compelling genre to read. The antagonist is a creature unique in and of itself...worthy of contempt and loathing, but perhaps even more deserving of immense pity for the enormity of the burden it has been forced to carry.Into the fabric of each of my novels, I've attempted to intertwine a prevailing thematic element that would serve as a foundation upon which the novel was built. InCircle of the Witch, I wanted to explore the psychological aspects of the impact of horror on the characters who fall beneath its shadow. Ultimately, horror is an emotion...or more succinctly, an emotional reaction to traumatic external pressures and stimuli. As a writer, this is one of the most enticing aspects of written horror...the portrayal of how characters are altered by the intensity of their experiences. Many of the primary characters in the novel are subjected to harrowing ordeals that radically alter who they are...a stark and poignant affirmation that the human heart is not intransigent...is not unyielding stone that cannot be molded by the cumulative torrent of experience. Those who inadvertently wander into the circle (at least, the few who survive) will emerged radically and irreversibly altered by the events that await them. Therein is the true art of this particular novel...a depiction of the manifestation of change that comes with being subjected to incomprehensible terror. With this intention in mind, I invite readers to step inside theCircle of the Witchand discover the harrowing answer to the question posed in the first paragraph of this page.", "related": ["B004UB8HPU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

McKeaveney was born in Northern Ireland in 1967. She grew up with her parents and five siblings. During the 1970s, 80s and 90s, Northern Ireland was a country blighted by The Troubles, essentially a time of extreme civil unrest and terrorist activity. While this was an era of great upheaval and change in the history of Ireland, for the author it was also a time for growing up, going to school, falling in love and making babies. The Troubles which she experienced had more to do with the search for Mr Right than the fight for civil rights, and the quest for independence was more about leaving home and travelling than about fighting for political freedom. It is widely accepted now that the war in Northern Ireland had a negative impact on a generation of young people, who grew up not knowing what it was like to live in peace time. The extent to which it impacted on that generation, however, remains a matter for individual reflection and comment. The author therefore wishes to acknowledge that the main failures in her life cannot be attributed entirely to growing up in an unstable external environment. The inability to achieve her life long ambition to become an astronaut and work in NASA cannot be blamed entirely on Northern Ireland politics. The author feels that, even if Northern Ireland had developed a working space program, it is highly improbable that she would have managed to pass the space exam or indeed the height restrictions for becoming an astronaut. Suffice to say that the author is not an astronaut but has worked for the Health and Social Services for over twenty five years. She currently lives with her son and her cat in Co Armagh. Away With the Fairies is her first novel.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Teachers can use it as a guide while teaching children in class on how to get started with writing. Teachers can also conduct interactive sessions based on the tips given by the author.Terri Kelley is one of my favorite children's writers as I have had the privilege of reviewing a few of her other children's books as well. She knows exactly how to reach kids and her books are always educational, with some concept or other which is relevant in their growth.", "related": [], "rank": 2314329, "title": "Writing is a Process eBook", "author": "Terri Kelley", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

By no means -- as Ella\nherself insisted -- is she a negative person. Persistent might be a\nbetter word; she is the kind of person you'd ask for directions if you\nwere lost, or provides you with a long chat while waiting in line at the\n grocery store.\"Nobody, and I mean nobody, can nag like I can.\" Written from a first\nperson point of view, protagonist Ella Boudreaux immediately establishes\n one important part of her personality or in her own words -- her unique\n skill set. I hardly raised my eyebrow when she mentioned that\ntelemarketer was her absolute favorite among other jobs before she\nsettled as a bill collector, her true calling. Ella delights in\naccepting her true self, and is from time to time brutally honest about\nher failings and idiosyncrasies. These are enough to put a smile on my\nface and make me chuckle. You will definitely learn some life basics\nfrom Ella in terms of relationships, the prospect of jobs, and\neverything in between.The pacing is faultless, the prose that Barbara Venkataraman uses is\nsimple and the narrative is rather linear, which suits the whole concept\n of the story perfectly. With humor fiction, I either get the humor or I\n don't. As for \"If You'd Just Listened To Me In The First Place,\" I did. A\n quirky and funny short read.", "related": ["B00KRQ0E1M"], "rank": 930259, "title": "If You'd Just Listened to Me in the First Place...: Barbara Venkataraman", "author": "Barbara Venkataraman", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 21.0}

It was that excess that ended his life. A friend, John Garner was preparing to speak and asked me for information on the Hollywood mogul.  The illustration John gave of a life lived without boundaries was thought provoking. It caused me to think of (the-myth-of-more) \"the Mythamohre\" in tangible ways and Thomas' journey was born.Perhaps no matter our age, 15 or 50, we find ourselves in Thomas: the potential of a King with the insecurities of a child. The armor always fits we just don't realize it.  How often do we hear the voice of the Gatekeeper in our own heads giving us warning or advice and we choose to ignore it?  Perhaps because it sounds like our own voice or we reason it away that often times we end up saying to ourselves, \"I knew it, why didn't I listen?\" Whatever name you give that voice, intuition, consciousness or gut-instinct - I believe every person on the planet hears it.  So in that way, I also thought, what if that voice was personified?  With the physical appearance of the Gatekeeper, would it make it any easier to follow him or would we still doubt?  Our lives seem so intertwined it made me think long and hard about Thomas' journey and even my own.  The subtext reveals that: The fate of many rests in the journey of one; at its deepest level I believe that to be true. Do any of us fully realize the significant impact we have on each other? If we could somehow zoom out of the atmosphere and see the chain of events and what our actions mean globally; I think we, like Thomas, would come to realize the journey is worth the cost.There's more to share about Thomas' journey and perhaps I will pick that up in another installment.  I would appreciate hearing from you and the encouragement to carry on Thomas' adventure. If the story inspired you please help me inspire others. The very best way to do that is to get the word out about \"The Mythamohre\" especially if it is good and edifying: post on blogs, write a review on Amazon and other sites. Let pod-casters and broadcasters know about it. I would welcome the opportunity to share the story with larger audiences. You'd be helping me and in turn you'd be helping others... isn't that what it's all about? Thanks for doing that. What started out as a way to share important truth with my children can be used by others to engage conversation and put the focus on what really matters in life... each other.  We can all use encouragement and I hope you find  \"The Mythamohre\" an encouragement to your journey.", "related": [], "rank": 3428604, "title": "The Mythamohre eBook", "author": "Christopher Bessette", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I can only hope that whoever reads my work will be sucked into the little world I've created on the pages. Aside from writing, I love sloths and mythology. I kind of have a thing for vampires, because let's face it, something about the fact that they have to fight the urge to bite your neck and drain the life from you is rather sexy. I have an irrational fear of the zombie apocalypse. I honestly cannot imagine a more horrifying way to go than by being ripped to shreds by a mass of mumbling, decaying, and oozing corpses with clicking teeth. Ugh! I just shuddered typing it. Now the boring basics: I grew up in the south listening to a ton of grunge rock (I'm sure if you read my books you'll be able to guess who my favorite bands are). I wanted to major in theatre and creative writing but my parents refused to let me. They told me those weren't \"reliable professions\". Reliable? I'd just rather do something I enjoy! When I hit 30 I decided to start a bucket list and publishing a book was on the top (followed shortly by meeting a certain celebrity). Proud to report I've accomplished both.  So, here I am with my first novel and working on the second one. The journey of writing Bound to the Fallen has been amazing and allowed me to meet many wonderful individuals. I hope if you read my work that you will enjoy it. After all, writing is the most amazing magic trick of all... it puts the reader in the mind of the writer (kind of creepy if you think about it).
