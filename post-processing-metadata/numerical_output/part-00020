At the moment, both feet felt as if she'd just attempted to run a marathon. And after an extended ceremony, dozens of photos and an hour and a half of socializing, it was no wonder.Still, barring the problematic issues of her attire, Sarah and Brad's wedding had been a success. The decision to hold the ceremony in the enclosed garden behind Sarah's parents' luxurious North Dallas home hadn't gone over well at first. But, with a bit of help from a wedding coordinator, the landscaped area had been transformed into an elegant wedding and reception venue. Even Sarah's mother had agreed that the setting—while far from traditional in her mind—was perfect for a summer ceremony.Lindsey winced as a stab of pain shot from the ball of her foot to her calf. The sight of the four-tiered chocolate wedding cake on the other side of the terrace clinched the decision. No one would miss the maid of honor for thirty minutes or so. And after enjoying some solitude with a thick slice of cake and the book she was reading, she'd be ready to join society again.She made her way through the throng of guests toward the house, but crossing the tiled decking around the pool gracefully turned out to be an exercise in futility. Her ankle twisted, and she barely caught herself before sprawling into the pool. She teetered for a moment on the narrow heels, then righted herself, glancing up to see if anyone had caught her near mishap.Best man Kyle Walker waved at her from the other side of the pool.Great. She felt her cheeks redden as she forced a smile and waved back. Kyle was just as handsome as he'd been in college. Even more so, in fact. Clean shaven, short dark hair and that one familiar dimple on his left cheek, not to mention the classy tuxedo…Memories of tutoring sessions, final exams and football games came flooding back. Lindsey and Sarah had met Kyle and Brad as freshmen at University of Texas. The four of them had become fast friends but Lindsey had lost track of Kyle after she left school. Apparently Sarah's recent reconnection with him, followed by her engagement to Brad after a decade apart, had sparked an interest in matchmaking. Sarah had even gone as far as to suggest how romantic it would be if Lindsey and Kyle were to discover love after all these years.Except she and Kyle had never been anything more than friends. And any matchmaking attempts had fallen between the cracks of last-minute wedding preparations and Kyle's delayed flight into Dallas last night. There simply hadn't been time for the two of them to chat.But while Lindsey had no intention of romanticizing their long-overdue reunion, perhaps her escape to the library could wait.Margie Adams, mother of the bride, waylaid Lindsey halfway across the terrace, balancing two plates of cake and a cup of punch in her hands. \"You were right, Lindsey.\"\"I was?\" Lindsey squeezed her sequined purse under her arm, taking the cake Mrs. Adams offered.\"I thought a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting would be completely inappropriate for the wedding, but it's absolutely fantastic,\" Mrs. Adams said, taking a bite. \"Don't tell a soul, but I'm on my second piece. You've simply got to try it.\"Lindsey took a bite. \"This is delicious.\"Mrs. Adams wiped the edge of her mouth with a cream-colored napkin embossed with Sarah's and Brad's names. \"And another thing, Lindsey. I wanted to tell you that you look absolutely stunning tonight. That old adage of 'always a bridesmaid, never a bride' certainly isn't true. Soon we'll be planning your ceremony.\"Lindsey frowned. Suddenly the cake didn't seem quite so appetizing. Why was it that everyone believed that being single was a matter of fate and not choice? She'd been a bridesmaid in three different wedding parties in the past two years and someone had made a similar comment to her at every wedding.Lindsey pressed her lips together. \"You know, Mrs. Adams, while I do plan to marry one day, I'm really not in any hurry—\"Mrs. Adam's held up her free hand. \"I know, my dear, I know. Even Sarah waited until her thirties to marry. But one can't wait forever, especially if you want a family….\"Lindsey took another bite of cake, while Mrs. Adams continued her monologue on the importance of finding the right mate. Sarah's mom tended to ramble—and eat—when she was nervous, and apparently the wedding of her only daughter had catapulted her into that precarious frame of mind.Lindsey glanced across the terrace for a glimpse of Kyle, but he'd disappeared. Not that it mattered, of course. She took another bite of cake, trying to ignore the pain in her feet, and turned back to Mrs. Adams. Apparently it was going to be a very long night.Kyle leaned down to kiss Sarah on the cheek. \"Congratulations, you two. This evening turned out perfectly.\"Brad thumped him on the upper arm. \"Now it's your turn, buddy.\"\"For marriage?\" Kyle coughed. \"One of these days, but I've got too much on my plate right now.\"Unfortunately, a relationship took time, which was something he had far too little of right now. Between running his own company and opening up a new office in Dallas, finding time for a serious relationship had fallen off his to-do list.\"Trust me, Kyle. When the right woman comes along, you'll find the time.\" Brad wrapped his arm around his bride's waist. \"Besides, do you see me worrying about work? There's more to life, you know. And a few extra perks like marriage can't hurt.\"Sarah pulled away from Brad's embrace, her hands on her hips. \"So you see me as a perk, Mr. O'Conner?\"\"The only perk I'll ever need, Mrs. O'Conner.\" Brad wrapped his arms around Sarah, who melted into his embrace as they kissed.Kyle cleared his throat. \"I think I'll leave the two of you to your blissful state of matrimony.\"\"Wait a minute, Kyle,\" Sarah said, stopping him from escaping. \"You've had a chance to talk to Lindsey, haven't you?\"Kyle shook his head. \"Nothing more than a quick 'hi, it's good to see you again.' Every time I head her direction, she's deep in conversation with someone.\"\"That's no excuse.\"Kyle laughed. It hadn't been an excuse. Not really, anyway. It was just that thirteen years changed a person, and picking up from the last day he'd seen her wasn't exactly easy.\"I always thought the two of you were perfect for each other,\" Sarah continued.\"We were friends. Nothing more.\"Sarah nodded across the terrace. \"At least go rescue her from my mother. You remember how much my mother talks. She'll keep her half the night, and Lindsey's too polite to say anything.\"Kyle glanced at Lindsey, smiling to himself as he remembered the first time they met. He'd been pulling a load of pink clothes from a Laundromat washing machine, after accidentally tossing a pair of new red jogging shorts into the mix. Then Lindsey had walked in. A trip to the supermarket and two hours later, she'd somehow managed to turn his socks and T-shirts white again.A decade or so later, she still looked beautiful even if the pink bridesmaid dress she wore might be a tad frilly for his tastes. Slender frame, honey-colored hair pulled up in a classic twist, big brown eyes… He'd often wondered what would have happened if their friendship had turned into something more all those years ago.His cell phone vibrated in his jacket, stopping his reminiscing. He glanced at the text message and frowned. \"Emergency in Amsterdam. Call D.C.\"Great. Matt's timing couldn't be worse, but Kyle knew he couldn't ignore the message. Security breaches were a serious cause for concern, and he was afraid there was either a mole in their Amsterdam office or a bug in their computer software. Both posed a threat to the integrity of the company that couldn't wait.\"Please don't tell me you're working,\" Sarah said.Kyle flashed her an apologetic smile. \"It will only take a few minutes. You don't mind if I step inside the house and make a call, do you?\"Sarah shrugged in defeat. \"Try the library. It should be quiet in there.\"He heard Lindsey's soft laugh as he headed inside. He would definitely make an effort to talk to her before the night was out.By the time Lindsey heard the ominous crack, it was too late.Her first mistake had been to agree to wear the pink taffeta bridesmaid's dress with the layers of ruffles down the back. The second mistake had been the shoes—one of the silver heels had just snapped off like a dry twig. Her left hip jutted forward and punch splashed over the edge of her glass, dribbling down the front of her dress. Teetering on one foot, she struggled to keep her balance and avoid spilling the rest of the drink onto the beige suede couch in front of her. The book under her arm slapped against the floor of the small library, followed by her purse. A groan escaped her lips as she grabbed for the couch. Fortunately, she was still holding the generous slice of cake with an inch of chocolate frosting.\"Need some help?\"Lindsey's arm jerked at the sound of a voice inside the darkened room. The cake flipped off the plate, into the air, and landed smack-dab in the middle of Kyle's white tuxedo shirt. It was clearly too late for help. She looked at him, horrified, and wondered if it was physically possible to dissolve into the expensive Oriental rug on the library floor.\"I am so sorry,\" she said, setting the drink and now-empty plate on the coffee table. \"I didn't know anyone was in here.\"Lindsey bit her lower lip, wondering how in the world she had managed to make a complete fool out of herself in less than five seconds. Kyle's familiar smile— though lovely to look at—did nothing to erase her humiliation.A wave of heat flooded her cheeks as he reached for the empty plate and used it to scrape some of the brown frosting from his white shirt.\"I really am sorry,\" she said again.\"Don't worry about...", "related": ["B00HAZ45MW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Professor Casey writes an engrossing and detailed account of Kennedy’s campaign, which shattered the barrier and alleviated many of the fears about “Romish” influence upon Catholic politicians. This was no easy obstacle to overcome. The Nixon campaign and Nixon himself publicly discounted any concern over Kennedy’s religion. Behind the scenes, Nixon surrogates joined with prominent Protestant laymen, preachers, and organizations to reinforce fears. Kennedy and his advisors made the decision to confront the religion issue head-on, making it plain that he would accept no counsel from “foreign” institutions.

Debut writer Patrick opens with a one-page verse voiced by a person who has forgotten how to be grateful. Four stories follow, the shortest of which--\"The Final Tip\"--is a clever tale narrated by an unnamed inanimate object who, after subsisting through a dark life of horrific abuse, torture and neglect, finally finds a home on a young waitress' dresser. Humanitarian Andrea discovers she has miraculous healing powers in \"Laryngitis\"--simply by reading aloud the favorite books of those who are in dire health, she brings about their swift rejuvenescence. A series of accidents cripples her abilities as the increased demand  for her assistance overwhelms her and she realizes that \"there's something bigger running our universe.\" The first of Patrick's heavily populated, novella-length entries, \"Baker's Dozen,\" follows a female psychotherapist who finds her hands full with a melting pot of twelve exceedingly needy patients. Among them are a compulsive gambler, an overeater, a shoplifter, a sex addict, a female narcissist, an OCD victim and a clean freak--each in a state of mental and emotional disarray. The group unites for a four-week \"revival camp\" in the Adirondack Mountains where the interactive melodrama has surprisingly effective results. Two homosexual German guards who fall in love during Hitler's 1941 reign in the touching tale \"Nothing Much to Write Home About\"--they're among the many desperately attempting to flee Nazi Germany for an unfettered future. Textured with authentic emotion and nail-biting suspense, Patrick saved this most impressive and complicated work for last. Considering this is the author's debut, he already appears pleasingly accomplished.  Excels in narrative quality, creativity and variety.  --Kirkus Discoveries, May 29, 2009", "related": [], "rank": 4608443, "title": "To Make A Long Story Short", "author": "Timothy Patrick", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ray graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Fine Arts, majoring in painting, drawing and sculpture. He then participated in several group exhibitions in Johannesburg, including two at the prestigious Total Gallery. One of his large nudes on show at a Pretoria exhibition created a controversy when a screen had to be erected around the painting to prevent it being seen by the then South African Prime Minister John Vorster. Ray and his family emigrated to Australia in 1980 where he had seven solo exhibitions in Melbourne. In 1997 he won the Applied Chemicals International Acquisitive Prize for a watercolour of a Victorian factory. Australian radio personalities Terry Lane and Doug Aiton both have portraits done by Ray and his works are held by private collectors in France, Hong Kong, Holland the USA, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Ray and his wife Lynne now live permanently at La Petite Galerie in a medieval village in southwest France where he exhibits regularly at the Mézin Tourist Office.

Puss in Boots? Rapunzel? The origins of fairy tales are looked at in a new way in these highly engaging pages. Conventional wisdom holds that fairy tales originated in the oral traditions of peasants and were recorded for posterity by the Brothers Grimm during the nineteenth century. Ruth B. Bottigheimer overturns this view in a lively account of the origins of these well-loved stories. Charles Perrault created Cinderella and her fairy godmother, but no countrywoman whispered this tale into Perrault's ear. Instead, his Cinderella appeared only after he had edited it from the book of often amoral tales published by Giambattista Basile in Naples. Distinguishing fairy tales from folktales and showing the influence of the medieval romance on them, Bottigheimer documents how fairy tales originated as urban writing for urban readers and listeners. Working backward from the Grimms to the earliest known sixteenth-century fairy tales of the Italian Renaissance, Bottigheimer argues for a book-based history of fairy tales. The first new approach to fairy tale history in decades, this book answers questions about where fairy tales came from and how they spread, illuminating a narrative process long veiled by surmise and assumption.\"This book will forever change the way that scholars and readers view a genre--the literary fairy tale--that remains vital today.\" -- Suzanne Magnanini, author ofFairy-Tale Science: Monstrous Generation in the Tales of Straparola and Basile", "related": ["B005D7KWKI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

(On my Commodore64.  It was that long ago.)After publishing my first novel, SEAMS16:A New Home, and while I was working on my second, SEAMS16:Arrival, I thought of that old story and asked my brother, Lanin, if he would be interested in illustrating it.  He agreed, so I dug the story out and looked it over.  I've learned a lot about writing since then, so I gave the story an overhaul before passing it on to Lanin.  I publicly asked for help in naming the story and my niece's daughters (age 3 & 5) suggested \"Sam and the Dragon\".Works for me.", "related": ["B006SQFHO4"], "rank": 3017360, "title": "Sam And The Dragon", "author": "Eric B.

Chris is determined to prove to his friends that he can survive alone for a week on tiny, unsettled Fowlers Island off the coast of Maine, which is rumored to be haunted and was the scene of a tragedy 150 years ago. There he meets Joellen, who is accompanying her father and his young girlfriend on a research project to restore the area's puffin population. Joellen spends much of her time writing a story about a girl who was abandoned on an island. After some initial reluctance and verbal sparring, the two young people jointly explore their surroundings, including threateningly named Dread Mans Cove. They uncover an old oilcloth-wrapped bundle underneath an uprooted tree that contains a journal. Entries in it eerily parallel the story Joellen has been crafting and reveal the truth about the island's ghostly past: the girl who supposedly haunts it is Chris's great-great-grandmother, who had been left there during a doomed attempt to enter the United States illegally during the Irish Potato famine. Readers will need patience to get through the novel's lengthy setup and its numerous subplots?seabird behavior, local environment, sheep farming, Joellen's writing process, her discomfort with her parents' separation, and her father's romance with his former assistant. Some plot elements remain unresolved at the conclusion of this part mystery/part adventure novel, ultimately leaving readers unsatisfied.?Ellen Fader, Multnomah County Library, Portland, ORCopyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 3221332, "title": "Island Bound", "author": "Betty Levin", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The reader is in for a delightful journey as Denise weaves a gentle path toward the true role of wife and mother, using examples of gardening to reinforce her points. Her gentleness and warmth are genuine. Denise does not preach, nor does she simply give you an opinion; she declares the truth that comes from God's Word and delivers it in a most graceful manner.

Susan Holloway uses Japan as a lens through which to explore the broad question of how culture shapes child-rearing. Her in-depth interviews with Japanese women shed light on universal questions: how mothers imagine what makes an effective parent, how one's own upbringing affects one's parenting, how to preserve tradition while accommodating modern demands, and how to balance work and family. This is a fascinating book grounded in the history and anthropology of Japan which speaks to the mounting pressures on the family in the industrialized world.\"- Amy Borovoy, Princeton University, author of The Too-Good Wife: Alcohol, Codependency, and the Politics of Nurturance in Postwar Japan\"In this timely and path-breaking book, Susan Holloway paints an engaging canvas of how cultural concerns and public policies have shaped the ways young Japanese women view themselves, without losing sight of the ways that individual women also transcend their own culture in their perceptions and evaluations of what it means to be wife and mother. The combination of these elements - the cultural, the institutional, and the individual - is what makes this book so powerful and different from previous treatments of Japanese families. A must-read book for scholars interested in an up-to-date narrative of Japanese women as mothers and wives in contemporary Japan.\"- Per F. Gjerde, University of California, Santa Cruz\"Through a series of candid face-to-face, in-depth interviews supplemented by survey results, Holloway brings us a stunning critique of Japan's approach to the lives of women - conditions of education, work, and marriage that often add stress rather than support. Declines in rates of marriage and childbirth are understandable results, particularly under the scrutiny of the 'faceless other' lurking among neighbors and extended family. The situation requires mothers to draw heavily on individual strength to attempt to create opportunities not only for their child's academic success but also for their personal happiness.\"- June A. Gordon, University of California, Santa Cruz\"There is no doubt that this is a major contribution to research and scholarship on Japanese parenting, child rearing, and education, but it is also a polished piece of writing, commanding the attention of anyone even slightly interested in the subject. The book is at once a synthesis of social science data and perspectives and an in-depth study of the attitudes and behaviors of 16 mothers in Osaka. Its analysis, reflecting the long experience of the author with this subject, is consistently illuminating, credible and balanced.\"- Robert A. LeVine, Harvard University\"Susan Holloway explores the 'good mother' in Japan in ways so far untreated in the western literature on Japan. Why is it that Japanese women who now have so many options for work and activities still measure themselves by their capacity to be good mothers? Holloway examines the peaks and valleys of the landscape of women's lives in Japan, revealing the psychological and social complexities at ground level. The voices of four mothers frame a story of confidence where demands are high, initiative where frustration bars the door, and self evaluation and determination when there is little support. And yet, the joys of motherhood in Japan are evident, perhaps more strikingly available to a Japanese mother than to her striving western counterpart.\"- Merry White, Boston University\"....the book is an impressive contribution to several fields of study. It is a careful, thoughtful project that provides important insights into Japan today and hints of the future society in which these young children will be adults. It demonstrates the value of multi-level analysis of social-psychological issues incorporating both individual agency and sociocultural constraints. The project provides rich comparative data for analyzing the relationship between parental self-efficacy and factors of social class, cultural values, social support, and institutional setting. For policy experts looking to understand young women's reluctance to marry and bear children at the rates of the past, this well-crafted book is an excellent place to begin.\"- Susan Orpett Long, John Carroll University, International Journal of Sociology of the Family\"Holloway (education, Berkeley) provides a very detailed look into the lives of Japanese women in the context of family.... Holloway also breaks some new ground, including an exploration of some interesting data on husbands, uncommon for books dealing with Japanese women. She also does well to contextualize the ways the lives of women intersect with public policies. Overall, this solid addition to the literature on Japan does a nice job of integrating qualitative and quantitative forms of data.... Recommended.\"- J.W.

Michael Stephen Hamlin CreateSpace 978-1-4538-3379-7Five Stars (Out of Five)In Military Millionaires, a former U.S. Army infantryman with a degree in business administration provides cogent, easy-to-follow financial advice for young men and women joining the U.S. military.With an aim to lead young people to a future of financial security, Michael Stephen Hamlin's step-by-step guide to managing money offers sound advice for just about anyone--young or old, military or civilian. He covers all of the basics: start saving early; know the difference between needs and wants; set concrete goals; learn to live with less; build up a six-month emergency fund; develop a workable budget; pay down debt; organize important documents; and, last but not least, stick to a plan. Young recruits will benefit from Hamlin's commonsense reminders. He points out that avoiding expensive, impulse purchases \"can be the most challenging part of building a secure financial future,\" that saving up to pay cash for a used automobile might be smarter than taking out a loan to buy a new one, or that readers might want to hang on to \"bills for insured items such as jewelry, appliances, electronics, and collectibles, in case you need to file an insurance claim.\"Hamlin shares financial expertise based on his own experiences and the experiences of others, and mixes his advice about dollars and cents with a dash of homespun philosophy. He wants to help young recruits avoid common financial mistakes, cut back on unnecessary purchases, and build a sizable nest egg for the future. All of which will become easier, Hamlin suggests, if one learns along the way that real happiness can't be found in fancy cars and expensive houses. True satisfaction, writes Hamlin, \"comes from faith, family, friendship, and helping others.\"With its details about the financial benefits available to military personnel, Military Millionaires should be required reading for all new recruits. Living in military housing, for example, means not paying rent or utilities. A career in the military provides full medical coverage regardless of a person's age at the time of retirement, which means that there is no need to purchase health insurance between the time of retirement and the start of Medicare coverage at age 65. Unlike its civilian counterparts, the U.S. military still provides generous pensions. Military personnel can contribute up to $16,500 annually to individual retirement accounts, a full $11,000 more than their peers in the private sector. In Hamlin's book, any young person who has just joined the military, or is just thinking about joining the military, will find a solid, workable plan for creating a secure financial future.Diane Taylor --ForeWord Clarion Review", "related": [], "rank": 1303273, "title": "Military Millionaires eBook", "author": "Michael Stephen Hamlin", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Married to his former job, he was like the proverbial fish out of water. Every day, as soon as I got home from teaching at a local college, he would arrive.We would lunch, have coffee, add a piece of cake, and then have another coffee. Talk? We talked about philosophy, religion, education, quantum physics, literature, Greek mythology. During one such talk-a-thon I said I should be taking notes so we could go back and check what we had said. Shared books flew from his house to mine. Sometimes, he struggled to find the right metaphor for my literary mind. His physics background meant much learning for meHe suggested I write a book about all this. I had written college textbooks in the humanities and had been an art book reviewer for a couple major textbook publishers. I agreed. In 1995 I retired. With my wife and two cats I flew to Seattle and settled in the Puget Sound area. It was then I began to write what I called, A Conversation Between Two Old Men. Very soon, I realized I couldn't have \"he said,\" \"I said\". Who in their right mind would read such a book, let alone buy it.  Besides, the two men needed names, lives, character traits.Because I had met a shaman when I was a young child, I decided to make my characters shaman, one who didn't know he was, and one who did. The book became a teaching/learning commentary: the young learning the traditions from the old.And with that, The Quest Seeking the New Adam was born. It was self-published in 2000. Ten years later, I rewrote the book, added 50,000 words, created a new cover, and new title, The Shaman's Quest. As news commentator Paul Harvey would say, \"And now you have the rest of the story.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The conflicts between long-time residents and tourists on the River; traditional enmity between ethnic groups; conflicts among the development, environmental and farming interests; the central role of water -- in many ways the New Braunfels situation is a particularly intense microcosm of the challenges confronting the whole Hill Country.Coalson deals with real places and his descriptions of the infrastructure of them are richly textured, lovingly capturing the ambiance and atmosphere of the context in a way that could only be done by someone who has had long intimacy with the area. The characters are designed to personify the interest groups involved in the New Braunfels issues and they are well-nuanced. It's a good read - well worth three hours in a hammock on the back porch.

Meanwhile, a man identified until the final pages as \"the diplomat\" is fighting his own battle against his corrupt boss and a slow-moving Chinese bureaucracy while attempting to free a young Austrian man from a Chinese jail.As the story progresses, the diplomat's marriage with his wife falls apart and he finds himself falling in love with the beautiful male prisoner, whose reason for captivity is the novel's final surprise. Weber (Benedetto Casanova--the Memoirs, 2011, etc.) cleverly structures his tale in chapters that focus alternately on Gabriel and the diplomat. Thedialogue is often witty and the mystery of the alternating storylines will keep the reader engaged.

At the suggestion of the Secretary of State, Sen. Richard Cromwell arranges a small dinner party at his country home. Among those present are the Secretary of State, Cromwell's wife Dolly, their college-age children, Leonard and Elizabeth, and Dolly's parents, Augustus and Jenny Levi. Gus Levi is extraordinarily wealthy and influential, and Richard understands the dinner has been requested so that the Secretary can speak with his father-in-law informally. Fast's tale covers the day of the party, from Cromwell's earliest thoughts, which are of his mistress, to his late-night reordering of priorities. In the course of the day, he reconnects with his wife, learns a tragic fact about his son and alters the direction of his career by standing up for his own needs and beliefs. More of the author's familiar preoccupations are represented in other characters: the couple who manages the Cromwell household is black, as is Leonard's visiting friend and lover from law school; Leonard relies on a Zen-like meditation to help him face death. Though vintage Fast in its issues, unfortunately there's little pace to this novel that reads more like a treatise related by cardboard figures than a story about livingand dyingpeople.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 1285515, "title": "The Dinner Party: A Novel", "author": "Howard Fast", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

May's distinctive approach throws light in both directions -- on the religious categories, which are enriched by their application to topics like American foreign policy, the free market, and immigration; and on public issues, which are understood in a more profound way by the application of religious ideas. A valuable book.\" --William Lee Miller, The Miller Center of Public Affairs and author ofLincoln's Virtues: An Ethical Biography\"Wise, clear, profound, and eloquent, William F. May's new book should be read by anyone who cares about America. He puts on display our runaway fears and desires. He traces the ways those anxieties and appetites have distorted our international policy, our domestic policy, and our economic life. It is a prophetic indictment of our culture, but it is no mere jeremiad. It is a hopeful call for a course correction, for a turning (or a returning) to the tradition of covenant. The concluding chapters elegantly contrast covenant and contract and point the way to a better common life in America.\" --Allen Verhey, professor of theological ethics, Duke Divinity School\"This book is a profound and beautifully written meditation on the dueling passions that drive American foreign and domestic policy by one of the nation's foremost religious ethicists. In order to keep those passions in check, May argues for the retrieval and renewal of the covenantal model of our national union. Deeply influential in colonial America, the idea of covenant is rooted in a fundamental model of God's gift and our grateful response. It is therefore capable of inspiring not merely enlightened self-interest, but also the self-expenditure on behalf of the common good that America so sorely needs to face its current challenges.\" --M. Cathleen Kaveny, John P. Murphy Foundation Professor of Law and professor of theology, Notre Dame Law School\"This book is the capstone of the life's work of William F. May as an eminent Christian ethicist and public intellectual. With stylistic elegance, theological depth, perceptive analysis, and persuasive criticism, May employs the concept of covenant to address the domestic and international policies that the United States should follow today.\" --Charles Curran, Elizabeth Scurlock University Professor of Human Values, Southern Methodist University\"The national debate on religion and politics commonly adopts political language for its framework -- right, left, reactionary, progressive. In a refreshing departure, William May takes a different tack. Religious language itself -- community, covenant, good, evil, hospitality, and generosity -- is his framework for looking at what unites and divides 'We the People.' He deploys this with his usual keen analysis and elegant style.\" --Margaret Steinfels, codirector, Fordham Center on Religion and Culture", "related": [], "rank": 2897835, "title": "Testing the National Covenant: Fears and Appetites in American Politics", "author": "William F.

Unfortunately, one of the things we seem to neglect is the attention we should give to not only talking with our Heavenly Father but allowing ourselves to be silent and hear back from him as well. Author Kenny Bowyer has made that a little easier with his new book A MOMENT WITH GOD.Though the title suggest that this is a book just for teens I found it to be just the thing for people of all ages who want to rely on something larger than themselves as they face the day and look for ways to make the most of their lives. Bowyer has used his own experiences and lessons to craft a book that is sure to reach the reader wherever they might be, inspiring them to live life with purpose and make the most of every opportunity.Everything from the scriptures he expounds upon to the way it is presented shows you that A MOMENT WITH GOD was written out of love and appreciation for the importance of a relationship with God. Bowyer has found that for himself, and he wants to do his part through this book to let others know the same is possible for them.No matter who we might be or where we find ourselves today, there is something in this book that will benefit us if you allow it to. All you have to do is slow down long enough to realize that all of us who are believers need to take out time and have a moment with God. ~ Cyrus Webb", "related": [], "rank": 2143689, "title": "A Moment With God: A Teen Devotional", "author": "Kenny Bowyer", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kevin Morrell, Leadership Exploring Leadership provides today's take on a decades long history of leadership study. What Bass's Handbook of Leadership does for us in completeness, Bolden and colleagues provide with pith. Larry Hughes, Leadership & Organization Development Journal Exploring Leadership is both a very timely and highly relevant book. It has long been recognized that the nature of effective leadership owes much to context, but recent history points to an acceleration in the shift of the contextual backdrop. We now live in an age where a diversity of leadership styles is an absolute requirement to address the ambiguity inherent in our complex world: an eclectic approach to leadership is indeed todays requirement. Hence, the theme of rerouting rather than uprooting leadership studies is absolutely relevant as we face the challenges of the future, and this book makes the case with both conviction and fluency. Sir Brian Burridge, Vice President, Strategic Marketing, Finmeccanica UK, and Former Air Chief Marshall, Royal Air Force Among the opening lines from this provocative book, coined by a gifted team of writers from the Centre for Leadership Studies, are the rhetorical: Not another book on leadership! My follow-up to this statement has to be noted for the record: But this is not your typical book on leadership! It is a journey through a leadership landscape that is like no other; so be prepared to hold onto your seats. Exploring Leadership is just that; an exploration into new territory in leadership studies, focusing less on classic individualistic approaches, in favour of alternative contemporary emphases on leaderships critical, relational, interpretive, and subjective nature. This volume needs to be read by all students of leadership, young and old. Joe Raelin, Asa S. Knowles Chair of Practice-Oriented Education, Northeastern University, USA This is no ordinary book on leadership. It is an engaging and highly readable exploration of our assumptions about leadership and management, balancing its examination across disciplines, levels of analysis, and issues of leadership ethics and leadership effectiveness. This book brings life to theory and presents a critical perspective that is both refreshing and provocative - certain to inspire students, practitioners, and scholars alike. Ellen Van Velsor, Senior Fellow - Research, Innovation & Product Development, Center for Creative Leadership, Greensboro, USA Offering important critical perspectives on the meaning and purpose of leadership, this book reframes leadership for the twenty-first century, and comes from a group of authors who have already made a significant contribution to the field. A vital book for all leadership scholars and students who seek to question the leadership assumptions that dominate mainstream leadership texts. Sharon Turnbull, Visiting Professor, University of Gloucestershire, UK, and Former Director of Centre for Applied Leadership Research at the Leadership Trust There is no doubt that that this book will do what the authors themselves suggest, to help readers navigate the complex and confusing terrain that is leadership. Navigating this landscape is not an easy one given the popularity and plethora of material written on the subject. However, this experienced team of authors are all well known in their field and are well placed to offer an authoritative and considered reality check on the substance and importance of leadership in contemporary society. Richard Thorpe, Professor of Management Development and Pro Dean (Research), Leeds University Business School In the clamouring market of Leadership texts, Exploring Leadership is a breath of fresh air. The books authors assume a reader who is thoughtful and open to challenging the gaps, homilies, and fashions that often characterize leadership proselytizing. Yet it is also practical and engaging as it roams across a deceptively comprehensive survey of leadership debates, from management vs. leadership to the contemporary ideal of the authentic leader. If you can only read or recommend one book on leadership, Exploring Leadership is the one to choose. It is on the side of supporting insightful, humane, and effective leadership without the sermon. Amanda Sinclair, Professor of Management (Diversity and Change), Melbourne Business School, Australia The people at the Centre for Leadership Studies have done it again. In taking a critical, interdisciplinary, multilevel perspective on leadership, they take the reader on a rollercoaster ride that is memorable. By enabling more critical reflections on leadership theory, development, and practice, this book is a must read for anyone interested in this highly complex topic. Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries, Clinical Professor of Leadership and Organizational Change, INSEAD, France The impressive range of concern and the depth of thought that is evinced in this book provides encouraging grounds for believing that the field of leadership studies may have finally come of age. By skilfully weaving together individual, organizational, and societal perspectives on leadership, the authors set the stage and inspire leadership researchers to do work that genuinely matters. Brad Jackson, Fletcher Building Education Trust Chair in Leadership, the University of Auckland Business School, New Zealand This multi-authored volume provides an engaging exploration of leadership from a variety of perspectives, but still manages to speak with a clear and compelling voice. The authors explain a wide range of issues and ideas in a lively manner that will involve readers in the uncovering of assumptions and the making of connections across contexts and disciplines. Exploring Leadership will encourage and inform reflection and debate among those who study, research, and participate in the dynamics of leadership on the personal, organizational, social, and even global level. Eric Guthey, Associate Professor of Intercultural Communication and Management, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark There are thousands of books on leadership but I wouldn't recommend many of them. I would recommend this one. It's a gem: contemporary, critical, well-written, and provocative. What more would you want? Keith Grint, Professor of Public Leadership, Warwick Business School Another book on the panacea that is leadership? Importantly, both these issues are dealt with quickly and seriously in a very timely book. Given the focus on leaders and leadership in recent years, both with respect to the general view that our leaders are responsible for our difficulties and the vast amounts devoted to developing leaders, we need a critically balanced view that helps assess where we are and what questions need to be considered to take us forward. And that is what we get here. Jeff Gold, Professor of Organisation Learning, Leeds Metropolitan University Do we need another leadership book? Yes to this one because it gives a uniquely well balanced, accessible, and integrated overview of most of the main perspectives and issues in leadership. Read this one instead of the other 39,999!

I grew up in Compton, California and had one of the greatest, richest childhoods one could have growing up in an \"inner\" city.   My dad was involved in the west coast civil rights movement, and during the 60's and 70's I got to witness and was involved in some wild and crazy events during this important time in American history.   Since birth, I've possessed an extraordinary memory; an insatiable imagination; and a fascination with writing.  I started writing in high school, through college, and during my work years.   Now 59 years-old, with my kids having graduated college and their adult lives headed in successful directions, it is once again my time to revisit my writing aspirations and pursue my passion for the written word!    I am and have been married to my beautiful wife Janice for 34 years.  My son Lance and daughter Arinn (pictured here) are both bright, ambitious young adults who have made their parents very proud.  I have 6 brothers and sisters (Maxine, Kelvin, Anthony, Stephanie, Dennis and Tracy); a goo gaggle of cousins, in-laws and friends.    I hope to retire soon and start the writing phase of my life.

He dove in various locations, but it was while diving in the “safest area” he ever dove that his life would be endangered by a careless boater. Up for a promotion to further heights in the Space Flight industry, the accident which “essentially cut him in half,” left Larry permanently disabled. Relying on his deep faith in God and his own destiny, Larry courageously fought back to build a new life.  He returned to his love of the ocean and has taught over thirty other individuals to free-dive and spearfish. He studied with the American Association of Christian Counselors as well as the International Coach Federation – the oldest and highest standards organization in the emerging field of Coaching. Larry’s coached at many levels, from individuals whose own lives have been seriously disrupted, to organizational executives and leaders of international Aerospace firms. He specializes in partnering with others to discover and achieve both their personal and organizational missions in life. He has developed Life Coaching tools for both individuals and organizations and is currently developing Life Coaching programs and curriculum for organizations with well over one-thousand members. He is excited about his third book “Propel Beyond Fear: Dive into Life” (due out spring of 2013) in which he combines his love of free diving with his coaching skills, using a variety of adventurous dive stories to coach readers to a life well lived:  “The Incredible Life.”", "related": [], "rank": 2242329, "title": "Dead Man Rising", "author": "Kris Orr", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Why go to Hollywood?Anyone can tell you that Hollywood is a great place to set a comedy. The lifestyle's absurdities, the quirks of glamour, and the mystery of the process are fun to read about. Adding in a murder only makes it more appealing.However, it was Gary's story that drew me to take the mystery to LA. He has a new TV show loosely based on his life--who wouldn't want to see that? Readers of earlier books knew the show was coming, and I thought it was time to show the world what Gary's show, \"The Taster,\" would be like. That said, new readers shouldn't have a problem jumping in to Jake and Gary's unique world.What challenges did you have while writing?As I mentioned above, the book is a series of funhouse mirrors--the mystery centers around a TV show based on Gary's memoirs, which are in turn based on his blog. And Gary himself is made-up already (sorry if I'm bursting any bubbles). Juggling those balls was tough, but I think it pays off for the reader.Other than that, it's always a challenge to keep readers on their toes. My goals with the mystery are simple: provide as many clues as possible, but keep readers guessing. By varying the structure, clues, and characters, I think that this book keeps the tension level high.How did you research this book?As a reader of entertainment media and a very peripheral participant (my bookDumbemployed was recently optioned by Warner Brothers TV), I felt aware enough of the lingo, legal issues, and procedure in TV. Or at least aware enough to set Jake and Gary loose. Jake also tries to bring his relationship with his girlfriend, Mel, to the next level in this book. I won't tell you how it turns out for Jake. But I will admit that I was inspired by my engagement to my girlfriend as I was writing the book. If anyone questions my commitment to Jake, I can tell them that I used my own major life-event as fodder for the fifth Jake Russo mystery's secondary plot.", "related": ["B00JERUXHK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

State-of-the-art essentials of providing empirically-based treatment for this often difficult to treat condition are covered in a clear and concise manner that is certain to facilitate positive outcomes. Clearly an invaluable resource for all clinicians providing care to those struggling with excessive anxiety regarding their health. ----Gordon J. G. Asmundson, PhD, RD Psych, FRSC, Professor of Psychology, Department of Psychology, University of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, Editor-in-Chief, Cognitive Behaviour TherapyThis volume in the Advances in Psychotherapy series is a practical guide to cognitive-behavioral therapy for hypochondriasis and health anxiety complete with illustrative case vignettes.[...] The authors provide a surprisingly in-depth look into the state of the field. The books in this series are great supplemental tools, references, and primers. All mental health professionals will find this book worthwhile, and primary care physicians may find it especially helpful if they have patients with health anxiety. The series is well regarded for both its academic and clinical applications. --Nicholas Greco IV, MS, BCETS, CATSM(Abbott Laboratories), 2011", "related": ["B003MQLZHQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Think of it as Red Bull in book form.Leonard SweetBest-selling author and professor (Drew University, George\nFox University)Chief contributor to sermons.com John O'Keefe has written a helpful\nguide for Creatives in the church as well as for those who love and lead\nCreatives. I've heard it said that the next great move of God will show up\nthrough the arts and creativity. I think John's book is evidence of that. He\naddresses the unique characteristics that Creatives possess and explains how\nthis matters in our present-day faith communities. John ties in the digital\nrevolution and shows us how technology and creativity are shaping the church of\nthe future. His book will help assure Creatives everywhere that we are not\ncrazy with our What ifquestions. Church as usual is over. Time for\nthe body of Christ to let loose our inner Creative and discover new forms.\nJohn's book will help us to do that. Pam HogeweideBlogger and Author ofUnladylike:\nResisting the Injustice of Inequality in the Church:pamhogeweide.com There is no guarantee that any book\nabout leadership will answer all your questions. In fact it's better to say\nthat any good book on leadership will help you find the right questions. That's\nwhat John O'Keefe's new book does. John guides us from lethargy to creativity,\nor as Kathleen Norris put it,acediato grace. Technology, art, rich\nsymbols, faith and friendship.

Brought up in north Belfast, she graduated in English and Philosophy from Queen's University, Belfast, then went on to gain an MA in English. She lives just outside Belfast, in Northern Ireland, has four grown up children and is married to author, media producer and broadcaster, Raymond McCullough, with whom she co-edited the Irish magazine, 'Bread', (published by Kingdom Come Trust), from 1990-96. In 1995 they published a non-fiction book called, 'Ireland - now the good news!' Over the past few years Gerry has had around sixty short stories published in UK, Irish and American magazines, anthologies and annuals - as well as broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster. Her poems and articles have been published in several Northern Ireland and UK magazines, and she has also done readings from her novels, poems and short stories at several Irish literary events.  She writes a regular literary blog - Gerry's Books - and guest writes for several other literary blogs. Gerry won the Cúirt International Literary Award for 2005 (Galway); was shortlisted for the 2008 Brian Moore Award (Belfast); shortlisted for the 2009 Cúirt Award; and commended in the 2009 Seán O'Faolain Short Story Competition, (Cork).

The school encouraged inter-cultural studies and she went on to earn a degree in Comparative Culture from Sophia University in Tokyo, Japan.  The author has published a collection of very short stories, Five Unlikely Tales, in the style of vignette, fable, fairy tale, and short story. A collection of rhymes with illustrations, Three Rhymes for Young Poets Age Five to Twelve, was written with Bilingual and ESL learners in mind by the multilingual author who has taught English to children and adults in Japan and ESL and French in public school settings in the U.S. Another publication, A Pig, a Horse, and a Catfish, is a nod in the direction of creation myths from around the world.  The author, whose mother worked for an English language newspaper in Tokyo and whose father had a lifelong interest in Asian art history, grew up around traditional Japanese culture taking flower arrangement, tea ceremony, wheel-thrown pottery, ink brush painting, and calligraphy lessons. She has practiced sketching Buddhist sculptures at various temples in Kyoto and Nara under the tutelage of a Buddhist sculptor. The combination of exposures to traditional arts of Japan and a marked diversity within the international community of Tokyo has shaped the author’s aesthetic sense and world view to integrate a wide range of points of view. She is inspired by local traditional cultures as well as the life history of expatriates, repatriates and other individuals who have flourished under unusual circumstances related to cross-cultural travels, long-term residences or displacement involving foreign countries. Interested in languages, language acquisition, and language learning, the author’s sincere hope is that her readers reap the joy of savoring words that create images in the mind and be inspired to write poetry or prose of their own.  The author’s pen name is derived from uguisu, a songbird known in English-speaking countries as Japanese bush warbler, whose song is heard in urban areas as well as in the countryside. Preferring the shade of foliage during the day, it is rarely seen, appearing more frequently in traditional literary works as a motif for spring, especially in poems.", "related": [], "rank": 5101564, "title": "A Pig, a Horse, and a Catfish eBook", "author": "Uguïsse Packard", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tansy Bell is the one he feels is meant to be his, and when she's in danger he goes after her prepared for her disgust.  What he gets is a dream come true.  Tansy protects herself after a love affair that ended in death for her lover.  In the world of espionage she's immersed herself. She knows her life span is going to be short and when she achieves her goal she'll have nowhere to run on this planet.  But what about another one?I loved this third book in the series the most.  Mak and Tansy are the most damaged of the couples, in my opinion, and benefit the most from having a mate.  It brings them both back from the edge of despair and gives them something to live for - each other.

Cheshire presents a thrilling account of the scientific, personal, and, occasionally, governmental rivalries behind each endeavor as the Piccards tested theories and themselves, prodding and encouraging each other in relentless pursuit of knowledge of the unknown, often in the face of great skepticism.

This book is must reading for both health care workers and church leaders who care about the health of individuals and justice in society.\" --James Newton Poling, Professor of Pastoral theology, Care, and Counseling at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary\"Ruether's straightforward telling of her family's struggle with mental illness is both memoir and manifesto. Reading her words, interwoven with those of her son, will increase your respect for how a family actually lives when one of its members has a mental illness. But as her readers have come to expect, in Rosemary Ruether's hands, the story also reveals that adequate care for families struggling with mental illness is a justice issue barely recognized but possible to address. This book leads us toward a vision of a better future.\" --Kathleen Greider, Professor of Practical Theology, Spiritual Care, and Counseling Claremont School of Theology\"Many Forms of Madness is an intriguing, gripping account of personal and family pain around a loved one's need and the society's failure to provide help. This is a must read for persons and families dealing with the mental health system and for pastoral/spiritual caregivers caring for them. This work gives a candid view of the ways in which these needs are not adequately being met and suggests ways in which changes could be made to improve care.\" --Teresa E.

I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her books have appeared on the New York Times and USA Today Best Sellers lists and she has received numerous industry awards including Romantic Times Readers’ Choice Awards.  In 2012, she branched out into suspense, mainstream and young adult genres. She has enjoyed co-writing these latest books with her husband Bob Wernly under the pen name of Bob Kat. Kathy’s 24th book is After Midnight, a suspense set in Denver and the first of the trilogy Denver After Dark. It has been well received and has many 4 and 5 star reviews. The trailer can be found from her website at www.NightWriter93.com or directly at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxSkqqaD-2Q Bob Kat became active in 2012 with two projects published, starting with the mainstream novel, Life’s What Happens, a fictionalized treatment of the 1969 to early 1970 anti-war movement as it played out at Kent State University. Bob Wernly was there, and the characters and thoughtful telling of the story provides a fascinating insight into the era. The reviews have been amazing. The direct link to the trailer is http://youtu.be/DQBnqNNNHUE Bob and Kathy have decided to take their newly launched co-writing career in a different direction, writing for young adults with stories drawn from real-life of teen suicide, bullying, runaways, abuse and drugs. They hope to counteract the caustic nature of television and film content and help this age group maintain a positive healthy outlook as they mature into their twenties. The series website is www.cuul8rseries.com.

As is true of many writers, she is an avid reader and especially likes suspense mysteries with a psychological twist.

She founded Horizon Therapy which provided speech services for schools and hospitals and she served on the California Speech Pathology-Audiology Examining Committee for a number of years. Five years ago she established the Reader-Writer's Group at the Running Y Ranch Resort, where she lives near Klamath Falls, Oregon. Now Jackie is ready to move on to entertaining people with Twisted Strands. Besides writing, she loves being a grandmother and enjoys exploring the pristine beauty of Southern Oregon with her husband, Tom, and their little dog Lexie.

Antonio currently lives in New Hampshire with his wife and two dogs. His fascination with Disney World started in the mid 1980's when he visited for the first time. In 2008 he started The Cousin Mickey Doesn't Talk About blog (http://thecousinmickeydoesnttalkabout.blogspot.com/). Originally, the blog focused on Disney World news, travel tips, photography, and Disney satire. In 2013 the focus of the blog changed to travel. His first book, Twisted Disney: Satire and Shenanigans was released in early 2012. A second book, CMDTA's Pictorial Guide to Disney World was planned for later that year. During the writing of the Pictorial Guide, A. Antonio came up with an idea for a novel that took place in Disney World. He put the Guide on hold and started writing World Killer. Two weeks later, the first draft was completed. A second draft was published in late 2013. A final draft was published in March of 2014. While Twisted Disney, the Pictorial Guide, and World Killer were being edited, A. Antonio wrote and completed the first drafts of Around the World and Imagineered Death. The two books complete the DW Mysteries Trilogy. A second trilogy has been planned to follow up the DW Mysteries as well as Special Editions of World Killer, Around the World, and Imagineered Death. The special editions will include pictures of the places in the book, detailed notes, and links to videos related to the books. A. Antonio is an unsigned, independent author.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In his direct and yet compelling style, Chester writes with real insight and honesty into the struggles of the Christian life and with a vivid hope for its joys. He shows again and again the way in which the cross of Christ not only showers on us the grace of forgiveness but also teaches us how to live. --Dr Michael Jensen, Lecturer in Doctrine, Moore Theological College, Sydney, AustraliaThis impressive book emphasizes what really matters that the truth of the cross and resurrection is to be lived as well as believed. Tim writes with a simplicity and directness that demonstrate how the cross and resurrection impact every corner of our lives and set us free to live as we should. If you read each chapter slowly and prayerfully, and determine by God s Spirit to follow what the Bible teaches, you will be on track to live a life of true discipleship. --Jonathan Lamb, Langham Partnership", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It took awhile before Tori considered her writing to be anything more than a hobby, but by then she had finished a few books.  Writing taught her to appreciate the mischief her teenagers stir up, that the characters in her head fight back, and that she misses Seattle. Life is still teaching her that her children will grow out of it, and she can visit Seattle occasionally. She’s still looking for a solution on how to deal with her characters.

He remained there until the cessation of hostilities in 1945, when he and his family were returned to Liverpool to re-build their family and their lives. Despite his initial dislike of being in South Wales and Llanelli, he grew to love the beautiful Welsh countryside and learned firsthand of the love and genuine warmth of the Welsh people. Now feeling like a duck out of water yet again, but yearning for the gently rolling hills and green valleys of South Wales, Ray vowed he would move out of the city as soon as he possibly could. When he left school Ray worked first at the State Restaurant in Liverpool as a cooks apprentice and then for Hanson's Dairy as a delivery man before going into the Army to complete his two years National Service as a member of the Royal Army Medical Corps in Egypt. He returned to Liverpool and in 1956 married his wife Lilian and shortly thereafter moved out of the city limits to the small village of Whiston. Lilian and Ray have one son and a daughter. In 1964 Ray started a wholesale clothing business and he and Lilian ran this enterprise together highly successfully until 1995, when they moved to the USA to be closer to their daughter and grandaughter (the inspiration for his writing the book).  Shortly after moving to the US Ray began writing the book at the suggestion of his daughter and with the encouragement of Lilian to help ensure the stories would be passed on to all of their grandchildren and generations to come. In 2001 the family moved once more and settled in the gentle rolling hills and green fields near Williamsburg, Virginia, which with all its history and connections to England feels just like home. The first edition of Before the Last All Clear was published in 2005, with a second edition released to the American market in August 2008, being published on Kindle in 2011. The most common question Ray was asked at book signings and events was, “what happened after the war?” That’s what inspired him to write the next part of his memoir “All I Want Is A Peaceful World…and A Pork Pie!”", "related": ["B005QPBINW"], "rank": 2813695, "title": "All I Want Is A Peaceful World and A Pork Pie! eBook", "author": "Ray Evans", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The best way to find out more about me is to read my books. I write from the heart and I express both my shortcomings and my triumphs. I like to think of my writing as 'Reality Fiction'. I tell it like I see it. Life is short and the troubles many, but with faith in Jesus Christ all things have become possible to me. I may write 'make believe', but I strive to live out what I write. I enjoy my work and I hope you do too. Have a blessed time reading my imaginative thoughts.

Although you wouldn't know it by looking at me, I have a great grandparent who was a member of that Native American Tribe. Her people once lived in the very southeastern corner of Montana where I now make my home. I didn't always live in such a wide open space, though. I grew up in New York City. Much as I love the city and admire what it takes to live there, I met a kindred spirit at Columbia University and together, we found a way to take our lives from the Big Apple to the Big Sky. We haven't regretted a moment. We've got a smallish ranch where we raise cattle and keep a menagerie of other animals, too. Once or twice a year, we hire a 'ranch sitter' and take an urban vacation somewhere hitting all the restaurants, plays, museums and musical performances we can squeeze in. Then it's back to the wide open. A writer finds creativity flourishes in solitude. My fantasy world is full of characters and stories lined up and waiting for me to bring them to life. I hope you will enjoy reading them as much as I enjoy writing them.", "related": ["B00L82ZVYE"], "rank": 296021, "title": "Year of the Billionaire: The Complete Trilogy", "author": "K.C.

There are all sorts of ecommerce sites on the web. Why do so many of your books focus specifically on eBay?Answer. I think eBay offers the best shot for new sellers to gain traction selling online. eBay is easy to get started selling on; it has a built in customer base of over 250 million eager buyers; and you can sell just about anything.Question: That last part is the million dollar question, what are the best things to sell on eBay if you want to make money?Answer: That's the great thing about eBay. It really doesn't matter what you sell. There are so many people on the site, with so many interests, that you can sell just about anything if you package it right.Question: Can you give us a few examples?Answer: Think cell phones, consumer electronics, and video games. eBay has hundreds of sellers moving these same items. The problem is these are almost impossible fields to compete in. You're up against the likes of Best Buy and the other big box giants.Question: So what do you do?Answer: Smart sellers narrow their focus down and serve a niche.     Do you service and sell used cell phones? There's a huge market for refurbished phones on eBay. If you have a ready source of phones, and can restore them to factory settings you're going to do well.     Let me give you another example. My Kindle went crazy last fall and wouldn't charge. None of the computer stores in town wanted to look at it. The one guy I did find who was willing to give it a shot wanted eighty bucks, but he wouldn't guarantee anything. I searched eBay and found a guy who would reset the charger stem (return postage included) for $34.95. When I checked his feedback he was doing a booming business, and he wasn't the only one. Five other sellers were thriving doing the same thing.     In my case, I take old magazines libraries and book stores are begging to get rid and harvest articles and pictures from them that sell for twenty to fifty dollars each. In fourteen years of doing it, I've made over thirty thousand sales.Question: But aren't there too many sellers already? How can the average guy hope to find a new niche that will make them money? Isn't it a little like finding the proverbial needle in the haystack?Answer: Ideas are all around you?     Do you run a local screen print shop? You can do short orders of six, twelve or twenty-five t-shirts and cater to the small business market. Are you an artist? Open up an eBay store and put your masterpieces out there for a larger market to find. Is there a local business in your area that everybody just loves? Test the waters and put a few of their products on eBay.     If you're really at a loss for what to sell, take a drive around town; open up the phone book; follow your kids around for a day and listen to what gets them excited.Question: Earlier you mentioned you can sell anything if you package it right. What did you mean by that?Answer: You've got to be creative in your listings. That means crafting awesome titles loaded with keywords; your pictures need to showcase what you're selling and make people want to buy it; you're item description needs to make customers drool for more.     I keep thinking back to a designer I use on Fiverr. She describes her book covers as being so realistic customers will want to reach out and lick them. Are auction listing so enticing customers will want to lick them. If not, you probably want to go back to the drawing board.Final Question: What's the best way to get started?Answer:  Dive in head first. So many people talk about what they want to do. They put all of these obstacles in their way. I'll do it when I can spare a thousand dollars. I'll start when I'm on vacation next summer and have the time to do it right. I need to get more information before I get started.    Listen to me. That's all a bunch of horse-hockey we tell ourselves to keep from trying. The best way to start doing something is to do it. Make a few mistakes. Who cares?     Read my books. Learn how to sell on eBay. Whatever you do, don't over think it. It's not rocket science.     What's the worst you can do? Loose a few bucks. Maybe make a few extra bucks. You'll never know until you give it a shot.", "related": ["B00J6WZJIQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
