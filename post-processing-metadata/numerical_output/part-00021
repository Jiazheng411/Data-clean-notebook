The task of separating myth from history can be a daunting one. Finkelstein and Silberman, both renowned archaeologists (Finkelstein chairs the archaeology department [at Tel Aviv University; Silberman is a contributing editor to Archaeology magazine), take a different approach: integrating ancient heroic and warrior archetypes into the lives of the kings of Israel, thus synthesizing history and myth in support of the religious endeavor. The authors are careful to note that the absence of contemporary confirmation outside the Bible is no reason to believe that the characters did not actually exist. Rather, the biblical stories form the basis for a legend tradition in which the Davidic legacy gradually transforms \"from a down-to-earth political program into the symbols of a transcendent religious faith that would spread throughout the world.\" Finkelstein and Silberman, who also had a winner withThe Bible Unearthed, tell their story in a clear and easily understood manner, never boring but always challenging.Discovery Club main selection, BOMC, QPB and History book clubs alternate selection.

It's a stodgy but effective effort in which an inefficient, disorganized widget-producing outfit called Essential resolves a dire companywide communication problem just in time to avoid corporate disaster. Paul and Cox's approach is to create a series of high-level managerial characters with stereotypical business personalities. The huge cast includes Rick Riggins, the authoritarian \"get it done now\" company president; Frank Harlan, the egotistical, turf-protecting genius engineer; and Jake Foster, a slow-but-steady operations manager new to the company. Essential is about to lose its biggest client because the company can't deliver its widgets on time. The desperate Riggins hires a wise consultant named George Tracey, who guides the company through the revitalization process, starting with candid employee interviews followed by a weekend brainstorming session and a retreat. Paul and Cox do a solid job of creating believable business problems and interpersonal conflicts, though the story is broken up by having too many employees take a turn narrating in short, choppy sections. General readers will steer clear, but the novel does offer a pleasant spoonful of literary sugar for business types who want to absorb the latest management trends. (Feb.)

The 12-year-old babysits her nephew, despite the protests of her brother-in-law, Ahmed, who worries that she is too irresponsible for the job. When she flies away on a magic carpet, leaving the baby in the care of a maid, he is furious. Upon Fatima's return, Selime, believing that her sister is lonely, allows her to invite her princess friends for a visit. Also visiting is Ahmed's beguiling cousin, Yusuf. Mystery ensues when Ahmed is kidnapped and Yusuf begins redecorating the palace. Of course, the princesses, with the help of the magic carpet, uncover Yusuf's plot. This is a disappointing story. The characters seem like caricatures: Ahmed is always angry, Selime is sweet, Fatima is flighty but has a good heart, and Yusuf is smart but evil. The book's pace and suspense increase toward the end, but the solution is predictable.

I was sympathetic to their dilemma and turning\nthe pages as fast as I could to make certain they got the happily ever after\nthey deserved.I don't want to give too much of the book away because Nancy Fraser does a\nwonderfuljobwith pacing and tension, but suffice it to say--it's not an accident that Kate\nis chosen to go into the future. Matt, now that's an accident, but a delightful\none.The secondary characters are as well drawn as the main characters.

I enjoyed\nhow, despite advances in technology, people are still as flawed as always.There are so many delightful scenes, but my favorite comes when Kate and Matt\nare given magic stone that allow them to converse via their thoughts. Kate has\na slight problem keeping her mind on the conversation and the banter between\nthe two was delightful.The back of the book says that Nancy Fraser is a multi-published author of a\nvariety of genres but doesn't list her other titles.\nI'm going to find them anyway.

After a stay in the Caucasus and Crimea he was sent to Bessarabia, where he began to write more seriously, beginning Eugene Onegin and Tsygany.  In 1831 he retired to a family estate, married, and his literary output slackened.  He was mortally wounded in a duel and died in January 1837.

The story flowed very well, the characters were well developed and the sex scenes were hot! Not too many erotic romance stories can really tug at your heart strings, but this one did for me. Rachel Clark was able to bring real feelings and emotions to her characters and let the reader feel them as well... It was refreshing for me to read this and really understand where all of the characters were coming from and how they all were feeling. Bec was written in a way that would empower all women to know that there is more to life out there, even after you have been hurt, and that you can achieve what you are looking for if you reach for it. No Use by Date for Love, in my opinion, is written in a way that any reader can relate to how the characters are reacting to each other and the situations they find themselves in.

A native of Scotland but a longtime resident of America and a world traveler, in his poetry he is always an expatriate an engaged, bothered outsider mastering a new dialect even as he longs for a home he can never quite locate. I think I left home, he writes, to go home to start a new home / or something equally improbable. If he is at rest anywhere, it is in his stance of urgent ambivalence his commitment to explore, in acute detail, the uncertain summons of place, nation, knowing, desire, and romance. In his brave attempts to connect over the borders and barriers that separate us, he proves himself a truly international writer, a poet of promise and grace. - --David Groff- Winner of 2002 National Poetry Prize forTheory of DevolutionA Ryan Davidson poem moves erratically, with admirable faithfulness to his thought's tempo. The lines veer, halt, speed up, and then surrender to a voluptuous neutrality. Self-abasement is this wanderer's terra firma. His cracked, casual tone-wistful but also stumbling - has the melancholy charm of David Schubert's. I enjoy these poems because of their irreducible strangeness, and because they don't forget that art is an accident. --Wayne Koestenbaum,Hotel TheoryThis collection presents a raw and personal perspective on love, life, and everything in between; using stunningly original language and a narrative voice that whispers in the ear long after the book is closed and retired to the nightstand.Davidson's poetry is like the moment before an orgasm, that blink of time, sustained for 74 pages.

He's right: essays on Tiger Woods and Shaquille O'Neal fall flat alongside the moving soliloquies and hearth-and-home portraits making up the rest of the book (his tale of the corkball leagues of St. Louis is particularly endearing). He avoids the two demons currently plaguing sports dialogue: sentimentality and the indictment of athletes as the sole agents of sedition in sport. Attending a game during Tiger Stadium's final season, Pierce notes that he has no attachment to aging concrete, despite hailing from Boston, \"where ballparks... find themselves afflicted with talismanic characteristics, as though they were concrete Kennedys.\" Ten years after the Seoul Olympics, he wonders aloud how Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson's steroid use made him a villain, while Mark McGwire's made him a hero. One wonders, in fact, why these fluff pieces were included at all, since they tend to work at cross purposes with Pierce's thesis: \"Big games are not about trophies and banners.... [M]emories are at stake, entire lifetimes of them.\" Pierce's finely detailed pieces should resonate with any sports fan who has watched in desperate agony as his team succumbs to inadequacy, and who knows the passionate optimism that springs when the season starts anew.

Only then does it address the more traditional gardening topics of microclimate, soil, planting and pests. Shepherd's 10 principles of organic gardening-\"create space,\" \"soil is everything,\" \"make a social space,\" among them-provide underpinnings for the overlapping themes of the book, which, although light on the step-by-step instructions novices might expect, provides something less tangible but perhaps more important: a vivid taste of why gardeners love to garden.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Livingston gets to the heart of human need, with all its confusion and messiness and she does so with  textured emotion and blistering prose.” (starred review)  —Quill and Quire“The stories are often dark and disturbing, but Livingston's sardonic wit sparks moments of grace and hope amid the dark.”  —Vancouver Sun “This is smart writing in more than one sense: sharp, slick and hard-edged.

He twists.\" Martin is Alice's father; Heinrik, having killed Martin, takes part of Martin's identity and reinvents himself as Henry Lewin, a Jew, and starts a new life in Australia. Alice, saved by the Kindertransport, lands in California, marries a non-Jew and erases the un-American lilt in her voice. But her son, Raphe, is obsessed with the Jewish grandfather with whom he shares a passion for volcanoes. His urging sends Alice to Australia, where she confronts Henry Lewin. Henry dies; Alice dies. Raphe, guardian of the truth, goes to Australia with such rage inside him, it seems he might murder Henry's daughter. Despite a melodramatic ending on the rim of a volcano and a few lapses in craft and language (\"loathe\" for \"loath\"), Australian Goldsmith's fifth novel has undeniable power.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Following the suggestion of her Czech father, a WWII immigrant to Sydney, she headed to Prague with $5,000 Australian (which will, astonishingly, keep her afloat for an entire year). Staying in her father’s communist-era flat outside Prague, Weiss explored the country, met extended family, and avoided writing. Fellow ex-pats entertainingly typecast themselves: an American artist/nymphomaniac, a lovelorn young Swede, and a hard-drinking Aussie hell-bent on meeting Bohemian beauties. Weiss charms us with a touch of Bridget Jones (her love for rich Czech food quickly inciting an all-out war with her waistline; thank goodness for the Czech Republic’s bounty of picturesque hiking trails!), and triumphs when she ultimately ditches her novel in favor of this memoir. Weiss’ personal journey follows a rather predictable trajectory, and, as she herself reveals, her year in Prague was one where nothing earth-shattering occurred. However, it’s a pleasure to sit alongside her as she digests this place and the heritage she never knew she had. --Annie Bostrom", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The title story is a giddy study of the socioeconomic impact cannibalism has on a tropical island, once the inhabitants discover that their flesh is a highly desirable-and lucrative-commodity on the gourmet market. Certain tales show an exotic spirit that puts them squarely in the magic realist tradition, while others reflect self-consciousness about the craft of writing, as in \"Call Me Omniscient,\" a clever trifle in which the personified omniscient viewpoint discusses the difficulty it has working with a mediocre romance writer. Several of the best stories are narrated from unconventional perspectives, such as \"Valley of the Sugars of Salt,\" which includes the thoughts of an orchard of trees whose ugly but delicious fruit offer a lovely parable on inner beauty. All but a handful of these stories are original to the volume, which makes a fine introduction to a writer little known outsider her native Australia.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He was raised around music his whole life. His mother could sing and his father played many instruments that automatically helped develop an interest in music in him. James studied music theory(piano) since he was 5 years old. This gave him the backbone he needed to thoroughly root himself into the science of music. He went to college in North Carolina and minored in business so he could familiarize himself with the basics of business. He also became a part of a internationally, well-known drum-line called \"Cold Steel\" in college that helped polish his leadership skills. God knew what he was doing by directing him down the path he was taking because James was about to experience a dramatic lifestyle change. During his sophomore year at North Carolina A&T; State University, James was introduced to professional depths of the music industry by learning hands-on how to become a sound engineer in a professional state-of-the-art studio, while working with professional/national talent. He knew that learning engineering would be like being a car mechanic in this economy. Everyone will need one sooner or later. Working at this major studio allowed James to network with everyone involved in any session, from the executives down to the groupies, and most of all, have FREE access to use the recording studio any time he wanted. He worked as a professional sound engineer/producer and then mix engineer, for over 19 years, which gave him the most profound wisdom about how the music industry really works behind the scene. James started a company by the name of SILER Entertainment Group that would focus on artist development, music theory and business education so that the many people interested in pursuing a music career has a heads up on what they were getting themselves into. Siler Entertainment Group was founded in 2006 as a business devoted to implementing national programs that support the arts and culture, unite communities and strengthen families through non-traditional cross-cultural entertainment. SILER Entertainment's vision is to enhance awareness and appreciation to the importance of positive interaction between cultures, families and communities, by developing successful long-term relationships through partnerships with private and public resources with similar views, while exposing the negative.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His father, like his grandfather, was a barrister of good standing and high character; his mother, remarkably beautiful, accomplished, elegant, and amiable, was the object, on his part, of a profound and worshipping affection, maintained unchanged throughout the whole of his life.  Educated at the Institution of Pestalozzi, at Yverdun (Canton de Vaud), he acquired at an early age the habit of investigation and the freedom of thought of which his later life was destined to furnish so striking an example. Endowed by nature with a passion for teaching, he devoted himself, from the age of fourteen, to aiding the studies of those of his schoolfellows who were less advanced than himself; while such was his fondness for botany, that he often spent an entire day among the mountains, walking twenty or thirty miles, with a wallet on his back, in search of specimens for his herbarium. Born in a Catholic country, but educated in a Protestant one, he began, while yet a mere boy, to meditate on the means of bringing about a unity of belief among the various Christian sects, a project of religious reform at which he labored in silence for many years, but necessarily without success, the elements of the desired solution not being at that time in his possession.  Having finished his studies at Yverdun, he returned to Lyons in 1824, with the intention of devoting himself to the law; but various acts of religious intolerance to which he unexpectedly found himself subjected led him to renounce the idea of fitting himself for the bar, and to take up his abode in Paris, where he occupied himself for some time in translating Telemachus and other standard French books for youth into German. Having at length determined upon his career, he purchased, in 1828, a large and flourishing educational establishment for boys, and devoted himself to the work of teaching, for which, by his tastes and acquirements, he was peculiarly fitted. In 1830 he hired, at his own expense, a large hall in the Rue de Sevres, and opened therein courses of gratuitous lectures on Chemistry, Physics, Comparative Anatomy, and Astronomy. These lectures, continued by him through a period of ten years, were highly successful, being attended by an auditory of over five hundred persons of every rank of society, many of whom have since attained to eminence in the scientific world.  Always desirous to render instruction attractive as well as profitable, he invented an ingenious method of computation, and constructed a mnemotechnic table of French history, for assisting students to remember the remarkable events and discoveries of each reign.  Of the numerous educational works published by him may be mentioned, A Plan for the Improvement of Public Instruction, submitted by him in 1828 to the French Legislative Chamber, by which body it was highly extolled, though not acted upon; A Course of Practical and Theoretic Arithmetic, on the Pestalozzian System, for the use of Teachers and Mothers (1829); A Classical Grammar of the French Tongue (1831); A Manual for the use of Candidates for Examination in the Public Schools; with Explanatory Solutions of various Problems of Arithmetic and Geometry (1848); Normal Dictations for the Examinations of the Hotel de Ville and the Sorbonne, with Special Dictations on Orthographic Difficulties (1849) These works, highly esteemed at the time of their publication, are still in use in many French schools; and their author was bringing out new editions of some of them at the time of his death.  He was a member of several learned societies; among others, of the Royal Society of Arras, which, in 1831, awarded to him the Prize of Honor for a remarkable essay on the question, \"What is the System of Study most in Harmony with the Needs of the Epoch?\" He was for several years Secretary to the Phrenological Society of Paris, and took an active part in the labors of the Society of Magnetism, giving much time to the practical investigation of somnambulism, trance, clairvoyance, and the various other phenomena connected with the mesmeric action. This brief outline of his labors will suffice to show his mental activity, the variety of his knowledge, the eminently practical turn of his mind, and his constant endeavor to be useful to his fellow men.  When, about 1850, the phenomenon of \"table-turning\" was exciting the attention of Europe and ushering in the other phenomena since known as \"spiritist\", he quickly divined the real nature of those phenomena, as evidence of the existence of an order of relationships hitherto suspected rather than known, namely, those which unite the visible and invisible worlds. Foreseeing the vast importance, to science and to religion, of such an extension of the field of human observation, he entered at once upon a careful investigation of the new phenomena. A friend of his had two daughters who had become what are now called \"mediums.\" They were gay, lively, amiable girls, fond of society, dancing, and amusement, and habitually received, when \"sitting\" by themselves or with their young companions, \"communications\" in harmony with their worldly and somewhat frivolous disposition. But, to the surprise of all concerned, it was found that, whenever he was present, the messages transmitted through these young ladies were of a very grave and serious character; and on his inquiring of the invisible intelligences as to the cause of this change, he was told that \"spirits of a much higher order than those who habitually communicated through the two young mediums came expressly for him, and would continue to do so, in order to enable him to fulfill an important religious mission.\"  Much astonished at so unlooked-for an announcement, he at once proceeded to test its truthfulness by drawing up a series of progressive questions in relation to the various problems of human life and the universe in which we find ourselves, and submitted them to his unseen interlocutors, receiving their answers to the same through the instrumentality of the two young mediums, who willingly consented to devote a couple of evenings every week to this purpose, and who thus obtained, through table-rapping and planchette-writing, the replies which have become the basis of the spiritist theory, and which they were as little capable of appreciating as of inventing.  When these conversations had been going on for nearly two years, he one day remarked to his wife, in reference to the unfolding of these views, which she had followed with intelligent sympathy: \"It is a most curious thing! My conversations with the invisible intelligences have completely revolutionized my ideas and convictions. The instructions thus transmitted constitute an entirely new theory of human life, duty, and destiny, that appears to me to be perfectly rational and coherent, admirably lucid and consoling, and intensely interesting. I have a great mind to publish these conversations in a book; for it seems to me that what interests me so deeply might very likely prove interesting to others.\" His wife warmly approving the idea, he next submitted it to his unseen interlocutors, who replied in the usual way, that it was they who had suggested it to his mind, that their communications had been made to him, not for himself alone, but for the express purpose of being given to the world as he proposed to do, and that the time had now come for putting this plan into execution. \"To the book in which you will embody our instructions,\" continued the communicating intelligences, \"you will give, as being our work rather than yours, the title of Le Livre des Esprits (The Spirits' Book); and you will publish it, not under your own name, but under the pseudonym of Allan Kardec. Keep your own name of Rivail for your own books already published; but take and keep the name we have now given you for the book you are about to publish by our order, and, in general, for all the work that you will have to do in the fulfillment of the mission which, as we have already told you, has been confided to you by Providence, and which will gradually open before you as you proceed in it under our guidance.\"  The book thus produced and published sold with great rapidity, making converts not in France only, but all over the Continent, and rendering the name of Allan Kardec a household word\" with the readers who knew him only in connection with it; so that he was thenceforth called only by that name, excepting by his old personal friends, with whom both he and his wife always retained their family name. Soon after its publication, he founded The Parisian Society of Psychologic Studies, of which he was President until his death, and which met every Friday evening at his house, for the purpose of obtaining from spirits, through writing mediums, instructions in elucidation of truth and duty. He also founded and edited until he died a monthly magazine, entitled La Revue Spirite, Journal of Psychologic Studies, devoted to the advocacy of the views set forth in The Spirit's Book.  Similar associations were speedily formed all over the world. Many of these published periodicals of more or less importance in support of the new doctrine; and all of them transmitted to the Parisian Society the most remarkable of the spirit-communications received by them. An enormous mass of spirit-teaching, unique both in quantity and in the variety of the sources from which it was obtained, thus found its way into the hands of Allan Kardec by whom it was studied, collated, coordinated, with unwearied zeal and devotion, during a period of fifteen years. From the materials thus furnished to him from every quarter of the globe he enlarged and completed The Spirits' Book, under the direction of the spirits by whom it was originally dictated; the \"Revised Edition\" of which work, brought out by him in 1857 has become the recognized textbook of the school of Spiritualist Philosophy so intimately associated with his name.

What will obedient Brit Jinny do, in these years of women's liberation? Stand up for herself as best she can. She puts her new MO in motion as secretary to Bob Henderson, her gruff, demanding boss as the two engage in friendly banter (\"You are a cheeky bugger,\" he tells her), and Henderson's wife and six children soon become like a second family. Meanwhile, Jinny finds herself attracted to kindhearted Hal Campbell, though the twice-divorced actor doesn't appear to have marriage on his mind. Jinny's life is turned upside down again when her boss and his eldest son, Glen, are in an accident that kills both of their spouses. While ministering to the wheelchair-bound senior Henderson, Jinny finds herself drawn to his once wayward son, John. Is he the man of her dreams—or just another cad? In a genre known for predictable plots and even more predictable characters, bestseller Cookson (d. 1998) renders a sharply drawn heroine with scruples and sass in this engaging tale originally published in the U.K. in 1988. Occasionally overwrought prose does little to distract from the story of a woman hoping for romance and respect.(Jan.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Of the five writers and stories reviewed mine was the only one that had positive reviews, it was titled Blue Moon Rising. I did just the reverse, where I adapted my screenplay into manuscript form because it was a story that had strong characters and elements. There is a wealth of stories to tell and I am looking forward to sharing them with all my readers. After spending a few years writing screenplays I've discovered my first love is writing novels.

There are many interesting characters such as Zuleika herself, Wyndham Tilbury - an art expert, Sylvia - the charismatic actress suffering from Bell's palsy and currently teaching drama at the school, Sylvestra - a new pupil with her ever changing hair colour and her visions. Then there are the unpleasant ones - the cold and vaguely evil headmaster - Odo Fitzhoward, Arabella - the pupil who behaves like the devil incarnate, Jack Mallins - another unpleasant pupil. -- Damaskcat (Amazon UK)I found this book enthralling.It starts slowly but the characters and the setting draw one in until one is completely caught up with the story.\nThe sense of place is extraordinary. The abbey, its surroundings and the moodiness of North Yorkshire weather are given powerful life. The characters are individual and quirky (although the wicked headmaster is a bit of a stereotype)and develop throughout the story. You don't feel you know all about them, you feel that you are getting to know them in fits and starts.The plot is complex and with more depth than many books in the Gothic genre. Legend, history, art, music and folk lore are all thrown into the pot and stirred. -- Mrs. K. A. P. WrightI was expecting a typical teen horror story, but was pleasantly surprised.The book is set in a British boarding school, so many of the characters are teens. But many others are adults, including the main character Zuleika. Most of the characters were well-developed and enjoyable to get to know. The setting, an old Abbey converted to a manor house and then a school, was almost a character in itself. -- pat1360", "related": ["B00EXRFLBO"], "rank": 281489, "title": "Devil's Sonata: Evil never dies", "author": "Elizabeth Edmondson", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 3.8, "rating_total": 19.0}

His parents were both history teachers and amateur artists, and Adam grew up surrounded by his father's paintings of historic English battles - which left a lifelong mark on his imagination. He was also fascinated by the ancient sword and shield that hung in his father's office. Adam's father said they were a Blade family heirloom. As a boy, Adam would spend days imagining who could have first owned the sword and shield. Eventually, he created a character - Tom, the bravest boy warrior of them all. The idea for Beast Quest was born. When Adam grew up and decided that he wanted to be a writer, he was stuck for ideas - until he remembered the old sword and shield, and the imaginary boy he had created when he was young. Adam decided to bring Tom fully to life so that readers could go on the kind of adventures that he always wanted to when he was that age... And still does, even though he's grown up! When he's not writing Beast Quest books, Adam enjoys visiting museums and ancient battle sites. His main hobbies are fencing and football. He also spends a lot of time at home running around after his two exotic pets - a tarantula named Ziggy, and a capuchin monkey named Omar. These little rascals were the inspiration for two of the Beasts that Tom faces on his Quest - Arachnid and Claw. Sadly, Adam does not have his own Fire-Dragon or Horse-Man.

Everyone knows that dropping the frozen fish sticks and driving through the drive-through are better for your health, but most of us have succumbed to the convenience these things provide, especially when the media is so skilled at persuading us that our busy lives don't allow the time to prepare good, wholesome food for ourselves and for our families. However, as Bittman points out, we do seem to find the time forThe Real Housewives, Snooki, andSpongeBob SquarePants, spending an average of two hours and forty-five minutes, each day, watching television. But this Kindle Single does not aim to scold. It's meant to empower us to take control of our diets, and in doing so, we're not only helping our waistlines, but also the economy and the planet. Moreover, the communal benefits of cooking at home with family and friends are not to be underestimated, and you don't need to possess Bittman's culinary gifts to enjoy them. Take it from someone who has ruined JELL-O (don't judge), there are plenty of easy, tasty, and nutritious meals that you can put on the table. Sure, it's going to take longer than it takes for you to warm a White Castle in the microwave, but as Bittman convincingly contends, the rewards outweigh the added efforts. --Erin Kodicek", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "Cooking Solves Everything: How Time in the Kitchen Can Save Your Health, Your Budget, and Even the Planet (Kindle Single)", "author": "Mark Bittman", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.25, "rating_total": 34.0}

After much research and many years of studying and discovering more about God's Word on this subject, she began applying it to the deep issues in her own life. This further led to her receiving many divine revelations that have brought about her own deliverance and enlightenment with the assistance of others. Now, the Lord has led her to write this book, which is a gripping account of her unusual journey. Eliana now has a passion for those who are spiritually wounded or in bondage and  strongly believes that persons who are bound up in sins and generational curses, can be set FREE from all yokes and bondage-but first, they need to know.  WITH THESE BROKEN WINGS is her first book; and is an attempt to share this knowledge with others who may also need to be free.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When I was two years old my parents moved us to Patterson , Missouri; to live on a farm. And finally in 1977 they bought a home in Piedmont, Missouri; where I grew up. I am now 38 years old. Twenty four years ago I was raped by a family friend who took my virginity after ten tears of being molested by my eldest brother due to his drug and alcohol addiction. It started when we moved to Piedmont and I was only four years old, and ended after the rape. This caused me many problems growing up and in my twenties. I was hospitalized a couple times for mental breakdowns and attempted suicide. I didn't want to kill myself until after I learned that the rapist gave my Clamydia and I had a severe case of Endometriosis that forced me to have a Hysterectomy when I was thirty three. It was in 2003 that I chose to die instead of drinking all my sadness and depression away. In rehab I met my now husband Jason who took all that pain away and turned my life and his own around. We have been clean and sober since April 2004. We married May 6th 2006. He gave me four beautiful stepsons that I have been privileged to raise as my own. We have the best relationship that I could ever pray for. They call me Mommy or Mommy Stacy. The youngest are twins named Trent and Zachary which are now eleven and Devin who is now twelve and the eldest is Skyler who is now fifteen. The twins were four and Devin was five and Skyler was eight when I walked into their lives and we became a real family. I battle bi-polar, OCD, and panic disorder, PTSD from the sexual abuse, along with Choric banding Shingles. I can't keep a job to save my life. But I can clean and cook and do laundry and i always wanted to be a Cosmetologist. So, I cut everyone's hair in my family. I am talented but unable to go to school because of my fear of driving. And of course four boys are very expensive with a house payment and truck payment and utilities. I can't forget about sports. I have been a soccer", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Expelled from his circus home after his carelessness causes a death, he first wanders and then flees  across the crumbling Ferupian Empire into daemon-infested Raw. He acquires a companion, Rae, who was  born in Kirekune (with whom Ferupe has been at war for 100 years), and who is also an exile, excluded  forever from belonging anywhere by the lengths she has gone to for acceptance. Their world is fantastically  dark, warlike, and corrupt, and the visions Crispin has of a city destroyed by holocaust suggest that the end  is near. Separated from Rae in Pilkinson's Shadowtown, Crispin goes on without her, transferring his  allegiance to the Ferupian Air Force and its daemon-powered planes, but there, too, he is an outsider,  despite his flying skill.Everends without resolution. The journeys (inner and outer) that Felicity Savage depicts are  interesting, but incomplete. Savage's writing is rough, sometimes overdone, and Crispin's episodic life  seems to have little effect on him; although he is the central character, we do not know much more about  him at the end than we did at the beginning. Savage leaves plenty of hints and loose ends for another  volume or two, and Crispin's story is by no means whole, so the ultimate quality of this book depends  entirely on what follows.", "related": ["B00BHRQQDA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

On returning to the UK, after a short spell in Dorset, he settled in Wales in 1935 where he lived for the rest of his long life. Those are the bare bones of his life. In some senses they seem unimportant when set alongside his extraordinary writing career. Not only was output prodigious, it was like nothing else in English Literature. Indeed, George Steiner has made the bold claim that his works are 'the only novels produced by an English writer that can fairly be compared to the fictions of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky'. And even that doesn't touch on their multifarious strangeness.John Cowper Powys wrote compulsively: letters, diaries, short stories, fantasies, poetry, literary criticism, philosophy and, above all, novels poured out of him. He also wrote a remarkable autobiography. In addition to hisAutobiographyhis masterpieces are considered to beWolf Solent,Glastonbury Romance,Weymouth SandsandPorius. But his lesser, or less well-known, works shouldn't be overlooked, they spring from the same weird, mystical, brilliant and obsessive imagination.John Cowper Powys is a challenging author with an impressive list of admirers. In addition to George Steiner, these have included Robertson Davies, Margaret Drabble, Theodore Dreiser, Henry Miller, J. B.

When asked at the age of four what I wanted to be when I grew up, my answer was \"an artist and a writer\".  Dreams have come and gone since then, but that one wish never dwindled.  Art in every medium was the hobby that everyone around me witnessed, but only those closest to me really understood my passion for fiction.      Many of the characters from the Midian Saga had their start in children's games when my sister, Becka, and I played dolls.  Evolving through the decades since, they have taken on a life of their own in my heart.  Even though they no longer resemble an eight-year-old's fantasy, I still feel as though I've grown up with the heroes of Midia.  Though I knew I could never give the brave and often tragic events of Midia the justice they deserved, I had to share them with the world.      I hope that you enjoy the first book in the Midian Saga, and invite to you to return to this fantastic world with me in the next book, \"The Fallen Shadow\". ~Kimber Grey", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As Kirtley so ably demonstrates, there are many sides to Lynda Barry's career, andLynda Barry: Girlhood through the Looking Glassis the first place where they have been assembled with the critical synthesis they deserve.\"--Isaac Cates,Department of English, University of Vermont\"Kirtley brings just the right combination of wit, wisdom and creative quirkiness to this important first academic study of the witty, wise and mercurial Lynda Barry. Focusing on Barry's lifelong engagement with the inner lives of girls across various graphic forms--comic strips, illustrated novels, graphic memoirs, and autobiographical workshop texts--Kirtley brilliantly avoids the trap of trying to pin Barry down within either comics or American literary history, instead allowing Barry's career as an 'image-wrangler' to define its own rules and ultimately its own canon.\"--Jared Gardner, author ofProjections: Comics and the History of 21st-Century Storytelling\"I thought I knew about Lynda Barry, until I read Susan Kirtley'sLynda Barry: Girlhood through the Looking Glass. In each chapter, Kirtley gives us new, provocative interpretations of such diverse Barry texts as theNaked Ladies! Naked Ladies! Naked Ladies!coloring book,The Good Times Are Killing Meplay, the novelCruddyand the graphic novelWhat It Is. Kirtley's writing--a combination of enviable clarity and the savvy application of narratology, comic art theory, and other ideas--does justice to Barry's kaleidoscopic take on troubled American girlhood.

The Melrose novels are a masterwork for the twenty-first century, by one of our greatest prose stylists' Alice Sebold 'A memorable tour de force' New York Times Book Review 'I've loved Edward St Aubyn's Patrick Melrose novels. Read them all, now' David Nicholls 'St Aubyn's Melrose series slices and dices morality with prose so chiselled and a narrative so intense that the hairs on the back of your neck stand up' Geordie Greig, Evening Standard 'A masterpiece. Edward St Aubyn is a writer of immense gifts' Patrick McGrath 'The wit of Wilde, the lightness of Wodehouse, the waspishness of Waugh. A joy' Zadie Smith 'Perhaps the most brilliant English novelist of his generation' Alan Hollinghurst 'Humor, pathos, razor-sharp judgement, pain, joy and everything in between. The Melrose novels are a masterwork for the 21st century, by one of our greatest prose stylists' Alice Sebold 'From the very first lines I was completely hooked ... By turns witty, moving and an intense social comedy, I wept at the end but wouldn't dream of giving away the totally unexpected reason' Antonia Fraser, Sunday Telegraph 'Blackly comic, superbly written fiction ... His style is crisp and light; his similes exhilarating in their accuracy ... St Aubyn writes with luminous tenderness of Patrick's love for his sons' Caroline Moore, Sunday Telegraph 'Wonderful caustic wit ... Perhaps the very sprightliness of the prose -- its lapidary concision and moral certitude -- represents the cure for which the characters yearn. So much good writing is in itself a form of health' Edmund White, Guardian 'St Aubyn puts an entire family under a microscope, laying bare all its painful, unavoidable complexities. At once epic and intimate, appalling and comic, the novels are masterpieces, each and every one' Maggie O'Farrell 'Beautifully written, excruciatingly funny and also very tragic' Mariella Frostrup, Sky Magazine 'His prose has an easy charm that masks a ferocious, searching intellect. As a sketcher of character, his wit -- whether turned against pointless members of the aristocracy or hopeless crack dealers -- is ticklingly wicked. As an analyser of broken minds and tired hearts he is as energetic, careful and creative as the perfect shrink. And when it comes to spinning a good yarn, whether over the grand scale or within a single page of anecdote, he has a natural talent for keeping you on the edge of your seat' Melissa Katsoulis, The Times 'The Patrick Melrose novels can be read as the navigational charts of a mariner desperate not to end up in the wretched harbor from which he embarked on a voyage that has led in and out of heroin addiction, alcoholism, marital infidelity and a range of behaviors for which the term 'self-destructive' is the mildest of euphemisms. Some of the most perceptive, elegantly written and hilarious novels of our era... Remarkable' Francine Prose, New York Times 'Irony courses through these pages like adrenaline ... Patrick's intelligence processes his predicaments into elegant, lucid, dispassionate, near-aphoristic formulations ... Brimming with witty flair, sardonic perceptiveness and literary finesse' Peter Kemp, Sunday Times 'A humane meditation on lives blighted by the sins of the previous generation. St Aubyn remains among the cream of British novelists' Sunday Times 'The main joy of a St Aubyn novel is the exquisite clarity of his prose, the almost uncanny sense he gives that, in language as in mathematical formulae, precision and beauty invariably point to truth ... Characters in St Aubyn novels are hyper-articulate, and the witty dialogue is here, as ever, one of the chief joys' Suzi Feay, Financial Times 'The darkest possible comedy about the cruelty of the old to the young, vicious and excruciatingly honest. It opened my eyes to a whole realm of experience I have never seen written about. That's the mark of a masterpiece' The Times 'One of the most amazing reading experiences I've had in a decade.'

When tales of the Great War became the rage, and aviation excitement grabbed reader interest, Rogers directed his fiction to the air war markets with numerous stories written for Wings, Air Stories, Air War, War Stories, War Novels and Flying Stories among others. By the 1930s, he was selling to the better paying pulp markets of Argosy and All-American Fiction and quickly transitioned into the detective field with sales to Detective Fiction Weekly, Detective Tales, Detective Book Magazines, and New Detective.  After World War II, Rogers continued selling fiction to such slick market magazines as The Saturday Evening Post and turning out new mystery shorts for Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine.

A romance about a little boy she liked\nat the time.Her first book, Centauri Dawn is based on a dream she had one night when she\nwas about fifteen. She was a princess from Alpha Centauri and her family was\ncoming for her to take her back home. Of course, now she knows all teenagers\nthink thisassome time or another. None of them want to think they belong to\nthe crazy family they have. But the dream stuck with her and she decided it\nwould make a great story. CA credits her wonderfully supportive husband Jim and the great\nfriends she's made atCRWfor saving her sanity and allowing her to explore her\ncreativity.", "related": ["B006VBAIRM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jones. I first learned his name in an e-mail I sent to Lt. Col. (ret) Lou Nigro, who runs the excellent Selfridge Military and Air Museum at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Mich.I had simply asked Nigro if he knew who the first base commander was at Selfridge. I had hoped to scare up enough information on the first commander for a short historical article. In my position as an enlisted public affairs specialist for the 127th Wing of the Michigan Air National Guard at Selfridge, I periodically am able to combine my interest with history with my tasking to create articles for the wing newsletter. I had written similar articles on Thomas E. Selfridge, the man for whom the base was named, and other topics over the years. A quick Google search on Jones, however, suggested I was on to something bigger.While I worked on the Jones project at home, I would regularly update my co-workers at Selfridge on the latest information I had found. Their enthusiasm, particularly that of Capt. Penny Carroll, the 127th Wing's public affairs officer, kept me digging for more.I must admit that I was often amazed at the material that I was able to find via a simple search on the internet. That is where most of my material was gathered. No internet search could ever match the excitement of some hands-on sleuthing. As such, a highlight in my research was a visit around Thanksgiving 2011 to the Benson FordResearch Center, which is part of the magnificent Henry Ford center in Dearborn, Mich. Why that center, which holds a rich collection of automotive history, also had a copy of Jones' book is a mystery. It is the only known, publicly-held copy of the book in the state of Michigan.The libraries at the Air Force's Air University and the Army's Center of Military History both provided resources that were highly beneficial . The staff at the Air University was willing to dig up a book from an offsite storage facility, just to send me a PDF copy of an entry on Jones. At the Army's CMH, a copy of Jones' official military biography was on file in a collection of biographies of Army generals (which has a few colonels sprinkled in). I was beside myself when I discovered Jones' name in CMH's listing of biographies.I worked as a newspaper reporter for almost 20 years before becoming a full-time military public affairs specialist for the Michigan Air National Guard. During my time as a reporter, I often took pride in the saying that newspaper reporters were writing the \"first draft of history.\" Snippets from numerous newspaper accounts were used in this report. I salute my long-ago predecessors for their diligence.Historical research is a fascinating endeavor. It has been made immensely easier to do, at least in the time period that I was searching, by the efforts of countless individuals and organizations that have created searchable online copies of numerous books, magazines, newspapers and similar products. For all their efforts, I am incredibly grateful.Finally, as an Air Force veteran, I salute Col. Jones and all those who have played a role--past and present--in creating what has become the world's greatest military service in the world's greatest country. It is an honor to serve as your wingman.", "related": [], "rank": 2922445, "title": "Forgotten Aviator", "author": "Dan Heaton", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Orehek is a doctor of internal medicine and pediatrics. He is the founder of the Medical Prevention Center(tm) and Dementia Prevention Center(tm) and has applied years of intensive research and study into developing a new paradigm for empowering individuals and their medical professionals. In this groundbreaking book that it is logical, compassionate, and efficacious for medical professionals to perform exploratory tests to catch conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, cancers, and stroke in their infancy. Doing so allows doctors to help patients apply preventative measures before symptoms ever develop. This opens with an impassioned introduction followed by several tone-setting chapters that do an excellent job of preparing the reader for a distinctive delivery style. He writes well and does a good job of explaining the science behind his theories in a conversational manner. Medical consumers must take the initiative in demanding preventative tests. - nine chapters to specific diseases or groups of diseases, and to the tests to discern whether one has the potential for these diseases. This emotionally charged, manifesto-like thread woven through the text is invaluable and eye-opening, and could forever shift how one approaches his or her health and medical care. There are several minor caveats to an unequivocal endorsement of this exceptional book. The title is odd, and there is an abundance of redundancies throughout the volume. Some of the illustrations appear both amateurish and confusing. Fortunately, none of these issues truly detract from the quality of the content. Prevention is Difficult-But Possible is a book that every medical consumer and medical provider should read. For those determined to live until one hundred, the hundred-year-old wanting to live another decade, and the medical doctor seeking ways to help patients reach their goals, Orehek's seminal work is recommended.

He studied Communication and Media studies at Pace University's New York Campus, and wrote as a hobby. Some of his first stories were written out of boredom and sent to friends, He was certain they were just as bored. These works slowly took shape and would become the basis for many of the works he has done.

First, because in part this was the second story I wrote a long time ago. It was at least half in length and very poorly developed, but I still loved it and wanted to do something with it. It spent 3 years with a publisher and finally, I had my rights back and the opportunity to revisit it. To make it what I intended it to be.Second, in this story I mention one of my favorite places in the world - Ascoli Piceno in Italy. This place has great meaning because it's where one of my dearest friends lives. We had met when we were both children. I saw her name in a magazine for kids and tweens. She was looking for people who had a passion for a certain Japanese cartoon - \"Lady Oscar\". The rest is history. I immediately wrote to her (didn't have email at the time, so it had to be snail mail) and told her I was crazy about that cartoon and, can we be friends? We met some time later in Rome. We had our families with us and were treated to some delectable Roman meals - pizza one day, and risotto with squash and mozzarella another day. To die for. Years later, when we both grew up, my friend was in emotional trouble. She felt lonely because the love of her life had traveled to some place far away and she hadn't seen him in a long time. I left everything and went to Ascoli Piceno to spend some time with her... and I fell in love with this place. So, it was no surprise I had to put it in a book. Today, my friend and I still communicate, and there's still the mutual love of \"Lady Oscar\" that binds us. I suppose there are things one never grows out of :).Ascoli Piceno is the perfect backdrop for a couple to mend their broken hearts. It is old, it has character, and it welcomes you with a quiet smile. It is not glamorous like Rome or Milan, but its buildings also have stood the test of time. It is solid and full of stories to tell. My characters, Dane and Lisbeth Marsh, can surely feel its magic.I hope you feel its magic too...", "related": ["B00D45RC6I"], "rank": 2302987, "title": "Lovestruck in Italy (Moonlight Love Match Book 2)", "author": "Natalie G.

The writing is matter-of-fact, with the design shouldering a lot of the load to distinguish each woman. Photos and reproductions of printed items, mostly black-and-white, lend context. Very useful for reports, the collective perspective establishes a through line of significance: with courage, perseverance, and determination, these women changed their lives as well as the lives of those who came after them.

The turning point in his life was his encounter with Jesus Christ, which has since blossomed into an affectionate and exemplary relationship. Having been tried in the furnace of diverse challenges, one of which was waiting on God for the fruit of the womb for over a decade, he encourages others by sharing proven principles of faith and patience.

Dudley was born in California in 19--, in what will undoubtedly go down in the history books as a dark year indeed for literature. An outcast due to his penchant for modestly altering his personal history, he ran away at age 18 to New York City to find fame and glamor in the New York literary world. He didn't. In 1993, Ian was forcibly committed to the New York Municipal Hospital for the Criminally Insane. It was there that he created the Marlowe and the Spacewoman series, of which The Santa Claus Gang is the second entry. Such is the nature of his insanity, he wrote this second story prior to the first book. Hospital orderlies regularly tried to re-establish Ian's sense of time's linearity, but the electroshock sessions were either too infrequent or involved too low a voltage. Ian has written numerous unpublished works of fiction and non-fiction, the titles of which are too terrible to duplicate here, except for The Killer Party: How to Host A Murder Mystery. The promotional activities for that book are what led to his incarceration. In 1996, Ian escaped from the New York Municipal Hospital for the Criminally Insane. He is believed to have migrated to the West Coast, where enforcement of the rules of grammar is less stringent. His exact location is unknown, and no current photos of him are available. Ian has never won, nor will he ever will win, any literary awards for his efforts. He is, however, the prime suspect in the theft of five Hugos, three Nebulas, and, for some inexplicable reason, a Bram Stoker award. His command of the English language has been said to be deadly, though readers will have to decide for themselves if that is a compliment or an insult. If you see Ian, do not engage him in conversation (in English, at least), but contact local law enforcement.", "related": [], "rank": 3224300, "title": "The Santa Claus Gang (Marlowe and the Spacewoman Book 2) eBook", "author": "Ian M.

The well-known literary figures have interesting life stories. For example, Morrison tells about the trials and triumphs that affected the woman's daily life and ultimately her decision to write. Likewise, Myers had a nontraditional upbringing that has greatly influenced his work. He has fought against criticism and even censorship of several of his books. Staying true to himself has earned him several awards and recognition in the literary world. Angelou has many accomplishments, from working with Martin Luther King, Jr., in his fight for civil rights to composing and reading a poem for President Clinton's inauguration. These individuals have in common their struggle for a better life; whether they came from humble beginnings or not, they triumphed through hard times and have influenced many people around them. Unfortunately, the lack of photographs or any illustrative material to break up the texts is a real drawback. Also, while the publisher touts these as new titles, Jordan's and Kramer's books were originally published in the 1990s and while a few updates have been made, the presentations seem a bit dated.-Carol Hirsche, Provo City Library, UTα(c) Copyright 2011.

The painful truth is that I suffered through 35 jobs after I left the Navy. More than anything, however, I wanted my life to be filled with art. In 2005, I woke up in a Veteran’s Administration hospital. The diagnosis was for PTSD and a degenerative back injury, both going back to an accident in Vietnam.

What follow is a delightfully funny account of two teenagers experiencing the delights of big cities, bright lights, cafe life and quaint little towns. The insights into Europe from a young person's viewpoint are spot-on. (Heidelberger)Peregrine Merritt is now an ex-student grappling with an un-caring labour market. He presents a gangly adolescent male view of the world and lives life to the max, every minute filled with action, reaction and dramatic enjoyment that explodes off the page. What makes this book a cut above just entertainment is the ironic counterpoint of the author - we can empathise with those who love him to exasperation. - Linnet Hunter (ABR)By the time I finished Stepping on Mussels I was smiling and sighing, partly at Peregrine's adventures and misadventures, partly at the memories of my first overseas trip that Harewood had evoked. This is an Australian rite of passage, with Peregrine taking his first step out into the world. The transformation of depressed, dope-smoking Skegs into the motivated lover Gary is moving and convincing and Perr's own changes, while less dramatic, are equally effective. This is a feel-good book, but one set among the gritty realities of everyday life. (Viewpoint)This is the third Peregrine Merritt book.

Other surprises await. At Nick’s grandmother’s old house, they find a shady business operating, and when they report it to the police, they begin to receive threats. Solving the mystery requires, as it always does in this series, plenty of rummaging about in family history. This time its Nick’s ancestors, who worked in the town’s textile mills as children, who provide the key. This smart series, full of fascinating material on genealogical research, should be recommended to members of library genealogy clubs. --Amy Alessio", "related": [], "rank": 1126097, "title": "Overlooker (A Suzie Fewings Genealogical Mystery Book 5)", "author": "Fay Sampson", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I first read The Impostor and immediately thought WOW!\nThen I began reading the second in this series Obsession and Sacrifice and I\nwas blown away! This book doesn't skip a beat it picks up right were The\nImpostor leaves off. I was completely into this story. It has the right\ncombination of suspense and romance without being over done. Obsession and\nSacrifice did totally deliver for me. I was not disappointed in this story at\nall. Tiffany Carmouche does an awesome job of taking you through the story and\nmaking you want more.The characters in this book are so well written it's as though you are them\ngoing through all the frustration and sacrifices they each make. Nichole trying\nto regain her memory, Dylan wanting nothing more than for Nichole to remember\nhow much he loves her, and Bradley who desperately wants to do the right thing\nbut is caught up in his secret of the heart. I absolutely fell head over heels\nin love with this book. I could sit here and write for hours on how great\nObsession and Sacrifice but, I won't as I am not going to give away any of it's\nsecrets. You must discover them on your own. So what are you waiting for go\npick up a copy or two of the series and discover The Alaska Trilogy for yourself.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 36, "rating_average": 4.8333, "rating_total": 174.0}

Dilloway has been a writer for most of his life. He completed his first story in third grade and received an ‘A’ for the assignment. Around that time he also placed in a local writing contest for a television station, receiving an action figure in lieu of a trophy, thus securing his love with the written word. Since then he’s continued to spend most of his free time writing and editing. In the last twenty years he’s completed nearly forty novels of various genres. Two of those novels are already indie published. Where You Belong is the heartwarming story of a man in search of himself and his place in the world. Virgin Territory is a suspenseful tale of a man who finds love from beyond the grave. He’s also indie published a volume of short stories collectively titled The Carnival Papers. A Hero’s Journey is P.T.’s first superhero novel, born from his love of old TV shows like “Superfriends” and the 1960s “Batman” TV series, both of which he spent much time watching in reruns growing up in rural Michigan, as well as more recent theatrical offerings like “The Dark Knight” and “Watchmen.” A Hero’s Journey tells the story of a young woman who finds a suit of magic armor that allows her to save the world—and herself. When not writing, P.T. enjoys reading and photographing Michigan’s many lighthouses. In order to pay the bills, he earned an accounting degree from Saginaw Valley State University in 2000 and for the past ten years has worked as a payroll accountant in Detroit. He lives in suburban Detroit, where he continues to work on new writing projects. If you want to find him, just search the Panera Breads and Starbuckses near Detroit on weekends.", "related": ["B00JER0ZGY"], "rank": 31671, "title": "Chance of a Lifetime (Chances Are #1)", "author": "P.T.

Some people wanted me to remove those mistakes, to make her into the perfect fairy-tale princess whose feet don't touch the ground. But life isn't simple, it isn't clean, and we can't just hit rewind if we don't like the decisions we made. Mae stayed the way she was, flaws and all. She's not perfect, and she doesn't pretend to be. Keli and Peter aren't perfect either.Mae's journey took me to some places I never wanted to see, and I met some amazing people. I also met one that I could have done without, but he was an integral part of the story so Justin stays as well.Sometimes I cringe at what comes out of my head.If you enjoyed this book, please leave a review on your favorite retailer's website and consider telling others about it.Lauren", "related": ["B00DOM107I"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The challenges of a science/practitioner model have been one of the most hotly debated topics in psychology for decades—i.e. the rigors of academic science vs. the practice of psychology. Yet, inFailure to Launch, DeVine takes us on a journey to understand narcissism today by incorporatingboththe science and practice of psychology.Through DeVine’s honest and lucid writing style, he integrates counseling theory, family systems theory, psychiatry, and cutting edge neurological research. With ease, he guides us to an understanding of how his generation bridges the ‘Baby Boomers’ and the ‘Millenials.’ He writes with passion and verve. The case examples are wonderfully clear examples of real life happening all around us. This is a book for everyday people and those of us honored and privileged enough to work with narcissism as it is seen today through the eyes of a brilliant young mind—a mind willing to mirror the truth back to us, even when we prefer not to see it. This book is a must read for any professional with ‘stuck’ individuals, as well as their families who often unwittingly contribute to the ‘failure to launch.’”(Larry Bugen, PhD, private practice, author of \"Stuck on Me, Missing You: Getting Past Self-Absorption to Find Love\")“The topic of dependent adult children is one that needs to be addressed. Clinicians who work with the young adult population have long been forecasting this generational issue of a 'failure to launch.' Thus, it is no surprise that Michael's work is filling a need for clinicians at just the right time.Michael has done his research. While this book looks at the sociological dynamics of the trend of overly dependent adult children, Michael also provides concrete, practical ways in which clinicians can address this problem. For this reason and many more, I strongly recommend Michael Devine's Failure to Launch.”(Roger L.

The nun's body is found outside a luxurious brothel where Malone starts the investigation that leads to an artist known as Miss O'Keefe, who turns out to be Brigid Hourigan, the victim's mother. He learns that the young woman was illegitimate, unacknowledged by Bridgid's millionaire father, Fingal, and her brother, Archbishop Kerry Hourigan. The influential old man's associates, like a small army, form powerful barriers to the detective. But he digs deep, looking for clues in the nun's service to the needy in Nicaragua, in Fingal's early years in Chicago and the source of his fortune. The sad truth closes the case, one of the hero's most intricate and exciting.

The author of this book is well placed to tell the story of this famous aircraft as he not only flew it but helped to design it. Consequently we are treated to a most comprehensive account of the ME 262, from the initial development stages through to its belated entry into service during the final months of 1944. Ziegler correctly focuses on the reasons behind this late arrival as it could have reached the front line much earlier, and may well have had a significant impact on the efforts of the Allies to win air supremacy over the continent. Yet Hitler's peculiar conviction that it should only be developed as a bomber, rather than the fighter which it quite clearly was, resulted in it only coming into service once that battle was effectively over. Despite numerous successes, the Luftwaffe's dwindling resources and pilots were faced with the insurmountable, and it became apparent that even a miracle weapon could only do so much. - Pegasus Archive  Written by someone who was closely involved with its design and testing.

She first decided to become an author at about age 7 when she discovered Narnia (sadly not in the back of a wardrobe but on a bookshelf in the school library). Once she realised the written word could transport her from the humdrum of daily life,she was hooked. C S Lewis led her to Kenneth Graham and then Enid Blyton, until a teenage diet of Errol Flynn movies and Jean Plaidy novels inspired her love affair with history. Fair Game came about by accident; Anna was writing a book which involved flash-backs to the seventeenth century, which she sent to a literary consultancy for help with editing. They loved the historical element of the story and suggested it could hold its own as a novel in its own right, so she set about a new draft. Essentially a love story, Fair Game is based in the 17th century, during the English civil war. The plot and setting came about when Anna read about the women who took on the defence of their homes when their husbands left to fight. The novel was written to celebrate these women’s ingenuity and courage. Anna was also drawn to the 1640s because of the religious upheaval taking place alongside the political unrest; the new religions pitted against each other, only united in one respect – the persecution of ‘witches’.

Commander Rilas relayed the message, then came over.\"I thought we would never get here.\" He put\nhis hands behind his head and arched his back with a groan. \"That journey\nseemed to take forever.\"\"I know.\" She watched the tired crew of submariner\nElves--jovial now they were bound for shore leave--jostle each other as they made\ntheir way aft, eager to climb the ladder to the fresh air above. One of them started\nsinging, and others joined in with the winter-song, filling the sub with festive\ncheer. \"Still,\" she admitted, \"at least we made it in time for Frostmoon. For a\nwhile I thought we would miss the whole holiday.\"\"Hmm, I--\" Rilas stopped as the intercom on\nthe post before them glowed.Brushing aside the tinsel someone had\ndraped over the box, they both pressed a finger onto the brass lever and\nconcentrated on the incoming telepathic message. The arcanium transmission sent\na tingle all the way up Ellanor's arm to her scalp.Conn,\nESP, announced the voice in her mind, filtered\nthrough the closed channel so only those touching the intercom could hear it.Rilas sent a thought back, and Eleanor\nheard it in her head.Conn, aye?Lieutenant Nimmeth, the ESP Operator, replied.Sir, Rear Admiral Silversun would like to\nsee the captain.Unease stirred in Ellanor's stomach like a\nsleeping bear poked with a stick. She sent a thought through to Nimmeth,\nknowing Rilas would pick it up.Captain\nhere. Tell him to rein his horses in. I will be going ashore very shortly.No... Sorry,\nCaptain. I mean, he has requested to come on board.She lifted her finger from the button and exchanged\nan exasperated look with Rilas, thinking damn Silversun and his pompous\ndemands! Then she depressed the button again.All right. Clear him for entry. Conn out.ESP,\naye.She lifted her hand off the lever, disabling\nthe telepathic connection, and scowled.Around them, other officers went through\nthe motions of finishing up the day's tasks before they left the boat. Ellanor\nmoved closer to Rilas. \"This is not good news,\" she whispered close to his ear,\ntrying to act casual.\"I am tempted to slip out of the portholes\nand swim away,\" he murmured in return.The corner of her mouth quirked up. \"We do not\nhave portholes, Commander, or perhaps that has escaped your attention?\"\"I could carve one.\"\"Through a three-inch-thick steel double\nhull?\"Rilas snorted. \"I would do it to escape\nSilversun. You know why they call him Rear Admiral? Because his tongue is so\nfar up the Vice Admiral's arse that he is licking his tonsils.\"She stifled a laugh at his irreverence. It\nwas difficult to argue with her XO when she happened to agree with him.With a joint sigh, they pulled on their\npeaked hats, turned to face the corridor and waited for Silversun to make his\nway through the sub to the control centre.As she waited, Ellanor straightened her\njacket, conscious that she probably looked as if she'd spent six weeks at sea\nwithout a glimpse of daylight. Her skin had lost the tan she'd acquired while\non shore leave the previous summer at Sherova Beach, and she feared she'd blend\nin with the snowy Frostmoon landscape. Even though her uniform was freshly\nwashed and pressed and her blonde hair scooped up in a neat chignon, she felt\ngrimy and tatty, more than ready for a two-hour soak in a hot bath with one of\nthose melt-in-the-mouth cherry pastries her sister made and a glass of\nexpensive red wine.Except... She heaved a sigh, prompting an\namused look from Rilas. \"What?\" he said.\"I have just remembered the High Council's\nnew edict for Frostmoon.\"Rilas stared at her, then tipped his head back\nand stared at the ceiling. \"Sharks and shellfish. I had forgotten.\"\"Sorry.\"\"I was really looking forward to a tankard\nof ale.\"\"I know.\"\"It has been six weeks, Ellanor...\"\"They did have their reasons,\" she reminded\nhim, loyalty making her instinctively defensive.He dropped his head to stare at her. \"You\nreally think a prohibition law is going toreducecrime?\"\"That is the plan. You have to admit, it has\nbeen bad in the city lately.\"\"Banning alcohol is not the answer; it makes\neveryone who enjoys a glass of punch a criminal. Reducing crime may be the\nreason they are giving. But their real motivation is that the blockade of\nMandaria means there will not be enough wine to go around and the king wants to\nkeep what is left to himself.\"\"Rilas,\" she said sharply.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the process of researching food and exercise for her own family’s wellness, and to develop TransferofHealth.com, she has met and developed relationships with countless bloggers, dietitians, foodies, naturopaths, and other health and wellness professionals, as well as fitness experts. Tiffany and her husband of over twenty years, Duane, have three grown children. Both grew up in scenic Skagit County in Northwest Washington, where they sold real estate for over eighteen years. Tiffany was active in the community, business organizations, and her church, where she sang with several of the worship teams at Christ the King Community Church locations in Northwest Washington. She moved to Austin, Texas, with her family in 2008, then to Columbus, Montana, in 2012. She continues to thrive in the business world where she assists entrepreneurs, management, and employees in a variety of industries including real estate and finance. You can see what Tiffany is working on now by visiting her LinkedIn profile at www.linkedin.com/in/tiffanyyoungren/. Tiffany has always loved to cook, and considers herself a huge foodie. Nutrition has been an interest of Tiffany’s for some time, and she has an innate fondness for physical fitness. She was an athlete in high school, and enjoyed sampling many of the workouts featured in her new book, Better Body Wannabe, including P90X, yoga, pilates, and Zumba.  Fitness has also played a big role in Tiffany’s interest in health and longevity. Like readers of her book, Tiffany struggles with making time to work out—and talking herself into doing it when she does have time. Compiling the trainers’ interviews for Better Body Wannabe has allowed her to see that fitness is a lifestyle, not an event—a truly encouraging thought! She sincerely hopes the book encourages others as well.", "related": [], "rank": 3141194, "title": "Better Body Wannabe: 12 Top Trainers Reveal the Real Skinny on Eating and Exercising for a More Healthy, Happy, and Fit YOU", "author": "Tiffany Youngren", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As an Author, I try to keep my stories as tasteful as possible while still remaining true to my characters. The men in my stories are over the top Alpha males, who will do anything to get the woman that they have set their sights set on. If any of these things offend you, then this is not the series for you.  I do not write stories that leave you hanging in hopes of you having to buy the next book. My stories are complete and will not leave you feeling as if you were forced into buying a sequel. Though my books come in series, each book is capable of standing alone and can be read without having to go through a numerical sequence. I also go out of my way to keep my pricing fair to the reader, because these books are 'self-published' and they are not as long as a standard published book would be. I chose to self-publish these fiction books in order to build up a fan base. As is the case of any other writer, I am growing and learning daily. I am constantly researching and studying in order to better myself for the people who enjoy my books. As my fan base grows and finances come along with that growth, I can promise my readers the traditional published and edited books. Though I am not a world renowned Author, I do have a very vivid imagination and the capability to tell a very emotive and provoking story. I look forward to growing with you and for you, because in my world it is all about you the reader. I hope that you enjoy reading my stories as much as I enjoyed writing them for you.", "related": ["B00CWN8R1C"], "rank": 553290, "title": "The Executioner", "author": "Suzanne Steele", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He also always popped up when we viewers least suspected him.  We knew little about him except that he had escaped from a mental asylum and a few other details.  Although I'm not a fan of slasher flix, when I wrote WINGS OF HONOR the idea of an unnamed, unknown killer intrigued me.  However, the killer in my book seems more human than Michael Myers, almost like your neighbor next door.  Plus, although he does pop up when other pilots least suspect, he's not invincible.  I've included a few clues about the killer in the book, but they may be hard to find. I mention this because one of the tips we writers often hear is that when we submit work to editors don't explain anything to them. However, often when I sent this book to an editor I'd get back a note stating ---- was wrong (I'm not going to spoil the book). I'd write back \"Yes it's wrong. It's a clue about the killer!\" I don't think the publishers liked that. Anyway, I hope you do like this book and can find some of these subtle clues.Something else happens in the book that publishers didn't like, but I included it because I wanted readers to understand that sometimes life can be random. Especially for the men and women who venture up to touch the sky. We never know what to expect. You'll figure it out when you get to that part.  Also, there may be a few readers who do not know the odd slang and jargon of pilots.  So I've included a few explanations and definitions (a glossary of sorts) in \"The Pilots' Lounge\" at the back of the book. So buckle up and get ready for the many spins and loops in WINGS OF HONOR.", "related": ["B006G3W4L8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She's an everyday teenager with her heart set on a career as a stage actress and a theatrical college in New York City when her world is turned upside-down. Her boyfriend, Zach, the love of her life, is bitten by a zombie and it falls to Amber to take care of him. With the help of her best friend, the zany, devoted, eclectic, bisexually-identified Jasmine or \"Jazz,\" Amber takes on the arduous task of caring for her living impaired loved one, Zach--and she's beginning to think maybe someone is trying to kill him, ur, again, that is.Writing this book was wonderful. Stan Swanson is a fantastic writing partner and, between the two of us, this novel fell onto the page at lightning speed. I loved the arc of the plot in which Amber demonstrates that true love really can exist, that teens can experience true love, and that real love sometimes means taking care of people who can't take care of themselves.By far, Jasmine was my favorite character to write. She's the closest character to myself, so I had an easy time relating to her and coming up with new and crazy antics for her to get into. It was important to me to write a \"real bisexual\" character, as well. GLBTQ rights are important to me and, as a member of the GLBTQ community, I felt it was important to write not only a strong female character, but a bisexual character who has genuine experiences. Amber doesn't always \"get\" her best friend, but Jazz doesn't let that stop her from being who she is--and the young woman Jazz ends up with at the end of the book may surprise you.Stan and I have also started writing the second book in the series and all you Jazz fans out there will be happy to learn she's the protagonist of book two. I hope you enjoy this book and all those that will come after it!Happy nightmares! (Or, in this case, happy, creepy chuckles as this \"horror\" book really aims to ham it up.)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 22.0}
