The real protagonist in his magical adventure, however, is India in all its teeming life, mystery and beauty, highlighted by a captivating narration.  - Rachel Redford, The Observer  Espionage has become so sophisticated and hi-tech that it's difficult to believe that this, the greatest of all spy stories, was published more than a century ago when agents relied on wits rather than gadgets. Set against the background of the Great Game being played between Britain and Russia on the north-west frontier after the second Afghan war, it tells the story of an 11-year-old orphan boy who looks and sounds like a native but beneath his filthy rags is white. Kim, ne Kimball O'Hara, wears his Irish soldier father's ID round his neck and survives by running errands for a wily Pashtun horse trader with an ancient Islamic proverb to suit every occasion. 'Children should not see a carpet on the loom until the pattern is made plain,' he advises, his great red beard wagging solemnly. What Kim doesn't know is that his mentor is also a  chain manA\" or spy for the British. Mahbub Ali's constant travels through the subcontinent, selling horses to army officers and maharajahs, affords the perfect cover. How Kim, travelling with a holy lama in search of the sacred river, meets Colonel Creighton, who recognises his unique qualifications and talents and sends him to a mysterious spymaster to learn the secrets of espionage, is riveting. Adventures aside, Kipling's descriptions of India, its exotic people and places, are awesome, as are Sharma's seemingly inexhaustible collection of accents British and Indian - in Kim's case, a subtle mixture of both. No mean feat. - Sue Arnold, The Guardian   Kimball O'Hara, orphaned son of an Irish soldier, survives by his wits in the back streets of India's teeming cities. Caught and identified as a white boy, he is sent against his will to boarding school, then trained as a spy in the 'Great Game' - the power struggle between Britain and Russia for control of India and central Asia. Kim, 'little friend of all the world,' works with an Afghan horse trader serving as a British agent, outwits Russian spies in the high Himalayas, and becomes the disciple of a Tibetan holy man in search of a sacred river. With his rich old-school elocution and Shakespearean training, British actor Madhav Sharma is the perfect reader for this book. Sharma grew up in Calcutta, studied drama in London, and has appeared in stage, television, and radio productions in the U.K. The Calcutta Telegraph calls him 'the Indian actor in England with...the most impeccably spoken English.' Sharma's career has taken him back to India, as well as to Singapore, Malaysia, and Hong Kong. He has read Kipling's Jungle Books and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi for Naxos, too. Each CD in this production has its own separate jacket, the tracks identified either with chapter numbers or phrases identifying the start of the track. That helps greatly in finding a passage or in pairing the listening with reading. A little booklet tells you about the book and the author. - Betsy Woodman, SoundCommentary.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story structure is reminiscent of episodes in Sharmat's \"Nate the Great\" books (Coward)--short, simple sentences packed with humor and a not-too-mysterious plot. The dialogue and Olivia's Maxwell Smart-like comments are more sophisticated, however, and will appeal to readers in between \"Nate\" and David Adler's \"Fourth Floor Twins\" (Viking). Line drawings in a comic style adorn nearly every page, capsules of the fun taking place in the text. Although the plot is basic and the characterizations simplistic, this book should prove popular where early mysteries are in demand. --Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, Wheeler School, Providence, RICopyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

These are, after all, potential customers.\"Annja considered the map in front of her. This time of year, most of the Northwest Territories of Canada was frozen. The arctic tundra was a mass of brittle green amid the snows and winds. She shivered just thinking about how cold it was out there.But it couldn't be worse than Antarctica, could it? She smiled at the memories of that adventure and then noticed Derek watching.\"You okay?\"\"The cold weather makes me reminisce about the other times I've been in the thick of it,\" she said.Derek took another sip of his coffee. \"That's been quite often, hasn't it?\"Annja looked at him. He smirked and waved his hand.\"Don't be so concerned. We take great pains to find out all we can about people we might be interested in working with. And there's never been anything that the right amount of money can't purchase. Information especially.\"Annja smiled. She was one hundred percent positive there was at least one small nugget of intelligence that their money hadn't been able to procure—the presence of the sword that she always carried with her.\"That's a curious grin,\" Derek said.Annja made her face expressionless. This guy didn't miss a thing. She'd have to remember that.\"How successful has the mining operation been at Ekati?\"\"By all accounts, incredibly so,\" Derek said. \"It's expected to yield five hundred million Canadian dollars a year for the next twenty-five years. Who would have thought that the earth could have such a repository of untapped wealth?\"\"I might have,\" Annja said. \"But then, I dig for a living. That kind of knowledge is my thing.\"\"You like getting dirty,\" Derek said.Annja watched his face for any signs that he was already tossing innuendo around. But to his credit, he kept his expression firm and unyielding. No sign of mirth tinged it.\"Getting dirty comes with the territory,\" she said. \"It can't be helped. And it's only when you're truly down in the thick of it that you find the most precious treasures. So yes, I like getting dirty.\"\"Where were you before this?\"Annja raised an eyebrow at him. \"Now, why would you ask me such a question? After all, I thought you had a complete workup on my recent activities?\"\"We do.\"\"So, what, you want to see if I lie about my whereabouts?\"Derek held up his hand. \"Calm down. It was just a friendly question.\"Annja looked at the map again. Frozen lakes, frozen rivers, frozen everything. It would be a damned cold jaunt; she knew that.\"Why now?\" she asked.\"Excuse me?\"Annja glanced up. \"Wouldn't it make more sense to start something like this in the spring?\"Derek smiled. \"We're hoping that by the time you get to the site and extricate everything that needs extricating, it will be spring and just in time for us to start our real work.\"\"Ah, the real work.\"Derek leaned forward. \"Annja, please make no mistake—while we're committed to helping the Inuit preserve whatever sacred ground they have in this location, our primary emphasis is on profit. We're a private corporation and as such, driven by the ever-present bottom line.\"\"Hence my original statement about private and public interests not intersecting.\"Derek leaned back. \"We can help each other.\"\"How so?\"\"By you agreeing to come on board and assist the Inuit elders with their research, we gain a certain degree of sympathy for our corporation. Our public image looks better than if we simply steamrolled in and took what we wanted from the land with little regard to its history.\"\"Even though that's exactly what you want to do anyway?\"\"You don't strike me as being naive, Annja.\"\"I'm not.\"\"So you understand the function of our meeting and your employment with us on this matter.\"\"I'm coming in as a contractor.\"\"But you work for us.\"Annja smiled. \"I gathered as much.\"\"For which you'll be paid quite handsomely. Far more than you make hosting that little show on television.\"\"Actually,Chasing History's Monstersdoes pretty well in the ratings.\"Derek grinned. \"Only when your cohost manages to have a well-timed wardrobe malfunction.\"\"Granted.\"\"I don't think we'd see such a thing from you, now, would we?\"Annja shot him a look. \"I wouldn't hold out any hope.\"\"Noted.\"Annja folded up the map. \"How long has this land belonged to this tribe of Inuit?\"\"Almost one thousand years.\"\"You were able to trace it back that far?\"Derek sighed. \"It was part of what we had to do in order to make sure that the government was satisfied we did as much as possible to benefit the tribe instead of our own rather money-oriented motives.\"\"And what have you paid the Inuit?\"\"Far more than the land is worth. But I'm not exactly at liberty to disclose the exact number we eventually settled upon.\"\"Still,\" Annja said. \"You'll inevitably extract far more than that if your estimates are correct, right?\"\"Of course. It wouldn't have been a good investment otherwise. And we most certainly are not in the business of throwing money away.\"Annja nodded. \"This dig site was a condition of the purchase?\"\"The elders insisted on it. They claim a portion of the land—which happens to be exactly where our scientists tell us that the richest veins of kimberlite lie—is an ancient burial site. It has to be moved to a new area that has been consecrated through a variety of rituals and sacred events.\"\"Kimberlite indicates the presence of diamonds, right?\"Derek grinned. \"Yes. It's a type of potassic volcanic rock. It occurs naturally in 'pipes,' or long vertical structures that have the potential to contain diamonds. Our scientists tell me that kimberlite is formed deep within the Earth's mantle, probably between ninety and three hundred miles deep.\"\"Journey to the Center of the Earth.\"\"All for a girl's best friend, yes.\"\"So, why bring me in?\"\"We need you to confirm when the land is free of relics and assorted Inuit history. If we didn't have you in there, the Inuit could hold things up indefinitely and claim there was still any number of items that had to be extracted or moved. It could delay our operations for years. And we are definitely in the realm of time is money.\"\"I see.\"\"Your job is to get in there, get friendly with the Inuit elders and help them do what they need to do. Move their burial site. Make sure there aren't any relics that need to be dug up and preserved. Do whatever it takes, but within four weeks we want that land free of any Inuit association. Because at the first sign of a thaw—as much as we get up in these parts—we're coming in with the drills.\"\"And at that point there won't be any second chance for the Inuit.\"\"None. Once you give us the word or if the four weeks expire first, we're coming in. I don't think anyone could argue we haven't been more than patient.\"\"I'm sure someone could.\"Derek sighed. \"True. People are always able to complain when they're not spending one billion dollars of their own money.\"\"This is a billion-dollar operation?\"Derek smiled. \"I never said that if anyone asks.\"\"All right, then.\"Derek finished his coffee and set the empty mug back down on the table. \"Do you have any other questions?\"\"My payment?\"He nodded. \"We wired the first installment directly into your bank account this morning, prior to this meeting.\"Annja smiled. \"You're awfully confident that I'd take the assignment.\"Derek shrugged. \"We make a habit of knowing as much as possible about who we deal with ahead of time. I've read all of your files and information. I've watched you for a while on television even. I know you can't resist the pull of a new dig. It's too deeply ingrained in your spirit.\"\"You calling me an addict?\"Derek smiled. \"Are you?\"Annja took a deep breath. \"Sure feels that way sometimes.\"\"You say that with a degree of… sadness?\"Annja shook her head. \"Not really. I tend to live a lot of my life locked in the past. Memories of what I've done overlapped with the memories I dig through on an almost daily basis. Sometimes it's impossible to see the future.\"\"Well,\" Derek said, \"I guess I can understand that to some extent.\"\"Only some?\"\"I've never been on an archaeological excursion.\"\"Make some time,\" Annja said. \"Come and join me on this one.\"\"I hate the cold,\" Derek said.Annja smiled. \"You're kidding.\"\"I wish. It's the one part of this job that I struggle with on a constant basis. If there was any way to do this from the warm beaches of Fiji, I'd be a much happier man.\"\"I guess not, though, huh?\"\"No.\"\"The rest of my payment will be transferred in four weeks?\"\"Or upon completion of the job, whichever comes first. If you finish in two weeks, you get a fifty percent bonus.\"Annja leaned back. \"Mighty generous o...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story is set on Atlantian Earth, on board various ships in space, and on the far off world of Eden. It is full of rich characters, monsters and hardware, but it is packaged in a totally different way to anything that's been done before.Although there are many visual centrepieces, it is the relationships between the principal characters and their understanding of each other that is the main focus of the story. At first opposing one another, many of the characters are forced together and learn that they are very much the same despite their very different natures and origins. All the aliens have different viewpoints and agendas; there are no blind killers, and the borders between the good guys and the bad guys are deliberately blurred. The idea is to break through the barriers of both race and creed and to show that all are the same underneath.More information about the story can also be found atthefriendlyambassador.com.Visit the author's website at booksandstories.com.", "related": [], "rank": 3169294, "title": "The Friendly Ambassador", "author": "David George Richards", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He sets out from San Francisco in a rented Chevy Blazer to explore the deserts and canyons of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. His tour covers so much ground so quickly that it ends up feeling like a one-night stand with the vast landscape; just for starters he bombs across the Mojave (which he describes as the \"Big Nothing\"), peeks over the North Rim of the Grand Canyon and gets a flat changed in Zion National Park. Checchio's descriptions of the land feel similarly hurried, and his comments can be hostile and insensitive, especially when it comes to people. He spends too much time harping about other tourists' bad habits, the worst of which seems to be their decision to visit the same sites he's visiting. In fact, no one but historical figures and writers he respects survive his judgment unscathed. For example, he flippantly equates artists in Santa Fe with sex offenders, reduces Congress and the Bureau of Land Management to a group of wilderness haters, declares that Americans \"are monolingual, and proud of it\" and blithely stereotypes Native Americans. At times Checchio attempts to capture the power of the desert around him, but he always seems to give up, leaving readers with an exasperating ride through a landscape that deserves, and has gotten, much better treatment.

Whatever did happen to the contents of Roberto Calvi's briefcase, for example? The official word is that the briefcase was retrieved and found to contain only Calvi's passport.I have other ideas about what Calvi documented and carried about with him as insurance against Mafia retribution. Sadly, this talisman failed to protect him. However this, my first novel, is no conspiratorial rant. It's a story of real lives being changed forever because of accidental contamination by the still-powerful forces of organised crime.A follow-up novel to The Fratellanza Contract is now released on Kindle.

My workers are free, and paid wages.' In one simple frame set in a northern textile factory, Ruchir Shah's comprehensive comic book,The Civil War, outlines fundamental differences between the northern states that used free labor the southern states economies that depended on slave labor. Adult aficionados of this war, by far the most studied in the United States today, will appreciate the feat of this recent high school graduate on its own merits, but they will especially love the way it draws younger readers into a pictorially accurate, smoothly written account. One can almost hear the thoughts churning: Maybe now my grandchildren will understand the importance of Civil War reenactments in which we wear genuine period wool coats in July and August so we can truly appreciate the horrifying conditions under which this war was fought.In just thirty-three pages, this comic book manages to hit on virtually every aspect of this most deadly of American wars. From the start of American slavery in Jamestown, Virginia to the invention of Eli Whitney's cotton gin and the subsequent greater demand for slave labor it caused, readers gain an understanding of antebellum Southern economics while the illustrations depict, in frame after frame, the suffering of Southern field hands and the auction blocks that destroyed their families. At the same time, however, Shah does not flinch from racism among the Union troops who refused to fight WITH blacks or FOR blacks. For these Northern whites, the war was about defending the manufacturing-based lifestyle of the Northern states, rather than the abolitionism preached most famously in Harriet Beecher Stowe'sUncle Tom's Cabin, a book that highlight[ed] the conditions that slaves were forced to live under.Reluctant readers will be attracted to the engaging comic frames in which the story is told, and they will also appreciate the dual-level narrative that tells the story in straightforward dialogue frames written in capital letters while dialogue bubbles spoken by characters in each frame add depth and detail to what is already an interesting story. Shah doesn t mention the European observers who came to see how the war's innovations trench warfare, barbed wire, and the first generation of machine guns could be applied in their own countries, but he does devote space to the unsurpassed and unprecedented killing that this war saw. From the two battles of Bull Run to Shiloh and the Battle of Antietam, Shah highlights the high casualties, poor medical care, and poor living conditions suffered by the soldiers of both armies, especially near the end of the war.The notion of the comic book as a vehicle for teaching history to middle readers is catching on because it adds so much depth to drier textbook accounts, giving life to documents such as The Emancipation Proclamation, which, at only 269 words, is a great extra credit memorization assignment.Shah has also written Benjamin Franklin and Martin Luther King, Jr., two excellent biographies also geared toward middle readers. Look for more from this exciting new talent. --Elizabeth Breau - An Independent Reviewer.The Civil War- introduces young readers to the harrowing true story of the American Civil War and its immediate aftermath.

More likely is the single page that finds her narrative jumping between British East Africa, rural Russia, Baghdad, South Africa, and Syria, making it impossible for readers to know or care for anyone involved. Proctor clogs passages with facts about government-imposed food and price controls and attempts to prove contentions that many will find obvious, such as her wish to demonstrate that \"despite differences of political structure, language, age, race, gender, class and geographical location, civilians in all countries faced many of the same challenges in making sense of the war...\" By focusing on the sameness of experience, the author misses out on more fertile ground.

It was written by Chris Witwer.The e-book Shuksan Descent tells the story of Gary Patrick,\na Native American backhoe operator who discovers human bones at a construction site on the\nShuksan Indian Reservation. Bureaucracy, politics, religion, history, intrigue, suspense, murder, and a\ntreasure hunt (minus the pirates!) follow in this fun, locally-inspired\nnovel.Barrett Schmanska does a great job describing some of the\nbeautiful places in which his characters live and work, generally north of Seattle along the\nSound...overall the book flows very well.  I did struggle to keep track of a\nfew relationships, but it didn't matter in the end.  The later chapters of\nthe book center around a specific circle of individuals who are well known to\nthe reader by the end of the story.By the time I read half-way through Shuksan Descent, I just\nhad to know how it ended.  I'm a picky reader, so that's saying\nsomething.  And I appreciated learning how hard it was for tribal members\nto obtain formal education just a few generations ago.  Finally, I don't\nwant to give anything away, but I was both pleased and surprised by one tribal\nperspective of a scientific concept which I  take for granted.  I\ndidn't see it coming, either.  It was a nice bonus, and a\nthought-provoking way to end this story.About The CoverThe cover is an illustration of a scene in the book drawn by\nRobin James, best known for the Serendipity Books series of children's books.", "related": [], "rank": 2301026, "title": "Shuksan Descent", "author": "Barrett Schmanska", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In January 1975, due to the military coup, she left for Argentina with her husband, leaving her four children under the care of their grandparents.  Three months later she was reunited with her children in Buenos Aires and proceeded to the United Kingdom, where they were granted political asylum in April 1975. She started writing in 1976 when she and her family were living in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, in the northeast of England.  That first material, written from 1976 to 1981, was lost during a trip to Mozambique. From 1978 to 1982 while living in Dundee, Scotland, Myriam Angélica obtained the Certificate of Proficiency in English, Cambridge University, in 1977, the Certificate of Teacher of Adults from Tayside Regional Department of Education, Scotland in 1978 and the Scottish Business Studies Certificate, specialising in Tourism, in 1979.   From 1983 to 1987 Myriam Angélica, her second husband and two of her children lived in México, one year in Veracruz and three years in Guaymas, Sonora. She now lives three kilometres away from Algarrobo, Chile, a coastal town in the V Región, very near Isla Negra and Cartagena, towns well known because of the famous poets who have lived in them: Pablo Neruda and Nicanor Parra, among others. In October 2009 she started the transcription of her work to the computer and to participate in various literary forums on the Internet.  Her work has received recognition: her poem, Under the Scent of the Guayabo Tree, received the award to New Talent in August, 2009, at mundopoesia.com.  The Colour of Hate; Wind; Coming Back, have been mentioned as outstanding texts at Rincón del Arte & la Literatura in September 2009.  At the literary forum mandalas.ning, her poem Historical Fact was awarded a nomination as outstanding poem. Soon she was invited to contribute her poems to an anthology: Odisea de un Verso which was printed in the USA by cafepoetico.forumotion.net, on sale at Lulu, Amazon and Barnes & Noble. Her work has also been published in an anthology produced by Lyrs Editores by invitation from the Spanish writer Nuria de Espinosa, in Barcelona.  It is on sale under the name: Alma de Poetas.  More of her poems written in English and Spanish, including an anthology of poems are to be published by the Indie Authors Press.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She refers to her name is \"a joke, a plain girl having a name that s also a color. Violet says, One of my boyfriends in high school said that the only color on my face was in my eyes, and that was the color of a faded dollar bill. He also said they d be good looking if only they could express something. The year is 2002 and 18-year-old Violet is beginning summer break from college classes, a summer that will bring unexpected conflicts and discoveries. In her compelling debut, The Sleepwalk Society, Kendare Blake explores what it means to define ones self and how expectations and relationships influence the direction of one's life. Violet says, But over time, we get tired of other people. Other people get you caught up in things; they make it difficult to be what we are, indifferent, the sleepwalk society, drifting around the center of our lives. I know that by the end of the summer, it will just be us three, sitting in a car somewhere, talking less and less but louder and louder, one last rail against the new semester coming down to beat us over the heads.  This summer doesn t turn out to be anything like previous summers. While on summer break, Violet's father also gives her an ultimatum: she will either declare a major or he will stop funding her education. Violet's mother, an alcoholic, wants Violet to return to school. \"In the end, they both want the same thing, my mother and my father; only they want it for different reasons. My father wants me to go to school and be successful so that I will be like him, to prove that his life is worthy of envy. My mother wants me to go so that I ll never be like her, to prove that her life was a price that she didn t have to pay.\" The ultimatum from her father isn t the only thing weighing on Violet. Dynamics change dramatically between the trio of best friends--Violet, Terran, and Joey--with disturbing consequences and unexpected outcomes for each of them. Violet also meets Brandon, who sees more beauty and goodness in Violet than she sees in herself. The events that unfold over the summer causes Violet to question everything she believes about friendship and herself, and to emerge bruised but more confident than she ever imagined. Blake writes with a graceful subtlety and insight as she creates a complex and intriguing cast of characters, most notably Violet, who is wonderfully vulnerable and honest as she navigates the difficult journey toward independence and self-discovery. --Jayne Pupek-...this is certainly an engaging and above all emotionally honest young adult novel, the likes of which are far too rare in today s market.   Violet is no cardboard heroine; she is concerned more with figuring out herself and her world than with vampiric tonsil hockey and so her voyage of self-discovery is at its core more painfully, poetically real in its simplicity that any epic romance could ever be.   a rawly realistic depiction of teenage life.  It is an unfortunate trend in young adult fiction today that the genre s teenage protagonists tend to be concerned more with love and present happiness than the future. Twilight s Bella Swan, the most widely-known adolescent protagonist since a certain boy wizard made his way onto the literary scene, defines her life around her vampire lover, choosing to forego further education and any chance of a career in favor of immortal codependency, centuries in which the present has extended itself indefinitely. So it is no exaggeration to say that Violet, the plain, wryly observant, angsty heroine of Kendare Blake s Sleepwalk Society is a welcome change: a character whose meditations on life, the future, philosophy, and mankind are if not particularly original nevertheless all the more poignant in their familiarity. Violet is no cardboard heroine; she is concerned more with figuring out herself and her world than with vampiric tonsil hockey and so her voyage of self-discovery is at its core more painfully, poetically real in its simplicity that any epic romance could ever be. The novel, which follows Violet and her friends the infuriatingly charming Terran, the immature Joey, and newcomer Brandon through the summer following their freshman year of college, is short on plot proper. The main storyline, Joey s relationship with Terran and the effect it has on Violet, meanders through Violet s musings on 9/11, her parents alcoholism, and her feelings for Brandon, Joey s cousin conveniently in town for the summer. Yet it is these meanderings the slow series of mundane events that make the novel what it is: a rawly realistic depiction of teenage life. When Violet analyzes her parents decaying marriage, or when she discusses The Real World with love interest Brandon in a series of marijuana-tinged conversations, she is passing through a gauntlet that is at once universal and yet vastly under-described in contemporary YA fiction; we cannot imagine Gossip Girl s Blair Waldorf, for example, any more concerned with existential truth than with her latest lot of Louboutins. Yet none of what Violet is saying or realizing is particularly new or profound. The adult world is often fake; cheaters often win; people are immature and selfish and foolish any adult worth his or her salt has figured it out long ago. When Violet, for example, expounds upon the nature of Arab-American relations after an encounter with a non-white deli owner, some more mature readers might cringe on her behalf. But for Violet, each realization (made with a cocky sense that she has figured out some great philosophical truth) is new and Blake is able to capture the pain and poignancy of these first coming-of-age realization, along with the sense of discovery, of re-inventing the wheel, that it attends. The reader may cringe for Violet, but more than that he is cringing at his own teenage self, the universality of which Blake channels expertly. A young adult reader Blake s target audience might not appreciate the ironic contrast between what Violet knows and what she thinks she knows as well as an older reader, but that is by no means a negative: if anything, youth might cement the emotional connection between reader and protagonist. The minor characters are sufficiently well-drawn for a young adult novel. A standout is Joey, whose relationship --Tara Isabella Burton", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A mystical tale of lost causesand hidden things. A children's story for those children and adults whoare still awake enough to listen. A tale for the dead of winter, longafter Christmas is past.'The craft of writing short stories is a very different skill to that ofa novelist, and being able to accomplish one is never a guarantee thatthe other will be its equal. In this case, however, X Trevelyan managesto produce something that has charm, style, and just enough substance tocreate its own micro-world. There's also a subtly encouraged sense ofsomething that comes from another age, and has perhaps been overlookedby those compiling wintry fables for children.For grownups, The Hobgoblin Bell Strikes Twelve may come up a littleshort on explanations concerning the ethereal mechanics of how what isportrayed can work. There just isn't the room for that kind ofexposition. However, older readers only need to cast their minds back toa time in their lives when the devil in such detail did not matter asmuch, and the story shimmers nicely before the minds eye. I particularlyliked the fact that the theme, while gently presented, was notsugar-coated or over simplified. It is easy to imagine a younger childenjoying this very much if read to by an adult.So, for those with a Kindle - or the means to convert Kindle format toother digital media - The Hobgoblin Bell Strikes Twelve is a worthydownload.Nathan Brazil for SFSite", "related": ["B00AP5CNF0"], "rank": 3920569, "title": "The Hobgoblin Bell Strikes Twelve (Tales of the Mystical Book 1) eBook", "author": "X.

Tyner's first adult novel is a yardstick for measuring success, Wait Here, Wait There is a page turner, keep you awake, one of the best you'll ever read books that leaves a lasting impression both in mind and heart. The novel is about one woman's travel through love, loss, and grief. When Margaret loses herself to the ravages of Alzheimer's, her daughter, Janet, a writer on the verge of success, gets lost, too. Howe she finds here way back is at the heart of the book. Janet lives in Chicago but grew up in Denver. The novel takes her back to her childhood through the familiar Denver landmarks that had great signifance when she was growing up, places that include the Tattered Cover Book Store and the Brown Palace. Through a series of flashbacks, the reader is shown why these places are significant and, eventually, explain the mystery of why Janet and Clay, her seat mate on a flight from Chicago to Denver, feel so at home with one another. Through Tyner's writing the reader shares the numbness that envelops Janet after her mother's death, a numbness that gives way to guilt, anger, fear, and eventually acceptance and a willingness to finally move on. --Norma Engelberg, The TribuneThis novel is interesting with some romance, a little mystery, and most of all a realistic view of what families go through caring for loved ones who suffer Alzheimer s disease. --June Ruyle, Book Review Editor, The Lamplighter", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Two detectives of long standing. None of the Gestapo-SS brutality and sadism for them. Just robbery, arson, murder, extortion, other things also, and much trouble with the SS and the Gestapo. These days so many got in the way.\"Among the people getting in the way of Inspectors Jean-Louis St-Cyr of the French Surete and Hermann Kohler of the Gestapo in this fourth installment of Canadian author J. Robert Janes's memorable series is top Nazi Hermann Goering. Goering's in Paris on an art-looting mission that crosses paths with an investigation by Kohler and St-Cyr into the murders of several young women who answered an ad to become fashion models. Ghosts of wars past and present haunt the story: one of the suspects is a \"drooler,\" an aristocrat badly mutilated in World War One; and Kohler's two sons are involved in the ongoing siege of Stalingrad.It's impossible to praise too highly the subtle ways in which Janes shows the twisted idiocy of the times through the lives of his two cops. St-Cyr (his family destroyed in a bomb blast) lives with a singer who has Resistance ties. But this most patriotic of Frenchmen faces death from a strengthened Resistance because of his perceived collaboration with the German occupiers. Kohler supports and protects two French women, and thereby puts them in danger. Always at odds with his Gestapo superiors, Kohler also needs their help in his investigations. When he faces down Goering at an art auction, it seems as much an act of suicidal madness as one of moral strength.Mannequinbegins just as the equally impressiveSalamanderends.

The House of Representatives recently acquired noted historian of the Jacksonian era, Robert Remini as the official House Historian. He recently wrote a pretty impressive tomb on the House of Representatives. The Senate already has a 4 volume history written by US Senator, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, so the Senate could not reply in that manner. So, I think the coffee table book was the best that we could muster. I think this is the first time I have actually read a coffee table book from cover to cover. It is a chatty little story book filled with useful cocktail-party-history of the US Senate. That's useful knowledge to me, as I never know what to say at Washington cocktail parties. Perhaps anecdotes about Thomas Hart Benton will help break the ice. The most striking thing to me about the book was the number of attacks on the Capitol. I had heard about all the incidents individually, but it is more jolting to see them sequentially. 3 bombings, 2 gun attacks and then the attempt on September 11th. In a way, its remarkable that the Capitol complex remained so open for so long. Note, I use the past tense here. As any of you who have visited the capitol recently will have noted, it is increasingly difficult to get in. And once the Capitol Visitor Center is completed, I expect it will be very much a controlled experience like the White House. In any case, Baker's prose is breezy and he is dutifully reverent to the institution without missing the absurdities of Senate life. You also get a sense of the breakdown in lawfulness that preceded the Civil War. Its not just the canning of Charles Sumner, its also the Mississippi Senator pulling a gun on Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton in the Senate chamber. Then there is the case of California Senator David Broderick (an anti-slavery Democrat) being killed in a duel by the pro-slavery Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court. Apearantly, back in those days, California was a lot more like modern Texas. In any case, the slide toward anarchy can definitely be found long before Fort Sumter. Another interesting aside that I really never knew concerns the order of succession. All of us learn in school that it is the President, then the Vice President, then the Speaker of the House and then President Pro Tempore of the Senate. After that, you get the members of the Cabinet, and I was aware that as new departments were created, they have been shuffled up a bit. What I did not know, is that Congress was not always in the order of succession at all. For a long time, it devolved from the President to the VP and then directly to the Secretary of State. Furthermore, when they first inserted Congress, it was the President Pro Tempore of the Senate who was third in line over the Speaker of the House. The structure we all know and love was only finalized in 1947 after some hard thinking in light of FDR's demise and the Constitutional Amendments on succession that followed. Anyway, this is a book for government geeks. If you are one, its a nice read and about as pleasant a way to introduce yourself to Senate history as I have found. If not, there are prettier coffee table books to be had.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She was born in Streatham, a suburb of London. Her father was a clerk in the City of London and she had an older sister and brother. Her family was middle class and lived a comfortable life. Ethel Dell was a very shy, quiet girl and was content to be dominated by her family. She began to write stories while very young and many of them were published in popular magazines. Beneath her shy exterior, she had a passionate heart and most of her stories were stories of passion and love set in India and other British colonial possessions. They were considered to be very racy and her cousins would pull out pencils to try and count up the number of times she used the words: passion, tremble, pant and thrill.        Ethel Dell worked on a novel for several years, but it was rejected by eight publishers. Finally the publisher T. Fisher Unwin bought the book for their First Novel Library, a series which introduced a writer's first book. This book, titled The Way of an Eagle, was published in 1912 and by 1915 it had gone through thirty printings.        The Way of an Eagle is very characteristic of Ethel M. Dell's novels. There is a very feminine woman, an alpha male, a setting in India, passion galore liberally mixed with some surprisingly shocking violence and religious sentiments sprinkled throughout.        While readers adored Ethel M. Dell's novels, critics hated them with a passion; but she did not care what the critics thought. She considered herself a good storyteller - nothing more and nothing less. Ethel M. Dell continued to write novels for a number of years. She made quite a lot of money, from 20,000 to 30,000 pounds a year, but remained quiet and almost pathologically shy.", "related": ["B000NJL74Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Wright aka Auntie Artichoke? & What’s with the Artichoke? Judy is a parent educator, family coach, and personal historian who has written more than 20 books, hundreds of articles and speaks internationally on family issues, including care giving. Trained as a ready to learn consultant, she works with Head Start organizations and child care resource centers. She also volunteers time writing end-of-life stories for Hospice.  She and Dwain, her husband of 40 years, have six grown children and seven grandchildren.  They consider their greatest success in life that their children like themselves and each other. The honorary title of “Auntie” is given in many cultures to the wise women who guide and mentor others in life. The artichoke also became a teaching lesson when Judy, with her young family, moved into military housing in California to find Artichokes in their yard.  Given that it takes two years for the vegetable to flower, the original gardener never got to see the seeds of her labor.  Many times, our actions and reactions in life are felt by people we will never meet, but we plant the seeds of kindness anyway. The symbol of the artichoke has great meaning in her teaching and writing.  As she works with families, she sees frequently only the outer edges are exposed and can be prickly, hard to open and sometimes bitter to the taste. They are closed to new ideas or methods. Many families prefer the known over the unknown, even when the old patterns and skills are not serving them well.  But as you expose the artichoke and people to warmth, caring, and time, gradually the leaves begin to open and expose the real treasure—the heart. You will enjoy Judy's approachable manner, wonderful storytelling and common-sense solutions gleaned from working with hundreds of families and organizations just like yours. Your encounter with Judy will leave you feeling inspired, entertained and especially motivated. Visit Judy's website for excellent references and a full listing of books, workshop topics, tele-classes and testimonials.", "related": ["B007QKSCIY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My formal schooling was in the area of clinical psychology . . . Bradley University, B.S. 1965 and M.A. 1969. But even as a child I wanted to grow up to be a jeweler. I was always fascinated by pretty stones. I would pry them out of old pieces of costume jewelry and squirrel them away in a small, fuzzy, green velvet box lined with cotton and have fantasies about whether or not they were real.I was a stay-at-home mom when we lived in Chicago’s Hyde Park district so I had a lot of time on my hands. I started buying and studying jewelry design books and set up a small studio in the sun room of our apartment and showed my wares at street festivals. The University of Chicago offered a class in welding so my friend, Annie Kleboe, and I decided to sign up. Annie was doing stone sculpture at the time; she’s now into collages.We moved to Arizona in 1975. I wanted to learn casting and was very fortunate to find excellent instructors. Bob and Gina Winston were veteran designers selling out of a gallery in California but their studio where they held classes was only ten minutes from my house. I truly lucked out. I stayed with them for five years.My other crafts include woodworking and sewing (quilt design and construction). I owe whatever sewing skills I have to my mother. She was very patient with me. Sometimes I’d get so frustrated at not being able to do it I’d be ready to quit. But she sat with me and she showed me and finally I’d settle down and try again. Another skill this taught me was how to follow directions.The unifying factor with all of these seemingly diverse crafts is that they are all puzzles where you first need to create the pieces before you can build the puzzle. I find that fascinating. It’s kept me involved for the past 40 years.My professional writing career began in 1980 with the publication of Jean’s Arizona Fan Palm, cutting directions for a 3.2 carat citrine (see it in the Handcrafted Jewelry Photo Gallery book in my Kick-Start Creativity series), in the January issue of the Lapidary Journal Gem Cutting Magazine. Many years later I was submitting step-by-step articles for original jewelry designs to various international magazines.And now, 2012, I’m enjoying the writing and publishing of various kinds of books for Amazon. I’ll be 70 years old this year. It’s been quite a ride. I hope you enjoy my offerings.", "related": [], "rank": 2619333, "title": "Sell Your Work: A Report for Craftsmen Who Want To Turn Their Craft Into A Business (Crafts Series -- Business of Art Book 7)", "author": "Joyce Zborower", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tabitha introduced concepts such as Glycaemic Index, Syndrome X (Metabolic Syndrome) and Insulin Resistance into a world that was still focussing on calorie-counting and weighing bland food. She has focussed for 17 years on diseases that affect more than 50% of the adult world today: . Obesity, overweight . Type 2 Diabetes . High Blood pressure . High cholesterol, strokes, heart disease . Fatty liver . Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, infertility . Gout, arthritis and infl ammatory disease, which have previously been treated independently and yet are primarily caused by one, often ignored problem: too much insulin. Tabitha explains in her light-hearted manner how traditional starvation diets lead to yo-yo weight fl uctuations and depression symptoms; unveils the truth about the diet industry and why low-carb dieting feeds the public's need for immediate gratifi cation, but can actually be linked to increased insulin resistance in the long-term; discusses the inextricable link between food and mood, and how cravings and binge-eating can be banished by eating traditional, comfort-food that she illustrates how to convert to Low GI and very low fat, yet indulgent, creamy and fun foods. Understand your emotional and cultural need for good food, and start eating like a child again: loving good food that loves you, too. \"After reading and applying the principles of The X Diet, I can honestly say that yours is the fi rst \"diet\" on which I have not felt deprived, hungry, anti social, and uncomfortable or guilty when ordering at a restaurant. My body actually feels normal again, and my energy levels and brain function also feel like they did many years ago. Previous diets put one in a \"fog\" that seems plastic, somehow! Many thanks\" C.

Greeted by the ghosts of her great-grandparents, she confronts her issues of the present and past to find her future. Craver has a lot of elements working here--basically that a person can be living two lives simultaneously. She manages to pull it off without totally confusing the reader.

It is of special value for those who serve in small rural districts. It is a wonderful combination of research-based information and anecdotal information. The book is an easy, interesting read. Mr. Murdock is the right person to write this book because he has walked the walk.The book is packed with advice, ranging from how to apply for an administrative job in a rural setting, to how to function once the position is secured. Much of the information is presented in the form of stories from the front lines. These anecdotal stories are designed to enlighten and inform, and they do both of these things. Also contained are several cautionary tales that are about incidents that forced the administrator to seek new employment.While the information is sometimes humorous, it always focused on the skills needed to be successful in a rural setting. Early on he makes the point that people are employed because of their technical skills, but are dismissed because of their inability to maintain productive relationships with the board, the staff and the community. George Murdock provides the activities that rural administrators must undertake to develop positive, productive relationships.If the goal of a book is to inform and entertain, then George Murdock is on the mark with his book “Bigger Isn’t Always Better.”(Al Meunier)The roles and responsibilities of small school administrators vary greatly from those of administrators in larger systems. While larger systems have specialized leaders for each area of school administration, small school administrators often have only the face they see in the mirror each morning to guide them through the day’s events. “Bigger Isn’t Always Better: A Leadership Guide for Small School Administrators” will serve as a favorite resource book for any administrator and as an essential survival guide for administrators in smaller systems.Isolation is a frequent challenge for small school administrators. George Murdock has long served as an instructor and mentor for school leaders through Eastern Washington and Oregon. His guide allows his collective wisdom from years in administration to be passed along in a format that reads much like a mentor’s treasured advice. Murdock presents his information with a mix of research, story-telling and quick tips to allow readers to prepare for, reflect upon, and refine practices in a plethora of areas.Murdock’s varied experiences are evident in this book. It is rare to find an all-encompassing leadership guide; yet, the book covers small-town administration topics thoroughly. The book begins just as an administrative career begins, with application pointers and interviewing advice. Once one has secured the position, Murdock leads the young administrator through the crucial elements of getting to know the staff and assessing the needs of the position. Murdock places heavy emphasis on communication and shares stories of successful communication, and the results of poor communication, to guide the reader through communication plans for use with staff, students, School Boards and the community.Facilities, fiscal, and human resource management are present in the job descriptions of many small school leaders, yet absent in most school leadership books. Murdock covers these topics in depth with specific examples and useful lessons for each area. Administrators who utilize the guide will not be left to search for resources on the various job responsibilities, instead, the guide supplies them advice on virtually every topic a new administrator will face in the first few years of the job.Small-schools will continue to thrive in the United States and many educational leaders will enjoy their start, or their entire career, in small schools. “Bigger Isn’t Always Better: A Leadership Guide for Small School Administrators” will serve as an invaluable resource to help leaders understand the hidden social rules of small-school leadership as well as the basic mechanics of success in administrative positions. The book is short on theory and long in practical advice- exactly what new administrators seek as they enter their careers. Murdock’s work will be a welcome resource to any small-school administrator.(Heidi Sipe)What a necessary read for anyone serving as an administrator in a small rural area! This book serves as a sort of survival manual to navigate the systems and culture that are unique to these communities. Murdock states that the most important element is common sense in regards to successful small school leadership. While this is absolutely true, it is equally essential to have a fall back to go to for guidance or to affirm that you are on the right track; this book does both. Having been raised in one of these communities, I can relate to the many threads that are woven throughout this book and believe that Murdock has done an excellent job of capturing the complexities that those of us in leadership positions face.For a new administrator, regardless of whether they are in a small, rural school or not, this book affords much of the common sense pieces and best practices that Murdock has picked up throughout his many years of serving in Oregon and Washington. I have shared this with an aspiring administrator in my district and she stated that it even prepared her for a job interview as a building principal recently. Although I have served in both small and large schools in the state, this book helped me reflect this past year as I began to lead my new district as their superintendent. The book really helps you prioritize and gain a better sense of what you stand for as an administrator.(Nanette Hagen)", "related": [], "rank": 3392140, "title": "Bigger Isn't Always Better", "author": "George Murdock", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a result, they've stopped reading it. It's gone out of vogue, and lost it's prominence in the literary world. I believe that's because today's readers demand relevancy. If poetry made sense to people, if it came alive and jumped off the page with a moving message, wouldn't the public read it? I promise you this collection of poems won't be dry, boring or incomprehensible. I believe there is still a niche for poetry which is understandable, inspirational, motivational, even exquisite in nature. We all need to be reminded that there is something greater inside of us than the confining, challenging circumstances we face, and this trilogy of e-books proclaims it IS possible for you to overcome the hurdles in your life.

I'm their happy scribe and their personal bard. When they come to me, their stories are already there and all I really do is to listen to them and help them tell their tales as best as I can. That's what fills my days with joy.Both my benefactors (characters) and I are happy when readers find delight on pages of our books too. My approach to writing best resonates with those who appreciate deep character emotions, and intricate plots, as much as the erotic aspect of the narrative. If you are looking for gay love stories that do not yield to the rules of romance, Guardian Demon books may be the right companions for your reading pleasure - if you like fantasy and gay paranormal sex twining pleasure with pain. As a real life dominant I can paint such scenes for your vividly.But\nbe ready for a different mental image of gay BDSM and domestic discipline than their moderns concepts show. My benefactors don't include contracts, safe words, scenes and collaring ceremonies in their relationships. While some of them appreciate the sight of men clad in leather, such visual stimuli play a little role in our world, where dominance and submission influence so much more than intimate situations. Dominants don't need to dress up to hold full control in their hands as such power distribution is simply necessary to ensure their own and their submissive partners' survival. It's not a play or even a lifestyle for them, nor is it for their subs.In the world where death is an ever present danger, submissives usually don't act up or challenge their Masters because they would struggle with their place in a D/s relationship. They rely on their Masters' judgment, quick wits and many a time on their physical strength for protection; in return they readily accept their decisions related to rewards and punishments.Domestic discipline isn't based on rigid sets of rules agreed between the Doms and their partners. Once a submissive joins a dominant's household, he is expected to follow whatever regime is already in place. Corporal punishments for breaching the rules don't limit themselves to spanking. Dominants in our world are ingenious when it comes to the most effective ways to reprimand their pets for their demerits. And are equally inventive in the employment of all kinds of kink to bring the same pets and\nthemselves to the peak of pleasure.But neither the Doms, nor the subs are perfect in our world. Bad decisions mark the paths to better ones,\ndisobedience occurs, misunderstandings happen and responses to such situations vary depending on the personalities of the involved men. Such variety makes writing for my benefactors a blast, and will bring you hours of enjoyment as you read about them on the pages of my books.Are you ready to accompany mortal men, vampires, werewolves, demons, angels and many other inhabitants of our plane in the moments of their purest bliss and in their darkest hours? Then welcome to our world. We hope you will enjoy our tales of lust for life and love.", "related": ["B00K5RU1R0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Anne, herself, was accused of witchcraft, although this charge was later dropped in favour of treason. So the paranormal aspects of the story have some validity.I also wanted to show how the misuse of power leads inevitably to disaster. These were dangerous times, but the rewards that came with power were enormous. Anne was ruthless and she paid the price.

In their twenties and thirties they lived in Paris and in Rio de Janeiro, where Hans sold bathtubs in villages along the Amazon River. Eventually Cambridge, Massachusetts, became the Reys’ home and community. Throughout their lives the Reys created many lively books together, including SPOTTY, PRETZEL, and lift-the-flap books such as HOW DO YOU GET THERE? The manuscript of the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and CURIOUS GEORGE was published in 1941. Their incorrigible little monkey has become an American icon, selling millions of books and capturing the hearts of readers everywhere. CURIOUS GEORGE has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian.

His first job took him to Washington DC where he worked for a US Congressman on Capitol Hill.   Since then Andrew has spent well over a decade working in financial markets in London and latterly New York. Importantly, Andrew originally worked in an area called “pan european small and mid caps”.   This simply meant that he dealt with companies from all over Europe that were less than about £2-3 billion in size.  He was able to meet and travel with the top management teams of several hundred companies and was involved with the stock market flotation (IPO) of the likes of Burberry, Campari, easyJet, HMV, lastminute.com, Carluccio’s and the Carbon Trust. Working in the more volatile area of “smaller” companies meant that Andrew saw first hand just how much money the very best investors were able to make. His reaction was to read extremely widely about investment and to start investing his own money.  Thanks in great part to the returns afforded by those investments he has been able to spend around five of the last fifteen years outside of conventional employment (not having to earn any money).  This has given him the time to read very widely on finance, trading, economics, history and economic history. It is this, more than anything, which he feels qualifies him to bring you the information you will find in Own The World.  More than his degree or over ten years of working in banking, it is the time he has had to read the very best books and other information sources about investment and economic history for the last many years that has enabled him to bring you this information… At the most basic level his view is simply: That you really owe it to yourself to learn enough about money to run your own financial affairs. The rewards of doing so are life changing as you have significant advantages over professional investors. Learning about money is nowhere near as difficult as you may previously have thought. You can learn how to do a perfectly good job with your money more quickly than it took you to learn how to drive, for example.  Andrew would argue that learning about finance is a more useful life skill than driving in the long run and it is crazy that nearly everyone learns how to drive but hardly anyone learns anything about money. Real financial literacy should be taught at school. He knows that you will find the information in Own The World truly life changing...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He's also one of the most colorful writers, his style vacillating between serious, objective analysis and the hilarious, caps-heavy rantings of the impassioned film geek. Wilson's reviews are sophisticated, placing a subject firmly within its cultural, political, and artistic zeitgeist with all the thoroughness and loving care of a museum curator. At the same time, though, you get the feeling that Wilson isn't above yelling expletives at the screen. And in no genre, of course, is this impulse stronger than horror. (\"Don't go into that forest alone, dumbass! Don't open that door! Get the f@!k out of there!\") [...]Wilson's lofty aim, as he establishes in the book's prologue, is to pick up where Danse Macabre--Stephen King's 1981 exploration of the horror genre--left off. The self-published work, which bears the ballsy title Son of Danse Macabre,focuses particularly on the 30 years after King's book was published. Son of Danse Macabre doesn't start its journey in 1981, of course. Art is greatly dependent upon context, and this includes the fine art of scaring people to death. So, after briefly introducing himself in the first chapter, Wilson starts us off with an examination of what horror really is, cleverly weaving in the highlights of the genre over the past century as examples. In doing so, he achieves the dual goals of defining horror while giving an overview of its evolution across the decades.

But I will give it a go. Very briefly, my background is in Mathematics - Operations Research (or Management Science) to be precise. With this skill I have lectured at Universities, both in the UK and Zimbabwe; including setting up Master's degree causes and promoting Mathematics in Industry. I have also spent many years as a Management Consultant, advising businesses, both small and large, how to make more profit. It was this combination of a hard core Mathematical background and a practical, hands-on understanding of business that made it clear the Mathematical optimisations would never work without the right mindset of the people who were implementing them. To bridge this gap I trained as a Leadership Development Coach, and spent many years in this role - and a very satisfying role it is too! Because of my ongoing interest in self development I would use and develop different techniques in my personal life to help with the type of issues many of us face. After having some massive success in my own personal life it got me thinking how I could use this to also help others in similar situations. I am an ordinary person, no matter what my background is I make all the same mistakes as many others. Then I need to work hard to put them right again - getting into big debt was one of them! So I developed a very simple system which focused on changing my mindset towards my debts in order that I could then do something about them, rather than bury my head in the sand and pretend they did not exist. When this system worked like a dream for me, and other close family and friends, I decided it was time to share it with the world. Take the plunge, get rid of those headaches, and let me know how good it feels!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Daresh helps school leaders understand the importance of their personal values about shared leadership as well as the individuals within the school, district, and community who are essential to building a shared learning community. The wealth of examples and school-based scenarios illustrate how these ideas translate into practice. A wonderful resource for a book study for teachers and principals.\"(Bruce Barnett, Professor 2009-09-01)\"Daresh continues his legacy of bridging scholarship and practice, within a context of strengthening school cultures by supporting positive interactions between all the people who interact within and around them. As usual, his tone is friendly and approachable, and his points to ponder are both practical and compelling. Aspiring, new, and experienced principals will benefit from the structured opportunity afforded by this book to reflect on their own values and how these values shape their leadership.\"(Mary Beth Cunat, Assistant Principal 2009-09-01)\"An invaluable guide for fostering learning communities, Daresh’s work provides a ten-thousand foot view of schools. Of particular interest to educational leaders are strategies to engage parents, business leaders and the often 'forgotten stakeholders'—staff members such as secretaries and custodians. Each chapter immediately engages the reader through humor, reflection, and analysis. Vivid, authentic scenarios capture the realities and complexities of today’s schools. We are invited into the minds of school leaders as they work through the change process and are reminded of the importance of continually reassessing our values. This book is not only a must-read, but a must-do for every principal whose goal is to enhance learning communities.\"(Debra Livingston, Superintendent of Schools 2009-09-01)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The main character who starts in control of everything suddenly has no control of anything. In the end, the change does him some good.People were asking for a sequel to my science fiction series, but I kept hearing the wise-cracking Nick Solace in my ear for months. He made me laugh, so I let him out to play for a while--a dangerous thing. My favorite line that sums up the whole group was, \"You're going to march in there without a plan, like a bird into a jet engine?\" To which the idealist answers, \"Even a turkey can take out a jet engine, especially if it's still frozen.\"I had fun listening to them talk over dinner or cleanup sites. Nick is so inured to corruption and hiding  evidence that he continually amused me. He has to pick just the right song for his iPod while sneaking bodies past the SWAT team. When someone  finally does scare Nick, this alone is enough to terrify the rest of the team.The core of the tale was the London ghost story with a  hero running from a job gone wrong. For a novel, I had to go back and plumb that character as well as how things when sideways. To complicate matters, I wanted for the first half for the sidekick to be asking, \"Is Nick insane? Is he really the one committing all these crimes?\"I  also had two very strong plateaus in mind, the first of which was how three people in the same car react to going off a cliff. The second involves a moral choice that the sidekick has to make: death or betrayal.Furthermore, for this story, I swore off popular icons from my other stories like super-powered heroes, priests, love stories, pregnant women, and dragons. Instead, I wanted to discuss ordinary people making a difference, paranoia, and how perfectly good people can get discarded by society. Okay, one pregnant woman had a cameo, but she was a zombie-killing machine who tagged along with another character. That's because I also pulled in an unresolved thread from my last two \"Ryoku\" novels, the Secret Branch of the Smithsonian. I didn't get this from Warehouse 13; rather, I borrowed the conspiracy laden thread from fantasy games I ran for almost 30 years. No one ever bothered to investigate the theft of a moon rock, one of the most valuable substances in the world.", "related": ["B00EENE9G0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.6667, "rating_total": 28.0}

Compelling, revealing, and passionate, this is a book that demands attention. Summing Up: Highly recommended. Lower-level undergraduates and above.\" -CHOICE(W. W. Dixon, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA)'By shedding light on the different nuances and complexities of film censorship around the world, this collection contributes new insights to the field of cinema studies . . . This is a scholarly but accessible book, likely to attract academics who work on cinema, censorship and transnational culture(s) more generally, but also recommended to undergraduates and other readers interested in the topic.' -The Kelvingrove Review\"A dizzying display of film scholarship, this volume brings together scholars from around the world to discuss global evolution of the censorship of film production and exhibition. More than simply 'rounding up the usual suspects' to discuss 1930s America, Britain, Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany, this book strides boldly into lesser known territory, documenting the censors at work in Mexico, Nigeria, India, China, Ireland, Belgium, and a host of other countries with instructive experiences of their own. The result goes beyond its function as a fascinating slice of comparative movie history, this is a unique and important window on the political and social history of the twentieth century, illuminating all the great issues of the time.\" - Nicholas J. Cull, Professor, Center on Public Diplomacy at the Annenberg School, University of Southern California, USA and Author of Projecting Empire: Imperialism in Popular Cinema (with James Chapman, 2009) and Projecting Tomorrow: Science Fiction in Popular Cinema (2013)\"Turnabout being fair play, Daniel Biltereyst and Roel Vande Winkel have assembled an A-list line-up of film scholars to cast a critical eye on the clerics, bluenoses, reformers, bureaucrats, hacks, apparatchiks, and sundry buttinskies from around the world who have sought to snip, slice, shred, and otherwise suppress motion picture art.

This time, the subject of Kroeger's brisk narrative is Fannie Hurst (1885-1968), the bestselling author of such novels asBack StreetandImitation of Life, not to mention dozens of short stories that brought the lives of immigrants and working-class women into the literary mainstream. Out of fashion today, Hurst's work was praised in its time as a model of the storyteller's art and served as the basis for many popular films. She was also a staunch liberal, feminist, and forceful advocate of civil rights. Kroeger traces in lucid prose the action-packed trajectory of Hurst's busy life, from a middle-class childhood in St. Louis as the daughter of assimilated German Jews to her later years spent residing in a lavish New York City triplex apartment. Plentiful quotes from Hurst's letters and other writings give an attractive impression of her personality: strong, smart, frank, generous, and friendly, though tending to hold her innermost self aloof. Kroeger's portrait is a little short on psychological insights, but that would probably suit Hurst, who does not seem to have been inclined toward introspection.--Wendy Smith", "related": [], "rank": 1825860, "title": "Fannie", "author": "Brooke  Kroeger", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His mother begins to notice that Gordon is different when he speaks his first words at just 5 months old and that's before the really strange things begin to happen!Fun, refreshing and certainly different, A Wizard Of Dreams is Book 1 in The Myrddin's Heir series by author Robin Chambers. Written at a quick, entertaining pace it's a potent blend of magical intrigue and adventure and whilst the theme is familiar, Chambers has a unique style of writing that sets his work apart. Much more than a trite fantasy plotline his young protagonist is defined in a realistic and empathetic way that pulls the reader through the story with him, and when Gordon interacts with Zack there is always much to be taken from these well observed exchanges. With well-defined characters, Chambers demonstrates a meticulous eye for detail that makes them instantly identifiable and whilst some are more endearing than others they are all very memorable. Each captured with a distinctive tenor that adds greatly to the thematic undertones of his tale.  A tale that not only entertains, but encourages thought and timely reflection.Original and highly engrossing, A Wizard Of Dreams is a wonderful read throughout and sets the tone for a series that undoubtedly deserves your attention.

Eileen Cartwright, a rich, middle-aged widow of less than lofty moral standards, arranges the murder of her solicitor's wife, under the mistaken impression that the act will win his affections. But the hired murderer, would-be private detective Stanislaus Jaskowski, is caught almost immediately--and confesses all. The trying task of proving the widow Cartwright's role in the crime falls to police superintendent Geoffrey Bailey and prosecutor Helen West--who are slowly and deliciously drawn together personally and professionally. While the case comes to involve Jaskowski's sons, Edward and Peter, the horrifying truth is revealed as the reader gradually learns the motives driving each of the marvelously drawn characters in this auspicious first volume in Pocket's new hardcover mystery series.

Kim began\ncreating healthy recipes that would get her body into top shape for the\nstage, shedding almost 20 pounds (see before/after in photos section).When\n her husband Rob watched her transform her body, he was sold. Rob, a\nself proclaimed vegetable hater, followed Kim's methods, ate her\nrecipes. After dropping almost 40 pounds and getting shredded at the age\n of 43, Rob entered his first local fitness competition and placed\nsecond (see Rob's before/after in photos section). Since then, he's\nplaced in the top 15 out of 100, mostly against guys half his age, and\nhas become a fitness model and contributor for Men's Fitness Magazine\nOnline.A few years later, their daughter, then 13 got inspired\nby her fit parents and entered her first fitness competition for teens,\nplacing second. As an aside, she also hates vegetables, but when Kim\nmade her famous Brussels Sprouts (from her Jet Set Body Holy Fit cookbook), her\ndaughter actually asked for a second serving!Together they\ncreated their 90 day nutrition and workout program called Jet Set Body.\nThe incredible Jet Set Body member transformations have been featured in\n Iron Magazine and on Body Buidling.com.", "related": ["B009BTMJ28"], "rank": 2082477, "title": "Kick A** Protein Shake, Smoothies and Snacks Recipe Book: Over 50 Easy, Delicious Protein Shake and Smoothie Recipes", "author": "Kimberly Murgatroyd", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That's the way I saw it when \"Murder on the Moon\" became an instant hit with my fourth-grade classmates. I'd always been a voracious reader, but upon sharing my little yarn with my friends, I suddenly realized the freedom (and power!) of becoming the storyteller. Over the next few years, I would go on to write several short stories, mostly involving murder mysteries and my schoolmates. The thrill of whodunits subsided when I discovered the long and (theoretically) rewarding payoffs of the soap operatic style of telling tales, which was followed quickly by my unearthing of the superhero fiction genre (which is just soap operas in spandex).Fast-forward to my last semester at Florida State University, where I was starting to regret my decision to pursue a business management degree instead of something more literary. I had big stories in my head. Instead of second-guessing my educational path, I used my free time to pursue my passion. A few months later, my first novel had arrived in the world--and it wasn't pretty. Like all writers, though, I had to start somewhere. I went back to the drawing board with my ideas for The Survivors--a contemporary fantasy story about what would happen if real people found themselves empowered with superhuman abilities. But The Survivors wasn't so pretty either. The concept was fun but the execution was rough. It was temporarily shelved while I set out to learn how to be a better and publishable writer. And 10 years later, I think I may have learned a thing or two. I wrote another novel in the interim years (more on that soon!), but The Survivors will always be my baby. In many ways, the work of an artist is like his or her child. Now my little one's ready to play with the big kids. After the many years of edits and rewrites, I'm proud of the novel it's grown into.", "related": ["B008HRS2A8"], "rank": 1588087, "title": "The Survivors eBook", "author": "Daniel Harvell", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She is a doctor and her day job is as a Forensic Psychiatrist. She has also completed a degree in American Literature at the University of Sussex (including a year abroad at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts) and a PhD on the Films of David Mamet.  Always a learner, she has recently finished a Distance Learning MSc on Criminology at the University of Leicester. Olga has loved reading and writing since she was a child. Her father always says that even before she could read she'd always ask what any writing meant. She has written a variety of things over the years: short stories, novels, novellas and plays, in English, Spanish and Catalan. Some have been edited into the trash bin, but a few are still available and sitting quietly waiting for their moment in the sun. (Or an e-reader, most likely). Due to the many distractions (studies and jobs) she has never fully dedicated herself to the business of writing, but after a minor health scare she decided that there is no time like now. Carpe diem! Her main love is fiction; she has written in a variety of genres (crime, family saga, para-normal, science-fiction...) and she is currently working on a series for young adults. Apart from reading and writing, she loves the cinema, the theater (modern, classic, musicals...), fitness classes (and more recently also yoga), walking, crochet, and owls. Her main aim is not to be boring and to entertain. The first of her books to be published as e-book (October 2012) is 'The Man Who Wasn't There' also available in Spanish version: 'El hombre que nunca existió'. In December 2012 she published 3 novellas in the series 'Escaping Psychiatry'. 'Cannon Fodder' (Escaping Psychiatry Part 1), 'Teamwork' (Escaping Psychiatry Part 2), and 'Memory' (Escaping Psychiatry Part 3). The author has used her experience and insights in these three works of fiction that follow Mary, psychiatrist and writer, and her adventures. In February 2013 she published a Young Adult novella in English (Twin Evils?) and Spanish(Gemela Maldad). This story talks about sibling rivalry taken to extremes, friendship, romance and has a touch of the paranormal. In June 20013 she published my first foray in romantic fiction: 'Click Me Happy!' a novella where readers can choose between three endings, an unhappy, a neutral and an unhappy one. She is working on further adventures on the series Escaping Psychiatry and...many other things.", "related": ["B00DJZKNFA"], "rank": 3928562, "title": "Click Me Happy!

The complex themes are woven into verse spanning intellectual and emotional styles and crafting poems across all forms such as stanzaic, sonnet, haiku, free verse, and many more. While certainly not a master of any of the philosophic, social, or religious parts, it is the innovative combination of the parts using all forms and styles into an interpretation of Life that perhaps proves to provide insightful inspiration to the reader.", "related": ["B00LE04UB0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Raised in the Midwest of America, she began travelling the world just after high school, settled in Scotland for several years, and eventually settled with her husband in Switzerland.  Interest in a wide variety of subjects has led to an eclectic path in life which has in turn lent itself to her writing.  Her style of writing in the historical fiction genre has been compared to both Georgette Heyer and Jane Austen, though she enjoys writing in other genres as well as it gives her the opportunity to explore a wide variety of subjects and research; she has works in progress in Historical Fiction, Science Fiction, Fantasy, and good old-fashioned Contemporary Fiction. Her love of learning has driven her to research in areas as diverse as geology, mineralogy, astronomy, archaeology, science and technology, the history of medicine at sea, naval history in Europe, bioelectronics, biology, botany, music, etymology, linguistics and obscure languages.  She can tell you the dimensions of the average coffin, how far a chaise and four can travel in a day, and what arsenic smells like when heated.  She needs little sleep, which in turn leaves more time to explore her interests.   Besides writing she is an active vocal coach and singer with four CDs under her belt to date.  She began singing on stage at the age of four, recorded her first commercial work at eleven, and began vocal coaching adults at the age of fifteen.  She began teaching English to adults at the age of eleven as well.  When not coaching, writing, or household management, she enjoys a wide variety of crafts, is an avid film buff and enjoys cooking.  She runs a forum for writers online dealing with linguistic, grammatical and etymological queries, which has stemmed from her training in TEFLA.  She speaks fluent English, High German and Swiss German, and does simultaneous translation into English.  Her husband of 20+ years is a keeper, and they share their home with three  feline flatmates.", "related": ["B008JLF4U8"], "rank": 1493546, "title": "The Price of Freedom (The Northing Trilogy Book 1)", "author": "Stephanie Huesler", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Its victims die an agonising death\n  at an alarming speed. Detective Ashley North is the only one assigned to the\n  case. Her tenacity is required to solve this mystery against the odds. As\n  more victims are struck down, Ashley wonders if she will ever save the town\n  from total decimation. What is the connection between these people? And where\n  has this 'virus' originated from? Jessica\n  Hemingway has penned a compelling tale in Consumed that could rival the\n  present masters of this genre. Despite the gripping nature of Consumed, I\n  found the writing style particularly easy to read. I was quite a way into the\n  novel before I thought I had the answer to the 'virus.' But, Jessica\n  Hemingway added a few more twists and turns that kept me guessing right until\n  the very end. The characters are interesting and have intriguing histories.\n  Characters are one of the most important factors of a novel, and Consumed\n  delivers in this respect. It encourages you to care for their lives and root\n  for their success. Is there going to be a sequel? There is definitely the\n  potential for a continuation. I will make sure I am one of the first in line,\n  in that case. Consumed\n  is a novel that defies your need to get on with other things. It demands your\n  undivided attention until it has satisfied your quest for resolution. In\n  other words, don't consider putting down Consumed until it has totally\n  consumed you.", "related": ["B00JO1GGT0"], "rank": 2859648, "title": "Consumed", "author": "Jessica Hemingway", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The explanations and advice provided by Kelly and D’Avignon are based on their considerable experience, wisdom, and thorough review of the literature. Therapists from a range of disciplines—new to the world of autism, as well as seasoned travelers such as myself—will gain knowledge and insight, both valuable and enjoyable.” (Tony Attwood, PhD, Chairperson, The Minds and Hearts Clinic, Brisbane, Australia; author of The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome)“A marvelous book both for beginning therapists and experienced ones, this volume provides a readable, highly useful introduction to intervention in autism. With chapters speaking to students, parents, and siblings, the book provides a thoughtful approach to developing a treatment plan as well as preparing for the future. It will be an invaluable guide for years to come.” (Fred R. Volkmar, MD, Chief of Child Psychiatry at Yale New Haven Hospital; Editor-in-Chief, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders)“Kelly and D'Avignon offer a compassionate and detailed guide to approaching the treatment of children on the spectrum. Their book provides an unusually pragmatic and thorough introduction to the treatment challenges faced by these children, their parents, and the therapist.” (Richard Bromfield, PhD, Harvard Medical School, author of Doing Therapy with Children and Adolescents with Asperger Syndrome)“A practical outline for working with a high functioning autistic person that clearly spells out the differences required in employing a therapeutic process that fits both their general profile and their particular individual needs. Both new and seasoned therapists can learn a lot from this book. The forms fit the theory. Use them!” (Elsa Abele, CCC, SLP, Pragmatic Language Consultant; Associate, Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders, Antioch University NE)“The community of psychotherapists working with clients with autism spectrum disorder is fortunate that this book has been written. In careful step-by-step explanations, readers are led through explanations of terms, causes of the disorder, and recommendations for its remediation. Avoiding the thickets of medical terminology that have plagued earlier works, this book strikes straight to the heart of the matter. Of particular value are the 12 exemplars of agreements, forms, and checklists found in the appendices. If a part of your practice involves treating ASD, this is the book for you.” (John Dacey, PhD, Professor Emeritus, Boston College; author of Human Development Across the Lifespan and Your Anxious Child)", "related": ["B005MRTK2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Most broadly, the book is important because it is sensitive to Thoreau's claim on our attention: it shows the 'postmodern' resonance of his concerns with self-fashioning and care of self, with the experience and representation of nature, with the power and limits of art. Of more specific importance is Bennett's exploration of the political bearing of the avowedly 'anti-political' ethos that Thoreau shapes from these concerns. In this regard, she uses her own ambivalence about Thoreau in a way that exemplifies the fruitfulness of intellectual honesty: she reads with and against Thoreau, to hold in tension his untimely idealism, and the genealogical critique she discloses in an extended discussion of Kafka. Bennett's reading of Thoreau, then, serves to articulate a political ethos that both defends and chastens political commitment. The result is a special book that theorizes politics by taking seriously the insights of literature and the practices of art. (George Shulman)Well-written, provocative, and altogether one of the most interesting books on Thoreau to come out in the past decade. Perhaps this fascinating volume will now get the attention it deserves. (Thoreau Society Bulletin)This remarkable book rescues Thoreau from readers intent upon reducing him to a sentimental nature-worshipper. By re-examining his writing in a series of dialogues with a wide array of postmodern critics, contemporary writers, and nature philosophers, Bennett elegantly represents Thoreau as an important thinker of subtle complexity and radical insight. Bennett's reading of Thoreau is a striking achievement that will revitalize discussion about the interpretations given to the realms of 'nature' or 'wilderness' in contemporary debates about ethics and politics.

She and her retired pastor husband have been married over four decades. They enjoy time with their married children's families, taking part in volunteer ministries, entertaining guests informally, and spending time with family and friends.     Margery's earlier creative thoughts made it to paper because of her personal faith in Jesus Christ or because of ministry or community needs wherever the Warders lived. When she turned sixty, her devotion to express her faith and humor in writing increased, resulting in being hired as a columnist, features writer, and reporter for two newspapers.     Now, hundreds of articles later, she has completed one historical fiction book entitled \"Leaves That Did Not Wither\", and has its sequels in rough draft formats, though \"books\" in her mind are begging for attention.     Margery hopes her writing is an encouragement to others because she values time, both hers and that of her readers.

Walls surround the town of Edenvale, and Zombie Zappers lure the walking dead to their final ends. The zombies are dangerous but under control, which frees Matt Hunter to worry about more pressing matters, like what he's going to get for Christmas. Matt hopes for a controller for his favorite video game, but his parents disappoint him by giving him a hamster instead. Snuffles doesn't do much except eat and sleep, until he dies and rises up as a zombie. Anti-Snuffles—as Matt now refers to his undead pet—soon escapes captivity. Now Matt and his friends must hunt down malevolent rodent before it turns Edenvale's pets into an army of the dead. McCreely maintains a humorous tone throughout, keeping the story from ever getting too dark. The irreverent narrator, short chapters, and brisk pace will appeal to reluctant readers. My Zombie Hamster contains some implied violence, but nothing too graphic, making it the perfect pick for readers who are interested in zombie action, but who are not ready for gore. The satisfying conclusion leaves just enough unresolved to hint at future adventures involving Matt and his ghoulish rodent.—Tony Hirt, Hennepin County Library, MN", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He holds a PhD in English from the University of California at Riverside.  His interest in marriage and relationships started many years ago, while he was still sin-gle, observing married couples interact. He saw some couples function as a harmonious unit and other couples treating each other as enemies. In later years, continued observation, personal experience, and substantial research led him to consider sharing what he had learned. He began mounting Web pages about improving relationships.  Then one day he witnessed a young couple in a supermarket arguing in hostile tones over whether to buy a particular jar of jelly. It oc-curred to him then that a short, easily accessible little book about marriage might be helpful for such couples. Not long after that, he was reading in the book of Proverbs, and the idea for the current volume took root. Dr. Harris lives in Tustin with his excellent wife, Marie.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has always known that writing would be the thing she'd spend the rest of her life doing. In addition to writing, Emily enjoys music; she plays violin, piano, cello, and guitar. She also loves cooking/baking, babysitting, working as a counselor of a day camp, and spending time with friends. Emily is a student at Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts where she is majoring in Elementary Education and Creative Writing. The publication of 'Right Where My Heart Should Be' is a dream come true. This novel has been in the works for about three years, and it's finally reached its final stages. 'Right Where My Heart Should Be' is completely fictional and has no connection to Emily's life, although she feels a connection with the characters, which is why she's been able to put so much dedication into the making of the novel. Emily has three other novels, 'A Little Different,' the sequel to RWMHSB, 'Identity,' which tells the same story from different points of view, giving new access to characters' back stories, and 'Dear Elliot,' a romance novel. All of Emily's novels deal with the same set of characters. Her family and friends are very important to her, and 'Right Where My Heart Should Be' would not be possible without their love and support.

Indeed love poetry often served as valuable communication tool with his long term partner. Tragedy strikes the family when his long term partner becomes unwell, requiring significant surgery and a lengthy hospital stay. Once again romantic poetry steps in to lend a hand, with loving poetic messages tucked away in Get Well Soon cards. Tragedy, unlike lightning, can indeed strike twice, some nine months later, his partner's struggle for life comes to an end. Tragedy thrice, only four days later, her son sadly passed away suddenly from a massive heart attack, caused by the same genetic disorder that had taken his mother from him too soon.  Heart-broken, overwhelmed by grief, and suffering the extra strain of new found single parenthood, Darren soon turned back to the pen, using poems to document and help process his feelings.  Over the next ten years Darren's writing, as yet not shared with the world, played an important role in his journey to recovery from such tragic bereavement, and therefore now makes his poems available to the public. His goal is to provide some comfort to those who may be struggling with a similar journey. The forthcoming bookMy 5 Stages of GriefbyDarren Heartis a chronicle of this journey to recovery, containing poems related to the various stages of grief; Denial, Bargaining, Depression, Anger and Acceptance are all covered via the medium of poetry and prose.
