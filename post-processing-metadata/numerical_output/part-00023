Although such a gang may contain a core group, many more are made up of fringe members, he asserts, and there is overlap among gangs. A large number of gangs have a criminal orientation, and their crimes have traditionally been against property. Gangs' major activity, according to the author, has been inactivity. But in recent times, the number of street gangs has grown enormously, he shows, with gangs now found in at least 800 American cities, their growth abetted by media attention and inept law enforcement officials. But as the gang culture has spread across the nation, the seriousness of its crimes has increased, with hundreds of homicides yearly in L.A. alone. Though written by a scholar who has studied street gangs for 30 years, this telling commentary is generally free of academic jargon.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Continuing to stress the importance of communication between partners, Cox distinguishes her work with an impressive range of topics, as well as careful attention to the emotional and intellectual aspects of sex. With a friendly, funny, conversational tone, Cox provides the requisite sex tips as well as advice on increasing attractiveness, consolation for late bloomers and detailed instructions on becoming a better kisser (an oft-overlooked instructional). She also offers her take on controversial topics like interoffice dating (why not?), and disproves common wisdom such as the assumption that men have stronger sex drives than women; she also disproves the adage that there's nothing new under the sun with three new female spots, besides the G, ripe for stimulation. Most topics are addressed from both a male and female point of view, letting readers in on the other team's viewpoint; her only misstep is a chapter on homosexuality and bisexuality aimed more at curious heteros than practicing gays and lesbians. Otherwise, this solid sex resource holds plenty of answers, both to frequently asked questions and the ones you're afraid to ask.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Magee, an associate musicology professor at Indiana University, attempts to redress this slight in his scholarly look at the work of Fletcher Henderson (1897–1952). More a \"portrait of a musical collaboration\" than a biography, Magee's narrative travels from Henderson's years as a bandleader during the Harlem Renaissance through his stint as Benny Goodman's arranger, highlighting the musical idiosyncrasies of what became known as \"Hendersonese.\" Magee paints a vivid portrait of the central figures of early jazz and swing (Louis Armstrong is a \"strong streak of color in a crazy quilt\") as well as the business of recording and touring in the 1920s and '30s. While Benny Goodman is lauded as the major force behind the Big Band sound, Magee argues convincingly that Henderson was equally important in \"building the kingdom of swing.\" The layperson will struggle with the musical notation and terminology, as well as the repetitious readings of dozens of scores and performances. For the jazz student, though, Magee's analysis of Henderson's recordings will be invaluable, as will the appendix annotating every arrangement Henderson wrote for Goodman. This may not be the book that brings Henderson out of the shadows, but it's a welcome addition to the study of swing. Illus.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

'You told Cristiano Cordova where I lived so that he could come and see the baby and… What was it you said? See for himself the dreadful conditions in which I'm living?'She stared at the telephone receiver in her hand as though it were an unexploded bomb, mute outrage gripping her throat while fear and dread cascaded through her bloodstream like a swollen river bursting its banks.'Why? Why would you do such a thing?''Why do you think? I told him because the Cordovas obviously aren't short of a penny or two, and theyoweyou! Since that good-for-nothing Ramón is dead, and you've been saddled with his child to try and raise on your own instead of finishing your degree, they ought to take some sort of responsibility for what's happened, wouldn't you say?''Is that what you told him? That he was responsible for Matilde?''Yes!' There was stubborn defiance in the other woman's voice. 'And he agreed!''Listen…they owe me nothing! It was my own decision to go ahead with the pregnancy and have the baby, and it's nothing to do with anyone else! If Ramón himself wasn't interested in his daughter why do you think for one moment that I would be remotely interested in making contact with the rest of his family? Much less have one of them come visit me!''Well, someone should pay for the mess that man got you into—and why shouldn't his family cough up? He ruined your life, Dominique! You were on course for a wonderful career and now look at you!'For a moment Dominique couldn't speak over the raw pain inside her throat. Her mother made it sound as if she was the biggest failure that ever lived! Was there nothing she could ever do to please her? Already knowing the answer, she fought off the wave of shame and despondency that washed over her and dispiritedly murmured a strained goodbye.***A week on and still she greeted each minute in dread of Cristiano Cordova showing up at her door, possibly wanting to assume some sort of control over her baby's future. The already broken nights she endured, waking to feed Matilde, had been disrupted further by anxiety and fear. The freedom to lead her own life that she'd so desperately sought when she'd finally left her mother's house to care for her baby on her own had been horribly threatened and spoiled.She had already been feeling strangely disconnected from the rest of the world—the only light in her life being derived from her beautiful baby girl— while other people were looking forward to the holiday season, busy flitting in and out of the shops that were bursting with glittering arrays of Christmas paraphernalia, and counting down the days for the big event itself. The restaurant where Dominique worked as a waitress was already inundated with orders for lunch on Christmas Day, and she could have increased her hours in a heartbeat if she didn't fiercely guard the maximum time she could afford to spend with her baby. But other people's anticipation of Christmas only served to heighten her sense of isolation.And now her mother had betrayed her.She had colluded with Cristiano Cordova—Ramón's rich and influential cousin—behind her back, and encouraged the idea that Dominique's baby was nowhisresponsibility, since there was now no hope of Ramón himself ever fulfilling that role. The revelation still had the power to stun her senseless. She was still reeling from the news that Ramón was dead…killed in a car accident on some remote mountain pass in Spain. The catalogue of heartbreak since Dominique had met him was surely now complete?Cristiano declined the offer of more coffee from the smiling air stewardess and, making a steeple of his fingers, stared out at the dazzling vista of pale clouds that resembled sun-struck snow-covered mountain peaks in the sky. For a poignant moment he imagined his young cousin's restless and unhappy spirit, roaming free amongst those selfsame clouds—no longer bound by the constraints of the physical existence that had seemed to cause him so much turmoil and difficulty while he lived… Emotion welled up inside him and painfully cramped his throat.If only he had been able to get through to Ramón as he'd longed to…get him to see that the family would have forgiven him every transgression if he had only met them halfway…But it was too late for recriminations. The situation wasbeyondrescue now. Cristiano had never voiced out loud his terrible fear that perhaps Ramón haddeliberatelysought to end his own life by driving his car over a clifftop that dreadful night— but he could not help thinking it just the same, and the thought gave him nightmares.When a letter had been discovered amongst Ramón's things after the funeral—from a girl none of the family had ever evenheardof before— Cristiano and the family had honestly been stunned by its contents. The girl…Dominique…wrote to tell him news of the birth of her baby—Ramón'sbaby— and had even included a photograph of the infant. Although things were well and truly over between them, she wrote, she thought he should at least know that he was the father of a healthy and beautiful little girl.The letter had been dated six months earlier, and though he knew he would have to go to the UK and investigate for himself the legitimacy of the girl's claims, Cristiano had also realised it must fall to him to convey the news that Ramón was dead—and that could not wait. But he had not had the opportunity to speak to Dominique herself. Instead, when he had called the telephone number she'd included in her letter, the girl's mother had answered. Upon his revealing to her who he was and why he was calling the woman had not held back.His 'heartless, good-for-nothing cousin' had wrecked her daughter's life, Cristiano had been told in no uncertain terms, and his family had better do something about it. Dominique had only had a year to go before she finished her degree, and had had a bright future to look forward to. Now, instead, she was weighed down with the responsibilities of a baby!When Jean Sanderson had calmed down sufficiently for him to get a word in edgeways Cristiano had soothingly but authoritatively told her that if it were true that her daughter's baby was Ramón's then he would of course take steps to ensure their future prospects were comfortable and to her liking. Certainly Dominique would not be denied the opportunity to finish her education. The Cordova family took their responsibilities seriously and would not turn their backs on one of their own. Slightly placated, Mrs Sanderson had then volunteered Dominique's new address—she had apparently moved out since her letter to Ramón—and was living in a 'grubby little bedsit' in one of London's least attractive boroughs.The accusations had come hard and fast. Dominique's mother's anger and resentment were glaringly evident.Even in death it seemed that Ramón's reckless and thoughtless behaviour was still having massive repercussions on people's lives…Yet again it had been left to Cristiano to smooth the troubled waters his cousin had left in his wake.Releasing a troubled sigh, he pulled his gaze away from the spectacular view offered by the small window beside him and concerned himself instead with thoughts of his family. A family whose sorrow at losing a beloved son had been unexpectedly eased by the revelation that he'd fathered a child… a child they hoped and prayed Cristiano would be bringing back with him on his return—back where they were convinced she belonged…There was a knock at the door, and in the same instant the milk she'd been heating on the stove for hot chocolate boiled over. Cursing softly, Dominique turned off the gas, surveyed the burnt sticky mess clinging to the side of the saucepan, and unhappily mourned the diminishing ability of her once sharp brain to concentrate for even two seconds flat. The trouble was Matilde was teething, and they had both had a horrendously sleepless night. Now fed, and finally asleep, the baby lay cosily wrapped up against the cold in her cot, and Dominique had been looking forward to the comfort of a hot drink for herself.No doubt the person knocking on the door at that inopportune moment was Katie—the ballet student who lived in the bedsit opposite. Frequently out of milk, sugar, tea, coffee…food—anything you cared to name—she often walked across the landing to see if Dominique could help out. Leaving the cramped space that laughingly masqueraded as a kitchen and padding across the thin, worn carpet in her stockinged feet, Dominique opened the door with a resigned smile already in place—and a swift, silent prayer of thanks that she had done her shopping yesterday, before Matilde's teething problem had kept them both awake for half the night…'Dominique Sanderson?'She stared up at the imposing male on the other side of the door with her heart racing a mile a minute. He was obviously foreign—even if his accent hadn't alerted her to the fact, his dark and striking looks strongly confirmed it—and Dominique half closed the door again, feeling sick with dread. 'Who wants to know?' she answered, the smile she had automatically summoned for Katie firmly banished.'I am Cristiano Cordova… Ramón Cordova's cousin. May I come in and speak with you?' he enquired formally.'No, you can't!' In a panic, Dominique glanced over at the tattered Chinese screen behind which her infant daughter's cot was positioned—grateful that at this angle it was completely hidden from view. 'It was very wrong of my mother to give you my address, and I told her so! I'm sorry, but you're just going to have to turn arou...", "related": ["B00JGABO14"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 1932 Forester was offered a Hollywood contract, and from then until 1939 he spent thirteen weeks of every year in America.    On the outbreak of war he entered the Ministry of Information and later he sailed with the Royal Navy to collect the material for The Ship. He made a voyage to the Bering Sea to gather material for a similar book on the United States Navy, and it was during this trip that he was stricken with arteriosclerosis, a disease which left him crippled.

Nourished by mass immigration and American society's proven adaptability, the country will reign supreme over an industrialized world beset by old age, bitter ethnic conflicts, and erratically functioning economic institutions. Although decreasing social mobility will present a challenge, demographic resources will give the U.S. an edge over its European rivals, which will be constrained by shrinking work forces and rapidly proliferating social welfare commitments. Largely concerned with migration patterns within the U.S., the book also offers a nonpartisan view of America's strengths, identifying both pro-immigration and strongly capitalist policies as sources of its continued prosperity. However, Kotkin tends to gloss over the looming and incontrovertible challenges facing the country and devotes limited space to the long-term consequences posed by the current recession, the rise of India and China, and the resulting competition over diminishing energy resources. Nevertheless, his confidence is well-supported and is a reassuring balm amid the political and economic turmoil of the moment.(Feb.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Slowly he bent his face down and his lips lightly brushed hers.

He moved his other hand up and down her curves; now holding a breast, now rubbing her hip, then he wound his fingers into her hair and used the two contact points of lips and groin to make her feel his desire. He moved his head slightly. His lips kissed along her face to her ear then to her neck. His tongue licked a trail along the curve of her face to her chin, then he kissed her once more.

B. Story is a writer living in the southwestern United States. While that territory can cover anywhere from New Mexico to Hawaii he declines to be more specific at this time.

Such invasions of one's personal life become an unnecessary distraction. D. B. Story has long had interests in both Science Fiction (since first discovering his mother's secret cache of Ace Doublebooks stashed under her bed) and writing. In fact, anything he has enjoyed participating in he eventually has a desire to create as well. He seriously began writing (although not selling) stories ten years ago due to a dissatisfaction with what he was reading at the time and the belief that he could do it better. He started out with the interaction between humans and the sexy robots they would inevitably create and later branched out to other erotic Fantasy and SF genres. During that time he has written everything from flash fiction to a 402,000 word novel and a screenplay based on his other writings, as yet unsold. Whether his writing is actually \"better\" he admits he must leave to his readers to decide, but he likes his stuff a lot. He has often said that, \"Writing time is always good time.\" He also says that with the advent of cheap computers, word processors, eBooks, and the Internet that times have never been better for a diversity of writers to be heard.", "related": ["B00KS23P6G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When he and the other boys are taken to Fort Smith, Ark., to witness a hanging--a lesson in criminal justice inflicted by the minister in charge of the orphanage--Tom is offered a job as errand boy to a hardware salesman. The minister gladly sheds responsibility for the teenager, and Tom is given to Jake Jaycox, an aging, soft-hearted drummer with whom the lad becomes fast friends. As the pair ply the trade between Oklahoma and Arkansas, Tom discovers \"civilization,\" racism and sex. Aiding in his coming of age is Samantha King, a provocative \"older\" woman who, through a bizarre mishap, becomes attached to the selling pair. Benefiting from extensive research by Morgan, a writing professor at the University of Missouri and author ( Belle Starr ), the book nicely captures the atmosphere of Indian Territory and environs nearly 100 years ago.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But these concerns melt away after the first 100 pages of this volume. Briggs's descriptions are crisper and the dialogue is sharper, with fewer \"shall's,\" \"shan't's\" and \"I say!'s\" than the Garnett, Maude, or Edmonds translations, leaving readers free to enjoy the rich and complex plot, vivid characters and profound insights into war and the nature of power. There are some awkward spots: Briggs claims his earthy rendering of soldierly banter is more realistic than earlier, genteel translators', but it reads distractingly stagy: \"Give 'im a right thumpin', we did.\" It's also a shame to have lost Tolstoy's use of French, not only in the mouths of his characters, but also in the essays, as when he plays with Napoleon's famous \"sublime to the ridiculous\" quote. Briggs will face competition next year when Pevear and Volokhonsky release their new translation, but for now, this is the most readable translation on the market.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A valuable and indispensable investigation, this work constitutes a landmark in historical analysis of the interrelationships among the United States, Brazil, and the African slave trade. Literally radiating with extraordinary historical observations and a host of well thought-out and well presented ideas,is not only of interest to historians, but also scholars of economics and politics.is required reading for all scholars working in the broad field of the African slave trade.\"-African American Review,“This fascinating study uses the tools and sources of diplomatic history to examine a sweep of national and international history far beyond the confines of diplomacy. . . . For Horne, the slave trade, rather than slavery, was an explosive political issue much later in the 19th century that is normally understood. Highly recommended.”-Choice,“Horne expertly interweaves the political views presented in official documents with personal commentary from letters and travel accounts. . . . It is valuable for scholars of U.S. foreign policy due to its coverage of diplomacy between the United States and other nations. This work contributes to the study of U.S. South since Horne details the plans of some southern leaders and planter elites who looked to Brazil as the answer when all was lost in the United States. ”-The Journal of Southern History,“A well-researched, skillfully-written, and carefully-argued diplomatic history examining connections between the United States, Brazil, Africa, and Europe as they relate to the transatlantic slave trade. Horne sheds considerable light upon the ideas, ruminations, and practices of U.S. nationals in their interactions with and encounters of Brazil over the question of slavery, especially from the mid-nineteenth century on, and makes a valuable and important contribution to our knowledge and understanding of (American) hemispheric relations and trajectories, both eventual and potential.”-Michael A. Gomez,editor ofDiasporic Africa: A Reader“An important study that starts with the proposition that what happens abroad affects developments in the United States. For the first time we are made aware of the extensive contacts between pro-slavery forces in the United States in the years after the abolition of the slave trade and the promoters of slavery in and the slave trade to Brazil and elsewhere.”-Richard J.

Highly proficient with multi medias and styles, Peter’s aim is to bring out the expressive quality of each student. His unique teaching approach is remarkably successful with not only the artistically inclined, but also the artistically challenged, special needs children and adults, senior citizens and at-risk-youth.  Proven correct time and again, his conviction that DRAWING SKILL CAN BE LEARNED is the heart of his ANYONE CAN...ARTS philosophy. \"When we are growing up, we are taught that a small percentage of people have the ability to draw well, but I'm convinced the opposite is true,\" confides Peter.  While studying psychology he questioned why some people have the talent to draw well and others don't.   Something inside told him it was more than talent and his investigations led him to conclude people were not only not getting the right encouragement, but they were also getting instruction based on faulty premises. Schools teach that art comes from \"intuition\" and it simply flows from us. If a child isn't showing any artistic instincts from the get go, he never will. Peter doesn't deny the existence of artistically gifted individuals, but he believes drawing should be taught analytically as a skill. Instead of using the historically great artists as absolute models, our learning should start from the basics and evolve step-by-step at one's individual pace. This method gives the student a fair chance to discover he or she can actually draw well and do something with the skill. In fact, Peter prefers to look at drawing as functional and we can use it any way we want.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His skill with a six-gun was something that he developed and kept a secret, mostly. Those who learned of his prowess often did not live to spread the knowledge.This is a story about love and the free-spirit attitude that prevailed in much of the Old West in this time. Many men were drifters, moving from one job to another, always looking for something better, whether is was a better job, or better land, or better neighbors. The hero in this case had just lost his job as a marshal, and was a cowboy at a nearby ranch when life changed drastically for him. He ends up shooting someone pretty important, and instead of being a \"cowboy,\" he is now an \"outlaw.\"The book required that I learn some things about Texas, but more about New Mexico Territory. That was truly the \"wild, wild west,\" even into the 20th Century. Apache bands regularly wandered across New Mexico, raiding deep into Mexico and hiding out in New Mexico Territory, and there were some true \"bad hombres\" in New Mexico. It's the place where Billy the Kid made his name.I enjoyed writing this book more than any story I've written. I liked the main character very much.Wish I could have known him.

Neither I nor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspired writing, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being the work of one of the masters. If they present truth in such a way that it follows sequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if the information given raises the aspiration and the will to serve from the plane of the emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found) then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth a response from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings a flashing forth of the intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But not otherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemed true under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good.

I first met Kevin as an assistant on Dale Brown's staff and immediately recognized a passion on his part to TEACH -- which is why I am not surprised that his book is an excellent one. The book itself is different but is exactly one that so many coaches need. If you are looking for some plays, quick-hitters and detailed X & O's, this isn't the book. But if you are looking for help to better teach the X & O's and, most importantly, apply them in game situations than this is a must read. There are thousands of books and videos on plays but this is unique look at STRATEGY including the following sections:The Right Approach Goes A Long Way It speaks to theories Kevin learned from Coach Wooden and Don Meyer as well as understanding what you can control from the bench and what you cannot -- including your relationship with officials.The Logic Behind It Delves into both strategic thinking and tactical thinkingManagement Issues Again, this is game coaching that we often don't give enough thought to such as preparing to play at home and on the road, bench decorum and bench organization.Failing to Plan is Planning to Fail This is a great chapter on planning and practicing special situationsControlling What the Coach Can Control Detailed look at pre-game warm-up, substitutions, timeouts, and jump ballsSome Thoughts on Defense A different look at defense with thoughts on how to foul for profit, special defensive strategies and how and when to change defenses.How Fast Do You Want to Play? Kevin talks about how to speed the game up and how to slow the game down.The End of the Game This is a section on understanding time and score, killing the clock and what do you need to do to comeback in a game.It is All in the Details A lot of great checklists to help your stay organized in a variety of areas.From the Summary -- some thoughts from Kevin:Coaches should always be thinking about teaching the game, and regardless of the outcome of the game, never stop coaching and teaching the players!The time to plan for special situations and bench coaching strategy and tactics is long before the game.The coach should decide what to do before games so decisions will be made in a calm, unemotional environment.The coach's responsibility is to TEACH the players.From the section on Bench Coaching for Success:\"Don't whine, don't complain, and don't make excuses!\" - John WoodenIf ever there was a creed or slogan that every coach in every sport should adopt, this might be the one. All players must accept responsibility for their actions, their inactions, and their individual responsibilities. It is almost inbred in each of us as humans to resist these very things; thus, the need for coaches everywhere is to teach the Wooden Rule.Whining simply produces negativity and annoys other people. No one likes to be around a \"whiner.\" It is not good for the player, it is not good for the team, and it does not foster a positive team environment. It can also be like a contagious virus. If one player whines unchecked long enough, the whining can spread like the contagious virus. Whining also prevents a player from being proactive and taking steps to eliminate the very thing that he or she is whining about, preventing the player from living up to his or her potential. --Coach Bob Starkey - Associate Head Coach for the LSU Lady Tigers Basketball TeamI got my hands on a new book this past week, Game Strategies and Tactics for Basketball from my friend Kevin Sivils.

Hope you enjoy the story! Jenna came to a thicket of dense branches. She stumbled along\nthe edge for a while, then pulled her dress hem from the back to the front and\ntucked it through her belt to make a pair of pants. She dropped to her hands\nand knees, hoping to find a way to the other side. The branches curved up from\nthe base of the tall bushes. She slid between two of them, ignoring the\noverpowering scent of earth and decayed leaves. Too soon, the Wraith might stir\nher own scent with them, burying her forever. Struggling to forget that\nthought, she squirmed ahead. After several more feet, she broke free.The fresh, clear air refreshed her. Her chest labored for\neach breath. Odors of rich earth still filled her nostrils. She scrubbed a\ngrimy hand over her face. Dirt turned to mud where the cold sweat coated her\ncheeks. She suppressed a hopeless sob. Sitting on the damp ground, she flipped\nher dress hem up and tried to wipe some of the grim away. Several spots stung\nfrom tiny scratches.\"I will not cry. I will be strong,\" she whispered, hoping\nthe sound of her voice might bring a measure of calmness to her. She glanced\naround.The forest had brightened. The moon had risen, casting\nlight through the towering canopy. Off to one side, ahead of her, the trees\nthinned. She shoved up from the ground and lurched along in that direction\nuntil she came to a small clearing.No more than thirty feet across, the clearing's\nleaf-layered ground held several fallen limbs and a large, high-back chair. The\nchair, in itself, should have caused the chill bumps to cover Jenna's skin, but\nit didn't. Her gaze snagged and remained riveted on a tall, dark figure\nstanding in the center of the open space. With her legs threatening to\ncollapse, Jenna eased down beside the nearest tree without taking her gaze off the\ncreature.Moon beams lit on the form clothed in tattered black robes.\nRandom sparkles sprang forth as the light touched the material. His face,\nhidden within the hood, tilted back toward the night sky. A gloved hand lifted\nand reached, his fingers moving slightly, to the stars above.Sorrow radiated from the creature, almost tangible in its\nstrength. A sharp pang pierced her chest, and tears threatened once more.\nSympathy dissolved her fear in minute degrees. She felt a strange kinship to\nthe Wraith. Today she had departed her home, thrilled for the end of her\nenforced labor, and now she hid not far away from the forest's spectra. Both of\nthem were alone, denied family and home. Her life stretched before her as a\ndark empty void, much like his existence. She wanted more than that, wanted to\nrefill the emptiness with love. Instinctively, the desire to comfort him leaped\ninto her mind, demanding she go to him.She stood and lifted one foot to step into the clearing. In\nthe span of a second, the Wraith stood before her, pressing her against a tree.\nAll thoughts of compassion fled under his assault. Her heart skipped a beat\nthen accelerated. Fear returned in full force, sucking the very air from her\nlungs.", "related": [], "rank": 2243460, "title": "Wraith's Forest eBook", "author": "L.J.

The fact that Aida Kouyoumjian can retell her mother s story so convincingly is the value of  memory ... Her stories teach us how to live and not give up under atrocious circumstances. Aida Kouyoumjian moved to America in 1952. The fact that this book is written in English is a testament to her intellect and very vibrant voice.  The book depicts Arabic and Armenian traits and it weaves a carpet for me to get a glimpse of what life was like back then ... Growing up in the '50s, I remember my parents telling me to finish the food on my plate with 'Remember the starving Armenians.' \"--Deborah Cooke, Retired editor/published writer travel\"This is a brutally honest story nothing seems to be exaggerated or glossed over in this true story--which makes more of an impact on the reader. Kouyoumjian did an amazing job at keeping the authenticity of the subject while writing a book with great literary value on its own.\"--Hasmik Kalantarian, Seattle, Washington\"Aida Kouyoumjian paints in minute details the vivid memories of her mother's daily experiences. We smell, taste, see, hear ... feel, cry and laugh alongside the hero. The powerful depiction of imagery painted in a colorful palette, reminds one of an oriental style painting, we are entertained by exotic places, people, and even humor in the middle  of a tragic story.\"--Sona Stewart, Retired Art Critic, Issaquah, Washington\"My mind staggers at the disruption of simple human life by the whims and obsessions of others. This is a great book for you to revisit how you see other human beings on the verge of violent and disruptive behavior by those who do not have the right to do so. I just love your book ...

Having spent the first eight years of her life moving from village to village with her missionary parents, she hadn't realized there was anything different until her uncle Phillip had brought her to his home in Tesoro del Mar.And even then, she wouldn't have imagined that there was anything likethis.She hadn't known that real people lived in such luxury. Not regular people, of course, but billionaires and business tycoons, musicians and movie stars, philanthropists and princes. Well, at least one prince.Prince Michael Leandres was the thirty-eight-year-old president of a multimedia advertising company, cousin of the prince regent, widowed father of Tesoro del Mar's youngest princess, and the first man who had ever made her heart go pitter-patter.As she slowed to wait for another set of gates to open so that she could enter the drive that led to the prince's home, she couldn't help but smile at the memory. She'd been twelve at the time, and as flustered as she was flattered when Uncle Phillip asked her to accompany him to the by-invitation-only Gala Opening of the Port Augustine Art Gallery.She'd been so preoccupied thinking about what she would wear (she would have to get a new dress, because a gala event surely required a gown) and whether she might be allowed to wear makeup (at least a little bit of eyeliner and a touch of lip gloss) that she hadn't given a thought to the other guests who might be in attendance at the event. And then she'd walked through the doors on her uncle's arm and spotted Prince Michael.To a preteen girl who was just starting to take note of the male species, he was a full six feet of masculine perfection. He was also a dozen years older than she, and already there were rumors swirling about his plans to marry his longtime sweetheart, Samantha Chandelle. But Hannah's enamored heart hadn't cared. She'd been content to admire him from afar, her blood racing through her veins just because he was in the same room with her.Since then, she'd met a lot of other men, dated some of them and even had intimate relationships with a few. But not one of them had ever made her feel the same kind of pulse-pounding, spine-tingling excitement that she'd felt simply by being in the presence of Prince Michael—not even Harrison Parker, the earl who had been her fiance for a short time.Now, fourteen years after her first meeting with the prince, she was going to come face-to-face with him again. She might even have a conversation with him—if she could manage to untie her tongue long enough to form any coherent words—and hopefully persuade him that she was the perfect woman to take care of his adorable daughter. Of course, it might be easier to convince him if she believed it herself, but truthfully, she wasn't sure how she'd let Uncle Phillip convinceherthat the idea of working as a nanny for the summer wasn't a completely ridiculous one.Or maybe she did know. Maybe it was as simple as the fact that she was in desperate need of an income and a place to stay for the summer, and working as a nanny at Cielo del Norte—a royal estate on the northern coast—would provide her with both. But on top of that, her uncle claimed that he \"would be most grateful\" if she would at least meet with the prince—as if it would be doing him some kind of favor, which made the request impossible for Hannah to deny. That the salary the prince was offering was more than enough to finally pay off the last of her student loans was a bonus.As for responsibilities, she would be providing primary care for the widowed prince's almost-four-year-old daughter. She didn't figure that should be too difficult for someone with a master's degree, but still her stomach was twisted in knots of both excitement and apprehension as she turned her ancient secondhand compact into the winding drive that led toward the prince's home.Having grown up in tents and mud huts and, on very rare occasions, bedding down on an actual mattress in a cheap hotel room, she was unprepared for life in Tesoro del Mar. When she moved into her uncle's home, she had not just a bed but a whole room to herself. She had clothes in an actual closet, books on a shelf and a hot meal on the table every night. It took her a long time to get used to living in such luxurious surroundings, but pulling up in front of the prince's home now, she knew she was about to discover the real definition of luxury.The hand-carved double front doors were opened by a uniformed butler who welcomed her into a spacious marbletiled foyer above which an enormous crystal chandelier was suspended. As she followed him down a long hallway, their footsteps muted by the antique Aubusson carpet, she noted the paintings on the walls. She had enough knowledge of and appreciation for art to recognize that the works that hung in gilded frames were not reproductions but original pieces by various European masters.The butler led her through an open doorway and into what was apparently the prince's office. Prince Michael himself was seated behind a wide desk. Bookcases filled with leather-bound volumes lined the wall behind him. The adjoining wall boasted floor-to-ceiling windows set off by textured velvet curtains. It even smelled rich, she thought, noting the scents of lemon polish, aged leather and fresh flowers.\"Miss Castillo, Your Highness.\" The butler announced her presence in a formal tone, then bowed as he retreated from the room.The nerves continued to twist and knot in her stomach. Was she supposed to bow? Curtsy? She should have asked her uncle about the appropriate etiquette, but she'd had so many other questions and concerns about his proposition that the intricacies of royal protocol had never crossed her mind.She debated for about ten seconds, then realized the prince hadn't looked away from his computer screen long enough to even glance in her direction. She could have bowedandcurtsiedanddone a tap dance and he wouldn't even have noticed. Instead, she focused on her breathing and tried to relax, reminding herself that Michael Leandres might be a prince, but he was still just a man.Then he pushed away from his desk and rose to his feet, and she realized that she was wrong.This man wasn't \"just\" anything. He was taller than she'd remembered, broader across the shoulders and so much more handsome in person than he appeared in newspaper photos and on magazine covers. And her heart, already racing, leaped again.He gestured to the chairs in front of his desk. \"Please, have a seat.\"His voice was deep and cultured, and with each word, little tingles danced over her skin. She couldn't be sure if her reaction to him was that of a girl so long enamored of a prince or of a woman instinctively responding to an undeniably attractive man, but she did know that it was wholly inappropriate under the circumstances. She was here to interview for a job, not ogle the man, she sternly reminded herself as she lowered herself into the Queen Anne-style chair and murmured, \"Thank you.\"\"I understand that you're interested in working as my daughter's nanny for the summer,\" the prince said without further preamble.\"I am,\" she agreed, then felt compelled to add, \"although I have to confess that I've never actually worked as a nanny before.\"He nodded, seemingly unconcerned by this fact. \"Your uncle told me that you're a teacher.\"\"That's correct.\"\"How long have you been teaching?\"\"Six years,\" she told him. \"Do you enjoy it?\"\"Of course,\" she agreed.He frowned, and she wondered if her response was somehow the wrong one. But then she realized that his gaze had dropped to the BlackBerry on his desk. He punched a few buttons before he looked up at her again.\"And I understand that you've met Riley,\" he prompted.\"Only once, a few months ago. I was with a friend at the art gallery—\" coincidentally, the same art gallery where she'd first seen him so many years earlier, though it was unlikely that he had any recollection of that earlier meeting \"—and Princess Riley was there with her nanny.\"Phillip had explained to her that the nanny—Brigitte Francoeur—had been caring for the princess since she was a baby, and that Prince Michael had been having more difficulty than he'd anticipated in his efforts to find a replacement for the woman who was leaving his employ to get married.\"The way Brigitte told it to me was that my daughter ran away from her, out of the cafe—and straight into you, dumping her ice cream cone into your lap.\"Hannah waited, wondering about the relevance of his recounting of the event.\"I kept expecting to read about it in the paper,\" he explained.\"Princess Riley Accosts Museum Guest with Scoop of Strawberry.\"She couldn't help but smile. \"I'm sure, even if there had been reporters in the vicinity, they would not have found the moment newsworthy, Your Highness.\"\"I've learned, over the years, that a public figure doesn't only need to worry about the legitimate media but anyone who feels they have a story to tell. A lot of ordinary citizens would have happily sold that little tale toEl Informadorfor a tidy sum. Not only did you not run to the press to sell the story of the out-of-control princess, but you bought her a new ice cream cone to replace the one she'd lost.\"\"It wasn't her fault that the strawberry went splat,\" she said lightly.\"A gracious interpr...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a clever mix of mystery and fantasy and the writer does an excellent job of bringing these qualities out. At first it seems as if there is a fight of good versus evil, but the twists in the book soon make you realize that what we may consider evil is not always evil.Though this book seems to have been written for young adults, any reader can enjoy its fast paced action. The vivid descriptions of the writer literally transport you into the world of the 36-floor hospital and you can easily see yourself enjoying it in front of a movie screen. The end left me begging for the next book in the series, with just the right number of questions left unanswered. I highly recommend this book and I can't wait to get my hands on the next one in the series.Reviewed by Robot Reagan for Geek Tyrant websiteClass Heroeswas a good read hands\ndown, and in an industry where good science fiction for a young-adult to\n adult audience is hard to find it's certainly worth the cost for your\ne-reading device.", "related": [], "rank": 33320, "title": "A Class Apart (Class Heroes Book 1) eBook", "author": "Stephen Henning", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 21, "rating_average": 4.4286, "rating_total": 93.0}

Tom Pettigrew and Linda Tropp apply their vast knowledge and penetrating theoretical insights to synthesize the literature to create the definitive volume on this topic.When Groups Meetreviews the origins of the theory, presents a deep analysis of the current state of work on the theory, and offers a thoughtful appraisal of emerging scholarly directions.

I thought I knew the contact literature pretty well, but I found I learned something from just about every chapter. It uses a nice mix of systematic and narrative reviews of empirical work, blended with a well-judged focus on certain key studies.

What makes this story\nstrange in the beginning was he was never in the navy. He was a decorated army\nVietnam Veteran that served his four year tour of duty. In 1976 he was pulled\nover for a traffic violation. When the officer ran his driver's license through\ntheir system the officer saw that he was on the FBI's ten most wanted list and\narrested him promptly. Once in a jail cell, his parents brought over all of his\npaperwork proving who he was and proving he was not naval personnel, but did\nindeed serve his country in the army. The navy released him claiming they had\nmade an error and said they would clear up the mistake immediately.In 1987 without any warning a sheriff came to our home one\nday in September with a warrant for his arrest. It was a complete shock as my\nhusband thought this was cleared up years ago. Once again, he gathered all his\npapers and took them to the sheriff's office to prove he was not a naval\ndeserter. I was home with my two small children awaiting for his return when I\nreceived a phone call from him stating the navy insisted the sheriff keep him\ndetained until a naval officer came to pick him up to bring him to the San\nDiego Navy Brig. I was unable to retrieve any information from the navy as to\nwhere he was and why he was being falsely detained.My husband seemed different and now was showing a side of\nhim that was new to me. He had a quick temper to begin with but now he was\nloosing control over everything. I found myself walking on egg shells to keep\nhim happy. He would snap at the kids, but he took most of his aggression out on\nme and I grew very concerned. This was not normal. I even found out he\npurchased a couple of guns which scared me to death. Then one night when the kids were sleeping\nupstairs my husband out of the blue starting to yell at me stating that 'I\ndidn't know what it was like' and I tried to ask him what he was talking about\nand he threw me against the wall and changed his whole demeanor and started to\nscream in my face about the Vietnam war and all the people that were after him.\nHe then threw me to the ground and literally sat on my chest for over 2 hours\nscreaming horrible crazy things! From this point on came the beatings, the\nscream fests, and rape-sex he forced on me or he'd kill me. I was repulsed and\nsickened by him and over the course of the next few months was a true test of\nsurvival for me. We had a huge law suit pending with the US Navy and even my\nlawyer begged me to be careful of my husband. He told me he was extremely\ndangerous and volatile.He certainly was not the man I married - I didn't recognize\nhim and realized I was in big trouble. The States District Attorney contacted\nme and told me my husband had been accused years before I knew him for rape,\nstalking women and having violent uncontrollable outbursts. It was so shocking\nto find out that I was married to a real monster.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was during his nine years in Washington that he published his first book, Wake-Robin. In 1873 he returned to New York State and established his home \"Riverby\" on the west bank of the Hudson River at West Park.

Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 84, "rating_average": 4.6786, "rating_total": 393.0}

They lack intellectual content and have an arch tone and uninspired style: “Paris is a ball and the kids are eating it up”; “Felix Frankfurter was off his rocker. Let me tell you, the sixties really suck.” Styron’s first novel, Lie Down in Darkness (1951), brought sudden fame but increased the authors anxiety and insecurity. He loathed critics but was obsessed by them, flattered his friends, and was mean-spirited toward almost everyone else. He called Allen Tate, W. H. Auden, Robert Lowell, James Farrell, and Stephen Spender “all terrible bores.” Arthur Miller was “frantically opportunistic”; Lionel Trilling “cliquish and myopic”; Bellow’s Augie March was also boring. But Styron was very social, knew everybody who mattered, made a lot of money, and lived well. The best letters concern his quarrel with Norman Mailer, the glamorous dinner at the Kennedy White House, the anguished dismissal of his agent, and his alcoholism, mental breakdown, and physical illnesses. The sniping at other writers is likely to attract considerable attention to this overlong edition, which is accurately but insufficiently annotated. --Jeffrey Meyers", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He attended Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS) in the 1970's and would later work in IPS. The idea for the Thomas Family Values came out his working for the school system. As a teacher's assistant in a special education class Mr. Anderson challenged students to write stories and then read them aloud in a small group setting. This helped increase the student's confidence in reading and writing. Conversely the students encouraged Mr. Anderson to write stories so they could have something interesting to read. The stories became a big hit with the students. The students felt like he was telling their story. With the help of Mr. Anderson the class went from being a Special Education class to just being a special class. He started a program where he ate lunch with a student or group of students just to talk about their issues. He had lunch dates set out for 2 months. Professionally, Mr. Anderson graduated from National Louis University, in Tampa, FL. He was a past President of The Manual Black Alumni Association (MBAA) a group that raised money for scholarships for Manual High school seniors. He was also a past president of The Civil Cervice Conservation Club in Indianapolis, a historically black camping and conservation club with a 75 acre campground in Brown County Indiana.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's just the kind of book I wish I had had as a first-year faculty member, and one that I know I will dip into as I continue to refine my teaching approach in the coming years and decades. From managing one's first semester on the tenure track to creating strategies for renewal in every semester thereafter, the essays collected here can serve as a jumping-off point to reflect on the reasons why we musicologists do what we do and how we can do it better.' Marie Sumner-Lott, Georgia State University, USA'This collection is an important, if long overdue, handbook that will be of use to both beginning and experienced teachers. Readers will find themselves enlightened by these contributions no matter what classes they teach, from non-major classes to graduate seminars. They will find specific, concrete ideas to improve their teaching from revising entire courses to tweaking specific class presentations. Many of the ideas presented in The Music History Classroom can be integrated into the current structure of the class a teacher is using, and the volume can be referred to again and again over time for specific ideas as one's teaching evolves.'Matthew Balensuela, DePauw University, USA'Music history pedagogy in the classroom is always a challenge - to find the right mix of lecture, discussion, listening, and score analysis so as to be able to impart a relevant mix of essential facts and historical signposts without swamping our students, and to instill a set of critical and interpretive strategies they can make part of their skill set for lifelong learning. The Music History Classroom fills a longstanding need, providing sage, practical advice - from a distinguished roster of experienced teachers who are also active research musicologists - on the nuts and bolts of course design, out-of-class assignments, lecturing and other classroom-based activities, grading, and more. Such material will be of the greatest value, as well, to an additional audience: the adjuncts and part-timers, and the uncredentialled (by whom I have in mind professional performers and applied studio teachers) who are doing an ever increasing amount of the teaching of music history in higher education today.'

She added \"Fun Facts About Fruit” at the end of the imaginative story as an entertaining way for everyone to connect with nature and see where fruit really comes from. Ruth’s own healthy lifestyle includes meditation, Nia and Zumba (forms of dance) aerobics, yoga and green living, and having a healthy diet and environment. She also works on her Mac computer, enjoys classes and workshops, and is involved in film and book discussion groups.

He is also aware that it will be challenging to get things started and to stick to it until substantial progress is made and explains how to get over the challenges with willpower and dedication. It is not prudent to become consumed with minor thoughts that will only serve to “poison” the mind.  Learning how to get rid of all the toxic thoughts makes you a better individual in the long run.

Her mother's nose was always in a book while she was growing up, and this piqued her interest in reading. Soon she became an avid reader like her mother, immersing herself in fictional lands and characters' lives. Then the day came, when she was about 11 or 12, that she wondered what it would be like to create characters of her own. Her junior high school years were filled with as many creative writing classes as the school would allow her to take, joining every short story contest she could and placing one of the Top 3 spots in the class every time. During her teen years she began writing short horror stories for the mere pleasure of it. The short stories soon made way to her first full-length novel, \"War,\" which she completed when she was just 18 years old. The novel revolved around a young girl coming of age during the advent of the Civil War. Her taste for horror and suspense never left however and soon her novels evolved into historical gothic family sagas. Angela's novels and short stories have been compared to the likes of V.C. Andrews, James Patterson and even the great Shirley Jackson. Angela now lives in the Seattle area with her husband, stepdaughter, and Yorkshire Terrier. She's an avid supporter of The Friends of the Seattle Public Library and is often found at the semi-annual sales with a suitcase and a ton of books in hand. Her favorite authors include Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Thoreau, and Kate Morton. Her other interests include Opera, theater, history, and genealogy. Angela's dream hobby is to become an antique book collector.", "related": [], "rank": 1002120, "title": "The Thorne Family Saga", "author": "Angela Darling", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has authored seven recipe books on Anglo-Indian cuisine. Her area of expertise is in colonial Anglo-Indian food, and she has gone through a lot of effort in reviving the old forgotten dishes of the colonial British Raj era. Her seven recipe books are a means of preserving for posterity the very authentic tastes and flavors of colonial Anglo India, besides recording for future generations the unique heritage of the pioneers of Anglo-Indian cuisine.  Her recipe book Anglo-Indian Cuisine: A Legacy of Flavours from the Past, which was earlier published in India, was recently selected as Winner from India by Gourmand International Spain, under the category Best Culinary History Book. This prestigious award is the Oscars for cookbook writers. Awards are given every year for various categories and genres (e.g., cookbook authors, cookbooks, chefs, winemakers who compete from all over the world). Bridget is also an independent freelance consultant on food-related matters. She has assisted many restaurants, hotels, and clubs in Bangalore and elsewhere with her knowledge of colonial Anglo-Indian food besides helping them to revamp and reinvent their menus by introducing new dishes that are a combination of both continental and Anglo-Indian. Many of them are now following the recipes and guidance given by her, and the dishes are enjoyed by both Indian and foreign guests. Bridget also conducts cooking demonstrations and workshops at various places across the country, such as clubs, restaurants, women’s groups, corporate offices, etc. She is always ready to share and talk about recipes and food.

This edition contains a new preface, but what isn’t new—nor should it be—is the at-once magisterial and intimate biographical account and assessment with which Lewis first graced the world. The book was widely applauded upon its publication and has enjoyed the sustained respect of historians and readers ever since. Public librarians need to face the fact that their shelves devoted to modern American history can’t be considered complete without it.

I loved seeing how Claire Robertson wrote her articles as if she were two different people. By day, she was this straight-laced, conservative writer and by night, she was a full-fledged erotic writer. When she accidentally sent the wrong file to her publisher, I could feel the craziness she was feeling when she realized what she had done. I thought it was funny how her publisher loved it so much they decided to run with it and have it printed. I loved Ms. Taylor's voice throughout as she told Claire's story. I also loved how I found myself hoping that Dustin Murray would be able to tell Claire exactly what happened to him a few years ago with her sister.

King) was moved in high school entirely against his will from the small town of Corinth to a large city he ended up loving in southern California. After, a series of mostly unexplainable decisions led him through a strange sequence of events beginning at the United States Military Academy, where he double-majored in physics and electrical engineering, through a fairly short career as an Infantry officer and then an electronics technician, a product engineer, a carpenter's helper, and an elementary school janitor, to ultimately finding himself on the faculty of a small college in Anchorage, Alaska. During those years, he learned that reading science fiction and fantasy allowed him to escape the strangeness into the more understandable worlds crafted by Isaac Asimov, Piers Anthony, Marion Zimmer Bradley, and many other great writers. As time went on he began to mold his own worlds. Stephen now lives in Midlothian, Virginia, with his wife, daughter, and two white Chihuahuas that enjoy morphing from Therapuppies into miniature dragons at the sound of food being opened. Stephen is currently working on the next book in the Goddess series when he's not serving the students of a small college in Richmond, Virginia, as their Dean.", "related": [], "rank": 1489483, "title": "Deception: Return of the Gods", "author": "Stephen H.

Later he was shown there the picture «The One and Only» which he described in his second book before the picture was revealed to the world.Vladimir started an independent life early and left the parents' house at the age of 16. Since 1974 he lived in Novosibirsk and worked as a photographer with Novosibirskoblfoto, a service company.At the beginning of Perestroika (reforms of the late 1980s) he was the president of the Inter-Regional Association of Siberian Entrepreneurs. In 1994-5 he organized two large-scale trade expeditions with a fleet of river steamers along the River Ob along the route Novosibirsk -- Salekhard -- Novosibirsk at his own expense. On this trip, an encounter with Anastasia in the Siberian taiga changed his entire life.It had been a secret for a long time for relatives and friends what made him, an entrepreneur with ten years experience, to pledge his property and spend his savings on unprofitable trading trips. The mystery was revealed in his books with Anastasia as the main character. Vladimir Megre brought something really invaluable from the trips.Throughout 1996-2006 nine books were written by Vladimir Megre (The Ringing Cedars of Russia Series: Anastasia, The Ringing Cedars of Russia, The Space of Love, Co-Creation, Who Are We?, Book of Kin, The Energy of Life, The New Civilization, Rites of Love).In 2011 the author became Laureate of Gusi Peace Prize.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Instead of the calm waters in front of the fortress, the rear side offers a view of a different sea--the sea of small, dark streets and  alleys--like an intricate puzzle. The breathtaking scenery visible from the other side had been replaced by the panorama of poverty-stricken streets, crumbling house walls, and dilapidated facades that struggle to  hide the building materials beneath them. It reminds me of the ghettos in Barcelona, the ghettos I came to know far too well. I take a deep breath and look for a sign of life--a life not affected by its surroundings. Nothing. Down, between the rows of dirty dwellings stretches a clothesline. Heavy with the freshly washed laundry it droops  down, droplets of water trickling onto the soiled pavement from its burden. Around the corner, a group of filthy children plays with a semi-deflated soccer ball--it makes a funny sound as it bounces off the wall--plunk, plunk. A man sitting on a staircase puts out a cigarette; he  coughs, spits phlegm on the sidewalk, and lights a new one. A mucky dog  wanders to a house, lifts his leg, and pisses on it. His urine flows down the wall and onto the street, forming a puddle on the pavement. The  children run about, stepping in the piss, unconcerned. An old woman watches from the window, her large breasts hanging over the windowsill for the world to see. Une vie ordinaire, a mundane life...life in its purest. These streets bring me back to all the places I had escaped when  I sneaked onto the ferry. The same feeling of conformity within despair, conformity with their destiny, prearranged long before these people were born. Nothing ever changes, nothing ever disturbs the gloomy  corners of the underworld. Tucked away from the bright lights, tucked away from the shiny pavers on the promenade, hidden from the eyes of the  tourists, the misery thrives. I cannot help but think of myself--only a few weeks ago my life was not much different from the view in front of my eyes. Yet, there is a certain peace soaring from these streets, a peace embedded in each cobblestone, in each rotten wall. The peace of men, unconcerned with the rest of the world, disturbed neither by global  issues, nor by the stock market prices. A peace so ancient that it can only be found in the few corners of the world that remain unchanged for centuries. This is one of the places. I miss the intricacy of the street, I miss the feeling of excitement and danger melted together into  one exceptional, nonconforming emotion. There is the real--the street; and then there is all the other--the removed. I am now on the other side of reality, unable to reach out with my hand and touch the pure life. I miss the street.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.6667, "rating_total": 28.0}

Just as he’s watering the lawn, imagining himself lord of a very small manor in suburban Berlin, class reject Tschick shows up in a “borrowed” old Soviet-era car, and the boys hatch a plan to hit the road. Mike’s rich interior life—he meditates on beauty and the meaning of life and spins self-mocking fantasies of himself as a great essayist—hasn’t translated well to the flirtatious physical swagger required by 8th grade. Tschick, meanwhile, is a badly dressed Russian immigrant who often shows up to school reeking of alcohol and who is also given to profound leaps of psychological insight.

Some directly  plunder the canon for their plots, re-imagining famous cases as Holmes and  Watson didn't experience them. Others discover slight allusions to create  adventures \"that might have been.\" Some go for humor, others aim at dash. Most  ape the original transmitter of the stories, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in tone and  temper, style and setting, as well as they can. All the good ones honor the  sublime originals. If they didn't, I certainly would not write about them.M.J. Trow is an Englishman who has won a growing following for his novels that  make sideways use, as it were, of the Sherlock Holmes roster of immortal  characters. Taking the unusual name \"Sholto\" (from a character in the second  Holmes adventure,The Sign of Four), Trow combines it with the figure of  the bumbling Scotland Yard inspector, Lestrade, Sherlock Holmes's frequent bête  noire, to give modern readers a cockeyed re-envisioning of the early 20th-century mystery of manors. And manners, too.Think Monty Python, with all the wickedly witty erudition that implies, and then try to imagine that troupe in charge of a season ofMystery!Trow makes his Lestrade uxorious (he has a devoted wife, Fanny) and a doting father, to boot. InLestrade and the Magpie, the now retired Superintendent Lestrade finds himself faced with a case in which his daughter's missing-in-action fiancé (WWI is over and the year is 1920) has turned up murdered in a London  hotel room. But where had he been during those intervening three years, since  the war office sent its official telegram?Bernard Shaw, the Irish nationalist hero Michael Collins, Lawrence of Arabia, the sexologist Havelock Ellis, the Russian pretender Anastasia, and the very late Marie Antoinette all have some part in the action. For Sholto Lestrade, who narrowly missed sailing on the Titanic and who is surely bound to wind up in Queen Mary's bedroom after taking a wrong turn in Buckingham Palace, history is what serves as the backdrop to his life. Near-ceaseless wordplay, continual lashings of highbrow whimsy, and a steady stream of literary in-jokes keep Trow's readers on their toes. If the plots are twisty (and they are), even more delightfully convoluted is the author's mind. Let's just be glad there are no quizzes afterwards.--Otto Penzler", "related": [], "rank": 996722, "title": "Lestrade and the Magpie", "author": "M J Trow", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is hard to understand the culture people are not used to. Anyway, back in early 1900s, in Odawara, Kanagawa Prefecture, there were famous toy makers which made mass production of wooden toys for exports to the United States. During those days, even though it was called mass production, the amount of products to be made through mass production was limited as the products were all hand-made. However, there were craftsmen with decent skills who worked in division to make simple wooden products like wooden cars or carriages. They were quite popular in the United States and there are historical records of the Japanese toy industry from early 1900s. On the other hand, there were craftsmen who had his workshop and made products on his own. Mr. Masaaki Hiroi's father was one of them. He was known as the first-class craftsman as Mr. Masaaki Hiroi is. However, as Mr. Masaaki Hiroi admits, his father was making products which was made from his period, Meiji Period. In Mr. Masaaki Hiroi's yong days, he wanted to make something completely new out of tradition. He started to dream of making the products out of his curiosity in addition to preserving intricate tops which cannot be made by other craftsman in Japan. Mr. Masaaki Hiroi has known a lot of toy makers which flourished until certain period of time. It was not because of the westernization. Anyway, the wooden toys made in Odawara were very popular in the United States in early 1900s. As a writer, I considered that it is important to introduce a part of Japanese living \"culture\" which has been inherited for thousands of years. And, the interesting part is that the tops have been played from ancient times. From those days, the materials were different and the tops were very simple as the skills are very limited. Also, the tools were different. As technology evolves, the \"art\" evolves. This is some part which people are missing. They have been evolving each other throughout generations. And, that is called \"tradition\" and at the same time \"culture.\" So, something classic does not necessarily mean \"just old.\" Mr. Masaaki Hiroi's life was not easy at all. It was after trials and trials that he made works which attract industrialists like executives of car makers. At the same time, he has made contributions to introduce the \"craftsmanship\" in foreign countries as the very first craftsman in Japan. The stories of his experience abroad is written in the book but his endeavor led to the first honorary citizen of Seattle back in 1983. And, 1983 was the very first year in history when the Japanese craftsmen landed on the land of United States in history. As a person and craftsman, it might be a good chance for you to think what your life is like, what culture is for you, and what life is for you.", "related": ["B00H4AV7O2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Klein is best known for her advocacy of play as a means of reaching a child's unconscious, and for her concepts of projective identification and patient-analyst countertransference. Grosskurth relates Klein's personal conflicts and traumas as a child and mother to the development of her ideas and methods as an analyst. She traces the history of psychoanalysis from Freud to the 1960s as it paralleled Klein's career, and reveals the often vicious and petty debates among British, American and German psychoanalytic societies, focusing on Klein's early support from and, according to the author, eventual betrayal by Ernest Jones; her fierce rivalry with child psychoanalyst Anna Freud; and her tyrannical rule in later years over the British psychoanalytic camp, dubbed \"Kleinian.\" A rudimentary knowledge of Freudian concepts is helpful but not necessary for reading this thorough study. Grosskurth has also written biographies of John Addington Symonds and Havelock Ellis. Photos not seen by PW.

His critically-acclaimed book, The Battle of Marianna, Florida, was named best in its category by Civil War Books & Authors. The Battle of Natural Bridge, Florida, Cox’s history of the 1865 Confederate defense of Tallahassee, was hailed by reviewers as the “excellent.” The Scott Massacre of 1817: A Seminole War Battle in Gadsden County, Florida overlaps in many ways the story of Milly Francis. Published to support the preservation and interpretation efforts of the West Gadsden Historical Society, the book is among the author’s personal favorites and provides the first in depth history of the beginning days of Florida’s Seminole Wars. Another of Cox’s books, The Claude Neal Lynching: The 1934 Murders of Claude Neal and Lola Cannady, has drawn widespread attention and acclaim. The most detailed account of the infamous 1934 incident to date, the book is used as a key reference by classes at major universities. His other books include Two Egg, Florida; A Christmas in Two Egg, Florida; The Battle of Massard Prairie: The 1864 Confederate Attacks on Fort Smith, Arkansas, and Old Parramore: The History of a Florida Ghost Town. He also has written multiple volumes on the histories of Jackson and Gadsden Counties in Florida. A Christmas in Two Egg, Florida has been adapted for the stage and is performed annually during the holiday season.  A descendent of the Yuchi leaders Efa Hadjo and Efa Emathla, he has lived his life deeply immersed in the rich heritage of the Creek Indians.  Cox was the 2012 Citizen of the Year for Jackson County, Florida, and has been inducted into the Bonnie Blue Society of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, an organization for authors of note. He has been awarded the Jefferson Davis Medal by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and has been honored for his historic preservation efforts by numerous other organizations, including the Children of the American Revolution, the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Order of the Confederate Rose. A Christian, Dale Cox is the father of two grown sons, William and Alan. He resides near the unique little community of Two Egg, Florida, with his constant canine companion, Goober D.

Jaaskelainen builds multilayered worlds, and a plot like a ball of yarn which manages to surprise the reader time and again. Kiiltomato Magnificently multifaceted Keskisuomalainen The Rabbit Back Literature Society starts like a detective story... but ends up being a book about the love of writing and the mystery of reality Helsingin Sanomat Jaaskelainen's strong voice and rich, individual writing style make the book a special treat Savon Sanomat Pasi Ilmari Jaaskelainen's The Rabbit Back Literature Society does what Donna Tartt's Secret History did in the early '90s Ilta Sanomat This book contains many ingredients: fantasy, mythology, literary philosophy, time and memory... It's a novel with horror, howling dogs, and creeping shadows... But it also considers what writing really is, what the relationship between a \"story\" and a reality that doesn't conform to narrative means Suomen Kuvalehti A fantastically fine fantasy book. Such a fireworks display of ideas, that many lesser writers would have milked it for several books.

He is internally driven to share as much knowledge as he can in hopes it will motivate and inspire you to take action. Action is what creates our results and improves our quality of life. Along with his weight loss coaching he researches and authors books in the self-help niche. There is a direct connection between how we feel and what we weigh. In essence our outside world is a direct reflection of our inside world. Losing weight is as much a physical act as a psychological act and Darrin understands that. Your success in anything you do in life also relies on your ability to set clear powerful goals. His goal is to change as many people's lives as possible through his weight loss knowledge and self-help books. You can have the life of your dreams if you can develop the right mindset.

Subsequently, he spent the majority of his childhood and teenage years traveling around Asia, with most of his time spent living in China. Such an uprooted upbringing has left a long and lasting effect on him, to the extent that the exact ramifications are as of yet still unknown.  To the exasperated chagrin of his parents, from a very early age he found himself helplessly in love with movies, with an immediate, strong, and near-obsessive leaning towards films of the more violent and horrific nature. Such a love is only matched by his desire to create his own stories within a similar vein, and this novel is his very first full-fledged attempt at doing so. As other aficionados of similar genres may notice, his first novel is also shamelessly full of both subtle and not-so-subtle references to its cinematic roots. It wears its influences on its sleeve, and he can only hope that it will be able to become a work in its own right. Currently, he is failing depressingly in his classes at Emory University in Georgia, where he is studying as an undergraduate. Eugene has been writing since he was nine, and is not planning to stop anytime this side of life. He is devastatingly handsome and has a car. It is blue. It is not a Galaxie. He claims the right not to be held accountable by anything he has written in these last few paragraphs.

However, they mean nothing if you only read them and do not actively apply them. Your life will not change unless you employ these new and improved thoughts daily. Learning how to live a better live is about application and not statements of truth. No matter how often you repeat the affirmations, they will not manifest unless you act on them.Credibility and Understanding comes from experience and from proving to ourselves, that the Laws work and how they work. It takes commitment to find the Truth. \"Seek and ye shall find\"- \"knock and the door shall open\"...yes, it takes a strong craving to understand Life's work, and it takes love of learning, teaching and curiosity.We are all students and teachers. We learn from each other. We see in the other what we admire or what we despise, depending on what we have yet to learn. It is imperative to know this truth and to use this valuable tool in self-improvement.Remember:\"Let\nyour star shine bright! Shed off all limitations, doubt and fear.

From the artwork of creating my first comic book, to writing stories. My family couldn't afford video games or the latest toy. So I found enjoyment in writing. Before Amazon publishing books could become very costly. Today I have published a few, Red in your Head and Zombie Slayer: Surviving the Outbreak. I have a wife and two boys, and work in nursing. When I need a break, to go into my own world in my mind. I'm also a movie buff, and sometimes movies don't excite or grab the emotion of what can be placed in words. So I write and write, not looking to get rich but if you have enjoyed my work, then it was time well spent. My imagination has been placed into words for all to enjoy! There are many more titles and episodes coming. So sit back and relax, read the images of people, places emotions and action.

The best way to find out more about me is to read my books. I write from the heart and I express both my shortcomings and my triumphs. I like to think of my writing as 'Reality Fiction'. I tell it like I see it. Life is short and the troubles many, but with faith in Jesus Christ all things have become possible to me. I may write 'make believe', but I strive to live out what I write. I enjoy my work and I hope you do too. Have a blessed time reading my imaginative thoughts.", "related": ["B00AMLJZXK"], "rank": 918595, "title": "A Warrior's Revenge (The Warrior Kind Book 5)", "author": "Guy Stanton III", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.6667, "rating_total": 28.0}

While a member of the Seventh Cavalry (1963-1966) I was given a collateral duty that ignited a passion that has burned in me for over fifty years. I was historical officer for the Seventh Cavalry and therefore custodian of all regimental memorabilia, including Custer's hat, gauntlets, and saber, as well as several of his morning reports and officers' field diaries. As my interest in the subject grew, I studied history books, memoirs, and archives. I even exchanged letters with a fascinating ninety-six-year-old gentleman who, as a boy, had known Custer and could remember vividly the day Custer left Fort Lincoln on his last scout be¬cause his own father had ridden into eternity with him. I was on active duty in the twentieth century cavalry, but my soul was answering muster roll call with troopers who had served a century before. For me, the post- Civil War, nineteenth century army was no longer a silent trumpet gathering dust in some long-abandoned western post. It was a bugle's call, as immediate as the one I heard playing reveille every morning. Over the past three decades it has become politically correct for historians writing of the nineteenth century to beatify the Indian and demonize the soldier. The common soldier is depicted as an illiterate ne'er-do-well, fleeing from the law or a failed life back East. The cavalry officer is held up to be an alcoholic misfit or a pompous martinet seeking glory. While some soldiers and officers might have fallen into such categories, the majority of the army was just as it is today: professionals following a calling. They were neither saints nor sinners, but servants of their government. Though they never fielded forces of more than 15,000 men, the army surveyed railroad lines, guarded construction crews, defended trails west, provided protection for settlers, miners, ranchers, and farmers, and engaged the Indians in over 250 battles, not counting small skirmishes of platoon size or less. They were nearly always outnumbered, and often the Indians were better armed, due to the greed of white traders. The Indians were better horsemen, fought as a way of life, knew their home territory, and could move as silently as the dust. But in the end, the West was opened and peace was won by the United States Army. Yesterday's Reveille is the story of that army. The literal historian will find some factual anomalies in my account. For story continuity I have made a few changes in dates, locales, and events. I have taken some liberties with the Battle of the Washita, and my depiction of Fort Hays is more generic than authentic. Also, those who have speculated about Custer's interest in the presidential nominating conventions that year speculated about the Democratic Convention in St. Louis. But because the earlier date of the Republican Convention fit my story, I used it.", "related": ["B00J1IN4B4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 13, "rating_average": 4.7692, "rating_total": 62.0}

Awesome, but I still haven't told her my secret. I\nselfishly took all the credit :)  Highly recommendedPaulBI don't have sleep apnea, but one of my good friends has it, and he\nrefuses to get any kind of professional treatment for it despite the\nfact his repeated bouts of apnea could be causing him brain damage. In\nfact, sometimes I wonder if it's too late, because he tends to forget\nvery basic things like: the locations of his car keys, and paying me my\ninvoices that I send him (actually, his memory problems are probably not\n related to brain damage). That being said, I am forwarding him this\nbooklet. There's nothing very innovative here, but it's just the \"facts\"\n about the condition and some techniques to alleviate it which are\nuseful to those of us looking for some solutions.

He has a songwriter's gift for the deft phrase, while his powers of observation and recall are quite extraordinary ...

It's all there in the tiny details Watt captures perfectly: empty fridges, crumpled clothes, the blood pooling on a bathroom floor. He's also good at the lighter moments ... When we find out how Romany and Tom got together ... and how Ben Watt came to be, the effect is like a blow to the heart.

This is the book we all wish Anna Freud had had the courage to write.\"                   —Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, author The Assault on Truth: Freud’s Suppression of the Seduction Theory and former Projects Director of The Freud Archives“Rebecca Coffey’s imagination knows no bounds. She makes you believe this is exactly the way it all happened. HYSTERICAL is sad, funny, painful, strange, outrageous, and disturbing. If we can’t have Anna’s diaries, this is the next best thing.” —Ellen Bass, author of The Courage to Heal\"…[A]bsolutely fascinating and interesting. Reading it brought up a lot of tears because of the memories it evoked about the people and the time. I was so happy to have Freud's relationship with his daughter revealed.\"             —Sophie Templer, 95-year-old daughter of controversial Freudian psychoanalyst Otto Gross“Though fiction, HYSTERICAL is structured as an autobiography, with Anna’s voice assuming the narration. It’s an interesting trick, and one Coffey pulls off quite well—she captures Anna’s formality, smart but plain spoken, straightforward to the point of creating emotional distance, and occasionally so hyper-aware and unaware in the same moment that it grates. . . . Like a therapy session, HYSTERICAL tunnels very deeply into Anna’s childhood experiences—thoughts, events, dreams, fantasies—and like a therapy session, the facets of what are revealed are at times disturbing and uncomfortable. Add to all that the inherent struggle between Sigmund and Anna, which twists and deepens as they both age, especially as Anna comes into her sexuality, and you’ve got a plot so rife with tension it’ll make you squirm. . . . HYSTERICAL also contains some incredibly riveting passages about various analysands of Freud’s—people whose deviant natures stuck with Anna, probably because she sympathized in some way with them—and some funny parts, jokes and other bits that provoke a laugh even while you feel slightly (or profoundly) disturbed. And while there is a strong emphasis on Anna’s childhood and coming of age, Coffey leads the reader through Anna’s young adulthood, her decision to become a teacher and from there an analyst and advocate for children, her first love, her “coming out,” and her life with Dorothy Burlingham. Those with an interest in Freud, the history of psychology or psychoanalysis, and/or the history of gayness as “illness” will find this book a necessary and enjoyable addition to the literature.  HYSTERICAL approaches its subject with remarkable, even agile, tenderness and understanding—Coffey gives Anna a voice, one that history has thus far not allowed her.\"“Journalist Coffey, seen in Scientific American and Psychology Today, presents an avidly researched, shrewd, and unnerving first novel that purports to be the lost autobiography of Anna Freud. A daughter of Sigmund, the father of psychoanalysis, Anna became an esteemed child psychoanalyst, but her path forward was dark and dangerous. Coffey adroitly mixes fact and fiction, compassion and irreverent humor as she explores their bizarre and perilous relationship. Sigmund broke his own rule against psychoanalyzing family members with Anna, focusing on her masturbatory fantasies in their nearly daily sessions. She, in turn, defied his strenuous condemnation of lesbianism as ‘a gateway to mental illness’ and enjoyed a long, happy relationship with Dorothy Tiffany Burlingham, the daughter of Louis Comfort Tiffany. Coffey offers some truly shocking disclosures about the Freud family in this complexly entertaining, sexually dramatic, acidly funny novel of genius and absurdity, insight and delusion, independence and loyalty. Illustrated with archival photographs and backed by a substantial bibliography, this is an electrifying, imaginative portrait of an overlooked historical figure of great significance: fascinating, courageous, and steadfast Anna Freud.“ —Booklist\"…[A] wonderfully insightful fictional glimpse into the Freud family dynamic and, most notably, its impact on Sigmund’s theories about lesbianism. How did Freud père receive the announcement that the daughter to whom he was closest—his right-hand girl and protégé—loved women? How did he deal with her long domestic partnership with another woman? Coffey’s presentation of what may have happened between Sigmund and Anna is nuanced, intelligent, and wonderfully persuasive.\" —Lillian Faderman, author of Naked in the Promised Land: A Memoir“Mental health journalist Coffey’s (Unspeakable Truths and Happy Endings) effective creation of Anna’s cool, somewhat clinical voice will hold the attention of readers already curious about the Freuds or psychoanalytic theory.” —Library Journal“Moving, irreverent, often very funny, and a remarkable tour de force, HYSTERICAL lets us eavesdrop at the keyhole of the Freud family. And, oh, what we learn!”              —Leonard Foglia, Broadway director of Thurgood, Wait Until Dark, and Master Class\"Coffey has created a stimulating interpretation of the Freud family through Anna’s eyes.”—Kirkus Reviews", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When several authors asked for copies of my notes on the Self Promotion workshop, an agent friend leaned over and suggested I compile my notes for a how-to guide to make available online. As I worked on the project I realized I really wanted to share some outside opinions.
