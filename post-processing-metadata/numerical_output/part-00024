Kim O'Hara, the orphaned son of an Irish soldier stationed in India, is neither innocent nor victimized.  Raised by an opium-addicted half-caste woman since his equally dissolute father's death, the boy has grown up in the streets of Lahore:Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the vernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain sing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the small boys of the bazar; Kim was white--a poor white of the very poorest.From his father and the woman who raised him, Kim has come to believe that a great destiny awaits him. The details, however, are a bit fuzzy, consisting as they do of the woman's addled prophecies of \"'a great Red Bull on a green field, and the Colonel riding on his tall horse, yes, and'--dropping into English--'nine hundred devils.'\"In the meantime, Kim amuses himself with intrigues, executing \"commissions by night on the crowded housetops for sleek and shiny young men of fashion.\" His peculiar heritage as a white child gone native, combined with his \"love of the game for its own sake,\" makes him uniquely suited for a bigger game. And when, at last, the long-awaited colonel comes along, Kim is recruited as a spy in Britain's struggle to maintain its colonial grip on India. Kipling was, first and foremost, a man of his time; born and raised in India in the 19th century, he was a fervid supporter of the Raj. Nevertheless, his portrait of India and its people is remarkably sympathetic. Yes, there is the stereotypical Westernized Indian Babu Huree Chander with his atrocious English, but there is also Kim's friend and mentor, the Afghani horse trader Mahub Ali, and the gentle Tibetan lama with whom Kim travels along the Grand Trunk Road. The humanity of his characters consistently belies Kipling's private prejudices, and raisesKimabove the mere ripping good yarn to the level of a timeless classic.--Alix Wilber", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fearing for their own safety, Rose's family moves back to England. Fifteen years later, Rose is shopping at the market when a strange man thrusts a letter into her basket and, before fleeing, cautions her to guard it with her life. Seeing the seal of Hugo's family on the letter, Rose surmises that it must concern the business of Hugo's cousin, and the veiled message inside indicates a lovers' rendezvous. Soon, however, Rose suspects she's being followed, and with a little investigation finds that her pursuer is Raj Khanna, a handsome Indian businessman, who's after the letter for reasons far graver than romance; amid rising suspense, Rose uncovers a plot to assassinate Queen Victoria and the truth about what happened to her beloved Hugo. Fast-paced, rooted in solid period details and supported by a fine cast of secondary characters—especially the scrappy street urchins who come to Rose's aid—Brandewyne's latest is another winning romp.(Dec.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It makes important points about how governments' counternarcotics efforts can actually help the insurgents.--Peter Bergen, author ofHoly War, Inc.andThe Osama bin Laden I knowVanda Felbab-Brown's intelligent survey of the steamy relationship between drugs and insurgency is a must-read. In debunking the theory that crop eradication undercuts the influence of narcoguerrillas, Shooting Up points American policymakers and generals toward a more effective strategy in Afghanistan and elsewhere.--Wendy Chamberlin, president of the Middle East Institute and former U.S. ambassador to PakistanShooting Upis an important and timely book that challenges the conventional wisdom about counternarcotics and counterinsurgency. Rather than complementing one another, Felbab-Brown persuasively demonstrates, these two policies are in fact at odds.--Bruce Hoffman, professor of security studies at Georgetown University and former adviser on counterterrorism to the Coalition Provisional Authority in IraqThe connection between drug trafficking and terrorism has emerged as one of the central problems of our time.Shooting Upoffers the best set of case studies on the complex relationship between the two phenomena and presents unorthodox and insightful conclusions about how the U.S. government should deal with them.--Peter Reuter, professor of public policy and criminology at the University of MarylandFelbab-Brown deftly describes how our current antidrug policies are frequently at odds with our counterinsurgency efforts. Her chilling conclusion—that the U.S. strategy for fighting drugs internationally is actually emboldening the enemies of freedom—offers one of the most compelling arguments yet for rethinking the current war on drugs. --John Carnevale, former chief of the Office of Planning, Budget, and Evaluation, Office of National Drug Control Policy", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book will be more useful to those in a teaching rather than a clinical context for several reasons. . . . Returning to the humorous portrayal of fundamentalist Christians sequestered in the soundproof room in heaven, I can imagine teachers and clinicians wanting to follow St. Peter's injunction and tiptoe past this room, leaving such believers to make sense of the world and deal with their anxieties in their own ways.

His third generation Scottish mother and engineer father wouldn't talk about feelings if their lives depended on it. Church was for appearances. Being a first child he carefully emulated his parents: the aversion to expressing feelings stuck, but the superficial view of spirit did not. Two books were very influential to his adolescent spiritual development. One was Shaw on Religion and the other was Letters from Earth by Mark Twain. Shaw on Religion is a collection of George Bernard Shaw's writings on religion and sprit. Letters from Earth is letters purportedly written by Satan during a visit to earth reporting back to his fellow archangels about the state of creation. Both authors were eloquent in their descriptions of the inconsistencies and abuses of organized religions, but both were also deeply spiritual. They described an appealing way of relating to things beyond the material. So Doug spent his adult years being an engineer like his father (BS and MS in Chemical Engineering), avoiding church whenever possible and reading science fiction and fringe science looking for some evidence of things beyond the material world. After the death of his mother (not properly grieved) and a stressful time at headquarters of a large computer and software company he took up yoga, energy healing and music healing. He started teaching a class on how energy healing worked. That led to the world beyond the material world and ultimately to this book, which is about people being gods and the importance of feelings. Sometimes the things you run away from are the very things you should be looking at. He lives with his wife, Pat, of 39 years who lived across the street from him when they were four years old. He and Pat have two grown daughters.", "related": ["B005EICSVM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Even as many of the writers mention reading the canonical Du Bois, Hughes, Morrison, Ellison, and Baldwin, others are drawn to Madame Bovary and Madeline, Catch-22 and Carlyle. Essayists testify to the inspiration of particular teachers, the encouragement of other writers (two mention Gwendolyn Brooks specifically), and most frequently parental enabling and support. Golden's introduction is moving and often lyrical; her headnotes are succinct and helpful; her interviewer voice is muted, direct, and consistently directed toward letting the writer speak. \"I tremble with anticipation each time I open a book,\" writes Golden. \"I smile with satisfaction when I read the last page.\" Her readers will do the same.

According to Nic Marks, author ofThe Happiness Manifesto, you should be. Marks argues that it is misguided and unproductive to measure a nation’s success based on economic factors such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Marks lays it all out for us in 12 steps, five that focus on attaining personal well-being, and seven that will help accomplish the same on a national level. He warns that we lack a positive vision: we might turn away from the hoo-ha on the street corner foretelling the end of days, but we all look to the future with the same overwhelming sense of dread.

His short stories appear in over 580 independent press publications in the U.S., Canada, the UK, and Australia with over thirty due for publication in 2011. His book of short stories, \"You Had Me At ARRGH!! : Five Uneasy Pieces by Ken Goldman\" remained an all-time top ten best seller from October 2007-March 2011 at the former Genre Mall and can be purchased at the Sam's Dot Publishers web site. Australia's Precision Pictures has contracted Ken's short story \"The Keeper\" to be filmed (hopefully) during 2011-2012. In June 2010 Damnation books (http://www.damnationbooks.com) published his novella \"Desiree\" in downloadable eBook; print and Kindle editions are available on Amazon.com. Ken has received seven honorable mentions in The Year's Best Fantasy & Horror Anthologies, and he has won numerous awards, too many to mention here---but he will happily supply a list. Further information on Ken Goldman and his writing can be found at the Masters of Horror website (http://moh.spruz.com/member).

Naomi, a former police officer whose law-enforcement career ended when she was blinded in an accident, is accompanied by her guide dog, Napoleon. In a local pub, they meet historian Eddy Thame, who is obsessed with the Monmouth Rebellion and with locating the legendary Kirkwood treasure. When Eddy dies after falling down some stairs in his home, Alec and Naomi are drawn into the case. Did Eddy fall, or was he pushed? Was he killed by a fellow treasure hunter, or did someone else want him dead? Alec and Naomi assist the local police, who accept their help grudgingly. Then Alec must strike out on his own, against orders, when Naomi’s life is in danger. On the surface, a straightforward small-town British procedural, the book gains texture from its multiple plotlines, the intriguing details of the Monmouth Rebellion, and Alec’s inner turmoil over whether he wants to remain a policeman. --Sue O'Brien", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": 2381022, "title": "Blood Ties (A Naomi Blake Mystery Book 6)", "author": "Jane A.

In other words: paradise. The supernatural and paranormal have always fascinated India. In addition to being an avid sci-fi and fantasy reader, she also enjoys mysteries, thrillers, and romance. This probably explains why her novels have elements of adventure, ghosts (or elves, fairies, angels, aliens, and whatever else she can dream up), and spicy love stories.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 24, "rating_average": 4.125, "rating_total": 99.0}

It's written by travel writers who live on Tenerife.We have spent years putting hoofing it around towns and villages, ravines and mountains, fiestas and music festivals...and occasionally atmospheric tascas researching information for magazines and online publications. We have amassed a wealth of knowledge and experience about Tenerife, its culture & history, towns & countryside and its people. Subsequently, we're recognised Tenerife 'experts' for two online travel websites as well as having our own websites and blogs devoted to sharing the 'Real Tenerife'.Real Tenerife Island Drives was written because many people travelling around Tenerife overlook the old roads linking some of the most traditional towns in favour of using the island's motorways and newer road networks. In doing so they are missing out on experiencing some of the most attractive parts of Tenerife. These old roads have less traffic and are a joy to drive on as they meander through some of the best scenery as well as the island's most historic and picturesque towns.In truth we wrote Island Drives for people like ourselves. People who like to explore the destinations they are staying in; who like to visit the most interesting places, learn something about them and revel in spectacular scenery; people who enjoy sampling authentic local cuisine in locations that range from the memorable to the quaint. We also love curiosities, so we've included snippets and anecdotes that fascinated us - such as pointing out the drum in the door of a hospital where unwanted babies were abandoned or the spot where desolate and battered Spanish conquistadors re-grouped after being heavily beaten in battle by Tenerife's original inhabitants, the primitive Guanche.Ultimately, Real Tenerife Island Drives was written in order to share the routes that we enjoy driving most on Tenerife with visitors who want to experience the best of Tenerife.", "related": ["B00795BTYU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The issue of pacificism  in World War 1 really resonated.\nThe other thing I particularly liked about  the book was the way it looked and felt.  There is nothing quite as magic as a book with maps.  There is a wonderful sense of anticipation as you prowl through the book before you engage with the text itself.  The photos, maps and family trees are all  signals of exactly the right kind of book for me, and great care had been taken to get them right.\nWe look forward to the next one!Regards\nDi Moffitt & John Werry.We have both read and thoroughly enjoyed this book. Clearly, the author has done some very thorough research and this shows in the superb atmosphere generated by the descriptions of the New Zealand Land Wars and the treatment of conscientious objectors during World War I. We certainly learned a lot in reading those. The research -- on the flax industry, the floods and fires that plagued Foxton (and other settlements) and the conditions of farming and road development -- was quite staggering. Again, the atmosphere generated by the descriptions was moving and enlightening. The personalities of the people come though vividly and showed how people lose touch but can still feel kinship. We liked the way modern-day episodes were interspersed into the narrative. Most importantly, though, we think the book starts to fill a huge gap in the genre of NZ historical writing- Barb & Brian", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For seven years the author ( Healing the Wounds ) practiced \"poverty medicine\" at Christ House, a Washington, D.C. medical recovery shelter for homeless men sponsored by the Church of the Saviour; he left in 1990 to found an AIDS shelter. Rarely have we been so powerfully forced to confront the plight of those who have been battered by homelessness, lack of education, poor nutrition and addiction; rarely have we been made to see how grossly inhospitable to the spirit is poverty. Holfiker does not allow us to disregard the helplessness of those who are unable to climb out of their own histories, even as he himself becomes frustrated that his patients often do not--sometimes cannot, under the conditions of their street lives--cooperate in their medical care. Along with case histories of his patients and accounts of his bouts with public welfare organizations, Hilfiker presents his well-reasoned criticisms of a society in which justice is procedural rather than distributive: \"Wealth, opportunity and a good education are not equally available to all.\" Earning $34,000 a year at Christ House, and given a comfortable rent-free apartment at the shelter for himself, his wife and their three children, Hilfiker questions whether his privileged life compromises his integrity. He provides the answer with this journal of what happened when he lived and worked among those whose poverty results--as he makes us aware--from the very societal structures that gave him affluence.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The culmination of those years was the short-film \"The Image\", which she wrote and produced single-handedly. And in so doing, she became fascinated with the dynamics of collaboration on a project. Since then, Jo hasn’t looked back.  Her body of work includes scripts for Children’s live-action and animated television programs, a direct to video Children’s DVD, television commercials and corporate videos. She's been a feature writer on ReZoom.com and a contributing writer for the Arizona Sports Fans Network; where she was called their most popular writer, known for her humorous articles, player interviews and game coverage. Jo was unofficially the first to interview Emmitt Smith when he arrived in Arizona to play for the Cardinals. She has adjunct taught at the Film School at Scottsdale Community College, has teamed with a Producer on a low budget thriller, and a Director on a New Dramady.” She went in front of the camera for a video, “Stepping Above Criticism”, capturing a popular talk with her students.  Her new book, FEEDBACK  HOW TO GIVE IT  HOW TO GET IT, shares her lessons learned with writers, and indeed everyone dealing with life's criticism.

Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in 1804 in the city of Salem, Massachusetts to Nathaniel Hathorne and the former Elizabeth Clarke Manning. His ancestors include John Hathorne, the only judge involved in the Salem witch trials who never repented of his actions. Nathaniel later added a \"w\" to make his name \"Hawthorne\" in order to hide this relation. He entered Bowdoin College in 1821, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1824, and graduated in 1825. Hawthorne anonymously published his first work, a novel titled Fanshawe, in 1828. He published several short stories in various periodicals which he collected in 1837 as Twice-Told Tales. The next year, he became engaged to Sophia Peabody. He worked at a Custom Houseand joined Brook Farm, a transcendentalist community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem, the Berkshires, then to The Wayside in Concord. The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to The Wayside in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, and was survived by his wife and their three children. -wikipedia", "related": ["B004ELAHMM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Art and family, intellectualism and morality, religion and philosophy-Gulick discusses them all in this intriguing work, one that reveals as much about the Western mind at the turn of the 20th century as it does about the Eastern.", "related": ["B003YL4HHY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That's the message drummed into readers in this decidedly less-than-subtle picture book. Bailey, a frisky dalmatian, and Margot, his owner, are due to celebrate a birthday. Meanwhile, Bailey attends Margot's friend's birthday party and concludes that if he's good enough, he, too, will get an enormous pile of loot. But Margot's parents are going through tough times financially, and the presents, when the big day finally arrives, are humble, the main focus being a fun family outing for all. The tale suffers from an excess of earnestness, and children are unlikely to enjoy being preached to by a dalmatian. However, readers can't help but sympathize with the dog's dashed hopes. Chase's ever-sunny watercolors of the Manhattan setting provide a welcoming backdrop. A videocassette and an activity book are also available, either separately or packaged with the book.

In the space of a single evening, with a marvellous versatility, they threw to the agitators the ascertained results of generations of the medical faculty, the report of a Royal Commission, what are understood to be their own convictions, and the President of the Local Government Board. After one ineffectual fight the House of Lords answered to the whip, and, under the guise of a \"graceful concession,\" the health of the country was given without appeal into the hand of the \"Conscientious Objector.\"In his perplexity it has occurred to an observer of these events—as a person who in other lands has seen and learned something of the ravages of smallpox among the unvaccinated—to try to forecast their natural and, in the view of many, their almost certain end. Hence these pages from the life history of the pitiable, but unfortunate Dr. Therne.[*]Absit omen!May the prophecy be falsified! But, on the other hand, it may not. Some who are very competent to judge say that it will not; that, on the contrary, this strange paralysis of \"the most powerful ministry of the generation\" must result hereafter in much terror, and in the sacrifice of innocent lives.[*] It need hardly be explained that Dr. Therne himself is a character convenient to the dramatic purpose of the story, and in no way intended to be taken as a type of anti- vaccinationist medical men, who are, the author believes, as conscientious in principle as they are select in number.The importance of the issue to those helpless children from whom the State has thus withdrawn its shield, is this writer's excuse for inviting the public to interest itself in a medical tale. As for the moral, each reader can fashion it to his fancy.", "related": ["B0084AY05O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this chilling one-off, the writing duo has had some twisted fun with the childhood of their beloved recurring character FBI agent Aloysius Pendergast. In the New Orleans of the agent's youth, kids didn't put baby teeth under their pillow in exchange for the tooth fairy's coin. Instead, they dropped them into a copper pot on an old man's front porch during a full moon. No one wanted to find out what happened if they didn't give the spooky tooth fairy of the French Quarter \"his due.\" All they knew was that the old man had to be appeased, according to legend. But when Pendergasts's younger brother, Diogenes, tries to pay his due with a baby tooth, Aloysius thinks his brother is being silly, and decides to intervene--to his regret. A story of brotherhood, fear, and a belief in the dark arts,Extractionhas the old-timey feel of a campfire ghost story.

Based on proximity and number of interactions, the hemisphere contains two \"regional subsystems,\" a North American subsytem extending south to Panama and a South American one further south. The US is clearly the hegemon of the north and has intervened directly in the Caribbean and Central America many times. Further south, the US is the \"absent empire\" that does not mind Brazil pursuing its own interests and regional stability. The US and Brazil were always friendly and usually had parallel interests. Teixeira uses three periods to make his case. During the 19th century, the Monroe Doctrine focused narrowly on the Caribbean, not at all on South America. During the Cold War, the US favored the 1964 Brazilian coup and 1973 Chilean coup but did little to promote them. Brazil played a much larger role in Chile in 1973. More recently, the US viewed the 1994 NAFTA as a step to a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), but Brazil preferred the 1995 Mercosur to keep its dominant regional role, and FTAA died. Summing Up: Recommended.(CHOICE)Teixeira, a rising Brazilian scholar, forcefully makes the case that the United States has employed radically different policies in Mexico and the Caribbean basin than in more distant South America. Historically, heavy U.S. interventionism, so visible in nations close to the United States, has not been visited on South America—because, Teixeira demonstrates, Brazil has protected core U.S. interests there. Teixeira may overstate the heft of Brazilian diplomacy and the enthusiasm of other South American states for Brazilian leadership, but his inspired insights demand the revision of much conventional wisdom regarding inter-American relations.(Foreign Affairs)In this important new book, Poggio Teixeira, a Brazillian scholar, argues that there never was a single U.S. policy on Latin America. . .Instead, there are two regional subsystems: North America and South America. . . .Poggio has written a significant book that makes two compelling points that should chart a new path for scholars in inter-American relations. . .the Americas should be viewed as two regional subsystems and that U.S. policy should be directed at each. That point is truer now than ever before.(Political Science Quarterly)This is a very valuable book for students and the informed public with an interest in the Americas. Relying on a rich range of sources, the author effectively combines theory and history to bridge the analytical gap between North and South America. Policymakers, too, will find in this highly readable study valuable insights on the conduct of bilateral relations between the United States and Brazil.(Simon Serfaty, Old Dominion University; director of European Studies, Center for Strategic & International Studies)Teixeira’s book is a most timely addition to the literature on Latin America the Inter-American System. He demonstrates that South America is a clearly separate sub-system and that Brazil’s geo-political interest in the stability of that system has served both Brazilian and US interests while limiting US involvement in South America. Case studies of the evolution of MERCOSUR and now UNASUR as alternatives to US regional policies, especially a hemisphere-wide free trade agreement, and the discussion of Brazil’s response to the instability and overthrow of the Allende Government in Chile provide tantalizing new insights. The book is a must-read to understand Brazil’s increasingly visible role on the world stage.(Margaret Daly Hayes, Georgetown University)", "related": [], "rank": 2236000, "title": "Brazil, the United States, and the South American Subsystem", "author": "Carlos Gustavo Poggio Teixeira", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A resident of Southern California since birth, except for his studies at the University of Miami in Florida, he initially intended to become a marine biologist. The story of how he arrived at a different calling is revealed in one of his stories of amazing sequential events described in Fingers in the Light. These events led to his decision to become a fine artist and commercial graphic designer—a profession that became life-long. During the 1970’s Jon also participated in a 9,500 mile run marathon, called “Liberty Torch” in which he placed a foot in each of the continental United States. He also taught math and coached swimming at a private school in Florida, as well as having traveled the world. But the external biographical facts don’t necessarily reflect a person’s inner life or what is most important. Jon’s real story is about his quest to understand his true path and his place in life in relation to his amazing experiences of divine guidance and his God-given gifts and abilities, one of which is his award winning writing. This quest and all that he has learned through his experiences is now being told for the first time in his non-fiction books and now through his science fiction books. Jon’s love for and advocacy of marine mammals continues, as does his sensitivity to the natural world and its creatures. These avocations are explored in True Tails, which was his first award-winning autobiographical book and centers around his gift of coherent two-way communication with animals and other many-legged creatures. He also works for the preservation of marine mammals—his gently persuasive and rational arguments for ending the killing of whales and other sentient marine creatures are expressed in his popular website blog, The Whale People (www.thewhalepeople.com). And although his first books are of a non-fiction nature, Jon has began his debut as a science fiction writing with the release of his science fiction adventure called “Element 238 – The Search for Truth.” The first five volumes are now available in exclusive Kindle format, while the full six-volume series is now available in paperback. His author website: http://www.jhsoeder.com also has links to his short stories, both fiction and non-fiction. Jon's books are widely available in softcover and e-book format. You can follow Jon on Twitter or Facebook.", "related": ["B00AF62EX0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After that, I didn't write extensively again for over fifteen years (except for a poetry phase). But then something crazy happened. Steve Jobs passed away. I'm not typically shaken by the death of a celebrity, but Steve Job's death really got to me. I started reading some of his quotes, and one said, \"Set a goal, and work at it everyday.\" Now I've heard that philosophy all my life, but something about that instance really got me thinking about what I truly enjoyed doing: writing. Steve Job's final words about working at your dream everyday materialized a writing passion within me.

THE DEADLIES is her ninth published book. She enjoys writing YA paranormals, both dark and light, and supernatural fantasy and romance, but it is her love of horror that started it all.

Her guilty pleasures include reality television, the Food Network channel and shoes. She truly believes she can accomplish anything if she has the right pair of shoes. And she adores totally inappropriate earrings.  Samantha loves writing and publishing her work and is in awe of the technological advances of our lives. With all of the genres there are for a reader, she has learned that writing paranormal and horror lets her share all the weirdness of everyday life in a not-so-everyday way.

I always knew I would find my way back to the KnightSeries, I just never realized it would come out of the blue at a time I wasgoing through a life altering change.I consider myself blessed that so many people have embraced Reina andFulke's story. Voted Best 2010 Romance eBook of the Year by TheGatekeeper's Post, I am thrilled at how well Reina's story resonates withsome readers. When one devoted fan waged a personal war to see the restof the Knight Series published, I was amazed when she succeeded. Otherthan dedicating the book to her, how do you thank someone like that? Ifyou are a writer who thinks like me, you strive to live up to the expectationsof the original story.Since I already had the complete story for volume two in my head, Iknew my personal distractions would not affect me in that way. However,upon starting, A Knight of Battle, I realized something vital was missing. Ihad lost my passion for storytelling.After several false beginnings and a brutal critique from my toughestcritic (mom), I started A Knight of Battle over and recaptured the spark thatbegan my writing career. Regardless of the turmoil I am forced to endure inmy personal life, the one thing that keeps me going is love. Love for life,friends, family and son. Love for telling a story I can proudly say I authored.Thank you for taking this journey with me, I hope you enjoy Albin andLecie's story as much as I enjoyed writing it.Blessed Be,Candace C.

I spend part of my time teaching at a local preschool and writing, while the rest is devoted to my family.  Writing is new to me, but storytelling has been a life long hobby.  I love using words to create images and feelings for others.  I can honestly tell a story about almost anything.  Some of my favorite storytelling memories are of telling bed time stories to my children and nieces and nephew.  They would pick random things, such as the ceiling fan, and I would make up a story about it.  Those moments are treasures to me and I hope they will be remembered by those special children too.  In that way I hope to bring special moments to my readers as well.  Writing offers me an escape from the wonderful chaos that is my life.  Raising two small children takes a lot of energy and I often collapse in my office chair late at night and let my ideas flow.  I often write from an outline, but just as often I simply sit at the computer and type until I run out of ideas.  Then I go back to make sure it all makes sense and works.  Often I find myself captivated by the story as I read because in my mad rush to type it all out I don’t really embrace the story in the way one does when reading.  My husband often laughs at me when I am reading a book of my own while wiping away the stray tear or two.  I feel it is a pretty good sign that it can touch me in that way and I hope my readers can feel the emotion that I try to inject into my stories. I find that I enjoy my self-published status because it gives me the freedom to write what I want, how I want.  I often choose characters who may not fit the norm of what most think of as a hero or heroine.  I like my characters unique and I like their story to flow from me instead of what someone else’s guidelines. I hope you enjoy my stories.  I enjoy hearing from you.  I do read emails and I try my best to reply if necessary.  I would love to hear your ideas and all about the types of books you enjoy most.  Who knows, you may give me a great new book idea?   amandaanderson2@tds.net Visit me on the web too AmandaAndersonBooks.com find me on facebook too!

Royer, a strong writer, tackles good and evil, greed, family and other issues in a well-plotted story that's surprisingly realistic. He has a knack for dialogue, which helps propel the story forward, and he quickly pulls the reader into the fast pace that doesn't abate until the end. A strong debut that's hard to put down.\" -Kirkus\"A tense and original thriller that raises some serious ethical questions whilst also giving top notch entertainment.\" -e-thriller.comJeffrey Royer's \"The Mercy Project\" is a well-planned, suspenseful, political thriller that doesn't cut corners on detail. Amidst today's political woes and economic crisis in our nation, Royer weaves an eerily plausible conspiracy that chills to the core. It is refreshing when a work of  fiction can not only entertain, but leave you with a moral. Jeffrey Royer proves he will be around for quite a while with the quality of this witty, yet no-nonsense debut novel.

He began his career at twelve, working on cattle ranches in Montana, to escape abandonment, beatings with a mean leather whip, and verbal abuse. Paramount in this journey is his wife, his Shiloh, who lovingly showed him the possibilities of other realities. Howard was once told he had the psychological profile of a serial killer, because of what he had experienced in his youth, and had \"beaten the odds\" by not being institutionalized. In 2003, he had a death experience, no heartbeat, no breath. He had experienced heart failure and a stroke due to Tachy Brady syndrome coupled with sleep apnea. It was then he realized he was not his body; that consciousness continues after death. His current joy is found in studying all ancient scriptures, including the Tao Te Ching with the help of the understanding of Alan Watts, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, Sufi mystic Hazrat Inayat Khan, and many others. He and his wife of fifty-five years enjoy a quiet life at their little monastery along Middle Creek, deep in the back hills of East Tennessee. They still love to study the old ways, enjoy their motor home, as well as an occasional visit by their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She now refers to herself as \"I, Amber Brown\" because she feels as though she's losing her identity because of all the recent changes in her life. Her mother and soon-to-be-stepfather, Max, are celebrating Hanukkah along with Christmas this year and anticipating their new life together. Her father has moved back to town from Paris and is getting an apartment nearby with a room for Amber. Seeking control over her life and her body, she tricks him into taking her to get her ears pierced. After the deed is done (Dad didn't know that Mom had forbidden it), her parents must work out a plan for dealing with other everyday issues that are bound to come up with joint custody. In the end, they are able to let Amber know that she is her own person, and that they both love her and are willing to try to do a better job together. The enormously popular heroine once again brings insightful verbalization to what life is like for kids today. Ross's black-and-white drawings are scattered throughout the short chapters. Readers who haven't read the earlier stories will enjoy this one, and then look for Amber's other escapades.Sharon R.

The opening pages of Stephen Stark's The Final Appearance of America's Favorite Girl Next Door have all the makings of a Hollywood page turner, but the novel's style places the author in a far more literary league....The Final Appearance of America's Favorite Girl Next Door touches on a wide range of topics -- show business, fame, predestination, love, reality, lucid dreaming, and standup comedy, to name just a few. To tackle these subjects, Stark offers the reader Ellen Gregory, a thirty-something standup comic turned TV superstar whose recent run-in with a murderous stalker leaves her questioning everything about the world she's grown used to...Ellen's Hollywood narrative alone would certainly provide enough material for a provocative examination of fame and its trappings, but Ellen falls for a computer programmer whose experiments have opened a doorway into a ... dimension that isn't quite real but is, in some ways, more real than real. When Michael falls prey to a vicious attack, Ellen's world turns upside down, and her entire world -- not to mention her sense of self -- goes up for grabs.Stylistically, Stark's writing evokes a diverse range of contemporary authors. From the more \"literary\" camp, there's Jennifer Egan and Don DeLillo, while the elements of science-fiction present in the novel call to mind William Gibson's interest in virtual reality and Jamil Nasir's examination of lucid dreaming in The Houses of Time. Complex, ambitious, and genre-bending, The Final Appearance of America's Favorite Girl Next Door is a philosophical page turner that dares to ask what it means to really know someone.-Review by Marc Schuster", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 20.0}

In this collection of 64 “literary tidbits,” Lubow, a former creative director at an ad agency, reflects on a wide range of topics. The pieces are each meant to be read in about a minute; the author provides word counts for each one, with the highest hitting just 160 words. All originally appeared as part of a series on the Guy Page of the Chicago Tribune from 2004 to 2008. The author draws on his background as a writer of short television spots to succinctly express deep, meaningful ideas throughout this collection. The tone is conversational and direct, often addressing subjects in everyday life. Some are short stories that reflect on particular points (a father and son roll malted milk balls into a crowd to see which get stepped on, leading the father to think about the nature of luck); others are short reflections, about such subjects as how hard it is to feel nostalgia when things keep coming back into style. Still others use a second-person perspective to draw readers into the experience; one begins, “[Y]ou’re with your dog in the vet’s crowded waiting room,” and goes on to describe how dogs accept their differences more readily than humans do. Some themes come up repeatedly, including various aspects of being a “guy,” and the nature of a minute (what one can do in 60 seconds, or how a minute can feel long or short depending on what it is one is doing). The book also critiques specific TV shows and books, such as Blue Collar TV, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Malcolm Gladwell’s Blink (2005). Most of these wise little pieces, however, are general and relatable for both sexes, who will likely find truth, comfort and humor in them.

As well as writing about Tenerife, they chronicle their travels worldwide for their Buzz Trips website and are specialists in the Canary Islands which has resulted in two travel guidebooks and subcontracted contributions to DK Guides, Frommer’s and The Independent.

The plot may not be entirely watertight, but fans of melodramatic crime dramas will suck up this rain-soaked page-turner in the Traces series. Set in a decrepit alternate or future London where whites are a persecuted minority, the story features teenage forensic investigator Luke Harding and his robot sidekick. Called on to look into a doctor's murder, Luke finds himself trailing a serial killer into a world of slums, exotic snakes, and an illegal Brown Supremacist cult that meets in the decaying Underground. While folding in plenty of action and on-stage violence, Rose calls on his background as a chemistry professor to provide specific scent and residue clues, and gives Luke an amusingly literal-minded robot companion, a clever foe, and a subplot involving a love interest before wrapping things up with a dose of just deserts. The offbeat but well-envisioned locales bode well for future episodes.

As Bob Makransky explains, A Vision is more like a poem than a treatise to be studied and understood intellectually, and his own approach is to offer us ways to bridge the vast world of feeling into our everyday life as we follow his guiding path through the extensive intricacies of the first section of A Vision. We are advised that the main reason of life is to feel feelings and that this above all other is the true path.\nMemory, that weighty primordial thing that ties us to the past and underlies all our present thoughts and transactions, is a function of the Moon and we look in detail at the 28 phases of this.  These individual quarters and phases can also be used as way of understanding yourself, your social role or mood, through the lunar phase under which you were born, and detailed descriptions of the various energies are given.\nThis is a fascinating and illuminating take on the meaning of the Moon and I learned a great deal, but there is much more, particularly a discussion of the Daimon, the part of you that encompasses all your human memories past present and future.\nThe book is divided into four parts overall under the titles: Connecting to Your True Purpose, The Four Memories of the Daimon, The Phases of the Moon and The Nature of the Daimon.\nIt's truly a moon book unlike any other and is guaranteed to alter you perception of yourself and the world.\n-  Paul F.

Upon the completion of “The Ballad of Elvis Christ,” a depiction of the pressures of the rise and fall of a musical icon, a story that burned in the back of Jaden’s mind for the better part of 20 years begged to be shared with the world. Through Jaden’s words “The Producer” came to life. Jaden was born in New West Minster BC in 1972 and moved to Kamloops BC with his family at the age of one. The decision to become a rock star or an actor bounced around until he finished high school and realized that he needed to get a job to pay bills. Moving around the West coast of Canada for the last twenty years, Jaden always had a journal with him. Through those years, many stage plays and stories made it to paper but few were selected to hit an independent theatrical stage. “The Producer” is the first in a three book series and the second installment, “The Stage” has taken its first steps to become a reality. Jaden has found that his passion for writing has hit a new level as the barrier that once held him from stepping into the world of “Author” no longer exists.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lin is destined to become a great person in the annals of her planet's history -- the emancipator of Luratia's last slave race -- but she doesn't know this yet; she's only ten years old.The Luratia Chroniclesexplores how an exceptionally bright child with a big heart and a handful of flaws takes charge of her destiny and makes for herself an amazing, beautiful life of service and advocacy. But great lives are not easy lives, and through every stage of maturity, Lin grapples with inner and outer struggles: impatience, impulsiveness, guilt, pride, and the persistent array of life's hardships.The Luratia Chronicles, too, is an educational science fiction series that realistically explores what a planet's evolutionary arc might look like if:The super-material graphene is developed abundantly and with ever-wiser applications that improve the quality of medicine, machinery, engineering, architecture, communications, transportation modes, and construction materials. Graphene is so new a discovery on Earth, few people outside of nanotechnology research and academia know of its existence. But we soon will. Graphene will outshine the contributions of steel, plastic, and the silicon chip as transformative milestones in Earth's long evolutionary adventure.Energy is harvested directly from the sun on satellite platforms in near orbit and in such volume that it can be distributed free to all corners of the world. Implementing the technique of wireless energy distribution first introduced by Nicolas Tesla, real-time sun energy is distributed planet-wide through the air, eliminating the need for batteries or fuel storage facilities.Science and love are intelligently paired. The applications of rapidly advancing technology are guided by a high regard for the greater good and an uncompromising respect for the health of people and planet. Population growth is limited to ensure a higher quality of life; machines free people from dangerous manual labor but do not contribute to unemployment; international collaboration in research and development leads to unprecedented advancements; and innovations in economics begin to evolve the planet from a profit-motive exploiter of natural resources to a service-motive society founded on cooperation, creative collaboration, kindness and goodwill.", "related": [], "rank": 3213538, "title": "Thank You and Happy Flying (The Exoplanetary Life of Lin of Luratia Book 2)", "author": "Melanie Pahlmann", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Highly recommended.” (Eric Maisel, PhD, author of Secrets of a Creativity Coach and Why Smart People Hurt)“A therapeutic toolbox for every clinician’s desk,The Healing Power of Writingprovides accessible, evidenced-based, and clinically proven techniques for leading patients in writing for mental health and emotional well-being. Addressing everything from anxiety disorders, grief, and low self-esteem to addictions, eating disorders, and trauma, Borkin elucidates a clear, precise, and flexible guide to best practices for writing in therapy.” (John Evans, MAT, MA, EdD, Integrative Health Coach; Executive Director, Wellness & Writing Connections)“Psychotherapist Susan Borkin reveals how writing—simple, honest, moving, and direct, while also private and unedited—may be one of our best medicines, allowing us to meet self and other in deeper ways, resolve conflicts, ease stress and depression, and much more.  From a solid research base to practical hints, stories, and examples, this book will change the lives of both clients and therapists.” (Ruth Richards, MD, PhD, Saybrook University, San Francisco, and Harvard Medical School; editor of Everyday Creativity and New Views of Human Nature)“Borkin masterfully presents us with the gift of her accumulated clinical discoveries about writing for psychological well-being. She takes us on a kaleidoscopic tour of the practicalities and possibilities of writing to deeply enrich, understand, and change our lives. Although written primarily for clinicians, both therapists and non-therapists alike will discover a feast of original and useful expressive writing ideas.” (Ruth Folit, designer/producer of LifeJournal software and founder/director of the International Association for Journal Writing)“While writers have always intuitively known about the healing power of writing, studies now prove that writing actually does heal. Susan Borkin’s new book,The Healing Power of Writing, is a clear, practical, step-by-step guide for therapists who want to integrate journaling into their clients’ treatment.” (Bill O’Hanlon, author of Change 101)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The plot concerns an unfrocked KKKlansman who mutilates, murders, then rapes women in San Francisco. Annie Tannenbaum and her best friend discuss schemes to snare the beast but they have other major interests. Both are supposedly foxy, 30-ish writers. Sarah is a crime reporter for a local paper; Annie collects data from personal ads for her literary debut, Meeting Cute. Together, they spend quantities of time in their search for dream lovers or in gourmandizing and occasional sex. Numbing trivia about food, the women's taste in clothes and home furnishings, the city's funky diversions, etc., are interspersed with grim details of the fiend's atrocities. In the crisis, irrelevant overwriting also deadens suspense. If the author had gone all out for campy effects, she would have been more successful.

With no real influences or coming from a writing background, James’ enthusiasm grew and grew and it was full steam ahead with no turning back. Not content with just writing words for his own amusement, he continued to test the boundaries to great effect. Using his new found love for writing and his in depth knowledge of the social networking sites, his resourcefulness really paid off.  Attracting a lot of attention over the years, James and his works have covered a range of different media platforms from radio and local and national magazines to working with musicians and actors who have adapted and performed his works. As well as writing, James has a passion for photography. His black and white style of photography has been a huge hit on the social networking sites and something that he was praised for during his radio appearances on the BBC.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

More the ordinary people whose lives were touched by the decisions, the beliefs and the whims of those who had power over them and who now fill our history books. What was it like to be a 17th century mother living in London, scared to death as the plague took hold? How did it feel to a woman in Berwick-Upon-Tweed in 1296 watching the English troops storming through the town? And what about all of those accused, tortured and horribly murdered in the witch trials that swept through Europe? How did it feel to be one of those women, terrified and desperate? These are the stories she wants to tell – how it was for the ordinary people, caught up in events they couldn’t control.  Alison has been writing ever since she can remember – scribbling down and (badly) illustrating stories in exercise books whenever she wasn’t actually reading (which was most of the time when she was awake). After getting married and having two children, she worked in education until deciding to bite the bullet and write full-time. She now works as a freelance writer and author. Alison has a Masters in Creative Writing from the University of Glasgow and is currently working on her second novel.", "related": ["B00DTG5444"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They loved this character and wanted to know more about him.  Creating his story was one of the highlights of my writing career and something that was very personal to me. Months of research went into putting this book together, but much of my information was the result of having a dear friend who had enthralled me with her accounts of growing up through the War years and living in the days of the Soviet Union.Set in 1995 Ukraine, Master can be read for itself or as a prequel to The Line Trilogy. He doesn't appear in The Finest Line. A sequel to Master is underway, but will be some time in the making, due to the size of it and the extensive research needed to put it together. As I get closer, I will make updates on my website.Thank you so much for the incredible support from all my readers and please share your thoughts about Master with other readers through reviews.Best wishes to all,Catherine", "related": ["B00IP1BSAM"], "rank": 309295, "title": "Master (The Master Files Book 1)", "author": "Catherine Taylor", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.25, "rating_total": 34.0}

Mintus's master, Captain Henry Northup, granted Mintus his freedom in his will. After the death of Captain Northup, Mintus, as well as becoming a free man, also managed, later on, to gain the vote by virtue of meeting New York State's property requirements, an impressive feat for someone coming from such a humble background. Mintus died in 1829.Solomon's mother – unnamed in the book – was a woman of mixed ancestry. There are only sketchy details about her in Solomon's memoir, but it is mentioned that she died while Solomon was held as a slave in the Deep South. Solomon described his mother as a quadroon, meaning she was one quarter black and three-quarters white.In 1829, Solomon married Anne Hampton, a woman of African, European and Native American heritage, and together they had three children: Elizabeth, Margaret and Alonzo. Solomon Northup worked as a raftsman, carpenter, construction worker and a fiddler, and he and his family initially owned a farm in Hebron, Washington County, before moving to Saratoga Springs, New York to take advantage of better employment prospects. Whilst Solomon worked, mainly as a musician, Anne was employed intermittently as a cook for local taverns and for the United States Hotel.In 1841, aged 32, Solomon Northup met with two men who called themselves Merrill Brown and Abram Hamilton.  After gaining his trust, they drugged him and sold him to slave trader, James Birch, and claimed that Solomon was a fugitive slave. Solomon was then taken to Louisiana, where he remained in slavery for twelve years.  It is these twelve years of slavery that are reflected on in this compelling memoir.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In all this time I have never come across a publication which complements the rather soulless and complex user manual so well...your excellent work is all I need to exploit the potential of this amazing dSLR.-Martin D.A well written, professional helpful guide- Brilliant, just what I was looking for! A manual that was exciting, clear to follow, had examples and was used by a professional who gave just the right amount of technical with explanations of why you use those settings, when to use those settings and so on, all properly explained. The book is a revelation, a joy to follow, well thought through and well written.-R.D.C.Really practical and tremendously helpful- Readers of this e-book can expect to benefit from a more rewarding photographic experience using this superb camera, and be better able to exploit its potential to match their personal objectives and photographic style. Highly recommended.-M.M.Really focuses on the Why- I found the Nikon manual good for understanding how to set things up but not much on the why - this book really focuses on the WHY.  The guide helped me understand why to use specific settings for specific needs.  The Custom Settings section helps to make firm decisions on how to apply settings by understanding the usage of each in addition to knowing how to set them up.-Benoit A.For Experienced User and Beginner Alike- It's clear,\nconcise and gets to the heart of the camera's multiple and often\nconfusing options. Very highly recommended - for experienced user and\nbeginner alike.-G.S.A.A clearly written, concise and useful explanationof the rationale for the seemingly infinite and often confusing settings options for the camera. Used in conjunction with the Nikon manual I feel more confident in understanding how to at last proceed in getting better photographs.-W.L.S.I would recommend this to anyonewho wants to get a quick start to using their camera.  Manuals are nice, but this eBook highlights the important information and gives a quick, easy to understand explanation of most all of the functions and controls.-Ray M.", "related": ["B00KH9EN3Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His creative energy has won him numerous awards during the Amazon screenwriting and test film competitions. In fact, he took home Amazon's very first $100,000 cash prize for a test film based off his screenplay title: \"Reminded.\" Now Robert is stepping into the world of storytelling for children with his book: \"The Adventures of Herman the Bean / Jump-bean to Conclusions.\" He's been putting this book together for almost ten years. Future books in the Herman Bean series will continue to encourage and entertain children of all ages. The theme of the series is set forth by the book's main character \"Herman\" and his can-do attitude. Herman may just be a tiny jelly bean, but he never gives up on his big dreams, and even though his heart-of-gold shines to a fault at times, in the end he shows how perseverance pays off. Watching Herman Bean reminds us all that were only human, and that it's okay to screw up once in a while. Herman knows that just because you mess up doesn't mean you have to give up. In addition to writing screenplays and children's books, Robert enjoys building and inventing. He's been a carpenter his entire life and built the home where he lives in the far northern wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Another of Robert's passions is making salsa. He's created his own brand of seasoning which is available online at www.RedCrowSalsa.com and also in local stores.  Some Robert's earlier adventures included cutting a Cadillac in half to build a limousine and fronting a few rock bands during a time in his life which he refers to as his \"long-haired days.\" Robert also enjoys tinkering with electronics and anything with a motor, but his strongest interests lie in the creative aspects of life. He hopes to one day write and direct films if he can find the time. If you ask him what the most rewarding thing in life is, he'll tell you it's the opportunity to help others. I'd bet that's why he started writing the Herman Bean series in the first place. His first children's book has clever and creative rhyming patterns which not only teach but also entertain. Born in 1963, Robert is just surpassing the half century mark and remains as ambitious as ever. He says life is filled with adventure and there are still many things he would like to try.", "related": [], "rank": 2298571, "title": "The Adventures of Herman the Bean", "author": "Robert Hosking", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I am a proud wife and stay at home mom.  After my first child was born, I started to focus on the ingredients used in our everyday health and beauty products. The more and more research I did, the more nervous and upset I became towards companies and their lack of care towards consumers.  Fast forward two years, shortly after having my second child, I was diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer. During my fight against this disease, I began researching possible causes. I soon began to learn just how many harmful ingredients were not identified on product labels.  I vowed once I recovered to share my knowledge through my newly established company producing all natural products, that include soaps, balms, bath salts, etc etc.  My books are intended to not only educate, but also to share the knowledge and passion that I have gained through my struggles over the last few years.  I hope you enjoy my books.
