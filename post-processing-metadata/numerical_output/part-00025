Noting that each year in America hundreds of thousands of couples seek fertility advice after being unable to conceive, the authors set out to help readers decide on a strategy. Part one describes the options available: early fertility assistance, including hormone stimulation and intrauterine insemination; assisted reproductive technology (ART) such as in vitro fertilization using a couple's own eggs or sperm or donor sperm, eggs or embryos; using a surrogate; and domestic or international adoption. The authors assure that in most cases couples are able to reach their goal of birthing or adopting a child within two years, and although challenges for single, gay, lesbian or other nontraditional families may be greater, they are not insurmountable. The key, the authors argue, is knowing when to call a halt to a particular pathway that isn't working and move on to another: remaining flexible and open to various options is crucial to success. In part two, emotional, financial and legal issues are covered. First-person accounts, often quite fascinating, conclude each chapter. This panoramic view of the many routes to parenthood is both practical and encouraging.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When she worked for a whitewater rafting company as a Registered Maine Whitewater Guide on the Kennebec River, she began exploring the central and northern regions of the state, and a sense of wanderlust was ignited. When she tired of her parents asking when she was going to get a real job, she drew on her writing strength, working as editor for the pro ski tour publications, managing editor for a food trade publication, features editor for a daily newspaper, and now as a freelance writer/editor.Hilary never tires of exploring Maine, always seeking out the offbeat and quirky, and rarely resisting the invitation of a backroad. To her husband’s dismay, she inherited her grandmother’s shopping gene and can’t pass a used-book store, artisans’ gallery, or antiques shop without browsing. She’s equally curious about food, and has never met a lobster she didn’t like. She still divides her year between the coast and the mountains, residing with her husband, photographer Tom Nangle, and two oversized dogs, all of whom share her passions for long walks and Maine-made ice cream.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Here, Reg aims to set the record straight, tracing the notorious twins' career from their beginnings in the East End slums to their reign over an empire of 33 London clubs, \"fraud firms,\" and other dubious interests. Unfortunately, Kray is too close to the events to tell an objective story or even to realize where American readers need more background information. While he waxes compassionate describing the state execution of a friend, his cool description of a murder he committed in cold blood shows that the only lives he values belong to Kray or his friends. Although this book might have value as a psychological study of a habitual criminal or may generate interest because of the recent movie The Krays , it is strictly for libraries with large true crime sections.- Lois Walker, Winthrop Coll.

With her typical wit and humor, Barbour (Step in Time, Signet, 1996) has penned a delightful, well-written Regency featuring a pair of engaging protagonists (who both reform), a well-drawn group of secondary characters, and an interesting element of Regency feminism.

A keen cyclist, Steve has also just started producing books detailing his favourite UK rides. Steve's fiction is an altogether different prospect, aiming to take the reader to some very dark places. Frequently bordering on horror, these novellas and short stories involve intense research to really bring the subject matter to life.

Kelly builds her scientific investigation on a solid cultural foundation, by introducing the crocodile through folk tales of indigenous Australians, Africans, Americans and South Asians; similarly, fossils showing crocodilies have changed very little in more than 200 million years adds relevance to the old stories and weight to the sobering fact that, today, mankind has managed to kill off many crocodilian species that eons of natural selection never could. Among chapters on biology, featuring photos and drawings of characteristic behavior and skeletal structures, Kelly covers the scientific minds who came before her, such as 19th century naturalists Sir Richard Owen and Thomas Huxley (\"Darwin's Bulldog\"), who feuded famously over still-unresolved taxonomy issues. In addition, Kelly recounts the tales of famous crocodile hunters and infamous attacks on humans by crocodilians, discusses the continuing demand for crocodile hides and meat and investigates crocodile farming in relation to other types of animal husbandry. Kelly's treatment is clever, entertaining and complete, making this a fine read and a great example of species history done right.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book's focus on the historical, constitutional, and economic significance of the road's construction and maintenance during the early part of the Nineteenth Century will be exceedingly valuable to students of that period. (Donna Holdorf, Executive Director, National Road Heritage Corridor)Roads connect people, and a national road can unite a country. The significance of extending and linking an expanding nation, along with the debate surrounding the extent and suitability of public involvement in the planning and financing of such a road in the US, are compelling stories that reveal much about not just literally the path but also the pace of American economic and political development. Sky (law, Catholic Univ.) has written an interesting, thorough history of this significant early national internal improvement--the National Road. Initially authorized in 1806 by Thomas Jefferson, by 1839 it would ultimately stretch more than 600 miles across six states from Cumberland, Maryland, to Vandalia, Illinois. This systematic, detailed study examines and deconstructs some of the legislative and constitutional debates while also providing insight into the constructive and engineering complexities in the thoroughfare's design and operation. As an instrument of national unity and identity, the National Road had cultural, political, and economic significance. As this history demonstrates, its story remains relevant as the antecedent of the continuing debates around public investment strategies; as such, this study will benefit undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, and faculty.Summing Up:Recommended.

This change in no way diminishes the value of this book for clinicians who work with and teach about adults with psychiatric disorders. . . . I strongly recommend this book to any and all who deal with psychiatric patients and those who rightfully advocate for their treatment. . . . The section on psychotherapy . . . can help the therapist to understand what the patient needs and how to go about achieving it. The section on psychosocial aspects can provide information for patient advocates and others involved in the field about how limited the resources are and what is needed.” (Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease)“[A]n important read not just for clinicians but for adults who are seeking diagnosis or who have attained diagnosis in adulthood. . . . [A] thoroughly documented text that will be valuable to clinicians seeking to provide support and interventions for adults on the mild end of the spectrum. . . . Research in how autism presents across the lifespan is lacking and many clinicians lack the expertise in recognizing how undiagnosed mild autism presents in adults. This book is a good solution, regardless of what we call the condition.” (Autism Blogs Directory)“This book lives up to its name ofComprehensive Guideand may well become a standard text for understanding the complexity of Asperger’s Syndrome (AS) in adults . . . . I am in awe of Stoddart, Burke, and King for their in-depth knowledge of this difficult subject. . . . I highly recommend this book.” (The Milton H. Erickson Foundation Newsletter)“The guide is written with great respect and obvious concern for the needs of adults with AS. In fact, it's the first clinical guide I've read that treats adults with AS as adults - with well-rounded and complication lives filled with college, careers, relationships, parenting, and sex. . . . The authors do a great job of blending research with their own clinical observations, providing lots of practical examples of AS . . . . The guide also does a thorough job of discussing the complexities involved with diagnosing comorbid medical and mental health disorders, . . . and the difficulties in using standard diagnostic instruments in an AS population.” (Snagglebox)“Well written and highly readable . . . . [T]his volume will be invaluable for those clinicians who provide that care.” (Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders)“An outstanding addition to the literature. This volume is comprehensive in scope and is a valuable addition to the growing body of work on this topic.” (Fred R. Volkmar, MD, Irving B. Harris Professor and Director, Child Study Center, Yale; Chief of Child Psychiatry, Yale New Haven Hospital)“Asperger Syndrome in Adulthoodrepresents a very welcome addition to the current literature on what happens to individuals on the autism spectrum after they graduate from high school or college. Maintaining an evidence-based perspective, the authors address a wide range of issues, including some controversial ones, in way that is accurate, accessible, and very applicable to the promotion of quality-of-life concerns. A very useful volume.” (Peter F. Gerhardt, EdD, Chair, Scientific Council for the Organization for Autism Research; Director, McCarton Upper School)“An invaluable resource for parents and clinicians alike. This book fills an important and neglected niche in our understanding of Asperger Syndrome. It is written with both clarity and compassion.” (Dr. Peter Szatmari, MD, Professor, Dept. of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences; Director, Offord Centre for Child Studies; and Head, Division of Child Psychiatry, McMaster University)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She moved into the projects of Dayton, Ohio with her family shortly thereafter. The Bella Vista Estates, where Angel called home, was a world of drug infestation and violence. It was a war zone and like any other war zone everybody leaves with scars. She had to deal with crack and heroine addiction in her own home, her family being torn apart, and her friends dying way too soon. Angel could have easily gone under with circumstance. Instead she chartered a new course, graduating high school with the highest grade point average in the city. She became the first person in her family to finish college, when she received her Bachelors Degree in Political Science and Criminal Justice from The Ohio State University. Angel started writing poetry very early in life as a way to express her thoughts and feelings. Poetry was a soul anchor for her as she navigated her way out of the projects. Even as gun shots rang outside of her bedroom window; Poetry offered an escape from the violence and confusion.  In A Spring in the Desert Angel immortalizes those that she has loved and the ones she has lost - the many souls she has encountered along the way. Each piece, like a snapshot, captures a moment in time. It speaks to the pain that we all experience in this life and the hope that allows us to rise above even the most dismal circumstances. With the pen Angel found her voice and with her words she hopes to give voice to those who have yet to find theirs.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This teaching is intended to empower incarnate persons living in the physical world individuals such as you and me to lead lives of greater blessing and capacity and to be sources of blessing and service for the world as a whole. All David's teaching and spiritual work has developed in association with this invisible school. For many years, he applied the skills and training he had received in co-creative work as a consultant with other groups, such as the Findhorn Foundation community in Scotland, where he served as a co-director for three years. David has done such work with the aid of inner colleagues but always under his own vision and authority. During these years, he have continued to research the mysteries of the inner worlds, of incarnation, and of the spiritual life.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

To save the family estate, and to provide her siblings with a steady income, she turns to a life of crime, establishing the persona of Euan Pate, smuggler. Keir Galloway, Lord Pittenmuir, wants to find the traitor selling secrets to the French, so he decides his ticket to the nefarious underworld is through the guise of a smuggler. Their confrontation is inevitable, as is their attraction to each other. This novel of double concealed identities has standard Regency fare--the faithful servant, the beautiful younger sister, and the plainer but brighter older sister. However, the rugged Scottish coastal setting and the descriptions of the smuggling activities give it a different perspective. Readers who take pleasure in books featuring women outlaws, such as Julie Garwood'sGuardian Angel(1990) (pirate) and Christina Kingston'sThe Night the Stars Fell(2001) (highwayman), will enjoy this book about another woman gone bad to do good.Shelley MosleyCopyright © American Library Association.

After school I joined the Royal Navy and at my last assignment in Denmark met my own tall, dark, handsome stranger - a US Naval Officer named Richard who became my husband. Our itinerant life took us to Sicily, California, Maryland, and finally London. Along the way we had our three sons. On retirement from the Navy my husband took a job near Nashville, Tennessee and we're still here. I've always been a voracious reader and in 2001 took a creative writing class which has sparked my new career. I've had short stories published in women's magazines in the UK, US, and Australia. My first novel 'Truth and Consequence' was published in 2006. I belong to the Red Bandanas Writing Group, Jubilee Readers Book Club, the Music City Romance Writers, and the Romantic Novelists' Association. I also volunteer at my local library so you can see words are important to me. I hope you enjoy reading my work as much as I enjoy writing it so sit back, make yourself a cup of tea and enjoy a break from everyday life.", "related": ["B00D03489I"], "rank": 3368096, "title": "Opposites Attract", "author": "Angela Britnell", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

During my younger school years, I won a Young Authors Honorable Mention for a short story I had written. I have also won a few Visual Arts awards during my school years and upon graduation from High School, I was given a President’s award for Outstanding Academic Achievement. The first book I began to write seriously for publication was The Priestess. Completed in 2008, the book was separated into a trilogy and published in 2010. It is currently undergoing reediting and will be re-released as both the individual books and as a one book collection, The Priestess: A Complete Collection.

Simpson approaches theories about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, for example, by laying out the accepted version of events, then briefly analyzing how some alternative theories either jibe with or depart from the historical record. Discussing the notion that NASA faked the moon landings, he shows how many of the theory’s key allegations are the results of wishful thinking and a lack of scientific knowledge on the part of the theorists. The scope of the book is limited to conspiracy theories that have some vague substance to them (hence, David Icke’s claim that the world is secretly run by shape-changing reptiles is dismissed), and Simpson adopts an evenhanded reasonableness to demonstrate the tenuousness of the theories. It’s also worth noting that some of the theories in the book are legit. There really was a conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln, just not the one some people have imagined.

Outside of work, she has been active in several horse show related organizations both as an exhibitor and helping out in the behind the scenes office work that such organizations require. When asked in a job interview what would be her reaction if she were asked to do a new task that she had never done before and was not on the job description, Carlynne remembers answering “I love to learn new things so I would take it in stride.  Learning, to me, is fun and if I don’t learn something new every day, then I wasted the day.”  She found out afterwards that other candidates had actually said they would point out to the co-worker that the new duty was not on the job description.  Which attitude would you want in a new employee?", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Max, you’re a well-\n\nknown author in the mystery/suspense field – why not use a joint byline for the novels you’re \n\nwriting with your wife Barbara?Max Allan Collins:WhenRegenerationandBombshellwere first published, we \n\ndid use both of our names, but there was hardly any room on the covers for anything else!  A \n\nfew years later, when we began doing the humorous, cozy “Trash ‘n’ Treasures” mysteries – \n\nstarting withAntiques Roadkill– we felt we needed something shorter and snappier.  I grew up with my family and friends calling me “Allan” and “Al,” because I was Max Allan Collins Jr., and my father was already using “Max.”Barbara Collins:Using Barbara Allan for our byline seemed perfect, because \n\nI’ve always called my husband Al - or Allan... two syllables, whinny... when I was irritated or \n\nmad.  Also, “Barbara Allan” would resonate with readers because of the familiar folk song... \n\nand it couldn’t hurt to be positioned first on alphabetically-arranged bookstores shelves.Q:TheAntiquesnovels are, as you just described them, cozies.  But bothRegenerationandBombshellare thrillers.  You could even callRegenerationa horror novel.  Do \n\nyou think yourTrash ‘n’ Treasuresreaders will find them a shock to the system?MAC:I don’t think so.  Both have a good deal of humor in them, and I’d \n\ncallBombshella comic thriller.  We wouldn’t have replaced our cumbersome joint byline with \n\n“Barbara Allan” if we thought those readers wouldn’t have a good time.BC:While ourAntiquesseries is considered “cozy,” they are also our own take on the genre: subversive, a little irreverent, and more realistic, the characters and subject matter being drawn from our own lives and experiences.Regenerationwas another life concern, especially for Boomers – the need to continue to work, and retain earning power well into our fifties and sixties.  With the current political talk of extending age requirements for Social Security and Medicare further, this subject seems even more relevant today.Q:Max, you’re known for noir fiction, butRegenerationhas a sort of \n\nAlfred Hitchcock flavor.  Is it fair to say it seems more reminiscent of Barbara’s short story \n\nwork than, say, your Nathan Heller historical novels?MAC:Very fair.  Barb began her writing career doing short stories, many of \n\nthem for the popularCat Crimesanthologies, and she’s an expert at darkly comic tales with a \n\nsting in the tail.  BothRegenerationandBombshellare novels that are expansions of short \n\nstories Barb wrote.BC:As an impressionable youngster in the 1950s, watchingAlfred Hitchcock \n\nPresentshad a very profound effect on me, as did episodes of theTwilight Zone.  I loved \n\nthe twist endings, and oftentimes ironic conclusions.  While Max is a natural writer, it comes \n\nhard to me, so I must have an emotional connection to the material - a point to make, or a \n\nsocial theme to explore, or I can’t do it.  Adding humor is a must.Q:Max, you seem to have a fascination for Marilyn Monroe.  Your recent \n\nNathan Heller novel,Bye Bye, Baby, deals with her death, and there’s a novella about Heller \n\nmeeting Marilyn,Kisses of Death, in the collectionTriple Play.MAC:Actually, it’s Barb who is the Marilyn collector and Marilyn buff.  \n\nShe has always struck me as a Marilyn Monroe lookalike, though she might deny that herself – \n\nstill, I was able to use a photo of her for the cover ofTriple Play.  She was very much the \n\nin-house expert on Marilyn for both of those Heller stories.  She’s written several short \n\nstories about Marilyn, including the one that we expanded intoBombshell.BC:I vividly remember when Khrushchev came to the United States.  I was \n\nten, and terrified of him, having seen his bellicose blustering on TV, banging his shoe on the \n\ntable, and holding up a small globe of the world as if to say it was his.  Russia had Sputnik \n\nup, after all, and we were far behind in the arms race.  Then Khrushchev said he wanted to come \n\nto America – I don’t think he was even invited – and demanded two things: to meet Marilyn \n\nMonroe, and see Disneyland.  In reality, he did get to meet Marilyn at a Hollywood dinner, but \n\ngoing to Disneyland was deemed too dangerous by the Secret Service and KGB.  In our book, the \n\nPremier does get to the theme park, but under the cover of darkness, spirited away by Marilyn, \n\nwho unwittingly uncovers an assassination attempt.

Place to escape North Dakota winters? Yes. Round of golf? Absolutely. But with the exception of Lee's Ferry, The Grand Canyon State has never drawn much attention from flyfishers. This new edition of Will Jordan's book should help change that. From hard-to-reach Grand Canyon creeks like Nankoweap and Bright Angel, to Mogollon Rim favorites like Chevelon Creek and Blue Ridge Reservoir, Jordan talks warmwater, he talks Apache and Gila trout, he talks flyfishing. In a state with way more of it than you think. --Drake Magazine, Fall 2012This new Flyfisher's Guide to Arizona joins the long list of highly acclaimed Flyfisher's Guides published by Wilderness Adventures Press in Belgrade, Montana. Now a Montana resident himself, author Will Jordan spent more than two decades exploring the backcountry streams and rivers in Arizona. He attended college in Flagstaff and worked at Grand Canyon National Park for four years. He is currently involved with a new publishing endeavor, Montana Sporting Journal, in Billings. Jordan's vast experience and expertise are evident in this book. After a thorough introduction to Arizona and its geography, he divides the state's fisheries into five main watersheds: the Colorado, Verde, Salt, Little Colorado, and Gila rivers. He also includes information pertaining to a number of the state's warmwater fisheries as well as miscellaneous trout waters, including Navajo Nation fisheries, Flagstaff-area fisheries, and Williams-area fisheries. While the majority of the book focuses on where-to and when-to advice, Jordan also includes helpful how-to information on tactics he has found successful on the small trout streams and rivers that characterize Arizona. Each major watershed is covered in great detail, beginning with specific rivers, lakes, and streams, as well as many of the tributaries to major rivers. Information deals with seasons, special regulations, maps, specific characteristics, flows, and river mile data. Special species (trout and bass) are noted for certain bodies of water. Especially valuable are the listings and drawings of Arizona game fish, material on etiquette and catch-and-release requirements, trip planning, the top 10 trout flies for Arizona with photographs and tying instructions and a glossary of acronyms and jargon. The book concludes with up-to-date data for Arizona fly shops and sporting goods stores, a listing of guides and outfitters, contact information for each of the six regions of the six regions of the Arizona Game and Fish Department, useful Web sites, and a detailed index. --Jack W. Berryman, Southwest Fly Fishing magazineI wish I had read Will Jordan's \"Flyfisher's Guide to Arizona\" when I arrived in Arizona in 1961. I would have taken up fly-fishing and it would have changed my life. As it was, I had to discover Arizona's streams on my own. Possessing a sturdy binding and slick cover, this 6-by-9-inch softcover from Wilderness Adventures Press is a \"where-to\" rather than a \"how-to\" guidebook. The assumption is that the reader knows how to fly-fish and tie flies, and wants to know where to find the best streams and lakes. The author, a graduate of Northern Arizona University, has spent more than 20 years fishing, photographing and writing about Arizona's fly-fishing waters. After an introductory overview, Jordan organizes his book by watershed, beginning with the Colorado River and Arizona's fly-fishing mecca, Lee's Ferry. What follows are accurate descriptions of each region's fly-fishing waters and the fishes therein. Comprehensive rather than exhaustive, the book encapsulates each water's history and management status, directions on getting there, conditions likely encountered, best times to fish there, dates of peak flows, aquatic insect emergences and other fly-fishing essentials. As is to be expected, some regions are favored over others, with the White Mountains and Apache Indian Reservations predominately featured. Poorly producing streams are discussed, along with blue-ribbon sites. Flagstaff's lakes are in a separate section, as are warmwater fisheries and other select sites. In addition to recommending tactics and tackle, the author includes pertinent information on each location's trails and access peculiarities, while giving advice on potential float trips and backpacking possibilities. Information about campsites and other accommodations also is provided. Maps and photos are distributed generously throughout the book. As the book progresses, the reader is treated to accurate natural-history descriptions of the six principal game fishes taken on fly rods - each accompanied by a black-and-white drawing. Up-to-date information is given for the two native trout. There also are suggestions regarding stream etiquette, catch-and-release methods and trip planning. Toward the end, the reader is provided clear presentations and descriptions of the author's top 10 flies, both dry and wet, complete with suggestions as to when and where to use them. Last but not least, the book contains a succinct index and glossary, phone numbers and websites for Arizona fly shops and fly-fishing organizations and contact information for land management agencies. Not every stream is included, as the author considers some places too fragile for general use. I was therefore please to find my best trout water included and my pet stream omitted. Some things are best learned by oneself, and reading this book will get you off to a great start! --David E.

Saxon is an English golf pro, down on his luck when he is asked to play in the Tournament of Champions in California by golf buddy Zuke Everett. The tournament is being held to inaugurate a new golf course, Golden Haze, owned by the shark-like tycoon Rutherford Kallgren. Though he hates cops on principle, Saxon becomes determined to discover who murdered his pal Zuke. Suspects abound, and his investigation leads him back to Zuke's first wife, a clash with Zuke's movie-star second spouse, and various rich, powerful and talented people in the L. A. golfing world. Then someone tries to kill Saxon, and the cops begin to wonder if he, not Everett, was the intended victim. This enjoyable romp should entertain mystery and golfing fans alike and keep the reader guessing right to the end.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00B0GFO2W"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Along the way various older, money-grubbing villains attempt to injure him. Eventually, with the assistance of kind patrons, he and his family achieve economic security and a happy home. Sounds rather trite, doesn't it? Not with characters written by Dickens (Hard Times, Audio Reviews, LJ 5/1/98). Schoolmaster Squeers would make a fine poster boy for child abusers. Ralph Nickleby's initial desire to injure Nicholas gradually develops into a full-blown obsession. Then there are the kind Cheeryble brothers, the gentle, much-abused Smike, and a host of other friends who provide comic relief. Martin Jarvis does an outstanding job of reading this book. His ingenues sound young (a frequent problem area for male readers) while his villains are deliciously evil. The only problems are with the abridgment. In several places, choppy editing has left brief, disconnected scenes and/or character cameos without relevance to the abridged tale. Still, this is a charming presentation and a wonderful bridge to a classic book. Recommended for public and academic libraries.AI.

She wrote her first book, a part-biography, in 2010, and was so inspired she quickly followed this up with her first major fiction work, The Horses of Ra. She plans to produce illustrations for the book, but is continually thwarted in her plans by the interruptions of her day job, her three dogs and a real-life horse. Dinka is inspired in her writing by her extraordinary life experiences, as well as a number of excellent authors, including Stephen King, Ernest Hemingway, Terry Pratchett, James Herriot, Isaac Asimov, Edgar Allan Poe, Jack London, John Grisham, Nabokov, Dostojevsky - to name a few! Special mention must go to Ferdinand Adelsberger, an author and a poet - and Dinka's grandfather, who was a special source of inspiration and with whom she exchanged literary critiques until he passed away.  Dinka has always been a free spirit and her one regret in life is that she did not pursue a writing career sooner.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Many are unsure of how old he is or where exactly he came from. He has been heard on a few occasions telling people his first memory is of awakening in a laboratory in which they were testing a chemical known as TXZ-871. This chemical compound is known to erode the mind and cause delusions of grandeur. After several doses the patient is rendered psychologically insane but left with extreme amounts of creativity. Some test subjects in the trial were even able to project their own mental image of themselves externally, resulting in the morphing of size, shape and form. Tex has been documented as one of the prime examples of this and nobody is really sure what he actually looks like. Due to the damage caused by this drug, Tex believes himself to be a self employed spy and travels the world seeking clues to his own origin. He says that there are secret messages encoded in his literary works and that others that have been exposed to the compound will be able to decode it. His residence, is always changing. His look is never the same, and many say he doesn’t even exist but is merely the apparition of another test subject.", "related": ["B00FI23NDG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Notes at the close of each chapter provide additional textual and technical comments for those who want to dig deeper. A bibliography as well as Scripture and subject indexes are also included. Pastors, students, and Bible teachers will find in this series a commitment to accessibility without sacrificing serious scholarship.Allen and Laniak direct the reader's attention to the literary elements of these three postexilic books while examining the historical setting and details, which in turn point to the valuable lessons to be learned. Though the focus is on human activity, the hand of God in restoration and deliverance is clearly seen. This helpful commentary sheds light on these sometimes misunderstood books.Leslie C.

Donald Thompson is a trumpet player with hopes of moving to New Orleans to play, even though following his dream means leaving behind his wife, Elaine; teenage daughter Dorothy; and eight-year-old epileptic daughter Tot. Donald tells Tot of his secret plan, and she promises not to tell anyone as long as he brings her back a snow globe to add to her collection. Tot, meanwhile, strikes a deal with God that if she catches seven stickleback fish over the course of seven Saturdays (and sacrifices them), her father will return. Subplots concerning other residents involve, among others, Gerald Damson, who lost his former home, sold most of his possessions and suspects his wife is flirting with the rent man. The pace suffers from stringing together a hodgepodge of points-of-view (a retarded child, Dorothy and her friend) that fail to coalesce. Goodjohn captures the feel and tenor of a working-class neighborhood, but the novel's meandering hobbles readers' emotional investment in the characters' plights.(Oct.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I joined the Royal Navy straight from school, did four years at engineering college and then went to sea for three years in destroyers. I took a commission after that and joined the Fleet Air Arm as a helicopter pilot. I was married, had two kids and now have four grandchildren and one great grandson. I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this engaging picture book, Mendel is the bumbling yet lovable caretaker of the Chelm synagogue. On the first day of Hanukkah, the rabbi tells Mendel to place the menorah on a table by the window so everyone can enjoy its warm glow. Poor Mendel! He takes the menorah off the table in the storage closet and then embarks with his smart-alecky cat on an elaborate, all-day, fumbling, slapstick search... for a table. (\"How many Chelmites does it take to move a table?\" asks his cat. \"One to hold the table and ten to move the earth.\") By nightfall, Mendel accidentally stumbles on the original table from the storage closet, and the menorah candles can shine through the synagogue window after all. David Adler's original tale has all the elements of a traditional folk story, and clever jokes abound in the full-pagepen and watercolor illustrationsby Kevin O'Malley. Families have been laughing together for hundreds of years over the funny foibles of the Chelmites, and this slightly irreverent holiday book enthusiastically embraces that tradition.

My books are not the long drawn out War and Peace length tomes, and I make no apologies for this. I write pure  escapist fiction for the general entertainment of the mass audiences. Books that will take you out of the mundane everydayness of your life into a world of pulse pounding action and adventure, just like the old Pulp stories from back in the day. Yes there is violence, yes there is bad language, and slang, sometimes extreme, but the worlds my characters inhabit, this can be the norm. All you need to do is sit back buckle up and enjoy the wild roller-coaster ride, then at the end you can get off and rejoin your life. Don't read too much into them, they're just for fun.

To take one small but revealing example, dinners with his family are a rich, warm and delicious mixture of Lebanese and Italian influences, transformed beyond their origins by the easy openness of the Australian environment and the sheer range of people from different cultures you will find around his table. In important ways, Joseph s life has depended critically on the need to communicate effectively with others. So it is hardly surprising that communications became the area in which he successfully built a business, and a new sort of business at that, drawing upon all the lessons he had learned. From his arrival in Australia as a migrant from Lebanon, in someone else s shoes as he poignantly explains in these pages, the author has not just been living a multicultural life, he has been thinking about it and reflecting on its meaning. Why do multicultural societies work? What are the challenges they face? How can they work better? What can we learn from each other? I xi The relentless energy and curiosity, and the sense of life s adventure that originally brought the author from his small village in Lebanon to the other side of the world, is evident in the pages that follow. From a kaleidoscope of cultural influences, Joseph has spent a lifetime drawing strength and lessons. This book is, in part, a memoir of an immigrant s life full of the transforming and revealing experiences only available to someone brave enough to leave the comfort zone of what the author calls his own cultural state . It is also a reflection (on the social approach we have come to refer to as  multiculturalism ) by someone who has thought about it and worked with it for decades. In some ways this is a very practical book. It looks not at the theory of multiculturalism (though it certainly deals with its philosophy) but at its practical impact on the real world. For example, it draws lessons from experience in discussing citizenship, or how language affects our understanding of the world and the impact this has on marketing. And in some ways it is a book focused on Australia  its past and its future. It deals with our national identity, what it means to be Australian, and how that is changing. Based on forty years of affectionate observation, it provides one man s reflections on what we have become as a country and what we should aspire to. Most importantly, the lessons Joseph Assaf has learned and wants to impart to his readers are not addressed to particular tribes or groups or nationalities but to all of us as humans, learning to live effectively and rewardingly with each other. Poking away, as he puts it, at the flames of hope for a better world . --Allan Gyngell, Executive Director, Lowy Institute for International PolicyJoseph Assaf does not pretend that his book In Someone Else s Shoes is an academic treatise of Multiculturalism as a public policy. However, what it is are the reflections of a man who has lived Multiculturalism to its fullest extent. In a very readable and, in many ways, a gentle manner, Joseph takes us through his own life to date, emphasising along the way the many issues that we, at Ethnic Communities Councils around Australia have been saying for countless years. His chapter on racial profiling of crimes was one of the many chapters that most caught my attention. Joseph, very gently, examines the futility and stupidity that occurs when Police and Media attempt to connect a person s ethnicity to their criminality. Joseph s own story is truly one of Multiculturalism. Of Lebanese ancestry, a very proud Australian citizen, married to a lady of Italian ancestry and with children born in Australia, Joseph s was the first voice heard in a language other than English on Radio 2EA (later to become SBS Radio). Very effectively, Joseph has examined the history of Multiculturalism in this country. His observations on a variety of aspects of that are simplified to the choices we make in the way in which we live our lives. Whilst simplifying the issues, Joseph is still able to capture the essence of Multiculturalism He does not shirk from addressing the difficult and sometimes, thorny issues of religious diversity together with multi racial and diverse communities attitudes. In the chapter relating to criminality and ethnic profiling he debunks the myth of the existence of Ethnic gangs . As Joseph puts it From what I could see, if we were to consistently discriminate against people based on their ethnicity, then the four pillars of our early society (Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed and Moses), if they tried to enter Australia today, would be put in detention. Jesus was a non-English speaker of Jewish parents who spoke Hebrew and Aramaic, Like many Middle Eastern leaders, he had ambitions to change the world, He lived his life by loving everyone, including his enemies.  A beautifully written book, In Someone Else s Shoes is simple and yet one of the most effective expositions of what Multiculturalism is all about. As ECC s around the country have said for a long time, Multiculturalism is about ALL of us and not simply, compartmentalised policies, about specific ethnic communities. This is highly recommended reading for any practitioner in this field. Policy makers also need to take heed of Joseph s views in this area. --Suresh Rajan, President of Ethnic Communities Council in Western AustraliaAs I was reflecting... on the work of Joseph Assaf, it in itself is a story which I think speaks to the heart of Australia. This book... In Someone Else s Shoes, is a great story writ large about the lives of so many who have come to this country from afar and made this country great. The story of a young Joseph, 40 years ago, lining up at the airport in Beirut, as a young Lebanese, who didn t even have the gumption to tell his parents that he was coming to Australia, and to discover at the airport that he had to have a new, clean pair of shoes in order to get past Australian customs and quarantine. And then having been turned back the first time because the flight was cancelled and gone back home to reappear on a subsequent day, and to be then told that the pair of shoes that he had had, which were then new and clean, on the previous few days, were no longer new and clean. They had a bit of dust on them. And so he could not be allowed on the aircraft. [After obtaining a pair of shoes] twice the size of his normal size in shoe ...he was allowed to board the aircraft and begin his new life in Australia. And so goes the circumstance and the happenstance of so many people who make their lives here in this great country of ours. Not just this century, not just the one that has passed, not even the one before that. So many different stories from so many parts of the world, each rich in its own depth and diversity. But each united in one thing coming here to Australia not just to make a new life but with a sense of determination to make that life an absolute success. The good thing about the Joseph story though, is his reflections contained in this book... It s about what you pick up when you arrive here in Australia. And if there is a theme to this book, it seems to be that the great thing which has crafted his business career, that through it, what crafts the success of so many business careers here in this country, is not just a celebration of diversity but the actual deployment of diversity for what you do in business and in life. He says here, I enjoy the fruits of thousands of years of collective wisdom . That is an elegant phrase. He says also that from my own people, the Lebanese, or the ancient Phoenicians, I ve learned how to learn from everyone else . If you anything of the history of the Phoenicians and their role in the history of the Mediterranean prior to the rise of the Greeks and prior to the rise of the Romans, the Phoenicians knew everybody, they knew everywhere, they knew every language, and so they traded... He goes on to say, in a celebration of some of the cultures he encountered here down under, I quickly began to understand the cultures of the Arabs. It was they who opened my eyes to the meaning of hospitality. That welcoming smile and that genuine desire to open ones heart and home to both friends and strangers. He speaks also of his second language, French. And with this linguistic tool I was able to mix with a new set of friends who taught me a healthy respect for language. He then talks of his arrival and dealings with genuine Aussie mates, who encouraged each other to be fair dinkum... And then he speaks of his encounter with his wife, who is herself, an Italian. Angela Bianca, who he has described... as my angelic Bianca, or my white angel ... he says while the Italians taught me about what it means to be passionate, indeed my wife Angela is Italian and she taught me a lot too . And he says with some modesty, and not just about passion . What is nice about this book, what is elegant about this book is that it is a story of reflection, about one man s experience of arriving on these shores of Australia from distant shores and absorbing all that we had to offer, in all of its diversity and then adding some. A new richness, a new depth, a new diversity. --Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, Address to Gala Presentation Dinner at Ethnic Business Awards 18 November 2008", "related": [], "rank": 1810639, "title": "In Someone Else's Shoes eBook", "author": "Joseph Assaf", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Darnell Hill comes from Tennessee, moving to Amarillo, Texas when she was nine years old. Her father taught her to read when she was five and, at least once a week, they enjoyed walking together to the library, where they each checked out the maximum number of books allowed. The shift from the green hills and mountains of Tennessee were especially hard on her mother, who despised the incessant winds and multitude of dust storms in Amarillo during the 1950s.  Hill has one sister, seven years younger than she. Linda’s education, beginning at Abilene Christian College and continuing at West Texas State University, was interrupted when she was married and subsequently had three children. In 1979, she returned to WTSU and completed a bachelor’s degree in Psychology in 1981. She immediately began work on her master’s degree three days later, and was awarded an M.Ed. in professional counseling with a minor in psychology in 1983. With her degrees under her belt, she became a substance-abuse counselor, then a family counselor for a local agency. In l986, she went into private practice as a psychotherapist. She always felt she’d chosen the perfect career.  In 1983 she married Fred Gene Hill, also a psychotherapist.  They developed a practice as Hill Associates and enjoyed 15 years of working together until she retired in 2000. She became a Master Gardener, and was passionate about gardening for many years until her health prevented gardening actively. She meets with her critique group once a week, and attends workshops and seminars any time they’re available, always eager to learn more about her craft.  She has been a member of Panhandle Professional Writers Assn. since 2010. She began writing in 2009, and her first book, \"Survival Ain't Enough,\" under the name, Linda D. Hill, was published in 2010.

My life as an author of fiction began in 2003 after several individuals consistently commented my speeches delivered at Toastmasters International always like captivating stories regardless of the topic. “I should write a book” they all said. My wife encouraged me because she was sick of listening to me rehearsing my speeches. “What should I write about?” I asked of my supportive spouse. “Write about your patient from the Navy who brought back a bottle full of human eyes from Vietnam.” Thus began my string of medical thrillers starting with THE EYEMAN. The sequel to THE EYEMAN, THE DUTY CREW, chronicles the last Christmas Day of the Vietnam War in a Northeast Naval hospital. Like all my novels true lifetime situations is interwoven with suspenseful and intriguing storylines. I spent most of my life in Massachusetts and schooling leading up to both an MD and PhD in medicine and directed medical research for the last 20 years of my healthcare career with drug development in major pharmaceutical companies. I’ve always been caught up in history and my medical thriller COTTER attests to historical fact both in medicine and family life in the struggling Post-Civil War years 1868-1872. I believe literature should be educational, fun, serious, full of feelings and always with a touch of fantasy. We’re all part dreamers. When Dr. Mathew Collins returns from Afghanistan military service his life encompasses all these elements in THE HELIOS RAIN. A similar experience but on a different motif was blended in my medical thriller surrounding a possible cure for Muscular Dystrophy in THE MYOSIN FACTOR. Ever want to reveal the bad side of an employment experience? My years in the pharmaceutical industry witnessed sabotage and some drugs with unacceptable side effects pressured by upper management to sneak by the FDA. THE ADJUSTMENT CLINIC fictionalizes two of these real-life based situations. WHO WILL WEEP FOR ME is my latest crime thriller about a high school classmate who confronted The Boston Strangler in adulthood. I live in San Antonio, Texas spending 5-hours a day on new writing, working with editors and trying to promote my e-books. Encouraging my 8 grandchildren to read and write is as much fun as my own writing efforts. It’s my hope that the reading public will experience the joys and realities of life through my novels.

This is how I got to know him. I was included in his coffee klatch that met every Sunday after Latin Mass by a mutual friend and heard bits and pieces of his incredible WW2 story. One day I approached him about the possibility of going to his house and recording his retelling of the story. I thought it was something that people needed to hear. And I thought there might be a possibility that it would make a great movie or documentary. He agreed and the result is this book The Royce Raid.Vernon was a docent at the World War 2 Museum in New Orleans and could be seen there almost every Wednesday regaling people with his knowledge and his experiences of the Pacific during the War.When we had coffee after church he would often tell us anecdotes of his experiences in the military. I remember always the twinkle in his eye and the way he would point his finger for emphasis. Sometimes his wife Mary Lou would join us along with his son Jay a lawyer at the Orleans Parish district attorney's office.Vernon passed away in 2012 before we were able to get his story on videotape. But we do have it on audio for posterity. After his passing he was honored at the World War 2 Museum.

I want to share the things I have learned about relationships ... what has worked for me and what hasn't worked quite so well! We have so much to give each other and to learn from one another.

I also dreamt of heroes and villains and the women that inspired the best and worst in them.It seemed like every book I read as a teen was a classic bodice-ripper.

Those books are what inspired me to write my own stories, not because I loved them, but because I constantly found myself tossing them aside and fuming. I would think of all the ways the story would have been better: if she had just picked up the sword and stabbed the bad guy when she had the chance...I LOVE writing, and I love the new direction that fiction has taken over the last decade. So many amazing, strong female leads now! And so many new writers that finally have a voice in the indie publishing community.I was blessed with a wonderful husband who supports my passion for writing and reading, and who really helped me focus my desire to publish my work. When I'm not busy enjoying my daughter and husband, I'm usually developing a new story idea, or sneaking in a bit of free time with my favorite authors.I'm a bit of a hermit, they called it being \"shy\" when I was a kid, but I love hearing from fans.

During its lifetime, the placenta fills many roles: it anchors the developing fetus in the womb; serves as its lungs, kidneys, and digestive tract; transfers waste products from the uterus to the mother; and produces hormones that manipulate maternal behavior in a way that benefits the fetus. Loke, an emeritus professor of reproductive immunology at the University of Cambridge, argues that the placenta has much more to offer in addition to these fascinating functions. Understanding placental growth patterns may shed light on the etiology of cancer; it could also help doctors combat the problem of tissue rejection in organ transplant patients. The placenta is even powerful enough to overcome the effects of time, in a way—post-menopausal women can bring a previously fertilized egg to term thanks to the placenta's ability to control endocrine levels. Accessible enough for a general readership, Loke's work provides the key to a truly unique world. 20 b&w illus. & glossary.

She started writing stories at an early age, her first literary influences being Walter Farley, author of the ‘Black Stallion’ series, and Carolyn Keene, of ‘Nancy Drew’ fame.  That’s probably why her earliest efforts involved a young girl detective who solved crime on horseback.  She had a very happy childhood, did well in school, and was a fairly obedient daughter until she went away to college.  The original plan was to major in journalism.  She wrote for the college paper until she realized that wasn’t the kind of writing she wanted to do when she grew up.  So she switched to education.  That was not, perhaps, the smartest move. Then, life happened.  Jobs, rent, husband, baby, another husband, another baby, until she found herself a stay-at-home mom, about to chew her foot off if she had to watch one more episode of ‘Barney.’  So, she started to write again. She still lives in New Jersey with her husband, daughter, two cats and a very spoiled cocker spaniel.  Her older daughter is off in Oregon, fighting the good fight for the homeless.  She loves to cook – and eat – and plays RPG  games on her Xbox when she needs to decompress (Skyrim alone cost her months of her life). During the past few years, she has lost, and tragically found again, the same twenty pounds.  Life is all about trying, failing, and trying harder.  She writes in her downstairs office, surrounded by her growing collection of gargoyles.  Smoke, Wings and Stone in her first YA novel.

Barton is the author of several fast-paced mystery and thriller series, featuring lively characters and lots of action. \"Miz Scarlet\" (Scarlet Wilson Mystery series) is a teacher-turned-innkeeper, who throws herself into danger with a feisty determination to make things right, relying on cohorts like \"Captain Peacock\" and \"Colonel Grey Poupon\" to help her solve the clues. Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans. It's the perfect human storm.\"", "related": ["B00J1QC2KK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 21.0}

Many of my illustrations of bible stories occupied our minds at the breakfast table on mornings when my nine children were young. My education includes an art course in figure drawing during my senior year of High School.         My work appeals especially to young adults I encounter in my travels. While attending college in Hawaii, I spent afternoons at the beach capturing beautiful visions I SAW and felt in nature, with oil pastels.         I studied herbal medicine under Dr. Christopher in the sixties and have found this science indescribably all encompassing in my life to turn around problems related to health, vitality and fulfillment as a woman.

Mmm, yes, I'll take that with some spicy Indian food, if you will.Text-quality is good, we have some really sharp dialog going on here, and some fun situations. At one or two points I felt it was a little rushed, like when our heroine's bra poked her, and her boss came in her office. We just had dialog there and no introduction. There was a couple other scene transitions that jumped a little quickly as well, but nothing really I can go all out and criticize heavily, more writer's style than an error really, and I bring it up because I got that uneasy feeling of being thrown off-balance as a reader. Overall though, a really nice job on the text here, and some really sharp and witty dialog.We have an Indian character too, which is a fun one for lesbian rom-erotica. I always love seeing the interracial lesbian hookups, they are fun and bring a little spice to the mix. The differences in culture, and the Indian culture itself was handled very nicely, so bonus points for that. The juxtaposition of boss and worker also played nicely into this relationship, which gave us another level of conflict and  drama to work with. We also get a girl-loses-girl moment, thank you sweetness! I love seeing this, and then being dragged through those feelings of 'what did I do wrong?' and \"I've messed everything up now!' that I just love reading.", "related": ["B00JDVH97Y"], "rank": 631478, "title": "DRAINING (Girl Crush Series Book 1)", "author": "MIchelle Outlaw", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So, at a very young age he was always very aware of art in his life and was naturally attracted to expressing himself visually. He attended public grade school, high school and college. He also studied at The Art Students League in Manhattan. While still in college he assisted his uncle Charles Santaniello, a sculptor, in creating commercial displays for many New York businesses. And helped produce parts of an exhibit for a Worlds Fair in Europe. It was this time spent working with his uncle that he realized he too wanted to be a sculptor. After graduating college he went to work as a commercial artist. In 1969, after several years at this position he started his own art studio with another artist, this partnership provided the opportunity to produce a wide verity of commercial work. It was at the time he spent at the Art Students league that Sal created his first wire tree sculpture, while constructing an armature to support a clay figure, he noticed that the wire he was using could also be bent, twisted and wrapped to create a tree sculpture. Whether viewed in direct sunlight casting harsh shadows or in soft candle light creating a gentle form, the tree sculptures created by Sal Villano each take on a personality of their own. As in nature, no trees can ever be created alike. All the sculpture of Sal Villano can be viewed at: www.salvillano.com    The following is an on line interview:  http://youtu.be/92UXEqP1kUk", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I began writing short stories when I was six years old, and some of the things I would come up with were quite funny. I overtime grew from originally doing short stories into coming up with ideas to make books out of, but I really didn't think much of it being so young. In 2009 my mom was diagnosed with a malicious thyroid cancer, and they didn't expect her to live. I had to mature very quickly to take care of my younger brother who was only 13, and very incapable of doing anything alone. I wrote this book when I went into a spiraling depression, because of the situation at the time. When I finished this book, I told my mom when she recovered from her illness I would read it to her. It took her about 3 years to recover. She is here though, and supports me all the way. She was the first person to read it, and she is the one who suggested for me to go all the way. I thought the best way to see if it was truly good was to let my friends read it, and they really loved how I kept it intense and then suddenly put a comic relief inside. My goal is give readers something they can really enjoy reading instead of getting bored with the same thing. I hope to maybe one day inspire a young reader who may dream of being an author. Learning from my own experience, I can tell all my readers to not give up on their dream no matter what it is, because I say the sky is the limit so reach for it!", "related": [], "rank": 3378290, "title": "Shadowed Romance With Past Loves (The Vampires Saga Book 1)", "author": "Kayla Petty", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She was told by her white professor that black girls don't major in English at a major, big top ten university and that she should go back to Gary, Indiana, and marry a steel-mill worker. She called her dad, crying, and told him. \"What does this man look like\" he asked. She described him, and her father said, \"Doesn't sound like Jesus to me\" and hung up on her. She knew he left her one option: to stay and finish. And she did, with English honors, the only minority in any of her courses. At one time, there were four of the six Poole children on Bloomington's campus, at the same time pursing their higher education. The value their parents placed on education netting over twelve college degrees from their offspring. Pretty darn good for two people who used to pick cotton! Ms. Mason was first African American deputy commander in Germany. She was Woman of Year and awarded the Command Civilian Award for Valor. She is the recipient of the Dr. Martin Luther King Award, Joint Meritorious Award, Hidden Hero Award, Air Force Angel Award. Ms. Mason speaks four foreign languages to include Spanish, French, German, and Korean. She has lived in England, Korea, and Germany (2).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I grew up on the Black Mountain north of Swansea, South Wales. I haven't really got a clue how this influenced my writing except I suppose, it instilled in me a great love of nature, adventure and the outdoors. I am the son of an elite collier and I would much rather take this opportunity to dedicate this great and pertinent poem to his memory: \"My father was a miner, He worked deep underground; The rush of drams and clanking chains. They were his daily sounds. He worked so far below the ground. Where coal was hewed by pick,  The work so hard and wages small He didn’t dare go sick. He crawled upon his belly. In drifts so low and narrow, The wind it whistled down the shaft. It chilled him to the marrow. He ate his food from a Tommy box, Shaped like a slice of bread, While squatting down upon the ground, Where spit and crumbs were shed. His water, it was in a Jack, to wet down clouds of dust, That gathered daily in his throat and lungs. Where it formed a deadly crust. We would listen for his footsteps, He then came into sight: This man, our Dad, as black as black, just like the darkest night; Right down his back white rivers ran amongst the dirt and grime, But you cannot wash away blue scars. That you get down the mine. Years now have passed. My father gone, But I am proud to say, My Father was a miner, until his dying day.” by William Holden", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this particular 1888 London, Babylon is another world, a relic of the Mesopotamian city, which the priestesses of Ishtar rule, though their power is waning on Earth, mostly because of the plots of the Black Order to destroy the rule of sex. Yet the priestesses remain a force to be reckoned with. When Maddy's parents discover that she has volunteered to become a novice of Babylon, they forbid her; she and fellow would-be novice Cliticia run away to the ancient ruins of Babylon under the auspices of Lord Azrael and Mr. Malachi, who are involved with the Black Order. While the girls fantasize about forbidden love, they are embroiled in the plot to destroy Babylon and its women, once and for all. Calder's re-imagined Victorian world is stellar, and his teen protagonists are both terribly alien and all-too recognizable in their dreams and relationships. Calder continues to write wild stories that resonate long after they're read.Regina SchroederCopyright © American Library Association.

Daniel Ash has no idea what they mean, but he’s sure they are key to defeating Project Eden. His only hope is that he’s able to figure out the secret in time.The survivors on Isabella Island are surrounded by death, and need to get off the island before the flu can claim them, too. But there are not enough boats at the resort to get everyone to safety. The only solution involves a risky trip to the mainland that may be even more dangerous than remaining on the island.In Mumbai, Sanjay’s friends watch as the Project Eden survival station is abandoned. Curious, they search the facility once everyone has left. They expect to find very little, and at first they are right. But only at first.Ben Bowerman’s search for his girlfriend, Martina Gable, takes him to the only place left he thinks she can be. When he gets there, he’s hurled into the unexpected, where he begins to see the truth of what is really going on, and knows if he doesn’t do something drastic, his days are numbered.And in an idyllic town covered by a blanket of snow, all is quiet. Except for the rotating squad of soldiers who watch and wait for a problem they believe becomes more and more unlikely as each day passes.

Young Holt couldn't bear to cut out any of his perfect western, so he threw it away and started writing another one. A draft notice interrupted his plans to become the next Zane Grey or Louis L'Amour. A tour of duty as an MP stationed in South Korea was pretty much the usual MP stuff except for the time he nabbed a North Korean spy and had to talk the dimwitted desk sergeant out of letting the guy go. A briefcase stuffed with drawings of U.S. aircraft and the like only caused the overstuffed lifer behind the counter to rub his fat face, blink his bewildered eyes, and start eating a big candy bar to console himself. Imagine Van Holt's surprise a few days later when he heard that same dumb sergeant telling a group of new admirers how he himself had caught the famous spy one day when he was on his way to the mess hall. Holt says there hasn't been too much excitement since he got out of the army, unless you count the time he was attacked by two mean young punks and shot one of them in the big toe. Holt believes what we need is punk control, not gun control. After traveling all over the West and Southwest in an aging Pontiac, Van Holt got tired of traveling the day he rolled into Tucson and he has been there ever since, still dreaming of becoming the next Zane Grey or Louis L'Amour when he grows up. Or maybe the next great mystery writer. He likes to write mysteries when he's not too busy writing westerns or eating Twinkies. Warning: Reading a Van Holt western may make you want to get on a horse and hunt some bad guys down in the Old West. Of course, the easiest and most enjoyable way to do it is vicariously—by reading another Van Holt western. Van Holt writes westerns the way they were meant to be written.", "related": ["B00J1IN4B4"], "rank": 2052455, "title": "Six-Gun Showdown eBook", "author": "Van Holt", "category": "History", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.6667, "rating_total": 28.0}

Over the years he produced everything from teen TV programs, to aerobics shows, to cooking shows, to live sports, and music shows. From TV he moved on to a short stint as a campaign manager. Then he moved on to his current profession as a financial advisor. Over the years he's taught television production at the local community college, and continues to produce and direct commercials. Rick currently lives in Central California with his two dogs, where he enjoys cooking, traveling, and writing. He is known to crank up the volume and attempt to play his guitar, but has yet to learn a complete song. He is obsessive about going to the gym, Fresno State Football, and NFL RedZone. Rick was influenced by growing up watching Hammer Horror films, classic James Whale pictures like Frankenstein, and reading Marvel Comic's, before moving on to Stephen King, Anne Rice, and Clive Barker. More recently he finds himself reading Chelsea Cain F. Paul Wilson, , James Rollins, Stieg Larsson, Val McDermid, and Lee Child.
