Prim-and-proper Carrie has just turned down a calculated proposal from one of San Francisco's elite, full-figured Rose has just been dumped for a thinner woman, and sex-obsessed Vanessa is just looking for a little distraction. Scenarios that could easily have been trod with reckless sexual abandon, however, give way to sweet, sensual, empowered stories enveloped in heady romance. Andre scores with her subtle use of Napa Valley food, wine and atmosphere, making her stories that much more delicious. Unfortunately, they all follow the same structure, and it quickly becomes clear that each woman is playing for keeps, not a roll in the hay. Though her erotic possibilities are hedged in by the spicy-but-safe formula, and readers may lose interest before they can finish their second helping, Andre provides some escapist fare for sentimental genre fans.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her pace didn't slacken. She was a pint-sized dynamo whizzing past customers.\"I don't think twenty-five is a milestone,\" Sara responded, rolling her eyes at Denise's exaggeration.\"Girl, you'd better celebrate it. How many women are twenty-five years old, a professor and no lame man hanging on?\" Naomi stepped outside of their entourage to throw out her question, as Sara, who was bringing up the rear, passed her.\"I'm not tenured,\" Sara corrected. This was her first semester and there were no guarantees in the collegiate world. Like anyplace else, climbing the ladder partially depended on office politics.\"Whatever! Only you highbrowed people know the difference. We, mere mortals, will continue to call you Professor Lovell.\" Naomi grinned with extra  effort  since  her  braces  had  only  been removed two days ago.They arrived in the women's department, not too quietly. Sara followed the direction of their scrutiny and finger-pointing, trying to catch the gist of their discussion. Her sorors were always up to something. Why did she think her birthday would be any different among these mischief-makers? But she'd be on the lookout for any pranks.\"Ooh, I like this.\" Naomi held up a little black dress.\"Is that the entire dress or is that only the skirt?\" Sara asked, concerned with the choice. \"You like to show your skin. I don't.\"\"You're right. This little number would look good with my long, shapely legs.\" Naomi spun in front of the three-sided mirror. With a manicured hand on one hip and a haughty raise of her chin, she erupted in a fit of giggles.\"At least those legs would be good for something,\" Denise added, with a smirk. \"I sure enough lost a pretty penny on your lazy behind in the last basketball game. The coach should've left you on the bench.\" Denise stood behind Naomi's still form, fearlessly sizing her up with open disgust.Sara foresaw the potential conflict that always ignited without much provocation. She stepped toward Naomi, removed the black dress from her iron grip and set it on the rack with other unwanted items. Then she propelled her friend out of the dressing room to another area of the women's department to cool off.\"Don't take on Denise. You know that she's always in a bad mood after she loses money.\"Her friend's budding pro basketball career wasn't exactly taking off in the right direction. Sara empathized with her soror. One thing she'd learned the hard way was how to shoot for the stars, but end up sitting in dirt.\"Hey, Sara, I found a great pantsuit.\"Sara looked over at Asia standing next to her twin, Athena, who held up a navy blue pantsuit. The tailored cut was flattering. And how could she pass up the added bonus to wear pants, her clothing item of choice?Asia handed off the suit to Sara, who headed for the dressing room again.\"I've got several blouses to go with this.\" Sara changed into the pantsuit. The jacket's cut enhanced her figure, as she expected it would. It had a longer hem that covered her well-padded behind. Although not fond of full pants legs, she did like the comfortable fabric of these that didn't cling to her thighs.She stepped out into the open area to model. \"I really like this.\" The darker shade complemented her toasty brown coloring.\"Good!\" her friends answered in chorus.Sara laughed. They'd often criticized her inability to make a quick decision. This impromptu trip did manage to improve her mood, considering that she awoke today feeling a bit bummed. The year had not been one for celebration when the highlight was a botched wedding ceremony.Her sorors made quick business of paying for the outfit. Back at her condo, each woman found a chair and noisily flopped dramatically into the seat, as if they had just completed a marathon.Sara, seemingly the lone survivor, stood and looked over the four women with whom she'd pledged six years ago. Her line sisters in Xi Theta Sigma were as close to her as blood relatives. Their pledge line, called Ladies of Distinction, consisted of all sophomores. After completion of their pledge process and the ensuing bonding experiences, she thought the line name more aptly described what they strived for in their post-university lives.Sara headed to the kitchen for refreshments. The party wasn't due to begin for another four hours, enough time for all of them to laze and get rejuvenated. They were known to dance until the houselights came up at more than a few nightclubs.\"What's the final number for the party?\" Denise questioned, popping her gum with annoying frequency.\"I got forty, but about fifteen didn't respond. People can be so rude. Anyway, I ordered enough food for about forty-five.\" Sara flipped through her writing pad with pages of copious notes and other details. \"Let me go to my laptop. I've an Excel file with additional notes.\"\"Stop agonizing,\" Naomi wailed. \"You make my head ache, rehashing nit-picking details. No one can control how much people will eat. When the food is done, well, then, it's done.\"\"Don't worry, Sara. We're following up on the big and little items,\" Denise reassured.Sara sighed, reluctantly closing her writing pad. \"Thanks, guys, I'm a basket case. I'm looking forward to the party, despite feeling gun-shy about the idea earlier.\" Sara sat next to Denise and leaned her head against her soror's shoulder. \"Not much to celebrate this year, I'm afraid. I'm on the loser trail when it comes to men.\"\"You're exaggerating, soror.\" Denise patted her cheek.\"No, she's not,\" Naomi objected. \"First, she breaks up with her college sweetheart, a.k.a. soul mate. Then she breaks up with her husband-to-be at the altar.\" Naomi shook her head, clicking her tongue. She twirled her finger around the ends of her braided hair.\"She didn't break up with her soul mate. He walked away from her. And, she didn't have a choice about the wedding, not with his pregnant girlfriend in the audience making a big stink,\" Athena stated, reciting the list of events without emotion, as if she read a shopping list.\"Thank you, Frick and Frack, for boosting my self-esteem before my birthday party.\" Sara waved aside their apologies and retreated to her bedroom.Through the walls, she heard Denise scold Athena for her thoughtlessness.\"My bad,\" Athena replied in her typical droll manner.\"Sorry, Sara!\" Naomi yelled.Sara was more embarrassed than angry. Fake Prince-Charming types had worn out their welcome in her life. She only wanted to enjoy her party with her friends and sorority sisters.Jackson Thomas searched the nearby parking lot in the complex for a space, but had no luck. He headed toward another distant area, keeping an eye out for signs that allowed visitor parking. The overhead streetlights didn't illuminate the lot very well. Walking a little farther, if he had to, didn't bother him, since he hoped the extra minutes calmed his nerves. He didn't believe in blind luck, but tonight he certainly accepted this symbol as his four-leaf clover.As he drew closer to the dimly lit community room, boisterous party-goers walked in and out of the building. Music pulsated out of the windows and door. Heavy beats from the latest R&B; hit spilled into the outdoor night air.Jackson slowed. His nerves sapped the energy from his legs. Doubts held his will in a mind-numbing grip. He wished that he'd brought one of his buddies to bolster his flagging courage as he tried to face his past. He took out a handkerchief and wiped his damp forehead. All over, his skin prickled  with  sweat  to  complete  his  body's reaction to the tension.\"Hey, Jackson.\"Jackson  sharply  turned  toward  the  voice. Denise waved at him, grinning with obvious enjoyment at his startled expression. \"Didn't mean to startle you. Don't worry, I'm not springing her on you. Your girl's chatting in the back. Asia and Athena have her in an in-depth conversation about the top African-American literary authors of all time. You know that's right up her alley. She's on a roll. The twins probably can't wait for you to show up and save them.\"Jackson smiled, took a deep breath and headed for the door. He paused, then turned. \"Denise, thanks for inviting me. I've wanted to visit—keep in touch—for a long time. You gave me a break. I couldn't pass up this opportunity to see Sarafina. Maybe even ask for another chance, or something like that…\" His voice died under the uncertainty.\"That's our sister in there. You've hurt her once. Do it again, and I'll personally hunt you down.\" Denise waved away his protest. \"Go. Don't waste time talking to me.\" She turned, and headed back into the building.Jackson acted on Denise's advice and sped up his entry. The large room was like a sauna, with the warmth and humidity. The area was populated with small table-and-chair sets already occupied with guests. Unaware of the party's formality, he wore a jacket over a polo shirt. Jackson shrugged out of his jacket and slung it over his arm.He weaved through the party crowd. Frankly, no one else mattered. There was only one person he cared to see. So far, he couldn't locate her in the crowded room.\"Hi J.T.!\"A familiar young woman with a pile of micro-braids seemingly exploding from the top of her head nudged his arm.\"Naomi, good to see you,\" he shouted over the music, exchanging a warm hug with her.\"Go past that column. She's over at the bar. Hurry!\" Naomi shoved him.\"Good to see you, too,\" he managed to reply, although the music probably drowned his words.He rounded the column with a slower approach. As much as he couldn't wait to see Sarafina, he didn't want to run blindly into her, either. Knowing how her sorority sisters operated, he was sure that they hadn't prepared her for his appearance.\"Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Look who's here.\" Jackson froze as Asia's piercing scream drew s...", "related": ["B00D1B4CTA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Despite the fact that NASD arbitration can become a career-defining, or even career-ending event, many Registered Representatives are unaware of exposures they may have in their current practice and how this system actually works. While concerns surrounding NASD arbitration continue to grow, there is still a lack of solid, clear, and helpful information on this most vital of topics. That's why Thomas Hine, with the help of John Brubaker, decided to write NASD Arbitration Solution.While those who've faced NASD arbitration usually avoid discussing their experiences because of the taboo nature of the subject, financial professional and 4th degree black belt Thomas Hine has not. Throughout these pages, he shares the lessons learned from his twenty-one month NASD arbitration ordeal and reveals how he relied on five simple but powerful principles—which were part of his more than twenty years of martial arts training—to build and protect his wealth advisory practice along the way. This definitive resource brings NASD compliance issues to life as never before and shows you how to simultaneously protect and grow a financial services practice, and, if necessary, deal with a well-intentioned system that has become increasingly hostile and adversarial.Divided into three comprehensive parts—My NASD Arbitration from Start to Finish, Five Black Belt Principles to Protect and Grow Your Financial Services Practice, and How to Prevail in an NASD Arbitration Hearing—this book:Completely details Hine's journey through arbitration, from pre-hearing preparation, testifying under oath, and cross-examination to closing arguments and the arbitration panel's dramatic final decisionClarifies each of the five \"Black Belt\" principles used by Hine and demonstrates how you can apply them in the development of a prosperous, ethically sound, client-focused financial services practiceProvides those who are brought into NASD arbitration with expert knowledge, a clear step-by-step plan of action, and easy-to-use tools to effectively defend themselvesGives an insider's view of NASD arbitration from a top practicing attorneyAnd much moreIncreasingly complex financial products, the implementation of stricter regulations, and the speed of real time business pose serious risks to even the most seasoned of Registered Representatives. To navigate this tough terrain, discover an approach based on the universal principles of humility, integrity, duality, awareness, and dedication—and use it to strengthen your practice and, if necessary, overcome the challenges that are an inevitable part of the arduous NASD arbitration process.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Those in favor of its medical use point to the apparent safety of this ancient and \"natural\" remedy, the profusion of anecdotal and survey-based evidence of marijuana's effectiveness, and the importance in today's culture of personal choice. This view has been expressed at the ballot box since November 1996 by referendums in several states. Those opposed, troubled by this potential gateway to serious drug abuse, especially among adolescents, regard acceptance of the medical use of marijuana as the camel's nose under the tent, legitimizing a dangerous relaxation of the nation's \"war on drugs.\" Both sides come from all age groups and levels of society, and both claim their own scientific evidence.In this rancorous climate of claim and counterclaim, both physicians and policy makers seek rational solutions based on credible evidence. Since 1986, basic science has helped enormously with discoveries of potent cannabinoid agonists; specific cannabinoid receptors and the correlation between their concentration in brain centers and their relevant functions; endogenous or natural substances that act on those receptors; and more recently, specific cannabinoid antagonists. Regrettably, societal concerns have focused attention on drug abuse rather than on the promise of drug development. Hence, a thorough scientific exposition of the medical value of marijuana would be welcome. But this book disappoints.Marihuana and Medicine, edited by a veteran in the field, New York University's Gabriel Nahas, and his colleagues, stems from the latest (March 1998) of several international conferences held since 1974. In the preface, Nahas states that \"today the verdict of marihuana in medicine is finally at hand.\" In the last of 71 chapters by 109 authors, he concludes that \"marihuana or THC [(Delta)9-tetrahydrocannabinol] do not qualify as safe and effective medications... [and] have no place in modern pharmacopeia,\" despite the interesting potential of cannabinoids described by several of the clinicians who have contributed to the book. Nahas does acknowledge that the \"invaluable information\" provided by the experimental use of THC and its synthetic analogues has facilitated \"a better understanding of membrane signal transduction.\" It can be anticipated that there will be much to mine from research when its emphasis and funding shift from drug abuse to evidence-based medical use.Structurally, this book is flawed by its dependence on annoyingly brief contributions by so many of the authorities who participated in the two-day conference. Figures that were projected as slides and embellished by the conference's speakers often lack legends to assist the reader. Instead of critical editing, there are summary reports of previous conferences and reprinted articles, which add mostly outmoded data or opinions. Unbridled redundancy abounds, whether it concerns the history of marijuana use and regulation or the receptor story. Acronyms go unexplained, the index is incomplete, and there are scores of typographic errors. Organized progression through the chapters is frequently interrupted, too often by material unrelated to the medical use of marijuana.Some parts of the book are valuable. Though scattered and repetitious, the historical information is interesting. The reference lists after each chapter are extraordinarily complete, with many citations from the 1970s. The new chapters begin with helpful abstracts. Parts of the book should appeal to pharmacologists, particularly as a source of references. Molecular neurobiologists will generally be less gratified. Yet there are recognized, contemporary scientists among the contributors, including Mechoulam, Devane, and Glaser (on pharmacology), Pertwee (on receptors and their ligands), Gardner and Hiroi (on the activation of dopamine receptors to induce genes involved in brain reward systems), and Sutin and Nahas (on the interactions of THC with other drugs and anesthetics). Although conclusions about immune suppression by cannabinoids seem premature, if not unfounded, the chapters on the pathophysiology of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems offer useful material. Paria and colleagues offer original data suggesting that activation of embryonic CB1 receptors by natural and synthetic ligands interferes with preimplantation development in embryonic mice. Parker and Zuckerman convincingly demonstrate that marijuana use during pregnancy is associated with impaired fetal growth and lower birth weight and that those effects are magnified by unhealthy lifestyles.Perhaps the book's most compact and yet comprehensive chapter -- and guide to potential drug development -- is provided by Lichtman and Martin, who focus on the receptor-mediated analgesic properties of THC and endogenous anandamide in animals and humans. They suggest coadministration of these compounds with opioids to escape the side effects of either agent and even pharmaceutical manipulation of the endogenous cannabinoid system to relieve pain. In a subsequent chapter, Clark describes an experiment in which habitual users smoked marijuana during the second of three months' surveillance in a research facility. Both the subjects' ability to discriminate among thermal stimuli of different intensities and the response bias (which reflects attitudinal and emotional factors that influence reporting bias, or responses based on expectation) were measured. Marijuana at low doses appeared to create both better discrimination among graded stimuli and hyperalgesia. Higher doses had no effect on the amount of pain experienced. Such sensory decision-theory models recognize the emotional side of pain and are recommended for future studies of analgesia. And analgesia has commercial value.Practicing physicians will gain most from six well-referenced chapters that address therapy for specific symptoms. Green dismisses cannabinoids for the treatment of glaucoma, despite their effectiveness in reducing intraocular pressure through aqueous outflow pathways; perhaps receptor-independent substances that are structurally related, such as HU211, will be proved neuroprotective. Gralla elaborates on one of the two approved uses of dronabinol (a synthetic THC): control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, for which very effective serotonin-receptor antagonists with dexamethasone are superior therapy. He also forecasts the potential for neurokinin-receptor antagonists. Consroe summarizes the rationale for their use and the largely anecdotal evidence that cannabinoids relieve muscle spasticity in multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury.In dealing with therapy for the cachexia associated with AIDS, the other approved use of cannabinoids, Timpone and colleagues carefully compare dronabinol and megestrol acetate therapy; the latter in high doses was critical for any weight gain, even though both drugs increased appetite in placebo-controlled trials. Negrete and Gill warn of troubling negative effects of marijuana in persons with schizophrenia.The book ends with brief attention to public policy and with repetition of the editors' conclusion that THC \"deregulates the physiological signaling role of a receptor protein to which it binds and of the membrane bilipid layer which it permeates. This deregulation of membrane signaling will result in discordant and partial therapeutic effects coupled with unwanted side effects.\" One can agree that, to date, drugs more effective than cannabinoids have prevailed. But the editors' drug-control bias obscures the promise of drug development.Reviewed by John A. Benson, Jr., M.D.Copyright © 1999 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.

That's all.'The man slid up the tailgate and dusted off his big hands.'Bien, mademoiselle.There are just a few boxes left in the attic now; nothing that can go in a Paris saleroom, I'm afraid. Perhaps a local firm, abrocante?Anna nodded, absent-mindedly scuffing the dusty gravel with the toe of her little green ballet pump, then stopping abruptly. She'd spent too long in tatty espadrilles hanging around with the GreenPlanet gang—she'd almost forgotten how to behave in proper clothes.She straightened up and smiled apologetically at the removal man. His face softened. He'd worked for Paris's top auction house for a good many years now, so by rights nothing should surprise him any more. Aristocrats were an eccentric lot, and English aristocrats were the oddest of all, but Lady Roseanna Delafield was like no one he had ever come across before. With her silky black hair shot through with pink streaks and her quick, graceful ballerina's movements, she was like a pedigree kitten who had got lost and gone feral. Today her hair was caught back in a discreet knot at the nape of her neck, she was wearing a little black linen shift dress that made her skin glow like sun-kissed apricots and she looked for all the world like any other smart young lady of breeding, but nothing could quite disguise the vulnerability in those big dark eyes.'Bon chance, ma petite,' he said kindly, climbing into the driver's seat of his lorry. 'Is sad to say goodbye to somewhere where we 'ave been appy, no?'Anna shrugged sadly. 'Yes. But maybe it's not goodbye just yet. You never know…'Leaning out of the window the man laughed. 'Miracles do 'appen,chérie.I 'ope you find one.' He started the engine and winked at her. 'You deserve it.Au revoir.'Anna watched the van disappear round the bend in the drive, through the pine trees, then she turned and walked slowly back into the château. Inside the hot, late summer air was heavy with the smell of decay and her eyes travelled desolately around the once-splendid entrance hall. The duck-egg-blue silk that lined the walls was rotting and torn; pale squares were left where the men had taken down the paintings and darker patches showed the ravages of damp.Her little low-heeled shoes echoed on the leaf-strewn floor as she walked slowly up the stairs. Above her, miraculously the stained glass dome was still intact and at that moment a shaft of afternoon sunlight sent shimmering pools of light on to the stairs. She smiled, remembering how she used to love trying to catch those rippling rainbows as a child, and how they used to fall in vivid splashes on the white bride's dress she'd got for her birthday that summer when she'd played the wedding game.That last summer before her mother had died.She jumped as her mobile phone rang, and slid it out of her bag.'Fliss, I'm on my way. The auctioneer people just left, so I'm just going to lock up and leave.''OK, honey, I'll order you a very strong Martini.' Fliss's voice was warm with compassion and understanding. 'Are you getting the bus?''No. One of the guys in the GreenPlanet camp has a bike I can borrow. It's only a few miles.'From the other end of the phone Fliss gave a snort of laughter. 'You're joking, right? Anna,no onehas ever arrived at the Hotel Paradisby bike.Are you going to get it valet parked?'Stamping up a narrower flight of stairs to the attic, Anna scowled. 'Don't be silly. I don't see why I should pump carbon monoxide into the atmosphere just to keep the parking valets at the Paradis in tips.''OK, OK, spare me the environmental lecture.' The laughter died in Fliss's voice, leaving her sounding suddenly subdued. 'Talking of which, how's life in the GreenPlanet camp? Have you finished saving the world for the rest of us yet?'Anna wandered over to the forlorn stack of boxes and old trunks the men had left piled in the middle of the dusty attic. 'We're still working on it,' she said stiffly, lifting the lid of a metal-banded trunk at her feet and finding herself looking down at a jumble of old clothes. 'Saving Château Belle-Eden from this…this vile property developer would be a good start, though.''Well, if word in our office is correct and the “vile property developer” in questionisAngelo Emiliani you don't stand a cat in hell's chance of saving it,' Fliss retorted, then, hearing Anna's soft gasp, said, 'Anna? What's the matter?''Nothing. I've just found my old dressing-up box. All my ballet stuff is in here—my first pointe shoes.' Reverently she wound the trailing ribbons around the tattered slippers, then slowly pulled out a crushed tumble of heavy cream satin from the depths of the trunk. 'The wedding dress!'Anna held the dress out at arm's length, gazing wonderingly at it. She'd thought it was so perfect, but now she could see how home-made it looked, how obvious that it had been inexpertly cut down from one of Grandmère's gowns and trimmed withmismatched bits salvaged from other garments. The fabric had yellowed with age and was spotted with mildew in places. Wedging the phone against her shoulder, she held the dress up against her and twirled slowly around.'To think I truly believedthismade me look like a real bride,' she said vaguely. 'A fairy princess…I must have been spectacularly naïve…'That was an understatement.Abruptly she tore the dress away from her body and dropped it back into the box. 'Anyway,' she continued briskly, 'like I said, there's nothing left for me to do here. I'm on my way.''Great. I'll be in the terrace bar, provided we can get a table. Don't forget it's Saskia Middleton's twenty-first tonight too, so wear something suitable. Youarewearing something suitable, aren't you?' Fliss added, sounding worried. 'Only I haven't quite got over the puffball-skirt-and-biker-boots combo from Lucinda's party at Christmas. Her poor mother didn't know what to say.'Anna glanced down at the subdued black dress. 'Don't panic, I'm looking deeply respectable,' she said ruefully. 'And it's entirely in your honour, as I have absolutely no intention of going to Saskia Middleton's party. I'd rather spend an evening with Lucretia Borgia and Hannibal Lecter. But go and grab a table on the terrace and get those Martinis ordered. I'll be there in fifteen minutes.'Hanging up before Fliss could argue about the party, Anna turned back to the wedding dress, stroking her hand over the slippery satin.How much had changed since that long ago summer, when she had thought that life was simple.Nothing was simple. Nothing was what she'd thought it was.Herself included.The château was just about all that was left of that old life. And that, she thought fiercely, standing up and walking quicklyacross the room and down the stairs, was why she had no intention of letting it go without a fight. It was nothing whatsoever to do with any lingering fantasies about white dresses and wedding bells, but her mother was dead, her dreams were broken, her own sense of who she was shaken to the core.Thatwas why she had to hang on to the last shreds of the person she used to think she was.A door slammed below.Crossing the landing, Anna stopped dead. A little gust of air seemed to shiver through the building, then everything sank back into stillness. But the atmosphere had changed. There was a charge in the air, like electricity before a storm, and with a pulse of horrified certainty Anna knew she was no longer alone in the house.She froze and then, with agonizing caution, tiptoed to the top of the stairs.For a long moment there was no sound at all.Then, with a mounting sense of panic, she heard footsteps moving across the hall. Instinctively she recognized them as male: slow, measured and sounding like the footsteps of the axe-murderer in every horror film she'd ever seen.The footsteps stopped.Forcing herself to lean forward, she tentatively peered over the banisters, then drew back with a sharp intake of breath.She was right.He was male. Very male. And very blond. Perhaps it was just because she was looking down on him from directly above that he seemed to have the broadest shoulders she'd ever seen.'Hello?'His voice was deep and faintly accented. He didn't sound like a murderer. He sounded gorgeous. Anna swallowed. The ability to speak had inexplicably deserted her, but the pounding of her heart seemed to echo through the whole building, declaring her presence with every beat.'Who's there?'She opened her mouth but the only sound that came out was a dry croak.There was a muttered curse from below. 'All right then, I'll come up.'Oh, God. She was being utterly ridiculous and in a moment he—whoever he was—was going to come up and see her cowering on the landing like some frightened animal. Drawing herself up to her full five foot three inches, she smoothed down the slightly creased linen of her dress. 'Don't bother,' she called, clenching her fists into balls of determination and desperately trying to assume an air of insouciance. She moved to the top of the stairs and began to descend.Halfway down she steeled herself to glance down at him and had to grip the banister to stop herself from falling. There was a roaring of blood in her ears and a dizzying surge of adrenalin flooded her body.The man who stood at the foot of the stairs was her fantasy made flesh. For a moment time seemed to stand still and the years melt away, until she could have easily believed that she was ten years old again, a ragged bouquet of forget-me-nots and roses clasped in her hands, sweeping down the stairs to meet her hero. He was there, just as she had imagined him so many times.Only his silver-blue eyes weren't filled with adoration.They were icy cold.'Gesù,who the hell are you?'Angelo Emiliani was aware of the hostility in his tone and didn't...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He sets out to discuss issues like God's judgment versus God's mercy, God's declared hatred of sinners versus God's declared love of sinners, God's omniscience versus statements about God \"forgetting.\" However, this exploration lacks the sort of precise thinking such topics deserve. Several chapters discuss the difficulty of God's foreknowledge, but Lucas's conclusions don't really help sort out that paradox's innate tension. Several of the other paradoxes are not true paradoxes at all, such as the instruction to Christians to be both innocent and shrewd. His interpretation of scripture is disappointingly flat, interpreting wisdom proverbs as \"commands,\" and allowing no notion that Jesus' teaching might be used as a critique on some of the ideas in the Old Testament. Several of his theological conclusions are disturbing that God's love is in fact conditional, or that while we are called to forgive our own enemies, we are called to hate God's enemies: \"In the end, we apparently have no choice but to reject those who have rejected God.\" The book could be valuable to spark discussion, as each section concludes with a set of questions, but it does not fulfill the potential of its interesting premise.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This sequel picks up as Whit manages to save his captured sister from public execution. On the run from \"The One Who Is The One\" (the evil ruler of this apocalyptic world), the siblings' recently discovered magical powers are their only hope of finding their rebel cohorts and escaping capture and certain death. Once safe for the moment, Whit becomes preoccupied with finding his murdered girlfriend in the Shadowlands and jotting poetry/spells in his magic journal. Wisty practices her power of controlling fire while dabbling in an occasional musical performance and exploring a budding romance with the drummer of a popular rebel rock band. There is no real safe haven for these siblings, though, and they find themselves imprisoned once again by \"The One\" with only a would-be traitor holding their key to escape. The action is relentless and there are too many close calls to count in this supernatural suspense thriller. The narration alternates between brother and sister, which, particularly in these very short chapters, can be confusing. Patterson's trademark mastery of gruesome and terrifying imagery makes this otherwise dull tale come alive a bit as readers are whisked at breakneck speed toward a culmination with no resolution. This sequel can stand alone, but is unlikely to draw new readers into the series.-Tara Kehoe, Plainsboro Public Library, NJ (c) Copyright 2010.

Joanna works for a venture capital firm and is hungry for something exciting to happen to her.

This million-pound production, with some of Britain's finest actors was released at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991.His extensive esoteric works are said to be the largest collection in the produced by a living author. He has written over 100 books and his list of audio tapes extends to include 400 live lectures given around the world.His books are now being translated into the 7 European languages.Douglas Baker has led the field in esoteric astrology, producing with a team, his magnum opus, a Dictionary of Astrology for the 21st Century in three volumes. This is in addition to the already existing 11 volume set of text books on the same subject.His most recent production is a comprehensive video course on Esoteric Astrology which explores the impact of astrology on all aspects of life and consciousness in a new and unique fashion, full of relevance to the modern and future world.He is presently engaged in research work extending the discovereis in the field of Occult Chemistry, particularly dwelling on background radiation and special characteristics of the carbon atom and the role it plays in organic chemistry. He is also looking into the esoteric factors related to weightessness in space physiology.His previous research into the Akashic Records is well know and documented. These have produced compelling answers to such mysteries as the true authorship of the works of Shakespeare.", "related": [], "rank": 1654985, "title": "Paracelsus - His Methods of Healing", "author": "Dr. Douglas M.

The book might be best used as a supplement to the numerous--and important--guides on parenting from physicians and other credible sources. Dean and Gorno (who work in sales/marketing and healthcare, respectively) cover everything from the joys of jogging with your baby, to letting your baby cry her or himself to sleep, to teething, to eliminating pacifiers. Most topics get one page, and Dean and Gorno employ the \"we\" perspective quite often. A considerable amount of their advice addresses partner relationship issues, such as what to do when parents have conflicting views on childrearing. Although this should by no means serve as a parent's only guide to raising a child--lines like \"recent research shows\" mingle with more credible sourcing--it's a personable book that could quell new parent anxiety.  --Publishers Weekly (On First Edition)", "related": [], "rank": 2199293, "title": "100 Things I Wish I Knew in Baby's First Year eBook", "author": "Lorri  Gorno", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Throughout my career, I've been passionate about leadership. I've had the opportunity to explore the secrets of effective leaders, from how they create a compelling vision to how they sweat the small stuff, from how they make tough decisions to how they navigate a difficult conversation, from how they inspire to what makes them perspire. I've had the enormous privilege of working with leaders in over 200 organizations in the public, private, and non-profit sectors. Along the way, I've learned that nearly anyone can be effective in a leadership role, should you choose that path. You're not \"born\" a leader, you develop skills that increase your effectiveness. My mission became to discover exactly what successful leaders do, and share what I learn with others who want to make a difference. There are several ways I do this: 1. I'm a leadership coach, working one-to-one with executives, managers, supervisors and team leaders. 2. I design and facilitate team-building events for leaders and their staff. 3. I design and conduct leadership academies and workshops. 4. I write practical leadership books, articles, and posts on the Leadership Almanac blog, which I founded in 2008. I'm based in San Diego, and serve clients throughout the United States and Canada. My personal passions include photography, playing the keyboard, and bicycling.

The United States, Great Britain, Spain and Australia have already been hit. Dwight Hamilton, principal author and editor of this remarkable book, rhetorically asks, \"Who's next?\" Perhaps, with inside knowledge, or professional clairvoyance, he was anticipating the apprehension of \"the Toronto 17,\" the Canadian Muslims who were arrested in Ontario last month on charges of plotting terrorist activity within Canada. It was widely predicted that Inside Canadian Intelligence would never see the light of day. Besides Hamilton, a journalist, its main contributors are three former highly placed members of the Canadian security and intelligence community. The results are an informative and revealing study of the intricate and at times Byzantine multiple structures that have been put in place in a large number of different federal departments and agencies to apprehend and counter terrorist activity at home and abroad. Ex-security officials Kostas Rimsa and John Thompson each contributed four or five chapters. Former Winnipegger Robert Matas, national correspondent with the Globe and Mail, has added an enlightening chapter on the Air India bombings and the failures of the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service (CSIS) and the RCMP in their handling of the investigation and prosecution of the suspected perpetrators. Readers will be fascinated by the substantial detail revealed and the lucid explanations provided of the murky world of intelligence and security. The information is up to date as of February of this year. They will also appreciate the authors' lament and frustration that their warnings of clear and present dangers are generally falling on deaf ears of politicians, commentators and the public at large, who seem to be either unaware or unconcerned. The particular Canadian political psyche provides a soft underbelly for terrorist elements -- foreign and domestic -- who would do us harm. According to Hamilton and colleagues, the barriers to effective surveillance and apprehension are: A prevailing lack of political will. Chronic under-funding. Bilingualism policies that have excellent candidates for senior intelligence work passed over because they don't speak French (although they speak eight other languages). Lax immigration policies and practices (there are currently over 200,000 illegal aliens in Canada). Privacy laws that inhibit personal investigations. An oversensitivity to Charter of Rights concerns. In these things, the authors say, we have fallen far behind the Americans, the British and the Australians in the misguided belief that it can't happen here. The authors propose a pragmatic seven-point plan of action to deal with espionage and terrorism in Canada in the current reality. They also urge readers to constructively lobby their members of Parliament and all political leaders. Describing intelligence as \"the brains behind the sword,\" they urge that an al-Qaida attack is not a matter of if, but when. We ignore these warnings at our peril.

Life without self-knowledge is miserable and life with self-knowledge is joyful and full of freedom. Self-inquiry is the way to gain Self knowledge.It is the most blissful activity in life because it is through which we realize the truth and become capable of dropping all miseries in the light of Self knowledge.Self-inquiry is not a mental practice unlike other spiritual practices in which ego is very much preserved safely to do the so called practice.It is not a cultivation of habit; it is a heightened awareness born out of understanding into the identity of consciousness to trivia, and so a liberating process, a creative Self discovery which frees thought-feeling from bondage of limitation of consciousness by the ego.The beauty of self-inquiry is that it is a \"verbal quest through heightened awareness,\" to know the nature of ego and comprehends its activity, rather than a static inquirer as noun trying to manipulate the ego and its activity.Ego is an epiphenomenon like rainbow and so it is not substantial and is formed during the interaction between you and the other. You are identified with that and this identity with the ego as the \"me\" is just a habit, and calling that substitute self, the ego as the \"me\", is the original sin, fall.  You are continuously giving it energy to it and so, that dead entity became established and looking so alive and posing as though it is the real Self.In self-inquiry  we inquire into ego, its urges, compulsions, frustrations, and desire to fulfill, misery, strains, anxieties, struggles, sorrows, and other innumerable problems, seeing all these facts with an \"Inquiring mind filled with heightened awareness\" which is free from all beliefs, dogmas, and so which is beyond thought. Mind in the present status is not fit to do self-inquiry because it is not a free mind, its awareness is entangled in the network of thought and it became one with it. This network of thought itself is unwanted furniture polluting the biological mind which is natural.  So we have to free the biological mind which functions out of awareness from this network of thought commonly called the ego. Once the biological mind is free of conditioning like that, it is filled only with awareness is capable of doing self-inquiry. So still mind is sine qua non for inquiring into the \"self\" because, ego mist evaporates only in the fire of heightened awareness which fills the empty and still mind.Self-inquiry is not an effort of one part of mind observing other. In fact there is no place for effort in self-inquiry.Doing self-inquiry with effort is like dog chasing its own tail but it never succeeds and such an effort stops only when dog realizes that tail is its own part.Similarly human must realize that in deliberate self-inquiry the observer and the observed are both conditioned entities of mind and there is no use of such effort however sincerely it is done.So self-inquiry is a gestalt from habit of thinking to understanding of \"nature of ego\". Now how that gestalt happens?All of us feel that we are aware in waking mode of mind but that awareness is in the grip of tendencies inside which leads the mind to get attracted towards objective reality thus causing awareness to be distracted by trivia in objective reality like amassing wealth, pursuit of pleasure, running after name and fame etc and a constantly struggling mind like this cannot watch. In such context awareness is in the grip of objective reality and so can never be centered and so we function without Self knowledge.Unless you are uninterruptedly aware of and so comprehend self activity you are likely to identify with the ego again because it is an age old habit to get identified with it. In self-inquiry when we start negating the things imposed on our consciousness by the society and to some extent by us, we will come to know that our nature is pure consciousness.Child is born as tabula rasa with tendencies in seed form at birth but those tendencies are waiting to sprout and so he is ignorant. If we can negate the imposed conditioning through understanding and spend our tendencies we can claim back tabula rasa in full awareness which amounts to self realization. That negating of conditioning out of understanding is \"real discipline\", and responding spontaneously from the consciousness is maturity and is religiosity. Just by belonging to a particular religion you are not religious. Religiosity is not that cheap.Only men without understanding belong to certain organized religion, ideologies, concepts, beliefs and respond from that fixed point. But life is a flow, it demands response from a living mind. When you respond to \"life in the present\" from past memories, which is a fixed and static state it results in conflict. That continuous response from the past to the \"life in present\" results in continuous conflict and that continuous conflict is called the ego and we are identified with that. Ego is a mist that is formed during interaction between you and the other. When we see things through that mist, things look distorted and the action born out of it is incomplete and so leads to conflict. So ego is state of psychological immaturity. Self-inquiry helps the mist of ego to evaporate and then we start looking things \"as they really are\". Awareness is the wiper that wipes out ego mist.When awareness free from the influence of past it is heightened awareness and when we act from it, the action is complete and the ego mist stops rising. Ego mist is the result of incomplete action born out of unawareness of self activity. If we set can set aside that ego by going beyond it and start learning to respond to the \"present\" spontaneously from unconditioned mind instead of responding from the ego, then we know what it actually  means to live. If awareness is not wasted in trivia, it goes on accumulating and you become a reservoir of awareness because it is not distracted by unnecessary occupation. And when that reservoir of awareness reaches certain breakeven point, the \"jump\", the \"quantum leap\", the awareness falls back on itself and radical transformation of mind happens instantly. In this luminous, \"Pure witnessing awareness\" self-inquiry and understanding happens. Self-inquiry leads you to a space where you can drop all effort in the name of spirituality. Till then real self-inquiry does not start.", "related": [], "rank": 2818846, "title": "The essence of self-inquiry Part 2. (Self-inquiry. Book 1)", "author": "P.V.S.

The book is written in a direct, easily applicable way. Much thought was given to the order in which the information is presented and the level of detail to which certain elements are explained (or not explained with instructions for the reader to seek information from reliable sources).While it would have been easy for Burton to have simply listed eight horrible mistakes and pointed to what she would have done differently, this instructional volume walks the reader through what is required to set up a sustainable Webinar program that adds potential profit to a department or company. In current economic times, this is a serious value for technical communicators looking to add skills to their repertoire. To that end, the reader feels like a student in Burton's classroom listening to her speak quite authoritatively about a topic on which she has exhaustive knowledge and a great amount of passion.

It s a book well worth savoring.\" -- Janine Stinson / Foreword Reviews --Foreword Reviews5.0 out of 5 stars Yet Another Visit With One Of The World's Great Writers, May 4, 2012 By H. F. Corbin \"Foster Corbin\" (ATLANTA, GA USA) - See all my reviews (VINE VOICE) (TOP 500 REVIEWER) (REAL NAME) This review is from: SAVING JANE AUSTEN: A Comedie Grotesque (Kindle Edition) I should say up front that I read, at his request, Mr. Curzon's novel in progress a couple of years ago and that he dedicated it to me. Although I understand that he has made some minor changes, I believe the novel is essentially the same one I read. I liked it then; I like it now. Anyone familiar with Mr. Curzon's fiction knows that he is a master of satire and that no religion, cult, political party, bigotry or ism is safe when he is riding herd. SAVING JANE is no exception. But like all good satirical writing, this novel is abundant in subtle humor. Mr. Curzon has created a character in Miss Austen who, as a many times over female Rip Van Winkle, is confronted with being awakened in the 21st Century and is a bit overwhelmed at what she sees: computers, e-mails, Nazi skinheads, women open about the love that once dared not be mentioned, female genital mutilation in the name of religion, etc. etc. As I said, nothing is off Mr. Curzon's table. Mother Teresa is lucky she didn't make a sandaled appearance. What Mr. Curzon does so well is convince the reader, at least this one, that Jane Austen, were she brought back to life today, would act the way this character does. Furthermore, the novel she dictates to her assistant reads like it might have been written by Miss Austen-- no small achievement on the part of Curzon. Of course, the dialogue is pitch perfect. I can think of no fiction writer who does it better. Eudora Welty has said that dialogue should never bore the reader. Mr. Curzon's meets her high standard. As much as I liked this novel and smiled often as I read it, I would not recommend it to everyone. If you are looking for a beach novel or have no interest in having your brain combed-- Norman Mailer's wonderful description of what his working the crossword puzzle each morning did for him-- then you should look elsewhere. --Amazon Top 500 ReviewersFor an author who only published six novels (the posthumous Sanditon is a partial novel not published until recently), Jane Austens Regency-era fiction has immense staying power. Not only have her books spawned innumerable fan-fiction items, works such as Pride and Prejudice now have sequels, prequels, and spinoffs. Many of these works continue Austens characters stories or take those characters down fictional side roads.Then there are the zombies (Pride and Prejudice), vampires (Emma, Jane Bites Back) and sea monster send-offs (Sense and Sensibility). Starting about 2009, the idea of creating a mashup of Austen and a horror icon took root, beginning with Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. One could argue that this trend has continued with other historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln and Edgar Allen Poe in computer games, movies, and fiction.Saving Jane Austen belongs with those novels, but its quite different in approach and content. Daniel Curzon takes a decidedly satirical view of Ms. Austen and her writing style, crafting a novel composed of e-mails between the cryogenically frozen and revived head of the famous authoress and an elderly American rare books dealer (now retired) named Aubrey Oxbridge, president of the What Would Jane Austen Do club. More than this, by way of summation, would spoil the fun.Curzons Jane Austen retains her eras viewpoint on matters public and private. Her lack of a body to which her head can be attachedand the limitations thereby forced on herdoesnt stop her from getting back to writing. What she produces is a dizzying blend of nineteenth-century British society and modern life that seems to want to go in two directions at once. Its also hilarious.Curzon is very adept at taking on the Austen writing style and melding it with a contemporary story of a woman transported into the future who must learn to adapt. This novel mirrors Austens focus on Regency-era class divisions and social manners by bringing in several topics of current concern (gender identity, neo-Nazis, immigrants, and longer lifespans) to replace them. The result is a roller-coaster ride, chuckle-per-page gem that will probably outrage true Austen fans and delight readers who can handle humorous approaches to famous authors. Satire is an acquired taste, and one which Curzon uses to great effect.This is not a beach read by any means (one must know at least the basics about Austen to get the majority of the humor): Saving Jane Austen is a novel best enjoyed by readers who like guilty pleasures. Its a book well worth savoring. --Janine Stinson, Foreword Reviews-------", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

By consulting archives and attempting personal contact with surviving family and friends (not all of whom agreed to talk), historian Mungello tells the ‘story of how twenty-three different men with same-sex desire fled to China and influenced history.’ . . . Throughout, Mungello asks a familiar question—What links a (Western, male) homosexual orientation with a passion for Asia?—but from a newer perspective: China hands in the Age of Imperialism. His book is informed, entertaining, and melancholy in equal measure. The heart may be unfathomable, but Mungello has proven it is there.(John Whittier TreatJournal of Asian Studies)D. E. Mungello explores the fascinating question of why so many gay men have been attracted to China, and what impact their enthusiasm has had on Western perceptions of that country. Instead of seeing Orientalism from the standpoint of the Asian subaltern, the reader is shown how generations of gay men have turned to China as a psychological, aesthetic, and even legal refuge. . . . A valuable contribution to our understanding of imperialism, Orientalism, and gay history. Mungello demonstrates the surprisingly important role that gay men have had in eliciting Western awareness of China’s profoundly rich aesthetic and intellectual heritage. He also suggests how homoeroticism has shaped Western scholarship and literature about China. Readers cannot help but come away with a fresh view of the history of Sino-Western interactions.(Bret HinschNan Nü)This is a fascinating read for anyone involved with China. David Mungello's novel focus on sexual orientation and Sinology illuminates the individuality of these cultural pioneers to striking effect.(T. H. Barrett, University of London)This is a fascinating journey into the lives of a number of Western men who, especially at the turn of last century, felt irresistibly attracted to China, traveled there, and sometimes made it their home. Aesthetes and art collectors, pharmacists, poets and opera fans, eccentric Sinologists—what drew these men to China? Many of them, David Mungello suggests, shared a most private and powerful secret—their homosexuality. Much has been written about orientalists as complicit agents of the colonial enterprise. Mungello’s book offers a corrective, showing that at least some of them might have been sexual refugees more than anything else.(Giovanni Vitiello, University of Hawai‘i at Manoa)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Gay & Lesbian", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The topics include the necessity for an abstract and incomprehensible God, finding the spirit in the simplest elements of earth, the paradox of Hell, the many forms of angels, the poetry of prayer, and others. The essays are at times personal and unique to Alves, but isn't the human experience driven through the prism of the self?

The romantic aspect is charming and realistically written with some mysterious elements also. I really loved this book. The author took a simple theme and made it into something grand.

I really appreciate you stopping by and taking a look. I guess in some ways I am an alternative medicine renegade. I talk about topics that, in my opinion, are critical for human health (mental, physical and spiritual). However, many people don't want to hear it because it places the responsibility for their weight and health squarely on their shoulders. I believe there is a health crisis in our country. We've all heard of the obesity epidemic and how children of grade-school age are being diagnosed with adult diseases as hypertension and Type II Diabetes. And, if the children are ill and overweight, then that means the parents are probably just as bad or worse. Indeed, there is a health crisis. But more than that, there is a crisis of personal responsibility. Giving in and 'going with the flow' is easy, at least for now. But sooner or later the piper comes around to collect with some sort of sickness, an unexpected condition that suddenly sobers the mood. And the truth can no longer be denied or escaped. That is why I have written this series of books. I want to use them to carry the message that EVERY weight loss goal CAN be reached with the proper mental artillery and physical preparation. I know what it's like to suffer with obesity and an eating disorder. Food addiction took more than 20 years of my life, and I want to prevent that from happening to anyone else. So here I am for all who care to listen.

Jack's fortunes became even grimmer when he was captured by villainous rum traders and taken to the Delaware terrorist base to face certain torture or death. Instead, the fleet-footed woodsman escaped to lead Colonel John Armstrong's colonial army to Kit-Han-Ne. When the white men answered the Indian menace fire for fire and blood for blood, Hawkins endured a life-changing experience that taught him the true meaning of human compassion.Attack in the Alleghenies, the second novel in the French and Indian War series by William P.

And\nthat's what I'd like to talk about. Writing the ménage. I didn't set out to\nbecome a ménage writer. It wouldn't have occurred to me. My first book, Genetic Attraction,didn't start out\nto be a ménage a trois. When I first conceived the plot, I expected it to be an\nolder woman/younger man romance, but then one day I ordered a book by Jet\nMykles calledHeaven. It was my first\nmale/male romance and I was hooked! I had to add another man to my book and,\njust that quick, it became a ménage.Fortunately, I didn't know that\nwriting a ménage is hard, so I just plunged in. That was the start of something\nfor sure. Of my eleven published books, seven have had at least one ménage\nscene. I guess I really like this dynamic. Here's what I'm learning:·Love between three people can be just as sweet\nand intense and passionate as between two - at least in romance novels! The\nreal-life dynamics of a ménage are probably very tricky, but virtually everyone\nhas harbored in their heart at sometime the thought that maybe, just maybe,\nthey could love two people. Ménage stories play into this fantasy.·Ménages make interesting plots. Simple, you have\nthree people to play with, to make interact with each other, to provide\nrichness and detail to your story. My new release,Genetic Celebritymixes a\nbrilliant young business assistant who is also an amateur chef, with a\nhard-driving modeling agent, and the gorgeous, androgynous street kid they turn\ninto a top model. Tommy, the chef, is 25. Irish Catholic, and loves a simple\nlife. Booky, the modeling agent, is 35 and Jewish. Shay Shaleen, the street\nkid, is only 20, and both informed and traumatized by his hard life. I have\nthree very rich stories to play with in my book.·Pronouns can be killers! Writing male/male\nstories is a unique challenge since both characters are called \"he\". This is\nalso true in MMF, but you now have another pronoun to add. At least there's\nonly one she!  ·Sex between three people needs careful thought.\nThe reader needs to know where each character is and what they're doing. No one\ncan be left out, so we have to see reactions from each character as well as\nactions.·There must be good reason why each character\nloves the other two. Each must have his own story, depth of character,\nmotivations, just as if it were a love story between two people.·But, oh, it's soooo much fun. A ménage is fun to\nread and it's fun to write. So many yummy things can be done simultaneously\nwhen you have three people. Just use your imagination.  That's what I did.  :  )", "related": ["B00IO8HQ3O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.8333, "rating_total": 29.0}

I don t know anybody who can handle a variety of voices, as well as an astonishing variety of times and places, with the ease and skill he repeatedly demonstrates. --George Garrett reviewing Phillips' A Dream of Countries Where No one Dare LivePhillips' works are continually ricocheting between foreground and background, light and dark, light and heavy; and with many degrees of light, as though endowed with an endless dimmer switch. --Alan Crossman, Light: A Quarterly of Light VerseBeware: The stories of Louis Phillips are not the kind that can be taken on just as one has snuggled, finally and wearily, into bed. One needs a mind in full gear.  And be warned: Those who have an aversion to PDM (public displays of mirth) would do best to read The Woman Who Wrote King Lear in private, therefore avoiding the occasion of conversations stopping and heads swiveling to determine Why is that woman in the corner snorting into her cappuccino?  The blurb on the back of the book compares Phillips' writing to that of Barth, Barthelme, and Borges. Throw in some Mark Twain for his strong sense of self, and Italo Calvino for his sense of the reader, and Harlan Ellison for his sense of the world. To revive a literary term one hasn't seen in a good while, what Phillips writes is speculative fiction, and the worlds he creates are set spinning by the confident first person narration he provides.  Going once more to the blurb on the back, madness is named as the theme that connects the stories. But to try to connect these stories thematically would be to try to herd the neighborhood cats: it's just not going to happen. Phillips, who teaches at the School of Visual Arts in New York, throws the reader off balance from the start with \"Errata,\" a \"story\" whose pages are numbered with lower case Roman numerals as though it were actually the front matter it mocks.  After explaining that Louis Phillip' story \"Errata\" (which, of course, is the story the reader is reading) was published the month before but with a \"small number of printer's errors\" due to the printers' and editors' strike, a list of corrections appears.  TITLE PAGE: The author was Louis Phillips and not Nathanial Hawthorne.  PAGE ONE: The main character was Mr. Malone, not Ms. Malone.  PAGE TWO: Pages Two and Three got reversed in the editing process. Page Three should be Page Two. Page Two should be Page Three ...  And so it goes for v pages. The short stories that follow describe a world where fiction writing is against the law (\"It always has been. It drains the economy. It steals time from the ordinary affairs of living.\"), and members of the Committee of Grief send out letters to the widowed, orphaned, and suddenly childless. A review of movies evolves into, or perhaps revolves around, an examination of the narrator's own life. A man obsessed with the Kennedy assassination pines for Lee Harvey Oswald's can opener, and a college professor revels in the discovery of a hefty manuscript by John Locke on mankind's indebtedness to the bicycle, even as he deals with the infidelity of his own much younger, bike-pedaling wife. A magician is hired to levitate a woman so that his client might seduce her mid-air, and a hypnotist breaks up a marriage when he never removes the suggestion that a woman's husband is not a gorilla after all.  Iowa leaves the Union. A cat gobbles Thomas Hardy's heart. And so it goes for almost 200 pages.  Oddly enough, the title story is the weakest of the bunch; the idea of a character going back in time and performing certain acts to preserve the present as we know it, and in this case it's a present made richer by King Lear, has been done and done and done. But the magic, originality, and poignancy of \"Suddenly I Do Not Equate the Light with Anything But Madness: The Best Short Story of 2010\" makes up for this.  Stories that explore an alternate universe are not everyone's passion, for sure. And not everyone is a fan of stories that lean reliably toward humor. But this collection offers more than the oddity and the chuckle. The writing is strong, the voice is confident, and the stories demand attention. --Katheryn Krotzer Laborde, Xavier Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sean then took to another water-sport and throughout his teens he competed in many endurance kayak (K1 & K2) marathons. Amongst many other challenges Sean is mostly recognised for climbing Kilimanjaro dressed as a penguin and more recently cycling 16,000 miles through 6 continents in 116 days and doing most of it with a fractured spine after getting run over by a truck in America. His never-give-up attitude captured the imagination of thousands and is now giving talks about setting your goals high, challenging yourself and overcoming tough times. Having grown up in Africa, Sean also focuses his energies on trying to raise awareness about banishing the kerosene lamp from Africa by the end of the decade. This audacious goal is being pioneered by the charity Solar Aid to which Sean supports.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My initial aim was to help people who are at the beginning of their journey through the world of digital photography, and find it difficult to read and understand books full of professional terms and jargon. That's why the book was written in an accessible way. You won't find difficult terms or technical descriptions here. All this is meant to allow you to assimilate knowledge fast and learn how to take proper pictures. I was a beginner too, and I know how difficult and frustrating that is. That's why I created a book that explains even the more complex issues, using plain language. Precise and relevant information only. The things you really need to know when starting your adventure with photography. When buying a car, you don't need to know how the machines that were used to manufacture it work, do you? You need only important and useful information. This was my primary goal.​​​​Although the book is meant to be used mainly by beginners, the translated version is enriched with tips that may be useful for people who are interested in photography for a while but do not perceive themselves as professional photographers.​​​The other thing I wanted to achieve was to create a full (complex) knowledge base, describing the entire process of photographing. So that you don't need to buy several books and browse them one by one to find the information you need. That is why the book contains information on:- choosing the camera and equipment- using the camera capabilities to take perfect pictures- the art of photography- the most popular themes- editing photographs- and making photographic printsThere is also an appendix on photographic papers and special kinds of paper.The book contains numerous tips that should allow you to solve the most common, as well as not so common problems you may come across, and a lot of guidelines for you to enjoy beautiful pictures.You'll learn how to take sharp, colorful and professional-like pictures that will delight your friends and family.​", "related": [], "rank": 2090454, "title": "Digital Photography", "author": "Anna Dadan", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has written for every 'Fleet Street' newspaper published since 1956, including many that have long gone like the News Chronicle and Empire News. In the early years, he put on a neutral hat and covered matches at Highbury before switching to a career as a foreign correspondent based in Paris and New York with the occasional sortie to Vietnam.   Returning to sports journalism, he wrote biographies of Ilie Nastase and John McEnroe; commented for BBC Radio Five at Wimbledon for twenty years and covered tennis and cricket for The Sunday Times, The Times and Observer.   But having caught the irrational bug of the football supporter at an early age, it never left him. This book offers no pretence at neutrality.

While both this\nand the original form of the story are mysteries, the redrafting process\n for the original turned the story largely into a conventional whodunnit\n - a form it really wasn't suited to. I had to twist it into a semi-police procedural even though the main character wasn't a cop, and this stretched believability quite horribly. It also added a lot of unnecessary material that served merely as red herrings for the reader, and that never sat too well with me either.What I'd originally planned at the time of first\n writing was to create a crime thriller exploring\nthe different ways people deal with loss and tragedy, obsession and guilt, where solving the mystery took second place to coming through events with your humanity\nintact, and without grief and anger turning you into the very thing that\n had hurt you in the first place. A theme which then carries on through the rest of the series as Alex slowly tips further over the edge.I didn't have the experience or the skill to do that back then - I was only 24 and this was only my second published novel - but with the rights to the book back in my hands, ten years down the line, I had the ideal opportunity to turn it back into what it should have been all along. It's been massively rewritten and very heavily cut, and I'm much happier with the result than with its previous incarnation.The Touch Of Ghostswill be the first of three writer's cuts of the old books (The Darkness Insideis up next, followed byBurial Ground), before entirely new stories carry on the Alex Rourke series.(You might also look at my author page, or know the original versions, and wonder what the other book, the earliest book,Winter's End, is and how it fits in. The short answer is: it's best to think of it as the pilot episode to a TV show, with the season proper starting here. If you've read it, it won't do any harm, but it's totally unnecessary.Thisis where everything starts for real. I don't have the rights to that early novel, but for what it's worth if I did and gave it the same treatment, there's almost nothing that I'd keep. Some people like it, but it's very first-booky, cheesy, especially at the end, and... you get the picture. I'm not a big fan.)So I genuinely hope you enjoyThe Touch Of Ghostsin all its shiny new glory, and I hope you stick around for the rest of the series.", "related": [], "rank": 23958, "title": "The Touch Of Ghosts: Writer's Cut (Alex Rourke Book 1)", "author": "John Rickards", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 22.0}

As Maris herself rebounds, her creativity reignited at the sight of a scarlet macaw after she falls in love with a suspiciously secretive visiting businessman, she finds a clue to the underlying cause of Peter’s murder. Fiction echoes reality continually throughout this novel, which seems less a mystery—with a wrap that’s a bit abrupt—than a family saga, notable particularly for its vivid sense of place in modern Singapore. --Michele Leber", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

MacDonald was born in Pennsylvania and married Dorothy Prentiss in 1937, graduating from Syracuse University the following year and receiving an MBA from Harvard in 1939. It was Dorothy who was responsible for the publication of his first work, when she submitted a short story that he had sent home while on military service. It was initially rejected by Esquire but went on to be published by Story magazine - and so began MacDonald's writing career. One of the best-loved and most successful of all the masters of hard-boiled crime and suspense, John D. Macdonald was producing brilliant fiction long after many of his contemporaries had been forgotten, and is still highly regarded today. The Executioners, possibly the best known of his non-series novels, was filmed as Cape Fear in 1962 and 1991, but many of the crime thrillers he produced between 1953 and 1964 are considered masterpieces, and he drew praise from such literary greats as Kurt Vonnegut and Stephen King, who declared him to be 'the great entertainer of our age, and a mesmerizing storyteller'. His novels are often set in his adopted home of Florida, including those featuring his famous series character Travis McGee, which appeared between 1964 and 1985. He served as president of the Mystery Writers of America and in 1972 was elected a Grand Master, an honour granted only to the greatest crime writers of their generation, including Ross MacDonald, John Le Carre and P. D. James. He won many awards throughout his long career, and was the only mystery writer ever to win the National Book Award, for The Green Ripper.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I remember one author actually had a graph showing how much time you should spend on praise, how much on thanksgiving, how much asking for personal provision, etc. Could you imagine a conversation like that with your friends or your earthly parents?I wanted to get away from that sense of prayer as magic spell, and look at the various types of conversations we have with God as they reflect the various aspects of our relationship with God.

One that will speak to your tired, broken heart and give you the nudge you need to venture on. -Stephanie Paige Cole, Still: a collection of honest artwork & writings from the heart of a grieving motherWhat an incredible group of women writers Melissa has gathered for us in Joy, Interrupted. They have truly mapped the journey of loss and grief many of us experience in motherhood. I can feel and relate to each woman's words.The anthology is a deeply soulful service to us all. --Maureen Murdock, author of The Heroine's JourneyTo a parent, there is no more frightening prospect than the thought of losing one's child. Parents aren't supposed to outlive their children, but sometimes it happens. When it does, the experience wrenches one's soul. While this is a hurt that will forever burden the heart, it is in sharing the burden with others that a portion of that weight is lifted. That is why a book like Joy, Interrupted is so needed. It is through reading the insights of real people sharing real experiences, that we begin to allow the process of self-healing. As we begin that process we might just discover how to assist others to do the same. Whether you've lost a child through death, adoption or some other means, you need to read this book...and then share it with a friend. --Kevin Jenkins, Staff Writer, Daily JournalJoy Interrupted is a creative anthology that helps grieving mothers move through pain to the other side of joy. Mothers who have suffered excruciating loss can realize they are not alone. This book carries a voice of hope with words of comfort which come through the stories of its contributors. It becomes a safe harbor for mothers to retreat to express grief, to rest the mind, and to read about creative ways to work through grieving. It suggests that even after paralyzing grief, mothers can keep on creating, living, and to begin experiencing moments of joy again. --Sharon Fulham, educator and author, Upper Room Daily Devotional Guide", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

On a normal day, she would be found in her herb garden collecting spices for her kitchen or ingredients for her potions; in her huge eclectic Provencal kitchen with the big modern oven cooking pots and pans of food for her family of one husband and three kids (an ardent daughter and two boisterous sons) that'll probably last for weeks; in her library with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and an e-reader in her hands as she reads the latest short story erotic hit; or scribbling pages upon pages of different erotic lifestyles, searching for the one that feels like it was inspired by just the right mix of passion, storyline, and sex. She loves going crazy on weekend nights with the hubby. Aside from these activities, the rest of the time she'd be found in front of her laptop typing the latest Sandra Ross concoction for her readers.", "related": ["B004PLMC5G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Since then he has read numerous books on the subject, visited many reported haunted sites and taken part in investigations. His interest in all things paranormal led him to start to write short fiction. He has recently finished a book exploring less well known haunted locations based on personal experiences and is developing at least one of his short stories into a full length fictional novel. Greg's recent Witch Hunter series is gathering pace and there is around 4 novelettes planned for the series, before the final novel to conclude the series. At that point it is possible the series will be continued or a planned prequel series will be launched. As a keen explorer of historical buildings and sites, Greg has recorded numerous tales of hauntings and had several as yet unexplained experiences himself. Some of these have been complied into the book 'Scotland's Hidden Hauntings', a collection of less well known haunted locations in Scotland. He is currently working on a second real ghost story book.

That’s when she said, “Let me type your book for your Christmas gift!” In my head that’s better than anything money could buy. Then people came in to my life and would tell me what I needed to do to keep going on so I could publish this book. I did not get a ghost writer, I edited this book by myself.

The  God of Scripture, of historic Judaism and Christianity is essentially  unknown to modern humankind.  The images of an earlier generation have  been largely distorted to portray God as an indulgent grandfather or an  angry judge, and neither seems to have any relevance to a technological  society.\"Once, many believed that science would provide a  description of the universe that would make religion obsolete.   Theologians, for their part, had adopted a largely defensive posture,  representing themselves as defenders of the faith \"once-for-all  delivered,\" assuming the progress of science offered nothing to  theology.Here, internationally renowned investor John Marks Templeton, along  with distinguished scientist Robert L. Herrmann, unfold the wonderful  irony of the situation as they depict a world where God is revealing  himself - through science - at an ever-increasing pace.  This  outstanding work probes many aspects of scientific discovery and  examines their philosophical and theological impact.  Positive in tone,  it seeks to preserve the mystery and wonder of our universe and  emphasizes the potential blessing intended by the God who plans and  oversees it.  The future holds great promise, the authors believe,  especially if we adopt an analytical and open posture toward both  nature and Scripture.  \"The book of God's works,\" as Francis Bacon  called natural science, can tell us a great deal more about \"the book  of God's words.\"John Marks Templeton has been described byThe New York Times  Magazine,as \"the dean of global investing\", and is the founder of the  Templeton group of mutual funds.  He retired in 1992 and now devotes  his time to philanthropic activities, principally via the John  Templeton Foundation, which is dedicated to progress in the areas of  science and religion, spirituality and health, moral education and the  appreciation of freedom, free markets and free societies.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I wasn't bragging.A few more rounds and Derrick led me to a house that was hidden behind the bar. He was more than a little drunk and fumbled a bit with the door. A teenage looking male, smelling of wet dog, picked up a game boy and left the room without a comment. An alpha did what an alpha did, and if you were a gawky teenager, you were pretty much at the bottom of the pack heap. Sucked to be you.Derrick stopped by the kitchen to pick up tequila in a round clay pot, while I took the opportunity to hit the head and get rid of a lot of liquid. I felt ten pounds lighter, and sadly, felt like I had pissed away a lot of my buzz. Damn Berserker metabolism. It was always a race to try to get a buzz on before running out of booze.I followed the alpha into his bedroom. I had expected it to be one big mess, but it reminded me of how neatly my uncles kept their boats. Everything was meticulous. Then all our clothes were on the floor and I picked him up and threw him on his bed. I pulled myself up to my full height.While I was personally embarrassed by being nude at this diminished weight, I knew this was my own issue and not his. In his eyes, he had won the lottery.

These include the concepts of deductive reasoning and the falsifiability of hypotheses, the development of a research question and hypotheses, and the process of data collection and measurement. Probability theory is then covered extensively with a focus on its role in laying the foundation for statistical reasoning and inference. After illustrating the Central Limit Theorem, later chapters address the key, basic statistical methods used in social science research, including various z and t tests and confidence intervals, nonparametric chi square tests, one-way analysis of variance,  correlation, simple regression, and multiple regression, with a discussion of the key issues involved in thinking about causal processes. Concepts and topics are illustrated using both real and simulated data. The penultimate chapter presents rules and suggestions for the successful presentation of statistics in tabular and graphic formats, and the final chapter offers suggestions for subsequent reading and study.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jessup's acceptance of himself as a gay man was wonderful, but it also made it difficult at times for him to understand Ben's fears of allowing others to know his sexuality. Ben's past taught him the only way to survive was to hide his true feelings, making it difficult to publicly acknowledge his feelings for Jessup. The character of Troy personified the prejudice many people deal with in modern society and the problems they face. The character of Aunt Meg was wonderful as she took care of her boys, accepting them as the loving sons she always wanted.

His discoveries of an advanced vanished civilisation in South Africa includes a diverse field of research and touches on human origins, spirituality, science, and consciousness. He has shown that long before the Egyptians saw the light of day, an advanced civilisation of humans lived in southern Africa, mining gold. They carved the first Horus bird, the first Sphinx, built the first pyramids and built an accurate stone calendar right in the heart of it all. Adam s Calendar is the flagship among millions of circular stone ruins, ancient channels, agricultural terraces and thousands of ancient mines left behind by a vanished civilisation unknown to us before, which we now call the FIRST PEOPLE. Michael has revealed evidence that these people had an astute knowledge of the laws of nature and the generation of FREE ENERGY using the power of sound from the Earth as a source of this energy. His discoveries have resulted in his close involvement with the Global Breakthrough Energy Movement, and his research has caught the attention of many scientist and inventors around the world. Michael s work touches critical issues around the subject of Unity Consciousness. He believes that quantum physics is a gift from the divine creator to allow humanity to find its way back to source back to unity from a deeply divided and manipulated species. Tellinger claims that only by understanding our mysterious past, the origins of money and the rise of the royal bloodlines, can we make sense of the insane world we live in today. It was his intimate understanding of our ancient past that allowed him to postulate a whole new way forward for humanity something that has never been done before. A model for a new social structure which he called CONTRIBUTIONISM. Michael Tellinger is the founder of the UBUNTU LIBERATION MOVEMENT and the UBUNTU political party in South Africa which will be contesting the national elections in SA during 2014. All the income generated from this book goes directly into building UBUNTU communities in South Africa and the rest of the world.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A year after graduation from Memphis Tech High, he joined the navy on the day following the start of the Korean War. In “Boot Camp” he was chosen Honorman of his company by fellow recruits, went to Airman School in Memphis, then to the Naval School of Photography in Pensacola, Florida. He served as a photographer aboard the battleship New Jersey on the staff of Admiral Harold Martin, Commander of the Seventh Fleet, then spent 13 months at North Island Naval Air Station in San Diego. His last two years in the navy were at Ford Island in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where he received a letter of commendation from the Chief of Naval Operations for his photographic work. He also attended night classes at the University of Hawaii, which is where he first thought of writing a novel when he composed a term paper for English 101. After serving in the military, Regenold graduated from Duke University where he was president of the Duke Players, the student theatrical group. He then attended the Pasadena Playhouse College of Theater Arts where he won the Faculty Scholarship and graduated cum laude. As a branch manager in banking at Ocean Beach, California, he was president of the Kiwanis Club and won first place in the National Public Speaking Contest for the American Institute of Banking. At San Diego's Old Globe Theatre was nominated for an Atlas Award for best supporting actor for his portrayal of Dr. Gibbs in Our Town. Later, while working at the Empress Hotel of La Jolla, he was chosen from 30,000 hotel employees in San Diego County as one of the 12 Hosts of the Year. When he left the Empress Hotel of La Jolla in 1999, he began working toward a goal he’s had since the age of 21 in that University of Hawaii English class: writing a novel.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her latest assignment finds her aboard a ship, which she quickly discovers is running guns. The ship is attacked by pirates off the Somali coast, but Munroe escapes, taking the captain with her. Turns out the captain is really what the pirates were after, and she hides him in a small private hospital while she tries to figure out her next move. The plan? Hijack the ship back, of course. This action-adventure thriller moves along at breakneck speed with the requisite violence peppering most of the pages. Munroe is a smart, fiercely strong, yet damaged woman in the vein of Lisbeth Salander, and she could hold her own with Robert Ludlum’s Jason Bourne or Barry Eisler’s Rain. For fans of high-energy action. --Stacy Alesi", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.1667, "rating_total": 25.0}

Additionally, she has written multiple screenplays, and contributed her writing to many non-profit and for profit organizations. She has launched several blogs over the years, which garnered international attention.  In 2013, Novelle returned to her first love – fiction. Writing under the names Renee Novelle and R.S. Novelle, she has a publication schedule that includes Psychological Thrillers, Suspense, Paranormal Fiction, Contemporary Women’s fiction, Chick Lit, and New Adult. Though she received her Bachelor’s of Science in Communication, summa cum laude, she considers herself a constant student of the written word. She’s an avid reader, an enthusiastic quote poster, and rarely takes “no” as a final answer. She has an unhealthy obsession for theater, dance, music and art, and strongly believes that wine is simultaneously the beginning of, and resolution to, all of life’s problems. She believes in following dreams, and that in the end, you always end up where you meant to be.

It offers progressive politics a revived purpose: not a surrender to economic practices as if they were forces of nature, but the pursuit of a common security that would enhance our humanity - because, as he puts it, \"knowing that your fellow citizen has the same rights as you do humanises us all\". -- John Harris The Guardian Standing follows his influential analysis of the precariat as the 'new dangerous class' with a comprehensive list of demands and suggestions for how this class can 'abolish itself' through a struggle for rights, eroded by neo-liberal austerity that has caused widespread existential insecurity. Standing's insightful and encouraging book will be welcomed not only by members of the precariat but equally by non-precarians on the left seeking inspiration for a new progressive programme. Claus Offe, Emeritus Professor of Political Science, Hertie School of Governance, Berlin, Germany In his call for 'social empathy' in politics, Standing offers an important corrective to decades of neoliberalism, while his demand for rethinking of the nature of work rightly seeks to undo centuries of damaging thought on the issue. The Charter offers a series of positive steps towards reshaping society to provide a better life for the vulnerable majority in our societies. Natalie Bennett, Leader of the Green Party of England and Wales This is without doubt one of the most important and powerful books I have read in a long time. Building on his influential thesis about the precariat Professor Standing provides not only a graphic account of the increasing insecurity and poverty facing many people in the contemporary age, but he also points to clear and workable solutions to many entrenched problems. The book brings into sharp relief the declining fortunes of the ordinary citizen and the role of governments in defining ever harsher life and working conditions for many. Whilst there is much in the book which is depressing this is ultimately an inspiring work which is full of promise. I have little doubt that it will become a classic of the future but its real potential lies in its clear and convincing mandate for political change. Quite simply, a tour de force. Tracy Shildrick, Professor of Sociology and Social Policy, University of Leeds, UK, and co-author of Poverty and Insecurity: Life in low-pay, no-pay Britain Building on the success of his much-discussed The Precariat, Guy Standing has now elaborated a brave and imaginative program that could bring protection to the denizens of the world and save us all from the destructiveness of neoliberal capitalism. A terrifying catalogue of destitution and dispossession. Michael Burawoy, University of California, Berkeley, USA No one interested in the fate of labor in the 21st century can ignore Guy Standing's The Precariat, which transformed both scholarly and political debates about the future of work in capitalist societies. A Precariat Charter is equally indispensable, not only updating and elaboration the earlier book's theoretical framework but also offering a detailed political program to attack the extreme inequalities and insecurities that neoliberal globalization has unleashed. For Standing, the precariat is not merely a victim but also a dynamic agent of social change. Building on the groundwork laid by Occupy Wall Street and similar movements around the world, this Charter is a gift to all who aspire to forge a new society in which human work has meaning and workers' rights are fully respected.
