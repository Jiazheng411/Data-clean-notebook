Perhaps unsurprisingly, Murakami lived abroad until 1995. That year, two disasters struck Japan: the lethal earthquake in Kobe and the deadly poison gas attacks in the Tokyo subway. Spurred by these tragic events, Murakami returned home. The stories inAfter the Quakeare set in the months that fell between the earthquake and the subway attack, presenting a world marked by despair, hope, and a kind of human instinct for transformation. A teenage girl and a middle-aged man share a hobby of making beach bonfires; a businesswoman travels to Thailand and, quietly, confronts her own death; three friends act out a modern-day Tokyo version ofJules and Jim. There's a surreal element running through the collection in the form of unlikely frogs turning up in unlikely places. News of the earthquake hums throughout. The book opens with the dull buzz of disaster-watching: \"Five straight days she spent in front of the television, staring at the crumbled banks and hospitals, whole blocks of stores in flames, severed rail lines and expressways.\" With language that's never self-consciously lyrical or show-offy, Murakami constructs stories as tight and beautiful as poems. There's no turning back for his people; there's only before and after the quake.--Claire Dederer", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Im so paranoid.(Text message from Heather Lowell to Bree Penny)u r not paranoid. they r watchng u. welcome to prichett.(Text message from Bree Penny to Heather Lowell)I caught the bridal bouquet.This happened exactly thirty seconds after I told God that all I wanted to do was fade into the beautiful woodwork of Faith Community Church for the rest of the day.I'm sure He was laughing when I walked out of the bathroom after a quick lipstick check and was swept into the center of a cluster of women whose eyes reflected deadly intent. Kind of like Mom's koi when they saw the mysterious hand poised above them, ready to drop food pellets into the water.I looked in the direction of whatever it was everyone was fixated on—just in time to see a floral missile hurtling our way. What happened next was something I'd only experienced in the mosh pit at a Christian rock concert the summer before. But this time everyone was wearing pastels.Candy Lane, Prichett's mayor, was short but agile, judging from the way she vaulted out of the pack toward the ceiling.Someone stepped on my toe and I bounced to the left, putting myself between Bree, who could have unwound the ribbon from her hair and lassoed the thing, and Prichett's very own resident artist, Marissa Maribeau, who looked as confused as I did that she'd been caught up in this weird ritual.As luck would have it, the bouquet rocketed right to Marissa like it was on a programmed course, but she decided to change the rules. As soon as it touched her hands, she popped it back into the air like we were playing hot potato. If she'd been a Green Bay Packer quarterback, she wouldn't have been signed on for the second season.Gravity did its duty and when the bouquet returned to earth, it ricocheted off Bree and landed with a fragrant thump against my arm, then spiraled toward the floor. The competitive instinct—the one that drove me to set my sights on Boardwalk and Park Place when I played Monopoly—kicked in and I grabbed it. Now I was in the crosshairs. Panicked, I realized my only option was to imitate Marissa's move, but just as I was about to launch it back into space, there was no one there to catch it. My former opponents suddenly muttered their congratulations and shape-shifted from future bridezillas to supportive, can-you-feel-the-love sisters. And they headed toward the cake table together.\"I think this belongs to you.\" I snagged Marissa's elbow before she escaped.\"Not a chance.\" Marissa backed away, staring in horror at the flowers I grandly offered.Future psychology majors take note. This would be a fascinating study. Why intelligent women who've grown up in the modern world react in unpredictable ways when the bridal bouquet is headed in their direction like a ribbon-trailing asteroid. It's not like anyone really believes that the girl who catches it is going to be the next one to walk down the aisle. I'm twenty-one years old and I've already figured out that in the age group twenty to thirty, there's a ratio of one Christian guy to a bazillion Christian women. Okay, a slight exaggeration. Then again, maybe not.I buried my nose deep in the lilacs and white roses and when I emerged a few seconds later, at least a dozen disposable cameras were aimed in my direction.\"Say cheese.\" Bree grinned.For all I knew, the good old dairy state of Wisconsin had been the birthplace of the expression.I silently pounded my head against my inner wailing wall.\"I wanted to fade into the woodwork,\" I muttered.Bree's blue eyes flashed in amused sympathy. \"If you want to fade into the woodwork, go back to the Twin Cities. In Prichett you've got a starring role.\"A starring role.Not quite what I had in mind, God.Why was He so determined to shake up my life? There's no doubt that what's happened to me since last summer can only be the result of God's intervention. Divine fingerprints. My life is full of them. Okay, confession. Maybe I had a hand in getting the whole thing started. Initially.Dad insists that I can't leave things alone. Supposedly this endearing characteristic can be traced to a package of Oreos and the VCR when I was four years old. Unfortunately, Mom has the pictures to prove it. Which leads me to ask a question—why are parents wired with a twisted sense of humor that drives them to take photos of their children's most embarrassing moments when they are too young and helpless to prevent it? Those photos have an annoying habit of surfacing years down the road like the risqué, before-they-were-famous poses of models that the tabloids gleefully print. Case in point, the infamous Oreo-VCR photos have come back to haunt me at my sixteenth birthday party, high school graduation open house and my first (and only) date with Chad Benson. Although I don't think there was a direct correlation. Really.As if the Oreo photos and the accompanying script my mom loves to recite when she displays them aren't enough, she's put them in a special album, which I like to refer to as Heather Lowell's Childhood Bloopers. Also included in my repertoire is the photo where I'm perched in Dad's leather recliner, wearing nothing but a diaper and draped from head to toe in yards of shiny tape—which in a former life had been the movieE.T.Mom is convinced I thought he was trapped in there somewhere and it was up to me to save him.As far as I'm concerned,alldiaper and birthday-suit bathtub photos should be burned on a kid's tenth birthday. Middle and high school are right around the corner. Think about it.So maybe I can be forgiven for being a bit camera shy. For years I thought everyone's parents came automatically equipped with a 35-millimeter and telephoto lens. I learned the sad truth at my kindergarten graduation, when my mother, armed with enough film to take a head shot of everyone in the Twin Cities, was besieged by mothers who'd (gasp)forgottentheir cameras. My mother, being the good Christian woman that she is, cheerfully took pictures of my entire class. And the faculty.I heard one of the moms whisper that after her fourth child, she was lucky she remembered to check to be sure both her shoes matched before she left the house, let alone remember to bring a camera. Mom had leaned over and whispered back that I was an only child and every precious moment needed to be recorded.I may have been five years old, but that's when I figured it out. The camera fixation and the bulging photo albums had something to do with my being adopted.Mom and Dad were never secretive about it. I grew up being told that I was a special gift to them from God. That I was the child of their heart. I was so cocooned in love and attention that I never felt like I was lacking anything. Some of my closest friends were adopted, too, so I didn't think there was anything strange about it at all. In fact—minus the never-ending photo ses-sions—it was kind of cool.Until my freshman year of high school. On Career Day. A day that will go down in history as the day I started to wonder—for the first time—about my birth parents. Particularly my mother. I blame the guidance counselor and Rhianne Wilson: the guidance counselor for handing out the questionnaire that was designed to point kids who still watched Saturday morning cartoons in the direction of their future career; Rhianne Wilson for getting caught in a downpour on the way to school, which caused her to slink into the gymnasium through the side door and huddle between the rows of lockers, where I practically tripped over her.The guidance counselor had decided that Career Day would be more fun if the students came to schooldressedfor their future career. If we had a clue what that was. Which I didn't. I attended a private school called His Light Christian Academy, so even though I could've borrowed my dad's scrubs and pretended I was thinking about following in his respected footsteps, it wouldn't have been completely honest. And honesty is a big thing at a Christian school. Not to mention that everyone knew from an unfortunate incident in third grade that I faint at the sight of blood—whether it's mine, a fellow classmate's, the classroom hamster's…But that's a different subject.\"I'm supposed to be a model,\" Rhianne had wailed. \"Look at me. Everyone is going to think I want to be a drowned rat when I grow up.\"\"It's not that bad.\" I was an optimist, but I still felt the need to ask God to forgive me for stretching the truth.I skipped algebra to put Rhianne back together. By the time she got to study hall, three boys had asked her out. By lunchtime, half the girls in the school were begging me to give them tips on makeup and hairstyles.\"I guess we know what you'll be doing with your life,\" Rhianne said, linking her arm through mine and forcing me to match her catwalk sashay—hip roll to hip roll— to history class.\"What?\"She gave me awell, duhlook. \"Hair. Makeup.\"\"No way.\"My parents weren't snobs but I'm sure there was an unspoken agreement between them and God that He wouldn't choose a path for me that involved anything less than four years at a Christian college and included at least two semesters of Bible study.\"You have talent. A gift.\" Rhianne could be pretty dramatic when she was wearing the right shade of eye shadow. I hadn't known that. \"It's in your genetic makeup. Wow. That was one of those…you know…\"\"Puns?\" Okay. I don't mean to be uncharitable, but sometimes it's a good thing a girl can go far on her looks.\"Right.\" Rhianne had tossed her long blond hair with one of those graceful head rotations that only girls with long blond hair have perfected.When we parted company, I sat through an hour of American history in a daze, remembering the Christmas I'd begged for one of those plastic mannequin heads topped with the glossy artificial hair you could style any way you wanted. I got a piano instead. Disjointed memories returned, of the times I coordinated Mom's outfi...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Here, I also compared/contrasted Saint Francis's model for interspecies communication with the spiritual autobiography of modern-day, animal behavior scientist, Jane Goodall, with special attention to similarities in interspecies communications techiques.Third, after I graduated, I also had the opprotunity to test my hypothesis, on two real life, wildlife-human conflicts, one involving a conflict with wild groundhogs, another with two feuding domesticated cats. Also, I discovered an additional book on the topic, where I added a cross-cultural componet, to my project. I went to press in 2008 at the time of the Obama-Cain election, to offer an alternative Christian voice to Sara Palin, on Christianity and hunting.After publication, I also was able to have an e-mail corrosponance with Christian animal theologian-pastor, Reverend Frank Hoffman where our conversation was published on his website.He also offered a web-page on his site to promote my ministy and recently published one of my short essays: \"Eulogy to a Parakeet: Mordecai's 'Soul's Journey onto God.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The station can't use the film footage they take, but right away we know it contains an important clue; too bad we have to wait for the end of the book for it. After the authorities pronounce Gillian's death natural, Maxi's self-styled snooping turns up enough questionable pharmaceutical evidence to prod the medical examiner into a second autopsy that proves Gillian was murdered. The brash Maxi insinuates herself into the case, interviewing Gillian's snappish husband Carter, his greedy mistress and Gillian's business colleagues. Red herrings and suspicious behavior by all the characters keep Maxi zooming around L.A.'s celebrity haunts. Finally, she pulls out the crime scene footage and identifies the murderer, a totally off-the-wall choice. The author's lavish descriptions of brand-name clothing and furnishings will tickle Jackie Collins fans, while others will welcome the insider look at how news programs are put together.

Somewhat static black-and-white drawings open up each chapter.

For example, a correspondence with Uncle Milton (President and Proprietor ofUncle Milton's Thousand Things You Never Thought You'd Findnovelty catalog) leads to the man's publishing a collection of Chief Leopard Frog's bad poetry, and Spencer's romancing two \"older\" women (older by a few years) as he takes on the world of art photography by storm. Jennings has a dry wit, and the protagonist's matter-of-fact observations make the most outlandish scenes seem possible. This is a coming-of-age story/tall tale that's full of charm.—Caroline Tesauro, Radford Public Library, VAEND", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I performed with Cash for 40 years and have read every book written about him yet D'Ambrosio astonishingly reveals another side of Cash framed around perhaps his most important work,Bitter Tears.A Heartbeat and a Guitaris a rare and extraordinary work thanks to D'Ambrosio's exceptional and masterful storytelling.  This book must be read, not just by Cash fans, but everyone who loves music and believes in its power and spirit.  D’Ambrosio’s work, like Cash himself, is highly original and a force to be reckoned with.Jim Jarmusch, filmmaker“This book is a truly fascinating journey, charting the historical and social context of a courageous musical statement by one of our greatest rebel voices.  It has since been locked away in the ‘denial drawer’ (aren't First Nations people just an extinct species, systematically exterminated by European ‘progress’?), but D'Ambrosio admirably shines his investigative lantern into every darkened corner, finally offering some greatly appreciated illumination.”Howard Zinn\"Antonino D'Ambrosio's book on the making of Johnny Cash's album \"Bitter Tears\" is much more than the story behind those extraordinary songs. It is a rich history, not only of Johnny Cash's life, but of the Indian struggle for justice, which inspired Peter La Farge to write the song ‘The Ballad of Ira Hayes’ and Cash to sing it.  The book is full of fascinating character sketches of the great folk singers of the Sixties, and their part in the social movements of that exciting era. I believe D'Ambrosio has made an important contribution to the cultural history of our time.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Finally, on the 13th day, they discover an important fossil that turns out to be part of an unknown meat eater. Though the text lacks panache, it offers digestible facts and manageable vocabulary for beginning readers. At times the plot is unrealistic and contrived, but it is easy to follow. Pages from Jeff's field journal and bright cartoon drawings add to the book's appeal. An acceptable addition for libraries building their easy chapter-book collections, and for those in which budding paleontologists routinely deplete the supply of dinosaur books.Holly T.

Of the several science fiction stories included, the strongest are Good Boy, an engrossing experiment in computer psychology, African gods and postcolonial anxiety, and Shiomah's Land, a cross-genre bildungsroman involving a girl who becomes the wife of a goddess. The concluding tale, The Beads of Ku, is an utterly arresting, authoritatively delivered tale concerning the diplomacy of marriage and the economy of the land of the dead. The threads of folklore, religious magic, family and the search for a cohesive self are woven with power and lucidity throughout this panorama of race, magic and the body.(Aug.)\"\"Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Alan Kirman draws on his immense experience of how real people trade, from the Marseille and Ancona fish markets to experiments on public goods games, to propose an approach to economics centred on interaction between individuals and its consequences for aggregate behaviour. This book is essential reading in the quest for new economic thinking’.- Prof. Robert MacKay, University of Warwick, UK'Alan Kirman identifies the two key issues in interpreting the workings of the economy and related social interactions (e.g., public goods): the variability across individuals and the surprising degree of coordination. He explores these topics in many contexts, going well beyond the standard equilibrium analysis. This is an outstanding coverage, not blinking the difficult issues and unresolved problems but casting light where possible.'-Kenneth J. Arrow, Professor of Economics (Emeritus), Stanford University, UK'I have always followed the simple rule of thumb: If Alan Kirman writes anything, push everything else aside and read it right away. I did the same when his new book arrived. His book is beautifully written and shows the power of complex adaptive systems thinking for increasing the ability of economic science to do a better job of understanding real economies. One of my favorites is how he shows that it helps to understand internal forces that can cause abrupt and surprising change. But there is much more in this book which is what one would expect since, Kirman is a master contributor to many areas of economics. You will not only learn a lot from reading this amazing book but you will be entertained and break out into peals of laughter as well.'-William A.

PI Stanley Hastings (Actor, Blackmail, Movie, etc.) once fueled a bunch of enjoyable light crime yarns as Stanley cased out ill-lit stairways and injured clients for his shark-like, ambulance-chasing litigator boss, Richard Rosenberg. Now, after some darker detours in which the cases got nastier and Stanley's thespian aspirations were mistakenly given center stage, Parnell makes a partial recovery. This time the monster-egoed Rosenberg is defending a man accused of murdering his wife. Anson Carbinder has six buddies who will swear he won the biggest pot in a poker session the night of the murder. But he also has a busty bimbo in tow, and a brand-new insurance policy on his wife. Rosenberg is naturally determined to preserve the integrity of the alibi. But the complexities of the game make Stanley curious and a little uneasy, especially when one of the poker players suddenly gets scared-and then dead. This latest outing moves at a smart clip and nicely balances the convolutions of the alibi with a lot of very sharp turns in the courtroom.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Placing the words \"Catholic\" and \"dissent\" in the same title may turn some off, but this is hardly the primary purpose. The author's great contribution is in illustrating a way to navigate this thorny social issue while maintaining civility and respect. He is a master of well-crafted arguments and does not allow ad hominem attacks and overly emotional rants to rule the day. The author understands the weak points of each side of this ongoing debate. Criminalizing abortion, he contends, is a road with a dead end for the pro-life contingent. To the other side he insists that a human fetus is not simply chaff--it is deserving of respect and some moral consideration. O'Brien is well versed on the literature regarding abortion, and he frequently quotes numerous scholars. A reader needs to have an open mind to benefit from this author's work, but those who do will gain much. (Sept.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Twenty-five contributors present broad overviews and critical case studies of burgeoning sustainable agriculture movements on five continents, but North America gets the most attention, with excellent chapters on Cuba; Mexico; Ontario, Canada; and three regions of the US. The fascinating history of organic agriculture is presented as a case of a socio-environmental movement that risks diverging from sustainability as it grows and industrializes. Nonetheless, \"organic\" serves as a convenient proxy for \"sustainable\" through much of the book. This is a readable and information-packed volume, accessible to undergraduate students but rewarding to advanced students and sustainable agriculture professionals. Summing Up: Highly recommended. All collections.–M. K. Bamford, Kentucky State University. CHOICE. JULY 2010, VOL 47, No 11Refreshingly, the book acknowledges the difficulties of both researching and putting into practice changes at the whole system level as opposed to alterations in individual farming practices. Of particular value is the discussion of what motivates practitioners to alter their agricultural systems; this goes beyond the usual discussion of finance and markets to address issues such as family values and community development. ...This book will interest students and practitioners of organic agriculture but will also be of value to a much wider community concerned with reducing the dependence of agriculture on fossil fuels and the challenges of reconnecting agriculture and consumers.--Christine A.

To do so, Mavio poses as a fellow crook interested in buying counterfeit money from Kahn and O'Shay, the latter, despite a long track record of bloodshed, having avoided jail even after a police officer witnessed one of his murders. Will Mavio be able to overcome Kahn and O'Shay's suspicions to get evidence to prosecute them?

His first novel, 'Jacks and the Jills' and his second novel, 'Our Father's Sons', were completed in 2007 and 2009. Three more are set to follow. He loves the writing process and has created a number of screenplays and television concepts. Don's movie company, MaxxaM Entertainment, is currently in the arduous task of securing funds to produce his original screenplay, 'Vegas Wedding Blues', which he is set to direct. Prior to his current writing career, Mr. Barnhart has Directed, Assistant Directed and Stage Managed hundreds of Network television shows in all formats, including single and multiple cameras, on stage and on locations, featuring book shows, musicals and commercials. His directing credits include, but not all, Mork &amp; Mindy, Benson, Full House, Hardknocks, pilots; Here To Stay and The O'Brians. He also directed 85 episodes of the syndicated series, Comedy Break, multiple episodes of Down To Earth, Safe At Home, Rocky Road, Madam's Place and a three hour live Network show entitled Celebrate America. He's also had the privilege of directing eight (8) seasons of the extremely popular NBC Network teen-age series, Saved By The Bell (over 200 hundred episodes seen here and in 85 countries during its hey-day and is currently still on the air!) Plus, three (3) seasons of California Dreams (over 40 episodes) to boot. When 'SBTB' became a huge success, Mr. Barnhart directed the NBC Movie of the Week, \"Saved By The Bell, Hawaiian Style' to huge ratings. Swapping a Speedo for snowshoes, he traveled to Montreal, Canada to direct multiple episodes of Fox's popular teen-age show, Student Bodies. Don recently finished his ninth year of directing the annual \"Meet The Nominees' for the Director's Guild of America and in 1996 received the prestigious Franklin J. Schaffner Award. He has also had the wild and unique experience of directing both Robin Williams and Jonathan Winters at the same time. No award for that, however, but he did learn some comedy.

For shear cloak-and-dagger value alone, this extended piece of journalism offers a gripping read (no less so due to the part played by one particularly surprising conspirator, an American named David Coleman Headley), but its being regrettably true only raises the stakes.

I enjoy your writing and I like the characters. I especially enjoy learning about the horses. The foaling in the first chapter was an exceptional piece of writing- it really evokes genuine emotion. --Joan Paris Hampden/Wilbraham TimesSandra J. Howell has brought us her first novel, jam-packed with exotic horses, passionate horse people, and a bit of drama as well. As fellow horse people, it's easy for us to relate to Samantha's struggles and root for her as she struggles to achieve her dreams. It's clear that this book was written by a knowledgeable horse person and Howell sheds light on a little known breed in a pleasant way. BOTTOM LINE; Entertaining story, heavy on the horses. --Kate Tully/ Horsemen s Yankee PedlarI had the pleasure of reading Sandra Howell's book, Spirit of a Rare Breed. It is a delightful book that weaves together an interesting story that is intermingled with our Curly horses. Sandra has a wonderful way of painting pictures with her words. We can all identify with the experiences of Sam, the main character in the story, along with the supporting cast of both human and animals. I can't think of a better gift for a Curly owner or animal lover. --Janice Voss-Crosby/ International Curly Horse Organization Gazette\"With great insight and wisdom, Sandra Howell translates her many years of experience in working with horses into this delightful and insightful book. Her characters are fascinating and her anecdotes are those we can all relate to. This is a must read for anyone who is a lover of all animals. The story is poignant, powerful and surprisingly sparked with wit and contemporary themes.

It was the dark and moving tale of a Halloween pumpkin. Unfortunately, the details of this gem have been lost to time. Her next story featured a large black dog who was really a demon in disguise. Apparently, Tori was born in paranormal mode.  Three years later, it dawned on her that she didn’t have to wait for the teacher’s permission to write fiction. She spent the entirety of her peculiar adolescence writing weird and romantic stories which embarrassed her parents and got her in trouble at school. Unfortunately for her ego, the teachers merely thought she was writing letters to friends.  Letters to friends! C’mon, this is dark, creative proto-Goth girl. Why would she write letters to friends when she could bring forth post-apocalyptic romances instead?  After a long detour for such grown-up pursuits as working boring full-time jobs (State of Alaska, U.S. Postal Service), getting married and having a child, she returned to her first love—storytelling. She was born and raised in Alaska, and now lives in the Pacific Northwest with her husband, son, and micro-dog.  Her novels include The Amaki series, about sexy fae, and a vampire series that includes both pre- and post-apocalyptic romance.", "related": ["B0093WRJPK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If you have read Charlee's work, then you will not be disappointed. 5 Stars!--Hattie Boyd for SimeGen ReviewsIN THE HEART OF THE WIND is a fantastic story. Charlotte Boyett-Compo has once again shown us her masterful talent as we become enthralled with this story of both light and dark. We become caught up in the story of Gabe as loving husband with a secret past. We watch his transformation into the creature his family turns him into. We also have the light side in this suspenseful tale as watch the members of the Iowa town rally and hatch a plot to regain Gabe. I have to admit, my favorite character in this tale is Edna Mae, the feisty older woman with money and sense. This one will keep you turning the pages and I highly recommend it. 5 Hearts,-- Chere, The Romance Studio", "related": ["B003XYEVUK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kimball’s wonderful debut novel, as do these unforgettable characters who inhabit its spirit and magic and grace. And the story so beautifully told that I read it in a single sitting, and then began reading it again.”—Jack Driscoll, author ofHow Like an Angel“With poetry and spirit Kimball's words are like magic, moving fluently through time, multiple voices, and histories.  Elk Rapids, Michigan is so intricately rendered it becomes another unforgettable character in this poignant tale about the wages of friendship, loss, and the heart in search of its rightful home.  A thoroughly engaging novel and a luminous debut.”—Jaimee Wriston Colbert, author ofShark Girls“If novels were bodies of water,A Good High Placewould be a clear, rapid river running through the primeval forest of northern Michigan, revealing to its readers pools and eddies, places inhabited by love, loss, remembrance, and the ever elusive trout. L. E. Kimball’s story is written with grace and ease as it explores what was and, hopefully, what will always be true about our at once forbidding and generous American landscape.”—John Smolens, author ofThe Anarchist", "related": [], "rank": 3484631, "title": "A Good High Place", "author": "L.E.

Cecelia Holland, a prolific writer of historical novels, turns this forgotten chapter of history into an impossibly interesting study of gritty American life before big government, unions, or business regulation. Holland’s vivid descriptions bring to life the seething anger of the mobs and their battles to control the lines. She renders the chaos of the strike in individual vignettes of drunkards, angry workers, curious onlookers, sheriffs disabused of power, militiamen who put down their arms to join the resistance, and men cajoled by the railroad bosses to take up arms against the crowd. The piece ends with a witty yet stern rebuke of Ayn Rand’s novelAtlas Shrugged, which used the story of a fictional rail line to champion a belief that profit is the best motivator (and Laissez-faire the best economic climate) for humanity.--Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 503237, "title": "Blood on the Tracks (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Cecelia Holland", "category": "History", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 3.6667, "rating_total": 33.0}

This time it is Bridgit's turn to get her very own unique Atlantean, and boy, what a truly fun ride it is. Bearing quite a different tone from the previous installments in this series, Return is lighthearted where the previous ones were brooding. This change in tone matches beautifully the quirky nature of the story's heroine, which screams with humor. As to Orion, let's just say that I would have loved to be a fly on the wall just to see his reactions to Bridgit's comments and statements. He is just plain adorable, and that without detracting one bit of his status as an alpha male. The love scenes scorch the pages, and Orion's \"enhanced\" attributes are simply drool worthy. Return can be read fully as a stand-alone; however, be forewarned, as once you are done with this title, you can rest assured that if you haven't read the first 3 books (plus the quickie) yet, you will feel an urgent need to catch up with this series. I admit that I am a bit saddened at seeing one of my favorite paranormal erotic romance series come to an end, but as the saying goes, all good things must come to an end, and this one was worth the wait!

A 40-year-old widow, Kellie lives alone aboard a sailboat moored in a marina near Seattle. A neighboring slip harbors the yacht belonging to the attorney who found Kellie a daughter through private adoption 20 years earlier. When the attorney and his wife are discovered murdered out on the bay, Kellie's curiosity is aroused, though given her tenuous connections to the couple her motivations are murky. Still, Wilcox does a good job of bringing depth and resonance to Kellie and her unusual life. The storyline remains on course, even though it bobs among several gritty subjects: black-market baby adoptions, adoptees seeking their natural parents, and horrid secrets of child abuse. Altogether this is a distinctive and intriguing launch.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 1660106, "title": "Sins of Silence", "author": "Valerie  Wilcox", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And lastly, are you tired of recipes that require a Master's Degree to assemble?Well, I was! Over the years, many times I would try an new appetizer with high hopes. Only to be disappointed in either taste, cost, or time spent preparing the recipe. But in those years, I also discovered quite a few amazing recipes!! Appetizers SO good, I'd want to eat them for dinner! After years of trial and error, these are the recipes that I keep coming back to. These are the appetizers that have gotten raves over the years and many requests for the recipe. I can make these and have some confidence that there will be none left and that my guests will not go hungry.Some of these appetizers I discovered at weddings and then tried to duplicate on my own at home like \"Philly Cheesesteak Spring Rolls\", \"Melted Mozzarella Bruschetta Slabs\", and \"Chicken Skewers and Peanut Butter Dipping Sauce.\" Others were discovered at family gatherings and friend's parties like \"Feel Good Slush\" and \"Melted Onion Dip.\" Some I found in the newspaper, but they needed some tweeking like \"Devilishly Good Bacon Deviled Eggs\" and \"Pina Colada Fruit Dip.\" But in ALL cases, these appetizers bring a smile to my family's face when I announce that I'm making them!Bon Appétit!", "related": [], "rank": 2950522, "title": "An Adventure in Appetizers...", "author": "Blair Daniels", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has abroad spectrum of best selling books that include such divergent areas as self-help for depression, global politics, and paranormal Victorian thrillers. Fiction includes Paranormal Victorian Thrillers, Science Fiction, Psychological Thrillers and Spiritual Fantasy. In addition to his writing he is has a wonderful, esoteric adventure in photojournalism that you can view at his www.StephenPaulWest.com website. \"Kwenda, Women Slaves of War\" tells the true story of motherhood caught in the cruelty of modern warfare. This story paints a story that will touch you to the core, and you will both weep and cheer. \"Depression Symptoms Decoded\" is a deep analysis of depression symptoms with a Jungian view of each symptom demonstrated: weeping, sex issues, rage, eating disorders, isolation, fatigue, confusion addiction, recurrent dreams and dark thoughts. The pioneering self-help book on depression delves deeply into the meaning of each symptom of depression as a pattern for emotional need. By decoding your type of depression symptoms you can identify a means of overcoming depression. \"Rise of the Maiden - Blood and Venom\" is a new twist on the paranormal. Emily Black is a compelling and strong female character who exemplifies a Byronic role. She is every bit as intelligent, smart and dangerous as role reserved for traditionally male leading characters. The darkness of this thriller include haunting of a mother's ghost, and the insanity of a kidnapper who practices vampire occultism.

K. Nicholas is an American photographer with a passion for collaborating with models and sharing knowledge. His vision is colored by being raised abroad and traveling to dozens of countries, including museum visits and other cultural experiences. In the Middle East, he observed how women's bodies were hidden from public view; in most of Europe, there was little prudishness. In his youth, he put in his dues clerking and staffing the darkroom of a camera store. His background includes an art degree, a long stint as a freelance artist, and a career as a professional photographer. His first camera was hand-made from an oatmeal box for a middle-school project. His first nude shoot was a complete surprise to him when a classmate in college assumed that his invitation to model meant for her to be nude. In the decades since then, he has photographed hundreds of nude models for publication in books, articles, as framed prints, product advertisements, stock agencies, and gallery exhibits. His exhibit work consists mainly of photomontage, sometimes printed life-sized. These days, when he picks up a camera, it is to fulfill a personal calling and not the agenda of a client. He is happiest when working on creative projects and devotes as much time as possible to new ideas. His second favorite thing is helping others further their artistic endeavors. He writes to help you learn from his experience, including how to avoid some common mistakes and to encourage your creativity.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Families zip through, stop at the occasional pull-out for a photo-op, then continue along their way. While most parks cater to motorists, one cannot experience their essence from the comfort of your driver's seat. You must walk among the trees and the mountains. Listen to wildlife all around you. Sit back, close your eyes and immerse yourself in nature. America's 58 national parks are irreplaceable treasures, yet they are our parks, preserved for our enjoyment, and if you want to experience them to their fullest you're going to need a good guide.That's where I come in. I admit my first trip to a national park was your typical affair. A group of friends drove to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. We peered in, snapped a few photos, shrugged and returned to our rental car. Did we know that adventurous hikers were resting their tired legs at Phantom Ranch nearly 5,000 feet below at the canyon's floor? No. Did we know how to reach the North Rim? Probably not. The point is, we didn't know much about the Grand Canyon.I've come a long way since those first steps atop the South Rim. While researching this book I spent two full years exploring and photographing the parks, living almost exclusively in my tent. As I passed from park-to-park I learned that this was much more than an assignment; it became an awakening. It was a communion with life and land as I learned to immerse myself in nature. (I also learned how to get to the North Rim, and even hiked down to Phantom Ranch to prove to myself that people were making regular trips to the canyon floor.) I've exhaustively researched every site in this book, integrating those findings with my unique perspective and with the opinions of hundreds of park patrons and National Park Service employees.These are the footsteps you should follow, and downloading this book is the first step to an unforgettable adventure.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hale (aka Tony Hale) began his career in stand-up comedy. Touring professionally as a comic for nearly a decade, he never envisioned that he would one day teach the world how to sleep, poop, and even lose weight. On Valentine's Day, 2004, Tony lost his voice and it never came back. After twenty-three doctors couldn't figure out the problem, Tony decided it was time to dig for his own answers. Eight years later, not only did Tony figure out his own issues, he also happened upon hidden information about how to improve countless other health problems. Though Tony likes to boast about the fact that he holds no legitimate credentials (nor does he believe that we need any more \"experts\" from the same pool of knowledge already failing so many with health issues), he is greatly respected by his peers in the natural health industry. The biggest manufacturers in the health, fitness and organic products industries send Tony their products every year in hopes of winning one of his GearAwards. Beyond working with many celebrity clients, Tony is on the executive board of the Coalition For Health Education, a nonprofit association that helps professionals and their clients learn about health through nutrition. Additionally, Tony teaches monthly webinars about nutrition to doctors, nutritionists and other health care professionals from more than thirty-five countries. You can also find Tony producing documentaries like, WHY AM I SO FAT? A film that teaches the truth about weight loss while showcasing Tony's client, Gabe Evans, who lost 200 pounds in 9 ½ months by treating Tony's word as gospel.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Max, you’re a well-\n\nknown author in the mystery/suspense field – why not use a joint byline for the novels you’re \n\nwriting with your wife Barbara?Max Allan Collins:WhenRegenerationandBombshellwere first published, we \n\ndid use both of our names, but there was hardly any room on the covers for anything else!  A \n\nfew years later, when we began doing the humorous, cozy “Trash ‘n’ Treasures” mysteries – \n\nstarting withAntiques Roadkill– we felt we needed something shorter and snappier.  I grew up with my family and friends calling me “Allan” and “Al,” because I was Max Allan Collins Jr., and my father was already using “Max.”Barbara Collins:Using Barbara Allan for our byline seemed perfect, because \n\nI’ve always called my husband Al - or Allan... two syllables, whinny... when I was irritated or \n\nmad.  Also, “Barbara Allan” would resonate with readers because of the familiar folk song... \n\nand it couldn’t hurt to be positioned first on alphabetically-arranged bookstores shelves.Q:TheAntiquesnovels are, as you just described them, cozies.  But bothRegenerationandBombshellare thrillers.  You could even callRegenerationa horror novel.  Do \n\nyou think yourTrash ‘n’ Treasuresreaders will find them a shock to the system?MAC:I don’t think so.  Both have a good deal of humor in them, and I’d \n\ncallBombshella comic thriller.  We wouldn’t have replaced our cumbersome joint byline with \n\n“Barbara Allan” if we thought those readers wouldn’t have a good time.BC:While ourAntiquesseries is considered “cozy,” they are also our own take on the genre: subversive, a little irreverent, and more realistic, the characters and subject matter being drawn from our own lives and experiences.Regenerationwas another life concern, especially for Boomers – the need to continue to work, and retain earning power well into our fifties and sixties.  With the current political talk of extending age requirements for Social Security and Medicare further, this subject seems even more relevant today.Q:Max, you’re known for noir fiction, butRegenerationhas a sort of \n\nAlfred Hitchcock flavor.  Is it fair to say it seems more reminiscent of Barbara’s short story \n\nwork than, say, your Nathan Heller historical novels?MAC:Very fair.  Barb began her writing career doing short stories, many of \n\nthem for the popularCat Crimesanthologies, and she’s an expert at darkly comic tales with a \n\nsting in the tail.  BothRegenerationandBombshellare novels that are expansions of short \n\nstories Barb wrote.BC:As an impressionable youngster in the 1950s, watchingAlfred Hitchcock \n\nPresentshad a very profound effect on me, as did episodes of theTwilight Zone.  I loved \n\nthe twist endings, and oftentimes ironic conclusions.  While Max is a natural writer, it comes \n\nhard to me, so I must have an emotional connection to the material - a point to make, or a \n\nsocial theme to explore, or I can’t do it.  Adding humor is a must.Q:Max, you seem to have a fascination for Marilyn Monroe.  Your recent \n\nNathan Heller novel,Bye Bye, Baby, deals with her death, and there’s a novella about Heller \n\nmeeting Marilyn,Kisses of Death, in the collectionTriple Play.MAC:Actually, it’s Barb who is the Marilyn collector and Marilyn buff.  \n\nShe has always struck me as a Marilyn Monroe lookalike, though she might deny that herself – \n\nstill, I was able to use a photo of her for the cover ofTriple Play.  She was very much the \n\nin-house expert on Marilyn for both of those Heller stories.  She’s written several short \n\nstories about Marilyn, including the one that we expanded intoBombshell.BC:I vividly remember when Khrushchev came to the United States.  I was \n\nten, and terrified of him, having seen his bellicose blustering on TV, banging his shoe on the \n\ntable, and holding up a small globe of the world as if to say it was his.  Russia had Sputnik \n\nup, after all, and we were far behind in the arms race.  Then Khrushchev said he wanted to come \n\nto America – I don’t think he was even invited – and demanded two things: to meet Marilyn \n\nMonroe, and see Disneyland.  In reality, he did get to meet Marilyn at a Hollywood dinner, but \n\ngoing to Disneyland was deemed too dangerous by the Secret Service and KGB.  In our book, the \n\nPremier does get to the theme park, but under the cover of darkness, spirited away by Marilyn, \n\nwho unwittingly uncovers an assassination attempt.  This book is as much about Khrushchev as Marilyn – he was a complex man, and reading his memoirs was very helpful in bringing him to life.Q:Will there be more Barbara Allan thrillers?MAC:We just signed to do another three Antiques novels, as well as some \n\nshort story “singles” in the series.  But I think Barb and I both have a strong interest in \n\ndoing standalone thrillers.BC:So far we’re not having trouble continuing on with the series, as \n\nstories seem to grow out of previous ones, and we do have an ongoing soap opera aspect to the \n\nbooks.  But my first love remains the short story - a tale complete unto itself, with a more \n\nfocused point to make.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Though she initially called itElinor and Marianne, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she \"loves him tenderly,\" she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister:Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure.--Alix Wilber", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

St Christopher's Live Your Life e-zine 'one of those entirely pointless but interesting journeys so beloved by those with an exploring nature... the first person to circumnavigate London in a small boat using the city's network of rivers and 200-year-old canals... what's best in Hughes's account are his whimsically philosophical musings on his various sailing experiences...' The Daily Mail 'Steffan Meyric Hughes, a boating journalist, takes us on a looping clockwise tour ... in his tiny dinghy, with autobiographical side trips and historical digressions. It works very well. The mixture of cartoony mishaps, encounters with eccentric waterborne humans (and the odd angry swan), historical trivia and seafaring adventure stops the book from languishing in the doldrums. The unusual perspective on the London that we take for granted launches Hughes into romantic rhapsodies on the transcendental, elemental experience of sailing. The result is an intriguing and lively read.' Time Out 'full of interesting facts and details... he meets a wide variety of London characters... great new book...'

Brooklyn is the basis for her inspiration and where she still calls home.  Before writing memorable stories for children, Nancy earned a Bachelors Degree in Psychology from Hunter College in NYC. She was employed at Citicorp, from 1984–98 in various Human Resources Functions. After exploring a career in the corporate sector, residing in NYC, traveling and sometimes skiing through Europe and out West, Nancy returned to Brooklyn and started a family.  Nancy has authored seven stories to date. “The Caterpillar that Wouldn’t Change” is her first published story. Nancy didn’t grow up longing to be a writer. In fact the urge, as strong as it is, is relatively recent. After her father’s passing, it was the birth of her daughter that compelled Nancy to write her first story “Papa in the Sky” a story about a young girl wanting to know more about her late grandfather.  Nancy channels her motivational messages through her writing to help children as well as some adults address common issues. Some of these issues include questions about death/heaven, dealing with change, accepting differences in others, feeling similar, stealing, appreciating your twin, and making meatballs! Nancy is a member of the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators (SCBWI). When she isn’t writing, Nancy enjoys music, reading biographies, recreational running, skiing, weight training, classic art, and time with her children. An avid cook and cooking student, Nancy has also been featured on the Food Network.

With expertise in both comparative theology and traditional Jewish texts, he again demonstrates his impressive ability to tackle this vital topic. He not only delves deeply into Jewish reflections on Christianity and Islam but assembles enlightening but little-known texts on Eastern religions as well.' - Adam Gregerman, Institute for Christian & Jewish Studies'Alan Brill examines the attitudes found in Jewish classical literature and contemporary writings towards western and eastern religions. The perspective is designed to argue for a more inclusive and tolerant stance based on modern mind-sets and deeper understandings of Christianity and Islam and even Judaism itself. His wide knowledge of world religions allows him to present original and thought-provoking arguments for greater religious recognition of the other.' - Herbert Basser, Queen's School of Religion, Queen's University, Kingston Canada'In presenting the urgency, the possibility, but also the complexity of a Jewish engagement with other religious traditions, Brill works consistently with concrete texts and particular contexts. Doing so, he not only speaks appropriately to Jews but challengingly to Christians. By being uniquely Jewish, Brill's book is a distinctive contribution to the general discussion on how to make religious sense out of religious diversity.' - Paul Knitter, Paul Tillich Professor of Theology, World Religions, and Culture, Union Theological Seminary, New York'Alan Brill's work is an encyclopedic contribution to the literature on religious pluralism. It is at once a guide to the spectrum of Jewish interpretations of other faiths, an insightful analysis of the contemporary interreligious landscape, and a sampler of Brill's own comparative thinking in regard to some major traditions. Through argument and by example, this book encourages a new depth of Jewish engagement in the theological discussion of diversity.' - S.

Or when during a conversation with Sam, Josh reflects, 'she beat me to the last piece of papaya, at the time it seemed like a great hardship to forgo the last piece.'Of life not literature, lovers Josh and Sam in India; of a generation not greatly written about yet, Josh from Australia, Sam from England, she has had previous lover, went with Josh on spur of the moment to India. They are in love but unhappy together and unhappy apart. This is the centre of the story but so is India: all intertwined. About drug culture we discover Sam is dependent on drugs seems no way out for her. 'I must go back to Joe,  just for my piece of mind if nothing else,' said Sam. 'I can't get him out of my mind.' Joe whom we never see, has been in prison in England. 'He needed me and I just left...I can't live with myself...I can't forget him...I think about him everyday...I love you Josh but I must go back...I love you Josh....'", "related": ["B00H4J4HQI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But the rest of the 1970s were stormy times for Bombardier as rising energy prices, a maturing snowmobile market, and major economic forces sent the entire industry into a downward spiral.The Bombardier Storydescribes how close to ruin the company came, and how it survived.This near-collapse ensured that the company would never again depend so heavily on one sector. Diversification became a key strategy and led to a move into the manufacture of rail equipment, even as most other North American firms in the industry were withering away in what was deemed to be a declining industry.The Bombardier Storyrecounts the decisive turning point—the $1 billion \"deal of the century\" in 1982 to provide over 800 subway cars to the city of New York. It was the breakthrough that launched Bombardier into the big leagues, but it was hard won, arousing the first of many controversies over government assistance.Next came the diversification into aircraft manufacturing. A key ingredient in the upward climb was the \"bet-the-company\" decision to develop the Canadair regional jet, a pioneering aircraft that many industry analysts at the time thought was a foolhardy initiative. Bombardier not only proved them wrong, but revolutionized the air travel industry with this new jet.The Bombardier Storyis one of inspiring entrepreneurship, as well as outstanding leadership and management. The company has enjoyed phenomenal growth in its chosen markets through product innovation, strategic diversification, exemplary succession planning, and an amazing knack for acquiring ailing companies and making turnaround successes of them.A fascinating cast of dedicated leaders has guided the company over the years. First, of course, was Joseph-Armand Bombardier, the passionate inventor-industrialist who turned a humble garage into a major manufacturing company, and his invention, the Ski-Doo snowmobile, into a household name. Then came the son-in-law, Laurent Beaudoin, whose career plan never included joining the family business, and who led the company for forty-five years, putting it on a fast-growth trajectory.Beaudoin steered the company through the golden age of snowmobiles, the 1973 oil crisis, challenges from aggressive competitors, and moments of uncertainty. And, most notably, he led the company to achieve an extraordinarily ambitious plan for diversification. Along the way he was assisted by able lieutenants, including Raymond Royer and Robert Brown. Laurent Beaudoin and his team were able to show the world that a Quebec company can become a globally respected multinational, can be successfully passed down from generation to generation, and can achieve true sustainability.Today, in the CSeries era, there is a new generation of leadership under CEO Pierre Beaudoin, Laurent's son, who oversees a multinational corporation of two major groups, with $17.7 billion in annual revenues in 2011, over 65,400 employees, and where the entrepreneurial spirit on which the company was founded still thrives.", "related": ["B00JUWYGDQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This provocative notion lies at the center of Wilkinson and Rogers' debut novel, the first in a series, about a circle of friends who have incredible powers. Rick Walters never believed himself to be ordinary, and he soon discovers just how on target his instincts are. He struggles to save his local church, which he believes is growing too large to serve its population, but he's unaware that dueling demons and angels threaten to upset the world's spiritual balance. The angel Praymar chooses Rick to receive an intense, astounding power--insight into the will of God--that allows Rick not only to remedy the turmoil in his church, but also to right the wrongs of humanity. Meanwhile, he also falls in love with Christine Feldman, a beautiful lawyer in his small Marquette, Ohio. They soon discover that their close friends also have a secret--one that may overpower Rick's new powers and threaten the safety of humanity. As good and evil fight to the finish, Rick focuses his energy on bringing the world closer to God's will. In simple, clear prose, the authors tell the story of Rick's archetypal quest to right humanity's wrongs. They engagingly portray him as a hero in every sense of the word, with his love for Christine symbolizing the pure, sacred love that can be achieved on Earth. The twisted path that Rick travels to fight evil keeps the story teeming with possibility and energy, and many Christian readers will find surprises, inspiration and comfort within these pages. A supernatural tale of good and evil that offers a new spin on a classic theme.", "related": ["B00AFB2ENA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I had so much fun writing it!Growing up as a Navy brat, I learned to appreciate living in new places and having to adapt, so I wanted to write a story that moved.  It does move!  It moves from Paris; to Washington, D.C.; to the Gulf Coast of Florida; and finally to the tranquil Florida Keys.  (Well, the Keys aren't so tranquil in this story.)  I didn't want the story to get stagnate and I intended for the characters to keep hopping on their toes. It was interesting to see how the characters reacted and adapted to their environments.  As I watched the characters develop on the computer screen, I fell in love with them.  They are so much like all of us.  They  have so much spunk and tenacity; they have to keep going no matter what life throws at them.The kids in the story are so much fun!  I really enjoyed getting into the head of Will, the oldest child. The reader is often privy to his true, unfiltered thoughts.  Will is brilliant and a think outside of the box kind of guy.  Tommy tries so hard to follow in his older brother's shoes, but we really see his own character develop. Tommy has a deep sense of integrity and is always on the move. Izzie, the youngest child, can be quite hysterical with her wide range of vocabulary and her honest comments.  They are so much fun as as we witness their reactions and comments when put in challenging situations.The kids are surrounded by wonderful, caring, wacky characters.  Their Aunt Lizzie is big hearted and tries to do it all, but she just can't. She finds herself in embarrassing situations where she is totally out of her comfort zone and often she falls flat on her face.  Of course, there are always people there to witness her shortcomings.  If you are like me, you can relate and know that in times like those, you just have to laugh at yourself.  Poppy is a big part of Lizzie and the kids' lives and she is sure to be a favorite of the reader. She is loud in every way, from how she dresses to her big voice. She embraces who she is and says exactly what she thinks.  I wish I could be more like her!I would love for YOU to share your comments on PURSUIT OF PEACE with me.  Find me on Facebook and Twitter.

She likes to think of it as a family tradition and has amassed a large collection of files on several hundred people currently sitting on death row.Jessie's icon is true crime author Ann Rule and she likes to take the time to read actual court transcripts just as Rule does. She believes it makes for a more realistic story. Gentry bases her stories on true crime cases and facts, but fictionalizes a portion of the stories to protect the true identities of those other than the perpetrators, including law enforcement personnel. Gentry lives with her husband of thirty years and her two Jack Russell Terriers, Flynn and Molly just north of The City.

I want to offer young readers an alternative to good exciting reading with a Christian point of view.Judy began to write professionally in l983; since then she has had numerous books published and was the recipient of the 1991 first place for juvenile fiction presented by the National Federation of Presswomen..Judy Baer feels that the Cedar River Daydreams series is in many ways a dream come true for a writer. \"Its a messy world we live in. Sometimes it is difficult to tie problems into neat packages and solve them by page two hundred. The Daydreams series will allow both author and reader to follow characters through their joys and disappointments, through their growth and maturation, through the teenage years. Any problem or situation that teenagers face may someday be a topic of a Daydreams novel.Remembering vividly her own feelings and emotions as a teenager helps her develop stories that ring true to teens. Judy says,\"If the characters in Daydreams can in some way act as role models or encourage readers to hold fast to the Christian faith, then I will have reached my goal. I want to create readable, enjoyable, uplifting and just plain fun books that will keep readers coming back for more.\"size : 4.2 x 7", "related": ["B00BGH8PD0"], "rank": 2137267, "title": "Price of Silence (LIVE!

The question and answer format of the book is reassuring forthe beginner, and a delight for the more experienced reader as well. (Anne Alonso, Ph.D.)A Primer on Working with Resistanceis much broader than the title would suggest. Stark describes the entire panorama of the therapeutic encounter in a style that is forthright, simple to understand and yet not oversimplified. Martha Stark manages to offer practical advice within the context of a sophisticated reading of psychoanalytic theory.A Primer on Working with Resistanceis an invaluable and unique guide. (Modell, Arnold H., M.D.)Emphasizing from the beginning the primacy of one's relationship to the object in addition to the roles of drive and of self, Stark weaves a challenging, cohesive thread originating from parental trauma and reactive defenses against grieving, which serve to preserve a relationship to the early object at the expense of what she refers to as 'illusion' and 'distortion.' The goal of treatment becomes the search to replace traumatic frustration and need with 'capacity,' and with the bravery of facing the unbearable reality of parental fallibility and abusiveness.

His newest collection of short fiction showcases his penchant for bending genre conventions in imaginative and provocative new ways. In the title story, a woman with little memory of her former life finds herself imprisoned in a pitch-black cell and struggles to keep her sanity by writing a journal entirely in her head. “Skating the Shattered Glass Sea” tells the story of a dying businessman who pays a visit to the asylum where his mentally ill twin sister, unseen for more than 50 years, is still erecting the imaginary castles they created together as children. The protagonist in “Grace” revisits the childhood home and small closet where an abusive stepfather kept her confined with her fantasies. Every piece in the volume bears the stamp of Conlon’s gift for combining subtle terror with unforeseeable plot twists. Connoisseurs of cutting-edge horror will not want to miss it. --Carl Hays", "related": ["B009GJRF8G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her characters aren't just characters, they are \"real\" people who let you into their lives and their innermost secrets.  I wish this story could have gone on and on....  Amish books are my favorite read and I've thoroughly enjoyed all of Mary Ellis'.  I highly recommend this book.Always in My Heart by Mary Ellis is a poignant story about Hope Bowman, an Amish wife who gave up her firstborn when she was a teenager, a secret she never told her husband. They have beautiful daughters, but deep in her heart Hope wonders if God is punishing her for past sins when the son they long for never comes. When God answers Hope's prayers, He provides the miracle of a son in a way she never imagined.I loved this story. Mary Ellis is one of my favorite Amish fiction authors and if you've never read any of her books, this is a wonderful way to be introduced to her writing. The characters are real-to-life and capture your heart on the first page. I first read this novella in the book,  An Amish Miracle, a collection of three novellas. I liked this story so much I bought the Kindle edition of Always in My Heart so I could read it again on the go. I highly recommend this story and once you read it, I think you will too.", "related": [], "rank": 1038617, "title": "Always in My Heart: An Amish Miracle Novella", "author": "Mary Ellis", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Where did it all begin? In 2008, I published my first novel, The Captain’s Lady, a contemporary military romance, through The Wild Rose Press. I’ve since received the rights back from my publisher, and I rewrote the book and republished it with a brand new title, Saved. I write edgy romantic suspense (Walk the Right Road Series), western romance (Finding Love ~ The Outsider Series), and young adult mystery, and I warn my readers to expect the unexpected. I’m a mother of three children and we live on a small island in the Pacific Northwest. I encourage you to contact me by email; I do answer every email I receive. Stay tuned. There is more to come from the Walk the Right Road Series and Finding Love ~ The Outsider Series, as well as a brand new western romance series coming later this fall, The One.

The main narrative, which opens a week earlier, reveals how Blackstone got into this fix. The new head of Special Branch, Superintendent Brigham, tells Blackstone to deliver £25,000 in cash to a German known only as Max in exchange for information on U-boats. Max has asked for Blackstone by name, and he's forbidden Blackstone to have any backup. As Blackstone fears, the exchange late one night at a London dockyard doesn't come off as planned. Now a fugitive, Blackstone embarks on an unlikely journey that reunites him with a Russian spy from a previous outing. The introduction of a notorious historical figure doesn't increase the plot's plausibility.

Once reading it, kids will understand better the amazing life of whales. florryalyna Oct 8, 2013Beautiful pictures accompanied by short and easy to understand facts. It's a book that can be read straight through or in small quick facts since it's easy to pick up where you left off. Once again Mr McDonald has produced a book that should be in every school library. I received a copy of this book in exchange for providing this honest review. lexiesmom Oct 3, 2013I was given this book in exchange for an honest review. I was amazed at some of the pictures. My son was up in the middle of the night and couldn't sleep, we read this book together. He is four and loved it. He had me reread it three times. He even started telling me facts. The only downfall is in my copy there were some grammatical errors, but with a little more editing it would be a fluent and easy read. sportzmomof 5 Sep 30, 2013", "related": ["B004SUP1XO"], "rank": 2425977, "title": "Whales (Amazing Pictures And Fun Facts Book About Whales)", "author": "Barry J McDonald", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As an Author, I try to keep my stories as tasteful as possible while still remaining true to my characters. The men in my stories are over the top Alpha males, who will do anything to get the woman that they have set their sights set on. If any of these things offend you, then this is not the series for you.  I do not write stories that leave you hanging in hopes of you having to buy the next book. My stories are complete and will not leave you feeling as if you were forced into buying a sequel. Though my books come in series, each book is capable of standing alone and can be read without having to go through a numerical sequence. I also go out of my way to keep my pricing fair to the reader, because these books are 'self-published' and they are not as long as a standard published book would be. I chose to self-publish these fiction books in order to build up a fan base. As is the case of any other writer, I am growing and learning daily. I am constantly researching and studying in order to better myself for the people who enjoy my books. As my fan base grows and finances come along with that growth, I can promise my readers the traditional published and edited books. Though I am not a world renowned Author, I do have a very vivid imagination and the capability to tell a very emotive and provoking story. I look forward to growing with you and for you, because in my world it is all about you the reader.

Bobby is also the secret boyfriend of Angela Quintana, whose father Anthony, a successful criminal attorney, is having trouble letting go of the two main women in his life: his daughter and his former fiancée, Gail Connor. Angela asks Gail to help her clear Bobby; Gail is torn, knowing her participation will bring her face to face with the man she still loves.Roger is the second Cresswell to die violently; his sister, a talented artist who was the wife of Anthony Quintana's client, took her life at the height of her fame. Those facts seem like more than coincidence to Gail, whose efforts to unravel the family secrets that seem to be at the core of the Cresswell deaths are complicated by her fondness for Angela, her belief in Bobby's innocence, and a surprising secret of her own.Suspicion of Maliceis as much a love story as a murder mystery, but Parker invests her plot with enough stylish touches to keep the momentum going. She excels at characterization--Gail's emotional depths and conflicted feelings are well explicated, Anthony's old-world machismo and modern vulnerabilities sympathetically portrayed, and the secondary players, especially Gail's mother and Anthony's grandfather, clearly and convincingly drawn. As in previous outings (Suspicion of Deceit,Suspicion of Betrayal), Parker has used the sexual tension between Gail and Anthony as they collaborate in crime-solving to good effect; how the events in their relationship that drive this thriller to its violent conclusion will affect their professional as well as personal affairs awaits a future installment.--Jane Adams", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

(After all, he was referred to as \"Don.\") According to the legends of his exploits, the fictional libertine fulfilled a particularly gallant role in courting the many bored wives who found themselves languishing in arranged marriages of the times. It is mind-boggling to consider how well the Don would have done with the advantages of modern technology and a copy of The Perfect Lover's Handbook: The Reason for Great Love Stories by Robert Dubois at his disposal. The book postulates that, although arranged marriages are now mostly a thing of the past, bored married women are still very much with us. And they are still grateful for the attentions of an understanding, considerate, but most of all discreet gentleman. In his book, Robert Dubois provides step by step instructions and insights to the man who may wish to fulfill such a role.Marriages in our modern times are supposed to be for love. Yet even a brief glance at any popular tabloid or blog will affirm that there are a lot of unhappily married women out there. The Perfect Lover's Handbook: The Reason for Great Love Stories by Robert Dubois is the book for any gentleman who may wish to be of assistance to these damsels in distress.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
