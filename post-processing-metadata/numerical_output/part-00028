When the gorgeous blond informs him that she stopped because she had a vision that a man jumped from the overpass, it is the beginning of the end of Jack's bachelorhood. He finds that Opal Smith takes a bit of getting used to, but his tendency to save helpless females keeps him around. Opal is from a family of psychics, all with their own specialty except for her. Her fondest wish is to discover her psychic power, and knowing that no one in her family will believe her, she enlists Jack as an independent verifier as each night she trolls the overpass waiting for someone to jump. This is just the start of the adventures in Skully's mostly lighthearted, breezy tale filled with kooky characters and sudden bursts of sensuality.Maria HattonCopyright © American Library Association.

Credited to the late Matt Christopher but written by Glenn Stout, On the Halfpipe-with Tony Hawk shows how Hawk changed the history of skateboarding. The narrator's clear, understated delivery serves the text well. He doesn't try to sound too \"hip,\" and reads the story with respect and even a certain degree of awe. This approach works especially well in the book's final chapter, a thrilling recap of Hawk's attempts to master a near-impossible move called the 900. Thanks to some exciting writing in this section, de Ocampo helps listeners experience what it must feel like to try this mid-air maneuver. Nothing else in the book matches this passage, but what remains entertains. The first two chapters explore the evolution of skateboarding from a fad that borrowed elements of surfing and rollerskating to the successful industry that it is today. Hawk was not interviewed for this book; the author relies on outside sources to paint a portrait of the skateboarding champ. Listeners learn about Hawk's childhood and his introduction to the sport. Although the book is mostly upbeat, chronicling Hawk's many successes, it doesn't shy away from some of his personal hardships (losing his father, getting a divorce, falling out of favor with the younger skateboarding crowd). Ultimately though, it shows the star landing on his feet and emerging as a successful role model who shatters the stereotype that skateboarders are socially irresponsible misfits. Young skateboarding enthusiasts will enjoy this title.Brian E.

This new kind of turf war between gangs is far more frightening than anything she and her buddies encountered on the battlefields of Desert Storm.

He was right; although a technology professional, Tom seems to specialize in knowledge pertaining to the strange and supernatural. Not only that, but he has an unusual habit of suddenly laughing for no apparent reason.     He suddenly cracks a mysterious smile followed by barely controllable laughter. \"What is it this time, Tom? Another moose running down the hall? Or are you thinking of eating a frozen arm?\" Tom has an active imagination which he often attempts to describe to those around him. But they wouldn't understand if he tried to explain. They couldn't see the mansion filled with grotesque paintings of clowns. They wouldn't see the little boy with an imaginary friend who fondles Mommy while she sleeps. And then there's his unquenchable thirst for the macabre: a world occupied by dolls that come to life, Ouija boards that tell lies, and blood-thirsty, spidery humanoids.    Aside from that, Tom Raimbault is a really nice guy with a love for writing. He hopes to become one of your favorite writers of horror and the bizarre.

Drawing upon numerous exciting outdoor experiences, such as teasing an ornery bull and almost getting skewered in the process, vacationing under the watchful eyes of friendly lizards and diving amidst sharks and stingrays, Harper amuses readers with her comically poignant antics. Each opening narrative is the forerunner to spiritually introspective life-lessons. Harper tells of human desperation for mercy and explains how women can be defined by God's inexhaustible grace. Women of faith who seek God's presence, she says, discover him to be a God who loves without condition. Harper includes endearing entreaties for women to accept their sin-spattered pasts and look to God for forgiveness, fulfillment and purpose. Popular calls to pay homage to professional accomplishment and materialism are, not surprisingly, treated with a firm dismissal. Harper exudes generous applause for intimate and worshipful time with God. Each chapter ends with questions for reader response and suggestions for further Bible study. This book is a welcome pick-me-up for difficult days. Harper reminds women that life is often full of unwanted twists, and that how they decide to meet the unexpected comprises a major part of a successful outcome.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This time, the religious McGuffin is the Q manuscript, a Greek document that was supposedly the source for the gospels and contains additional suppressed sayings of Jesus. The manuscript may be hidden inside a golden shrine unearthed during an archeological dig in Norway. Eccentric Bjorn Belto, the designated site inspector, has spirited away the shrine to prevent it from being illegally shipped out of the country. Belto's efforts to preserve the artifact take him to London and Israel, besides leading him to the truth about his father's death in a climbing accident decades earlier. Belto's quirks are the best part of the book, which loses momentum consistently as it goes along. (Feb.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Morgan conducted over two dozen state-specific test development committee meetings and consultations for real estate clients in those jurisdictions.  His career at ASI culminated in drafting the general examination that, with minor recent changes, remains in use, then reviewing it and all of ASI's sales-level test questions with a national committee of Subject Matter Experts. Morgan entered the field of large-volume test development at the Educational Testing Service (ETS) where he spent several years writing, editing, and assembling material for the verbal portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), Advanced Placement (AP) Literature examinations, and other ETS state and national programs. A professional educator and writer since receiving his Master of Arts in Teaching English from Brown University in 1981, Morgan took his first real estate course in 1978 while studying literature at the University of Connecticut. He held his first real estate license in Rhode Island during graduate school, his second in Arizona, where he sold property in Tucson, and now holds his third in Connecticut, where he currently lives on the eastern shore with his wife, two young sons, and countless cousins. He has completed eight real estate exam prep books that include one for each major national test vendor, several state-specific titles for Connecticut, and a Bermuda Real Estate Guide at the request of the Bermuda government to help prepare its real estate candidates.", "related": ["B006IH6EL8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The 11-year-old is a ghost magnet, but in the past her encounters have been with deceased humans. This time, she is dealing with a dog, which makes communication rather difficult. Allie is elated when she is asked to dog-sit for Hoover, her beloved teacher's pet. When the animal is stolen, Allie is distraught. She soon believes that her ghost dog, Hoover's kidnapping, and the mysterious deaths of puppies at the local pet store are all connected. Allie suspects that the new boy in town, L. J. Cutler, and his menacing father may be running a puppy mill, and she must convince her parents and the local authorities of her suspicions. DeFelice has created a suspenseful tale that will leave readers rapidly turning pages to learn Hoover's fate. The pacing is good and Allie and Dub are likable characters.

Of limited use to small business owners, Flamholtz's principles are more helpful for major firms trying to analyze potential or actual problems.

He offers a unified prescription for management, integrating ideas on topics ranging from product life cycle to leadership styles to organizational structure. He contrasts and explains entrepreneurial and professional management styles, explaining which is needed when, and why the use of the wrong style has led to the demise of some very large firms. Paul Hawken's Growing a Business (S. & S., 1987) is more popular in approach with more nitty-gritty advice for small businesses.

I made up my mind to make this superman’s acquaintance. This I was shortly after enabled to do through the editor of a physical culture magazine commissioning me to visit the Brand Music Hall, Clapham, and take with me a scale with which to test Saxon’s claim that he was raising 300 lbs. overhead single handed twice nightly. The Saxons had no inkling of my intended visit but I was pleased to find that they placed no obstacles whatever in my way; they seemed only too glad to believe that at last something was being done to establish their claims. ...This was because at the time it was quite customary for so-called strongmen to outrageously exaggerate their lifts, one 10 stone (140 lb) lifter calmly claiming a Bent Press of 336 lbs. whilst the bell probably weighed only 140 lbs. or so. ... Once, indeed, at Battersea, the card read 286 lbs., but the bell, of course, was a good 300 as usual. Asked what this meant, Arthur, to my surprise, said, “We have lost the 300 lbs. card and they cost money, but we have a nice 286 lbs. card.” Such behavior had never been known in the lifting world before. ... Thus the Saxons had what others at that time lacked – the method of daily hard work which has got the champions of today where they are. But in this system they stood alone, others did as little as possible and the general standard of lifting was low at the time. I am often asked about Saxon’s measurements and his best lifts. They were as follows: Height, 5ft. 10ins.; Weight, 200 lbs.; Neck, 17; Biceps, 17; Forearm, 14½; Chest 44; Thigh, 24; Calf, 16; Wrist, 8 ½. His best lift was, of course, the Bent Press, or a Two Hands Anyhow with Barbell and Ringweight, the barbell to be pressed single handed and not jerked and changed to one hand (the style which I introduced for the first time in my match with Aston). Arthur Saxon’s British record was 336 lbs. Bent Press and 411 lbs. Barbell and Ringweight. These were performed in strict conditions. He always seemed capable to me of doing substantially more but was never lucky when the attempts were made.\" - Thomas Inch", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Joe Parker writes pulp stories; his brother, Dale, is a natural mechanic who likes to race fast cars; and Joe's friend Adam Bergman has built himself up physically to defend himself against anti-Semitic baiting, which is something that Adam's girlfriend, Catherine Tancred, hears all too much of from her Austrian father. But it's Dale's liaison with the wife of a powerful Chicago banker that leads everyone (including Catherine) to that enlistment booth, since the banker's desire for revenge against the Parkers and their friends is only satisfied when Joe and Dale agree to enlist. Author Reasoner (whose Civil War series includes the novels Manassas and Shiloh) tells a competent story, neither surprising nor disappointing; unfortunately, it's not exciting, either. There's a formulaic silver screen feel to everything, from the basic training scenes (which would probably end up on the cutting room floor) to the obvious device of setting up the only two fathers in the book as a martinet (Catherine's dad) and a drunken lout (Joe and Dale's). No tough choices for the protagonists: all they have to do to be heroic is stand up against unlikable characters. In the end, everything reads as introductory material, from Joe and Dale's assignments as radioman and mechanic to the ending itself, which manages to feel both like a clich‚ and an afterthought. It's The Winds of War on a diminished scale call it The Breeze of War. (June)Forecast: The incredibly prolific Reasoner strikes out here. It'll be uphill work to make this series stick, but wartime action may enliven future installments.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00F2T2W46"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Walt quit school at age eleven, working as an office boy for two lawyers, then as an apprentice at a newspaper, where he learned about typesetting and the printing press. In 1836, Whitman became a teacher, but wasn’t happy and left the job in 1838, founding his own paper, selling it after ten months, and trying his hand at teaching again.   Walt began writing “Leaves of Grass” in 1850, publishing it five years later.  Ralph Waldo Emerson praised the book and it gained in popularity.  The book was rereleased multiple times.  Henry David Thoreau was also a fan and visited Whitman. Walt’s brother George was a Union Soldier during the Civil War and when Walt thought he had died, went to the battle front to find him still living.  Witnessing the carnage affected him and he headed for Washington, D. C. to volunteer as a nurse in the army hospitals. In 1864, George was captured by Confederates in Virginia, another brother died from tuberculosis and another brother was committed to a lunatic asylum.

His exploits have garnered him acclaim in the Guinness Book of Galactic Records, and he once worked as a biomod technician pioneering illegal nano–tek for underhand government agencies. His writing has picked up numerous esoteric awards for visceral hardcore action, clever plotlines, black humour and a willingness to push the boundaries of science fiction and sexual deviancy, all in one twisted whiskey barrel. When kicked to describe himself, Remic claims to have a love of extreme sports, kickass bikes and happy nurses. Once a member of an elite Combat K squad, he has retired from military service and claims to be a cross between an alcoholic Indiana Jones and a bubbly Lara Croft, only without the breasts (–although he’d probably like some). Remic lives in Lincolnshire and enjoys listening to Ronan Keating whilst thinking lewdly about zombies. You can find out more about ANDY REMIC at www.andyremic.com. PRAISE FOR ANDY REMIC “Hard–hitting, galaxy–spanning, no–holds–barred, old–fashioned action adventure.” The Guardian on War Machine “Loud, brash and so in–your–face that it’s actually gone right through and is stood behind you, giving you a good kicking when you least expect it.” Graeme’s Fantasy Book Review on Biohell “It’s been so long since we had Robin Hood, or Conan the Barbarian floating around, and Gemmell – he updated them with class. For me, Gemmell revived my favourite heroes and gave them a good kick in the pants… Mister Remic looks like he could do this, too.” Lateral Books on Kell's Legend “Violent is really not the right word for this spare–no–detail fantasy monstrosity. Insane? Maybe. Really, the only way to describe Remic’s Kell’s Legend is with a phrase: a bloody, violent, fantastic journey through carnage, terror, and a downright epic tale that makes Underworld and every zombie movie look bad… Remic is the Tarantino of fantasy, and if that isn’t a compliment, then I don’t know what is.” Fantasy & SciFi Lovin’ on Kell's Legend “My favourite science fiction novel of the year. Yes, you heard correctly: Peter F. Hamilton, Neal Asher, Richard K. Morgan... War Machine topped them all, and no–one is more shocked than I am! I loved every testosterone–fuelled second. And the sequel is easily one of my most anticipated new releases...” Fantasy Book Critic on War Machine Links: www.andyremic.com www.anarchy–books.com", "related": ["B008GNGW5A"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Pecknold's book fills that gap, and more: it makes a real theoretical contribution of its own, most notably in its treatment of the migration of the treatment of conscience from church to state, and the effects of that migration on the understanding of freedom, political and otherwise.\"--Paul J. Griffiths, Warren Chair of Catholic Theology, Duke Divinity School\"Modern life and thought has a centripetal force, separating into discrete units what should be held together: politics, economics, theology, metaphysics, liturgy, and history. This division of labor creates specialists who can see the units but lack focus for a larger vision . . . In this substantive, readable, brief history of the relation between theology and politics, Pecknold focuses our vision by bringing together his own considerable acumen for both theology and politics. This comprehensive work shows connections that only someone of his breadth of knowledge could see. The result is a first-rate work that sets the bar for political theology.\"--D. Stephen Long, Professor of Systematic Theology, Marquette University\"If it is true that 'youth is wasted on the young,' then to restrict this so-called primer only to beginning learners or students would be wasteful in the extreme. This is a first-rate book, a serious and fascinating work on theology and politics that masquerades as a gateway resource. Yet it also succeeds as an outstanding introduction--readable without being simplistic, engaging key voices and eras in the long interaction between Christianity and politics. I can't wait to use this book with students, both to give them a solid grounding in key ideas and sources, as well as whetting their appetites for joining in these crucial conversations and debates. Anyone with an interest in the church and politics will benefit from this book.\"--Michael Budde, Professor of Political Science, DePaul University\"At last I have found a textbook for my undergraduate course on Christianity and Politics! Pecknold's book is brief and crystal clear, ideally suited to supplement primary source readings in an introductory class. This book helps the student grasp the sweep of Christianity's political history in a relatively few deft strokes. The broad-brush approach does not mean the book is simplistic, however. To the contrary, Pecknold's analysis is insightful, engaging, and at times contentious. Pecknold shows how theological concepts like 'mystical body' have wandered in and out of different political arrangements. In so doing, he shows students how church history and political history are not two separate subjects but one, and a fascinating one at that.\"--William T.

We also mistake superstitious obsession for hard work, believing, for example, \"The idea that,/ if I say it well enough,/ fear/ will be gone.\" And it's a world where degradation is sexy (\"They're beneath you/ and it's hot\") and \"Security cameras/ record each moment, but/ nobody can bear to watch.\" Armantrout is only getting better: these new poems are among her best, and among the most relevant poems now being written.

I would recommend her highly to anyone who needs to find their voice in the world. Jan M., Salt Lake City, UT. --Personal correspondenceI have had Beth's Lawrence Vocal System Exercise CD for about a month now and have found that I am much improved as to my confidence and strength in singing. I feel like I am exercising an unused muscle and each day I play the CD I feel like that voice muscle is getting stronger. When I start singing anywhere, the car, the shower, at home etc. I feel like I have more power to reach notes, sustain notes and my voice is much more fluid and in control. It's so nice to have in the car to practice on the way and coming home from an events and trips as well. I now see that there is great benefit to exercising all of our muscles. Janet S., Ms. Senior Utah, Bountiful, UT --Personal correspondenceI started to do the exercises, reading the booklet and suddenly a voice that I never heard came out of my mouth and it took me by surprise, it was a very strong rich voice that I never thought I had. I am excited! - Jorge M., San Diego, CA --Personal correspondence --Personal CorrespondenceI d like to introduce you to my new singing coach, Beth Lawrence, author of the book, From Shower to Stage! 7 Easy Steps for Singing Like a Pro .Beth has quite an impressive bio. She has been studying singing for over 30 years, and the result is this gem of a book she has published to teach us her singing method, The Lawrence System. With this book, you will learn 7 simple steps to improve your singing, and help to correct anything you may have been taught wrongly in the past. If you ve taken singing lessons somewhere along the line, you may very likely have been taught wrong things, and therefore developed bad habits which have caused you to not enjoy singing as it should be enjoyed joyfully! Beth accurately describes the most common mistakes taught by many singing instructors, and then tells you how to do it the right way.The exercises in the Lawrence System force you to focus on things other than hitting the right notes, and before you know it, you re able to sing notes you didn t think you could, and without straining. The improvements come easily, but you do have to make the effort to practice the exercises, to replace old habits with new ones. If you have about 15 minutes a day, the end result will all be worth it. You ll forget about producing a perfect tone, but rather focus on releasing your natural voice. And that s when you find yourself wanting to sing, no matter who s around... or whether you re in the shower or not. Relax... Beth s method promotes relaxation, because, not only is it important in our everyday stressful lives, but it is also important to be relaxed in order to sing properly. Being nervous doesn t help us do anything well, singing included. However if you relax, and know what you re doing, you ll sing like you never imagined you could. You may be hiding the next Beyoncé or Steven Tyler, (or fill in your own blank here) somewhere in there; and if not, that s okay; the one thing you will certainly learn is to be confident enough in your ability to sing, and that s really all some of us may be striving for here.This book is not only about the ABC s of how to sing. Beth gets you to involve your whole self body and mind in your singing. I found that these 7 steps were all I needed. The exercises are simple and effective. And you can practice them anywhere in your car, in the kitchen while cooking, even when you re in the shower! Finally, you ll definitely want to read this book more than once. I read it the first time, just soaking up all the information. Then I read it again, this time actually doing the exercises as I went along. And I'm not done yet. I plan to keep reading it over again until I no longer need to consult it, until all the information becomes second nature to me. (And then I m going to lend it to a friend of mine who recently claimed she has the worst singing voice ever.)This book comes with a CD for vocal exercises based on the Lawrence System. These exercises are so well explained, they re not just there for you to mimic. In fact, before each exercise, Beth describes the exercise, she then explains the purpose of it, and then guides you along, sitting at her piano while you stand beside her.I believe I have found the only singing teacher I ll ever need. And I highly recommend her to you, too. --Anastasia Karalekas/The Muse's NewsI have been reading and really enjoying your book From Shower to Stage.It really contains a marvelous pot of secrets and techniques that even if you have been singing all your life, will remember and use them during your performances.It is like having a personal Singing Manual!I personally recommend it and agree with your vocalization technics.Bravo! You did it again!Richard M. --Personal Correspondence", "related": [], "rank": 2066115, "title": "From Shower to Stage....7 Easy Steps for Singing Like a Pro!", "author": "Beth Lawrence", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He said the bunks had as many as eight people in them.  At morning roll call they called out by number and the Nazis took certain ones for the gas chamber. Or those that committed crimes as they decided and would hang them and leave them for days as an example. Stas received a busted jaw from a Nazi as he tried to help a fellow prisoner. He wrote his memoirs in 1994. I got them in 2004. They are in Polish. I started serious translation efforts in 2009 and finally finished it.  I had to correct all the Polish errors when I read in the Polish version into my computer then do the translation. I tried to keep his words in the order he wrote them and not interpret what he was trying to say. It was a worthwhile effort to get the book translated. More people need to know about the Holocaust and it effect on Poland and it's people. I tried to get it published but the cost for me was prohibitive for me. And as it turned out a blessing since now it can be downloaded to various platforms digitally.  Stas died in 2004 but his wife Stanislawa is still living in their house in Zatorowizna Poland.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In straightforward, nontechnical, often witty prose, he helps readers identify items on, inside, and under the car, as well as under the hood, and explains what they do and why. He also painlessly reviews a few principles of science and mechanics here and there. The 130 entries range from basic to complex, from bumper and windshield to differential and constant velocity joint boot. They are all accompanied by serviceable black-and-white photos to help readers identify the items under discussion. Perhaps the most enjoyable feature of the book is the inclusion of interesting facts for most of the entries. For example, at the end of the brief discussion concerning speedometers, readers are told that the first speeding ticket was given in 1896 to a driver in Great Britain who was guilty of zooming along at eight miles per hour in a two-mile-an-hour zone. Most of the material concerns passenger vehicles, but there are also sections on off-road vehicles, motorcycles, buses, and human-powered conveyances.—Robert Saunderson, formerly at Berkeley Public Library, CACopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The lessons were not obviously successful and, unlike Beautiful Music, my mother did not come to my to my aid. My sister, however, was excused lessons after a few months because my mother feared the heavy accordion might make her flat-chested. The lessons stopped when we went back to the US. Not entirely traumatised by the lessons, I continued singing fairly seriously in school afterwards and as a rebellious young man, briefly took up chording stringed instruments for busking and generally making a nuisance of myself - I gave up both activities well before I finished a PhD. Fifty years later the accordion, liberated from the back of a closet, became a prized possession of my brother-in-law, a sometimes professional musician.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Each story was filled with adventure, thrills, working through all weather. His exploits and knowledge of droving was second to none and was described in the town as 'the most honest man'.Once I accompanied him on a droving trip, although it was only short by the distances he'd drove cattle or sheep; but this trip gave me a taste of his life. It was his way of life.After thirty years of listening to his stories; watching his ability of a drover, research of his trips, I decided to write his story. Although it is fictional characters, it is his story. I'm proud to have written it.", "related": ["B005C0YG1C"], "rank": 655378, "title": "The Drover", "author": "Pat Ritter", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While raising her children she traveled to  different states with her engineer husband  whenever he was assigned for a year to a nuclear plant. The family always returned to their San Jose home which they kept for 30 years. Sometimes she accompanied her husband to Europe and says that all this moving around, in the States and abroad, gave her the experience and inspiration for her books. Her stories become alive with many different settings and customs. For this reason she easily writes in all the different genres, although her favorite is Historical Romance.  She also credits raising a large family for the insights she has gained in people of all ages.

They are offering products to sell. Products that don't work! I never wanted this. I wanted to create CHANGE!A question you probably have on your mind is, why should you believe that we can help you?As you already know quite well, there are a lot of people running around trying to convince you that they have all the answers. Well, unfortunately for you, we don't have ALL the answers. But we do believe that we have SOME of the answers (and I think the answers are very powerful). And my answer to you is that you SHOULDN'T just blindly believe me. In fact, I would recommend that you PRACTICE my materials with a healthy skepticism. PLEASE PRACTICE MEETING PEOPLE. I want you to TRY what you learn from us. Only after you've seen that this stuff is REAL do I want you to believe us.We think our courses are the best in the world, and we stand behind them. I honestly hope you get incredible value from each one. Modeling is the best way to learn because you get to see it and then you get to mimic it... AND THEN turn it into something based off of you. Based off of your motives, based off of who you are. You will experience our courses online, but the best of the best is the Dating Mastery Course, where I work with you. IT IS BASED ON MENTORSHIP AND COURSE-WORK. I FAIL WITH YOU. I SUCCEED WITH YOU. You will connect with someone sexually just about anywhere- within about 5 minutes or even with 30 seconds.

I want to be apart of the experience and experience with YOU. If you are ready to change....This is not for everybody, but if you're ready to put in the work YOU CAN DO IT. Don't be ashamed to live the sexual life of your dreams.*Bottom Line - You will get Results - I will make sure of it! Sign Up Now!

Not a computer, not an electric typewriter, but a then-state-of-the-art manual typewriter. The story ground to a halt on page 50 but Vanessa never forgot the excitement of bringing her own characters to life. In 1985 Vanessa's novel Pacific Disturbance was published in hardcover by Mills and Boon. She now has over 10 million books sold and has been translated into 15 languages. She also has written what one critic described as, \"by far the best writing book I've ever read.\" Writing Romance, published by Self Counsel Press, won the Under the Covers Best Writing Book Award, and is currently in its third edition. Over the years her love of storytelling and curiosity about people led Vanessa to study psychology, volunteer on a crisis line, complete individual and relationship counselor training, volunteer as a peer counselor for a family life organization, and tell stories about life, love, and secrets. Vanessa is also a university professor, a publisher of educational materials and eBooks, and has given workshops to writers' groups in Australia, New Zealand, the USA and Canada.

Beginning in the shadowy Neolithic era, improving climatic conditions encouraged sheep and goat herding throughout the Fertile Crescent. Manufacture of pottery made possible the storage of excess milk and provided a transportation medium. Primitive acid-coagulated cheeses emerged for local consumption, but the discovery of rennet coagulation made possible hard cheeses with long shelf lives that could readily be shipped across land and sea. During the Middle Ages, innovative European monastic communities developed sophisticated techniques that generated a tremendous diversity of cheeses. Cheddar and Stilton shone in England, France became famous for its Roquefort and Gruyère, and Holland marketed Gouda and Edam. Colonization of the New World and the Industrial Revolution gave rise to today’s mass-produced cheeses, not always to the benefit of quality or flavor. --Mark Knoblauch", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I had lived all over Canada and seen everything my country has to offer, from the enchanting shores of Newfoundland to the gigantic snow capped mountains of British Columbia all by the time I was ten. I did, however, spend most of my life in Eastern Canada where I was surrounded by folklore and legends, not knowing how they would shape my personality and imagination for the rest of my life. Being the only girl of my age in a small group of kids, in an even smaller town, left me spending most of my time by myself and, in result, letting my imagination take over. I would sit by the shore and dream up stories of mermaids and other fantastic creatures to pass the time. Coming from a family with writers and artists dispersed throughout, it was only natural that I spend my time writing, drawing and reading. I dreamed of becoming nothing more than an artist, a creator of any kind. By the age of eleven, I spent most of my waking hours scribbling down short stories, poems and anything else I could think of, while adding my own personal illustrations. By the age of fourteen, I had won numerous minor arts and writing competitions. I excelled at anything art and literature related so, naturally, I planned to attend university for nothing more or less than that. In 2003 I planned to attend university for Creative Writing and Literary Studies. But, with the fear that I would spend all my time and money on an education and end up in a field that I may very well struggle to succeed in, I backed out and attended school for Design instead. Now, a successful Designer specializing in interiors, I met a man and fell in love. His passion and talent for art far exceeds my own, but he motivated me and awakened my old habits of staying up late and waking up early to scribble down dreams and ideas before I had forgotten them and they disappeared forever.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Donaldson spinsÂ a web of intrigue and suspense about a Nation besiegedÂ by foreign and domestic threats.\" - Walker Rutherfurd, Washington DC</span></span>--websiteAuthor of Rude Awakenings, Keith M Donaldson's first love is theater. He has been actor or director for over fifty years, and a playwright since 1988. At about that same time, he began writing mysteries, one of which was made into a movie and released in 2011, Life Fine Tuned.Donaldson has worked in broadcast television and radio (NBC) in a variety of positions and in advertising as art director as well as owner of his own advertising agency. He has freelanced for many magazines, written commentaries, interviewed stars, directors, and playwrights in the greater Washington, DC area. Donaldson is author of two other books, both self-published and one of which won the finalist award in both Politics and Multicultural Fiction in 2008 at the Next Generation Indie Book Awards. (Death of an Intern and The Hill People)Before I read Rude Awakenings, I didn t know much about Keith M. Donaldson, however, I believe he has a home run with this one! The book's main character, Mike MacDonald, is a very well -heeled all-American type man who has just ascended to the highest office in our land, President of the United States of America. While being capable he is new at this job and he is tested early on by a nuclear attack over the city of Detroit in Michigan. His cabinet was not in place when this occurred and as such he must scramble to do so, as well as, make some tough decisions about how to mitigate the nuclear fallout that will come for this horrible act of terror. His key personnel work with him in the White House Situation Room to allocate the resources that can best help the people of Detroit and perhaps Southern Canada and the areas that are contiguous to Lake Erie.A key political nuance is that MacDonald s second/vice-President is a woman. She is also a capable person and well respected in her slot. The two are instrumental in eventually and rapidly coalescing a team of likely to pass cabinet members who can effectively and efficiently help them navigate this political mess. Most are passed, but there is a hitch in one or two.MacDonald is able to bring some very credible players into his fold because of the life he led prior to becoming president and the things and people he came in contact with along that journey. These people lend a solid background and sound decision making in unstable situations to the scene. With a nuclear bomb detonated in this densely populated area they can ill afford panic on the streets. Calm and confidence are what they hope to exude while trying to partner with our friendly allies and some not so friendly in order to locate the responsible parties for this horrible act.In order to let the reader know a bit about the background of the main character Donaldson tells us that she died from Leukemia after the two had been married a scant six years. They had wanted children, but time was not on their side. However, her legacy is a trust for children in the Greater Chicago land area. MacDonald still misses her in his life while half searching for another life partner. --Michelle Kaye Malsbury of Bookpleasures.com", "related": ["B00873GSQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.1667, "rating_total": 25.0}

The painting depicted a woman whose ear had\nbeen cut off and behind her a hanged man. This made me wonder: what\nif the gypsies had had a leader who could have united them to fight?\nAnd what if that leader was a woman? I have always been fascinated by\nthose women leaders in history, who despite all the prejudice against\nour sex, rise to the top.As\nfor the inspiration of the book's title: at its simplest Lupa\nadopts two wolf-cubs whose mother has been killed by hunters. In the book Lupa's people\nbelieve that each person has a spirit animal and Lupa's is of\ncourse the she-wolf. Of course the title is also symbolic. As a leader and mother to her people Lupa transforms them from being hunted to being the hunters - \"her wolves\".The\nbook is a historical fantasy/alternate history. It is set in an unnamed country at an\nunspecified time. But the countryside described in the book is based\non the riverscape of the River Severn in England and so I did a lot\nof research into the history and customs of the area and the natural\nhistory of the river. Of course I researched the history and culture\nof the gypsies in depth, but I also included elements of other\ntravelling cultures, most notably the travelling native peoples of\nNorth America.Although this is a fantasy, there is not a lot of magic in the book: Lupa survives on her wits. Such magic as there is is based on the humans' relationship with animals - Lupa with her spirit animal the wolf and the wisewoman with her fox familiar.Lupa will appear briefly inCompany of Shadowsthe third book ofThe Healer's Shadow Trilogywhich is out this autumn.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 14, "rating_average": 4.4286, "rating_total": 62.0}

He committed his heart to Jesus Christ when he was nine years old, but it wasn’t until thirty years of age that he began to actively experience the work and fruit of the Holy Spirit in his life.  Brandon is deeply passionate about regular “lay-people” rising up as the Body of Christ, and discovering the leadership, power, and authority that He designed them to live out. As such, Brandon has chosen to remain a lay-person, actively living out his calling in the marketplace as well as in the church. He is a serial entrepreneur, with a background in Landscape Architecture and a BA in Ornamental Horticulture from Cal Poly Pomona. He is also a graduate of The Master’s Program, a Christian leadership mentoring program, and out of a desire to be more fully trained, he graduated with an MA in Biblical Studies from a distance-learning school of ministry. Desiree Elrod has been lay-counseling for over twenty years. For the past ten years, she has been leading a prayer and mentoring ministry within her home church, Calvary Church of Santa Ana. This ministry was designed to explore the various roles of prayer in a counseling setting. Based on all her years of experience, Desiree has compiled, written and taught curriculum for Calvary Church’s Women’s Ministry series. Three years ago, Desiree understood the Lord’s calling to launch a Prayer and Healing ministry, and she did so as an official ministry of her church. With its unique emphasis on inner healing, Desiree has ministered to missionaries, church leaders, licensed counselors, and pastors. She has also served as a board member and spiritual director of CLEAR Hope Ministry. Desiree has spoken at numerous women’s events, bible studies, retreats, and abroad. Her focus is consistent; she is passionate about seeing individuals reconciled with and healed by their heavenly Father through the ministry of the Holy Spirit. She has personally seen miraculous healing of emotional wounds, due to a person’s encounter with the Holy Spirit as He restores them to the Father.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The time is 1832, six years after Skye deserted from the Royal Navy to hide out as a fugitive in the wild, harsh mountains of the Pacific Northwest. Skye's reputation as a savvy mountaineer and leader garners a job offer from the prestigious Hudson's Bay Company, but first he must return to London to clear his name. Eager to restore his reputation and see his English family, and assured that a pardon awaits him, Skye agrees to the offer. Accompanied by Victoria, he sails from Oregon on a company ship and straight into trouble. In Mexican California, Skye is recognized as a deserter and must flee the clutches of the Royal Navy, the perfidy of corrupt Mexican officials and the specter of starvation. He and Victoria struggle to return to the safety of the mountains, but first face bandits, an Indian massacre and a hungry grizzly bear. Cohorts in their adventures include a tenacious mongrel named No Name and Alistair Nutmeg, a na?ve, hapless English botanist filled with excitement and little good sense, who provides Skye and Victoria no end of worry as they baby-sit the tenderfoot through the wilderness. Wheeler has a gift for creating believable, convincing characters, and Skye and Victoria are two of his best frontier portrayals. It is their devoted relationship and shared trepidation about the white man's world that endear the reader to this enduring series. The next installment will be much anticipated.

During the Oklahoma bombing trial of Timothy McVeigh, Ms. Kane provided commentary on national television for MSNBC and Tribune Broadcasting and for National Public Radio.  Ms. Kane has accepted many challenging cases. In 1987, she was co-counsel representing Bruce Pierce, a member of the white supremacist group known as The Order, which was perhaps the most challenging of all. Mr. Pierce was indicted in federal court in the shooting death of Denver radio talk show host Alan Berg. Ms. Kane assisted in the defense of Rockwell International, a defense contractor operating a nuclear weapons plant in Boulder, Colorado, for two years during a federal environmental crimes investigation and prosecution.  Ms. Kane has been published nationally and has lectured nationally on trial tactics. Repeatedly, she was invited to return as a faculty member for the Florida Defense College, where she conducted trial skills and tactics workshops for lawyers.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After a failed career as a standup comic and broadcaster, in 2000 Jeremy fittingly became a Social Studies teacher.

His father was Benjamin Ward Baum, who would make a fortune in Pennsylvania Oil, and his mother Cynthia Stanton. Frank, as he preferred to be called, was born with a weak heart so wasn't a boisterous child, but timid and shy. He was home schooled and having few playmates, he also spent hours reading in his father's library. He developed an aversion to the usual scary creatures and violence of folklore and popular children's fairytales of the time and would end up creating his own adaptations of them in order to give other children, later including his own, delight in stories rather than grim and frightful moral lessons. Baum's childhood and home life with nine siblings was happy and no doubt set the tone for his future Oz series. Baum created many endearing and wonderful characters in his work that have brought joy and excitement to generations.", "related": ["B008VDVESK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I'm thinking both of these items will have to wait until my days as a soccer mom are over. Until my happy travels can begin, I'll remain in Baton Rouge with my fabulous husband, David, our three teenagers, (pray for me), and one incredibly demanding cat named, George, (No, I'm serious, pray for me) I'll continue to give the characters in my head a voice while driving our kids to and from school, soccer, softball, cheerleading, tutoring . . . you get the picture. Having said this, you should not find it strange to encounter a sports reference during a love scene or a 'because I said so' during an argument between characters. Those things tend to happen when you're writing a love scene or an intense exchange while cheering on your kid's team. Please do forgive my multitasking downfalls and feel free to share in a little giggle when it occurs. Thank you for choosing Clay's Rules. I completely fell in love with the characters in this story and hope that you will also. I've been asked how I came up with Abbra's name, and I have to admit, it wasn't the creative genius you may have thought. The name Abbra was borrowed from an actual friend of mine. The last name, Truelove, although an absolutely perfect pen name for a romance author, is actually the last name of a cousin of mine . . . a guy no less! Even though I can't claim creative genius where my character's name is concerned, I still think it's a pretty cool name!

Kate grew up in a seaside suburb in Adelaide, South Australia. Her love of books began in childhood and she started reading novels at an early age. Always wanting to write, Kate wrote short stories in my twenties but never submitted them for publication. Then raising a family and helping to run a family business cut short such aspirations. The idea for her first novel, 'Inheritance', came because of an area that we spent much time in and came to love - Far North Queensland.  And so, her writing career began from a need for therapy after a great loss. It’s an ongoing career that brings me much pleasure, and along the way Kate gained the peace of mind she was seeking.  Now, when not writing, Kate enjoys reading, listening to music, good food and wine, and ‘hanging out’ with family and friends. Kate has since published 4 books –  • An Independent Woman,(Redwood Trilogy) 2009 • A Liberated Woman, (Redwood Trilogy) , 2010 • Reflections (Short Stories) 2011  •  Eat Cook Slim (Healthy Eating & Weight Loss) 2013", "related": ["B00HHCFV5S"], "rank": 1916312, "title": "A Liberated Woman: Redwoods Trilogy Book 2", "author": "Kate Loveday", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The nature of my conversations with clients had become different...people didn't want to talk about retirement projections or the 'latest and greatest' investments, they wanted to know how they could sleep again at night in spite of all the fear surrounding the markets, the economy, and their lives. I began to realize that I was no longer a \"Financial Advisor\" in the traditional sense--I had become more of a coach, guiding my clients to self-awareness and empowerment, so they could better manage their emotional responses to money...and life. As a Wealth Intuitive, I guide clients in attaining confidence, wealth, and inner- peace by strengthening their emotional relationship with money. In large part, my role as a Mentor is to help my clients shift their current perception of what money is...to transcend their current beliefs and recognize money as their teacher. It is your relationship with money that will teach you about your true Self, your relationship with others, and the world. I also believe that money is more than the exchange of currency, more than paper, coin, or debt. Money is symbolic of the giving and receiving of love, appreciation, insights, creativity/ideas, inspirations, peace, and joy. So it's not really about the money per se, it's about what money and your relationship with it, is trying to teach you, about you. I am the Owner and Founder of the Mathieu Center for Financial Wholeness, a Wealth Ministry for Women. I receive great joy in mentoring women to realizing their \"true wealth\" potential by transforming their emotional and spiritual relationship with money. It saddens me to see brilliant women continue to live their lives from a place of lack and insecurity, which is why I created \"Financial First Aid for Divorce for Women\" and \"Financial First Aid for You\"...two programs that will guide you to experiencing greater ease, joy, and abundance in the context of your relationship with money and life.  \"If a person gets his attitude toward money straight, it will help straighten out almost every other area in his life.\" ~Billy Graham", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When I was a little boy, I would tell stories and have adventures in the backyard pretending I was in a circus in front of an audience of my family and neighbors.

In High School and College, I donned my glasses and disguised my super writer self in my computer nerd persona and while I still told stories and had adventures, they were never made publicly known. Many years later, I decided that it was time to remove my disguise and let my stories out in the world again. My first adventure, Grimm End, was published in 2012 with four more Grimm End novels planned for 2013 through 2015. CJ Kask, the 106 year old explorer from Grimm End, also appears as an eleven-year-old adventurer in Young Explorers and the Inca Wraith, the first book of the Young Explorers series which was published in 2013. In addition, a sprawling swords and sorcery fantasy novel series and a number of computer thrillers will appear over the next several years. Outside of writing, I have adventures with Kay, my wife and future author of her own books, my two wonderful daughters and their families including three grand-children (and one on the way) and two grand-puppies.

Now one of America's most respected Bible teachers, Warren Wiersbe, mines the Lord's petition for its rich theological and practical gems. The intercessory prayer reveals Jesus' priorities and concerns as he faced the final hours before his death. By studying this prayer, Christians can learn what was most important to Jesus and make his priorities their own. The Intercessory Prayer Of Jesus addresses the most pressing concerns of contemporary Christain living, including understanding salvation, making disciples, utilizing spiritual resources, become mature in Christ, creating a genuine community of believers, and balancing truth and love. The result is an expository and devotional study reflecting the doctrinal integrity and relevant teachings of Jesus' prayer recorded some two thousand years ago -- and still very much relevant to Christian life today.  --Midwest Book Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Alex fired a shot, missing everything completely, before the weapon was wrest from her grip and thrown into the hangar.Up close, Alex could see that the two women had quite a bit wrong with them aside from the tails and the shade of their skin. Her vision was immediately brought to their crotches, which had thick, erect cocks pointed with such ill intent toward her. One of the aliens leaned in close, nuzzling against Alex before stopping completely. The other moved in, pressing its body against the brunette as well before they whispered in unison, \"Our queen...\"Alex was far too frightened to correct them, immediately remembering the immortal phrase, \"If someone asks you if you're a god, say yes.\" She didn't have time to react as the alien-infused women stopped for a moment. Their unnaturally green eyes lit up, and a wide grin crossed their lips. Apparently they figured out that Alex was definitely not their queen.Their hands caressed and rubbed over the brunette's sides, teasing the woman with an almost gentle, loving touch with their clawed fingers. Their hard cocks rubbed against Alex's sides, already leaking copious amounts of jizz over her uniform. The liquid dripped down the form-fitting, forming a puddle at her bare feet. The warm goo made the brunette cringe as the slid between her toes.The duo of aliens pushed themselves forcefully against Alex, flicking their elongated tongues against the exposed flesh of her neck and cheek. The whole situation was gross and terrible to think about at first, and suddenly it started to feel kind of nice.Both of the aliens began licking and suckling at Alex's neck, forcing her to squirm uncomfortably as each toyed with her. She still wanted to escape, but something deep in the back of her mind was wanting her to go along with it out of curiosity.", "related": ["B00CB719H8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story begins with a rather grisly murder and the race itself presents an exciting climax before the story comes full circle and we learn the killer's identity.First Tuesday captures the thrill and excitement of the Melbourne Cup itself. It follows battling country trainer Jack Morgan's quest to win the race with his wonderful mare Star Chaser, while introducing us to ruthless casino magnate Albert Maressmo - the man who owns pre race favourite Lord Melbery.Writing the book was an absolute joy and there were times I thought I would never finish the running of the race itself, such was the emotion that overwhelmed each time I tried.

He gained favor with Sweden’s King Charles XII, who gave him the position of overseer of the Swedish mining industry. Later, he was given a seat on the Swedish House of Nobles by Charles XII’s successor, Queen Ulrika Eleonora. Between 1743 and 1745 he began to have visions of heaven, hell, and Jesus Christ which resulted in a stream of books about the nature of God, the afterlife, and the inner meaning of the Bible. He devoted the last decades of his life to studying Scripture and presenting his own unique theology to the world.", "related": ["B00EEDTSVG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She is called back to London to be with her dying sister, Jeanette, a journey that is challenging in many ways. Years before, Constance fell in love with her sister’s husband and ended up not only heartbroken but also estranged from the family. Because she was a foundling and raised by adoptive parents, the rejection hit her very hard. Her solution—to flee to Bali—has anchored her until now. Following Constance from lush Bali back to noisy London, the story line also meanders around Jeanette’s son, Noah, and his girlfriend, Roxana, who is from Uzbekistan and does her own soul-searching. The different characters water down the plot, but some may be interested in the tangles of old family hurts and the potential power of true forgiveness. --Julie Trevelyan", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is through this work, in the trenches, that he developed his parenting program, Getting Your Kids to Think! His background that prepared him for this includes:  • 7-years experience supervising, developing, and implementing juvenile shelter care for the 18th Judicial District of Montana in compliance with state and federal regulations and setting up a 501(c) 3 non-profit status. Responsible for coordinating implementation of CASA/GAL programs in the state of Montana; training the justices for the Mt. Supreme Court. Established the Bozeman Shelter Care Facility, removing juveniles from adult detention centers not being held on capital offenses. • 14 years working for the State of Washington Division of Children and Family Services,  in FRS/CPS providing emergency services to law enforcement and private agencies.   Most cases were multi-disciplinary and required teamwork and an understanding of current practice in risk assessment and child abuse. • 11 years as the Foster Parent Trainer Certifier for the Chance Program of Comprehensive Mental Health Services, Tacoma, Washington. Researched and wrote material for staff and monthly seminars. Developed a complete library of audio, visual and printed materials. Increasing responsibilities included training and writing the manual for CMH Child Respite Program, the Behavior Management Program, and an equivalency program to Foster Parent Scope.  • 18 years developing my training program, Getting Your Kids to Think!, for private and non-profit agencies in raising biological and foster children.

The current version from BPG has undergone a massive overhaul and in my humble, albeit highly partial opinion, makes for a much better story.Review snips from the previous versions:\"This is medieval romance at its best -- full of intrigue, pageantry, and steamy sensuality. A wonderful debut from a very talented author! Denise Lynn is fantastic!\"  ~ Award winning author ~ Tina St. John aka Lara Adrian ~ \"Lord of Vengeance\" / \"Lady of Valor\"---Get ready to put aside those waiting chores as you will find yourself riveted to the tale of the Dream Knight!!! You may not want this heroine's initial dream but you will definitely crave the devouring love that ensues and grows despite formidable barriers! ~ Viviane for What I'm Reading---. . . New author Alexis Kaye Lynn weaves a girlish fantasy, the dream bag, with the reality of 12th century politics and intrigue.  The horror of war is a compelling contrast to the dreams and hopes of a young woman.  Readers of medieval romance will enjoy this well-researched story with its richness of detail as they root for these strong-willed characters to put aside the past and embrace their future.  I hope to see more from this talented writer.\" ~ Diane Burton ~ Scribes World Reviews ~ 4 1/2 Stars---\". . . Catheryn and Gerard's rocky path to love makes for a good story, with mystery and intrigue propelling the characters along. Time spent with Gerard and Catheryn is most pleasant, indeed.\"~ Writers Club Romance Group on AOL---\"This is a wonderfully written story, set in Medieval England...This is one of those books that suck you in so completely that you leave dishes in the sink and forget to cook dinner! The love scenes are exquisite! Super sexy dialogue and no skipping to the morning after. Denise Lynn has a remarkable gift for bringing her characters to life. If you are looking for a wickedly sexy, humorous, mysterious medieval, then this book is for you!\" ~ Reviewed by Susie Burkett for Romance Fiction---\". . . well written, enjoyable read. The writing is done well, the dialogue clear and not overdone with a good balance of action and narrative throughout the book. The love scenes belonged in the book, and did not seem forced, were not overdone and did not go on incessantly. Catheryn and Gerard are both well-rounded, three-dimensional characters...The fact that while Catheryn accepted Gerard as the man in her dream and didn't just bend to his will was an important aspect to the story, and made her in my eyes a strong heroine. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys medieval romances and is a book I would read again.\" ~ Reviewed by Susan E. DeWitt for Simply eBooks---\"Reminiscent of Jude Deveraux's earlier work, Denise Lynn tells a wonderful tale of a tortured hero whose heart yearns to be free from pain, and a heroine whose heart is yet to be won.\"~ Reviewed by April Redmon (Romantic Times Book Reviews) rtbookreviews.com/book-review/dream-knight---I found myself engrossed in the reading of this book. It was easy to visualize the time period and feel as if I were there while the story was going on. This book is excellent reading. This is a book definitely worth buying. ~ Carol Castellanos for SIME-GEN---With a glorious historical setting and characters that draw attention, Ms. Lynn's writing is exciting and enjoyable. I was swept up in the drama of the events and carried away by the romance between Catheryn and Gerard. In a classic style, the hero and heroine are wonderful people kept apart by outside forces and misunderstandings; the villains are truly despicable; and the action is reminiscent of a dramatic saga. A touching story of betrayal and romance, This book is well worth an afternoon spent reading. Brew a cup of tea, turn off your phone and dive into this wonderful historical romance! ~ Sally G. Laturi for Ivy Quill---In Ms. Lynn's novel she has written an engaging medieval romance that fans of the genre are sure to enjoy. There's plenty of conflict, and while the love scenes are few, they are well done and tasteful. For a trip back in time to knights and damsels in distress, don't miss this book! ~ Terrie Figueroa for Romance Reviews Today---Ms Lynn's story won my heart with such warm and engaging characters that had me actually swooning from the hero's words, and the heroines loyalties. It's not often I find a book written in this period that I don't grow weary of the story...this book surpasses the norm in it's poetic form of two people who are drawn to each other and learn to trust one another despite the odds and obsticles. It is the heart of this love story that carries it through and makes this one just a little different. ~ Rita Hestand for Romanceing the Web---This book is a beautifully crafted novel with bold characters and a finely tuned plot. Ms. Lynn is already a master, or perhaps, a temptress of anticipation. This gripping tale is loaded with suspense and sexual tension. Reveur vows to not only protect his new wife from the fiend de Brye, but to give the passionate Catheryn time to want him without hesitation before the marriage consummation. Which takes longer than the count anticipates, but the sexual dance toward that goal is a treat to read. ~ Debbie Jett, Author's Den---DREAM KNIGHT is a historical romance set during the Middle Ages, which happens to be my favorite historical period of time. Reading the blurb, I hoped that this would be a good read. What I got was a superior story full of intrigue, fast action, and romance. While Gerard and Catherine don't trust each other, they do share a strong physical desire. Gerard's treatment of Catherine is poignant and utterly sensual. Anticipating the action before it happened, I found myself on the edge of my seat, oftentimes yelling at the characters like they could hear me. Realistic emotions, poignant love scenes - DREAM KNIGHT delivered both in spades. This novel is well written and sensual; I quite happily placed it on my keeper shelf when finished. DREAM KNIGHT definitely gets a \"thumbs up\" from this reviewer! ~ Natasha Smith, Romance Junkies", "related": ["B00KY0YURU"], "rank": 1046913, "title": "Dream Knight", "author": "Denise Lynn", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I think applying Deirdre of the Sorrows to a modern Ireland is something I haven't seen attempted, at least not like this, and is very worth trying.Storytelling is a big part of Irish culture and keeping the old stories alive is worth doing any way I can I think.", "related": ["B00HG2KNE8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Little League Baseball and hanging out. Cooper, Gooby, Chuck, Cliff, Bolo, and Scooter are friends, actually closer than friends. Just a normal summer, right? Suddenly, with one swing of the bat, everything changes as tragedy strikes this group of friends. But, that's not all. Soon their small town is paralyzed with fear as a serial killer preys upon children.The Sneaker Tree by Phil Taylor is an excellent story. I would have to classify it as a young adult, paranormal mystery. Although it is told by a 12-year-old boy, adult readers will find it enjoyable as well. For adults, the behavior of this group during this particular summer will have them recalling their own summer experiences. What could be better than baseball and enjoying the company of friends? The author's characterization of the group is well thought out and the dialogue of this group of pre-teens is spot on. The author brings the story nicely along as the suspense grows to a strong exciting climax. The book is a great read and thoroughly entertaining.", "related": ["B00DLS13CW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 28.0}

The murder of a male stripper at an exclusive East Side club leads detective Alvin Yablonsky from the mean streets of the East Village to the exalted realm of the U.N. diplomatic corps. Yablonsky learns that the victim moonlighted as a high-level prostitute, specializing in servicing prominent women whose names he'd found in soft-core porn publications. When a friend and colleague of the first victim is also murdered, there is increased pressure to solve the highly publicized case. Yablonsky, who has his own troubles--he is being investigated by the department 's Internal Affairs division because of his penchant for eating at top restaurants on the cuff--compounds them by falling in love with one of the suspects, punk rock star Suzy Creamcheese, a client of the victims. Then Latin American diplomat Emile Suarez, a kingpin in the large-scale looting of his native land by its dictator, tries to compromise the detective in the most affable way. The conclusion is chilling and true to life. Painting New York in dark and gloomy colors, Trigoboff, a poet and the author of the novel Abu , creates a disturbing and involving tale.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 2240484, "title": "The Bone Orchard: A Detective Yablonsky Mystery (Detective Yablonsky Mysteries Book 1)", "author": "Joseph Trigoboff", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Imagine gardening instead as a process which improves the soil even as we grow our crops, helps balance and enrich the ecology, relies on free services of nature rather than purchased inputs--and is powered with energy from the nearest star. That is the way of gardening Cindy Conner offers inGrowing a Sustainable Diet. ~---Harvey Ussery, author of The Small-Scale Poultry Flock", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jones believes that generations belong together...and she's determined to spread that message! While in high school and college, Marcie worked as a nurse's aid in various nursing homes. She often said that it was the best job in the world because every single day she left work knowing that she had made a difference in someone's life. After college she hoped to go into nursing home administration, but was side-tracked by a corporate position in the credit world.  After 30 years, Marcie and her best friend Murt decided it was time for a change. In their \"encore\" careers they wanted to make a difference in the world. Murt wanted to pursue a career working with children; Marcie wanted to return to her original dream of working with seniors. They began brainstorming and searching for business options, and discovered the unique niche of Intergenerational Daycare. It seemed to be the perfect fit, and they began their journey of creating Gentog...a Loving Daycare for Generations Together. Her passion does not end with the business day, however. For many years, Marcie's household has been multi-generational as well. For two years her Gram lived with Marcie, her husband and her children. When her son and his wife welcomed their first son, four of the five living generations were housed together in her home. Although Gram has moved on to long term care, the other three generations (which now includes a second grandson) continue to live together. One of her greatest joys is waking up to her beautiful grandsons, and bringing them with her to Gentog.  Now in her late 50's (yikes), Marcie has decided that it is time to add the title \"Author\" to her resume. Her first book featured ideas for activities that can be enjoyed by people with dementia and their caregivers. The ideas came from her personal caregiving journey at home and at Gentog.  Her newest title \"Grandma Helen and Me\" is a sweet story about the love of a little boy for his great-great-grandma, and features the story and photos of her grandma and eldest grandson.  This book is perfect for sharing with young children as well as with older people suffering from memory loss.  Faith, senior care and intergenerational relationships are all topics on the horizon for this new author.

Rodney has over thirty years of experience and dedication in church as a minstrel, psalmist, and minister of the gospel, producer and the list goes on. God has given him unlimited anointing and talents which exceed many ministry expectations and requirements. He has traveled nationally and internationally and is acclaimed for the gifts that the Lord has blessed him with. Traveling to several nations has catapulted him into new Kingdom assignments and thrust him into higher realms of worship. The Minstrel is now training and equipping psalmist, minstrels, producers etc. through his School of Worship.  He has also hosted “Cozy But Kingdom” and “The Key of David”.  These vehicles have brought the Kingdom of God to different venues throughout his local region bridging the gap between praise and worship with spoken word and the arts. With a tremendous catalogue of praise and worship CD’s, Rodney has captured the heart of God and released it to the Body of Christ. Rodney has authored two manuals, “The Character of a Worshipper”(Keys To Accessing the Heart of God) and “Pen of a Ready Writer”(Davidic Patterns for Prophetic Writers).  These ministry tools train and impart spiritual principles guiding those that have a desire to perfect the talents and anointing that the Lord has placed in their lives. He has also produced several new psalmist and minstrels under, “Zion Muzik”, the label that he founded. As the Praise and Worship leader for Rivers of Living Water Ministries International under the leadership of Apostle Stephen and Prophetess Yolonda Garner, he has seen God’s hand enlarge his ability to spread the gospel. Realizing he can do nothing apart from God he has set his goals to complete his kingdom mandate on the earth. Rodney resides in Hillside, Illinois with his lovely wife, Prophetess Etta Williams and his five beautiful children.", "related": [], "rank": 1863529, "title": "Healing A Wounded Worshipper", "author": "Rodney Williams", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
