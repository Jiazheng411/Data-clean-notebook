He was a literary artist of laconic precision who probed below the surface of life, laying bare the secret motives of his characters. Chekhov’s best plays and short stories lack complex plots and neat solutions. Concentrating on apparent trivialities, they create a special kind of atmosphere, sometimes termed haunting or lyrical. Chekhov described the Russian life of his time using a deceptively simple technique devoid of obtrusive literary devices, and he is regarded as the outstanding representative of the late 19th-century Russian realist school.", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although many WWII memoirs have appeared in recent years, Edwardss rises above the rest with his honest and captivating accounts of daily life for a combat pilot in Africa. Also excellent is Fords commentary: He gives non-flying readers all the necessary technical information without attempting a course in aeronautical engineering. Edwardss training and combat career are interesting, but less colorful than his indoctrination into the first ranks of the armys test pilots (this in the days before the Air Force was formed). His accounts of jumping into any plane he could get near, and of hopping through the country in search of beautiful womensometimes, even, Hollywood starletsoffer a unique perspective on the world just after the war, when multitudes of young men returned from overseas and the military pilot was just as much a symbol of glamour as the movie idol. Edwards himself was assigned soon enough to head the test program on the radical and ill-fated Northrop Flying Wing Bomber (he would be killed during testing).While at work on that, he contributed important findings to aircraft research and helped to change the position of test pilot from one offered to any skilled pilot to that of a highly trained scientist. Edwardss own words are skillfully interwoven with Fords, offering a richly detailed account of postwar aviationand the infant years of the military-industrial complex.

You cannot help but respond to the well-written characters that come to life with each sentence. I felt their pain, smiled at their joy and became an enthusiastic voyeur watching their sensual love scenes. This is a fantastic story that should not be missed. Be sure to get UNDER MY SKIN to see how it all began.\"--Chocolate Minx, Literary Nymphs Reviews\"5 STARS!...M.L. Rhodes is on top of her game in this sequel to UNDER MY SKIN. The complex relationship between Dylan and Sebastian and the way their past hinders their future is narrated in such a way that the reader can't help but cheer for them and hope that they can work things out and be together...When it comes to writing sex scenes M.L. is hard to beat. Not only are the scenes explicit, hot and sensual but they are so exquisitely crafted it's no wonder she is an award-winning author. Dylan and Sebastian get down and dirty on numerous occasions in the book and the intensity and passion of each encounter left me breathless. This is yet another winner for this author and I highly recommend Under My Skin II as a wonderful excursion into a complex human relationship and kudos to M.L. for giving us this superb romance.\"--Jessewave, Reviews By Jessewave", "related": ["B00LK13EYW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That's the conclusion in a new book that examines the enormous change sweeping the profession, Unbound: How Entrepreneurship is Dramatically Transforming Legal Services Today by American writer David Galbenski -- a must-read for lawyers and law students who want to build successful law business. Mr. Galbenski, CEO of Legal Lumen, a legal staffing firm, provides a book that is both topical and timely, coming only six months after the U. S. economy suffered its worst market decline since the Great Depression. It also comes at a time when U.S. law firms are rapidly downsizing and looking for ways to survive. The highlight of the book is a series of interviews with leading general counsel, who explain the changing global landscape their companies operate in and the pressures in-house lawyers face to rein in costs since the economic collapse. Their observations are stark and should raise the hairs on the arm of every managing partner, group practice leader and legal marketing expert in the business. Susan Flook, group general counsel at The Body Shop International in London, put it most succinctly when she said: \"In my view, outside counsel have got to substantially change the way they charge for and deliver legal services. It is my opinion that the basic fee-earning structure in law firms is wrong. The whole thing needs a sea change.\" While his views aren't entirely novel, the book's strength is that it brings them together under one roof, and the timing-- especially the interviews with general counsel, which took place as recently as January -- is opportunistic. Unbound also follows on the heels The End of Lawyers? the book by noted legal futurist Richard Susskind, who predicts that general counsel will shape the future for external law firms. Mr. Galbenski warns lawyers who are \"risk-averse\" and fail to respond to the fires burning in the legal forest will suffer. \"The longer you wait, the farther -- and faster -- you will have to go just to catch up. You will be left behind in the ashes.\" --Jim Middlemiss, Financial PostLaw firms may be coping with a downturn in business by trimming their costs, but the recession is moving the entire industry toward a range of new, entrepreneurial models that will eventually put the legal industry more in line with other types of businesses. So says author David Galbenski, whose new book Unbound: How Entrepreneurship is Dramatically Transforming Legal Services Today analyzes trends in the legal services industry and predicts the market will shift toward more project-oriented models. Nashville firms haven t seen the radical decline in demand that has hit other cities and sent some major firms out of business. Some New York and California firms in business for more than a century have closed during this recession, and layoffs of attorneys and other legal staff have become common in big city firms not to mention bonus reductions and raise freezes at some white-shoe firms. ...Over the past 18 months, major law firms have laid off nearly 13,000 people, including nearly 5,000 lawyers, according to the blog lawshucks.com. The largest firms are under the most pressure because they ve had the highest price point, Galbenski says. Nationally, they re operating under a wait-and-see methodology.  Right now, large firms are moving incrementally to cut expenses, by laying off workers, freezing salaries, .....and deferring start dates for some new hires.   When the crisis hit it exposed a lot of the price/value gap, Galbenski says. But I don t yet see that tipping point where people are making wholesale changes to their business model.  Washington, D.C.-based Howrey Simon, a large global litigation firm, is implementing an apprenticeship model, whereby first- and second-year associates will enter a two-year training program, including taking classes on legal writing and research, trial tactics, cross examination and mediation and arbitration. They re also working on pro bono projects and working at a reduced rate of $150 to $200 per billable hour.  That s the most dramatic change, Galbenski says. Frankly, the pay scale for one-year associates was out of whack.  Galbenski predicts many of the large, global firms that tend to be headquartered in expensive downtown real estate and pay massive salaries in exchange for superhuman numbers of billable hours what he calls the National Legal Journal 250 and what others shorthand to Big Law will go away and only about 20 to 30 global firms will keep that model. He thinks the firm of the future will modify the current fixed-labor model, by supplementing fewer numbers of permanent employees with more contract work to reduce costs and retain more flexibility to hire as needed. Another scenario is a movie production model, where a lead attorney would be called on to assemble a legal team to handle a case akin to a project or production manager hiring a crew for a movie or a concert tour.  It may not be the resources underneath them at the law firm, Galbenski says. ...Several factors point in this direction: technology that allows employees to work remotely; large numbers of women in law who have pushed for more flexible work arrangements; and a Millennial demographic accustomed to job-hopping and having expectations of proper work-life balance. Most younger workers also accept they will need to take responsibility for their own retirement and health benefits a trend that has only accelerated during the recession as pensions disappear, employers stop matching 401(k) contributions and health care reform gathers steam.  Whatever industry you re in, you are being asked to provide services better, faster and cheaper, Galbenski says. Corporate purchasers are looking at legal services and asking them to do it more efficiently and at a lower price point.....\" --Jeannie Naujeck, Nashville Business Journal", "related": ["B005AHQBNI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Using first-hand accounts  by rank-and-file teachers as well as leaders, Dennis Gaffney documents how  teachers, once underpaid and hopelessly divided, finally organized, lifting  themselves from the underclass to the middle class to become a formidable  grassroots political force able to defeat and elect U.S. senators. He  describes how New York's teachers sparked the modern-day teachers'  movement, and what key lessons other labor unions can learn from NYSUT's  unity and success. Teachers United also shows how NYSUT has been a leader  of educational reform, winning more money for education, creating smaller  classes, raising academic standards, and training better teachers.\"Public education is among the most central functions of government in a  democracy and, in New York State, NYSUT is arguably the single most  influential organization in the field of education. For the first time,  Dennis Gaffney tells the story of this influential group and sheds light on  the rationale for teacher unionism and for teacher unity.\" -- Richard D.  Kahlenberg, author ofTough Liberal: Albert Shanker and the Battles over  Schools, Unions, Race, and Democracy\"What a pleasure to read a modern-day labor history, so informative and  consistently engaging, that brings alive the struggles of those who have  built one of the most successful unions of the last half-century: NYSUT.  I'd recommend this book to all students of labor history and activists who  want a reminder of how vital and essential unions still are. I was  inspired.\" -- John J. Sweeney, President, AFL-CIO\"Dennis Gaffney has produced a lively narrative that keeps the action  moving across many years of NYSUT union activity. He's also managed to  write what amounts to a book-within-a-book, with a compelling biography of  founder Albert Shanker embedded in a larger story of organized labor.\" --  Paul Grondahl, author ofMayor Corning: Albany Icon, Albany Enigma", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

During his lifetime Dickens' works enjoyed unprecedented popularity and fame, and they remain popular today. It was in the twentieth century, however, that his literary genius was fully recognized by critics and scholars. Many of his works were originally published serially in monthly installments, a format of publication that Dickens himself helped popularise. Unlike other authors who completed novels before serialisation, Dickens often wrote the episodes as they were being serialised, and he often revised his plots and characters on the basis of readers' responses to a published episode. The practice lent his stories a particular rhythm, employing cliffhangers to keep the public looking forward to the next installment. The continuing popularity of his novels and short stories is such that they have never gone out of print.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She married right out of high school and started a family. When her children were school-aged, she enrolled in Wayne State University, intent on becoming a scientist. However, she took a course in creative writing, and it became her passion. She decided if she couldn’t visit the stars in person, she would do it page by page. Yet again, life took another turn. Smolen was diagnosed with a genetic eye disease and lost her vision. Her husband gave her one year to mope and feel sorry for herself. Then he sent her to a local Lighthouse of the Blind to learn how to use a computer without looking. She has since written ten novels in the science fiction realm, ranging from sci fi romance to horror to young adult. She is currently working on a paranormal series about a werewolf who falls in love.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This loot was stored in bunkers, castles and mines in both Germany and Austria for personal use after the war. At the end of WWII, the Allies put together Monument Men Teams to find stolen Nazi treasure and attempt to return it to rightful owners. The USSR put Trophy Teams on this same quest, but with a different mission: to steal it for shipment to the USSR. Priam's Gold was part of this latter treasure that eventually was discovered in the basement of KGB headquarters in Moscow and put on display. After the fall of the USSR, Russian President Boris Yeltsin decalred that Priam's Gold would never be returned to Turkey from where it was originally stolen.In addition, the history of the Trojan War as told in Homer's Illiad is the story of Gods & Goddesses, Kings and Warriors; a romanticized version of history.

In testing a nuanced and integrative model of institutional decision making, the authors use statistically sophisticated methods to expand our knowledge and understanding of the modern Court. Well written and accessible, displaying a dazzling command of the literature as well as case law, the authors have produced a work worthy of placement with the classics in the field.\"- Sheldon Goldman, University of Massachusetts at Amherst\"Scholars of the Court have long attempted to utilize a single model to characterize all judicial decision making. Rather than falling into this trap, Pacelle, Curry, and Marshall make the case in this well-crafted book that single-cause explanations obscure how justices make decisions. The evidence they provide convinces one that none of the attitudinal, strategic, or legal models alone can account for decision making on the Court. If you want to understand the complexity and multifaceted nature of Supreme Court decision making, this is the book.\"- Forrest Maltzman, George Washington University\"In Decision Making by the Modern Supreme Court, Professors Pacelle, Curry, and Marshall contribute a unique bird's-eye view of the modern Court since Brown. By controlling for key factors associated with attitudes, separation of powers, precedent, and issue evolution, the authors' parsimonious models of Supreme Court decision making enable comparison of these influences across the Court's docket and across time. The picture that emerges is one of a Court driven by policy preferences but simultaneously receptive to the preferences of the elected branches and to salient legal arguments. Because the book includes careful case analysis in addition to sophisticated empirical modeling, it speaks to a broad audience in law and social science. For that reason, it will - and deserves to be - widely read by anyone interested in understanding why the Court does what it does.\"- Stefanie A. Lindquist, A. W. Walker Centennial Chair in Law and Professor of Government, University of Texas at Austin\"The authors' rich knowledge of events surrounding the cases that are included in the study makes Decision Making by the Modern Supreme Court an interesting and broadly accessible book that is a welcome addition to the literature on judicial behavior.\"- Eileen Braman, Indiana University", "related": [], "rank": 2450792, "title": "Decision Making", "author": "Jr/Curry/Marshal Pacelle", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hardaway’s message is one of encouragement, inspiration, conviction and information.  She preached her trial sermon titled “Being Emotionally Busted” in September 2004 and was licensed the same month.  Rev. Hardaway was ordained to the ministry in 2008 and specifically ministers to hurting people and to those who are broken in the body of Christ, those who are and have been neglected, depressed, discouraged and in pain from emotional and physical abuse; all of which she has experienced herself.  Her life is a testimony that “God is a God of second chances.”  God has anointed and chosen her to heal the brokenhearted and to bring deliverance to those that are in bondage.  She also has been commissioned by God to be a prophet to the nations, declare repentance and reconciliation in the Body of Christ. Rev. Hardaway has ministered in Westchester, New York City and New Jersey.  She graduated from high school in Pine Bluff, Arkansas and has attended both Virginia State University and Westchester Community College majoring in Business Administration.  She has earned an Associate Degree in Religious Studies from Andersonville Theological Seminary.   Rev. Hardaway is the mother of two (2) children, Jonathan and Talaia.  She is also  Nonni to Kevontay, Aiya Marie and Aniya.  She is the stepmother to Jimmie III and Marquita and stepgrandmother to three children.

American culture constantly sells us the myth of the meritocracy—you deserve what you have because you earned it. The moral foundation of our economic system depends on the persuasiveness of this myth. Drugs that improve performance or level the competitive playing field threaten this core cultural belief. It is, as Mehlman elegantly argues, not so much that bioengineering perfection threatens to undermine fairness but rather that our mythic and fragile view of fairness is so threatened by the latest technologies of improvement. Anyone fascinated by the emerging battle over the morality of perfecting mankind ought to read this book.(Arthur Caplan, University of Pennsylvania)We humans will never be 'perfect,' but Max Mehlman persuasively explains why Americans will nonetheless continue to try whatever we think might make us 'better' and keep us on the road to perfection.(George J. Annas, author ofAmerican Bioethics)InThe Price of Perfection, Max Mehlman makes it clear that biogenetic enhancement is the human destiny. He provides an insightful tour of not only the pitfalls but also, more important, the tremendous benefits that biomedical enhancement offers humanity.(Ronald Bailey, author ofLiberation Biology: The Scientific and Moral Case for the Biotech Revolution)In his highly readable and especially timely new book,The Price of Perfection, Mehlman makes it clear that he is not at all persuaded that the ethical response to the availability of performance-enhancing drugs in sports—or elsewhere in society, for that matter—is to ban them and then spend a lot of effort testing for those who use them anyway.(Arthur CaplanPerspectives in Biology and Medicine)Bioethicists, as well as policy makers and the public, must think more often and more deeply about science’s rapidly growing ability to improve human functioning. But what is present inThe Price of Perfection, and sufficiently inspiring, is a well-balanced and well-documented look at how we now are positioned (at least in the United States) to control this process, and what some of the pros and cons of enlarging control, or alternatively loosening it, might be.(Anita SilversInternational Journal of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics)", "related": [], "rank": 3073907, "title": "The Price of Perfection: Individualism and Society in the Era of Biomedical Enhancement", "author": "Maxwell J.

The travel bug first hit on her honeymoon in Miami. Fidel Castro had just taken over Cuba and lured by rock-bottom prices, Sheila sweet-talked her ex-husband into abandoning Miami for Cuba. That marked the beginning of her lifetime travel passion and addiction. There are very few countries that are not on her to-see list no matter how remote and/or difficult they may be with many, \"What was I thinking of\" moments in hindsight. The U.S. State Department recognizes 193 independent countries and she has visited over 150 in over 40 years of travel (but...who's counting). Touring, hiking, trekking, rafting, snowshoeing, skiing, volunteering on archaeological digs, family trips and, she must admit, occasionally sitting on a beach and compulsively shopping. Her goal is to encourage you to take the big step and travel to more exotic, remote destinations with tips, anecdotes and reassurance that, yes, you will come back alive. Visit her \"travelswithsheila\" channel on YouTube to watch over 1,400 videos filmed around the world and covering the gamut from taking a cruise to camping in Egypt's desert, food (fried tarantulas, anyone?), sights and even instructions on how to navigate subways in Paris and Beijing. All Travels With Sheila Guides will tell you the truth, and only the whole truth, about each country and whether sights are a hit, or a miss. Follow Sheila's advice to avoid making mistakes she learned the hard way. For example, not knowing that an important piece of equipment when camping or trekking is...an AIR MATTRESS? A never to be forgotten experience spent in a sleeping bag on the cold, hard ground of Nepal. And what kind of crazy idiot goes trekking in Siberia and gets lost? Really...lost in Siberia?

What if you could buy twice as much for half the cost? Couponing in the 21st century is a whole new game. What is doesn't mean is that you will be forced to spend countless hours with newspapers and scissors, scanning for brands you'll use and then tediously cutting individual coupons. Did you know that most coupons can be found online? In fact, some of the highest value coupons for the most coveted brand items come from the internet. Did you know that there were individuals devoting their lives to helping you save money as if it were their full time job? I'll teach you how to maximize your time by finding the coupons you need for the items that you'll actually use. I'll point you to the most valuable couponing sites so that you can take advantage of the expert's tips and their coupon hunting treasures. If you're feeling overwhelmed by learning all of the store coupon policies, I'll teach you the key rules to get you couponing at your favorite spots. Diary of a Discounter also features stories from my own shopping trips as well as those of other featured writers and readers. My goal is to teach you to focus your precious time by looking for discounts on the items that you will use rather than adopting the tempting habit of buying items that you don't need just because you have a coupon. If you want to know what all the chatter is surrounding discounting shopping lately, you've come to the right place!", "related": ["B008E88ZDY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In addition to being a leading authority on the international automotive business and the butterfly, Mr. Roegner, who speaks five languages, was an advisor from 1984 to 1992 to the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative on international trade policy.

Gerrit was focused on Dutch settlement of what is now New York City and western Long Island in the mid-1600’s. A Time to Remember, the third book in the series, was suggested by Mr. Roegner’s wife, Anneliese, who was ten years old in the ruins of Berlin in 1945.", "related": ["B005IGVRVM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Thus we are given entrée into one of the most popular shows in the history of television. We meet the real-life cast and creators, including Larry and Jerry (they do not disappoint). We watch Stoller rise and fall and climb back up again (returning to act in aSeinfeldepisode).

Marshall  (physical acting, Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, London) and  the contributors to the collection by Potter (theater, Marymount  Manhattan Coll.) are well aware of this problem and take different approaches to solving it. Marshall tends to focus on  the inner being and the actor's inner response. Concepts such as  \"finding the center,\" \"discovering the rhythm,\" and \"focusing  your energy\" are cited throughout, along with physical and  practical exercises and activities that will help actors use  their bodies effectively to communicate with the audience. As a collection, Potter's book offers a variety of viewpoint and  focus. For example, Mary Fleischer's article is about  stillness-how to be silent, respond, return to stillness, and so  on-while Marianne Kubik discusses Meyerhold's system of training  actors and body movement. Theresa Lee examines the Alexander  Technique. In all, there are 23 articles and almost as many approaches to body movement. Interestingly, both books discuss  the importance of the synthesis of body and mind, discipline and  spontaneity, and knowledge and instinct. Both works are highly  recommended for all library theater collections and large public  libraries.Susan L.

This prompted our teacher, George Eklund to declare \"porcelain is the best antenna for creativity\". I thought that it would make a great idea for a play...a group of college students behind the closed doors of  a row of toilet stalls.

Self-exiled from New York City because of a misdiagnosis that ended tragically, Jo runs a peaceful health clinic from a motel in rural New Jersey. A confrontation-hungry gang of bikers, \"Satan's Apostles,\" rolls in one evening sneering at Jo's non-Harley \"rice-burner.\" When Jo recognizes the leader, Pi, as a neighborhood geek who was once smitten with her, she realizes he's not the usual biker type—after all, he's a mathematician and MIT dropout. An impromptu bash in the motel's parking lot leads to a scuffle leaving one \"apostle\" dead, apparently at Pi's hands. While Pi goes on the lam on his Harley, Jo searches for the real killer. To complicate matters, Jo's boyfriend is witness to several easily misunderstood clinches that put their comfortable relationship at risk. Hathaway is best at creating likable characters and evoking place; the plot suffers from inconsistent pacing and a less-than-fleshed-out mystery. Despite the biker milieu, this is one for cozy fans, not readers of Barbara Seranella's gritty Munch Mancini novels.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His work has appeared in several periodicals and anthologies including Agenda, Bim Magazine, Callaloo, Caribbean Quarterly, Caribbean Writer and Wasafari. Also published are two novels, Season of Mist and Misbegotten, and a collection of short Stories - Careme.  Dixon's main philosophy is to recreate a history of the legends and myths of his people so that generations of Saint Lucian writers, living and in the future, will find a platform as intricate and beautiful as their island home from which to launch their chef d'oeuvres.

It started with my difficulties finding a publisher for The Blood of Logant and The Fire of Kings in their earliest form (as one novel in need of heavy revisions). Challenged by my ignorance of the publishing process, I did what any other young, impatient writer might have done; I started writing something else.I began another novel.That work had a completely different feel than the first one did,\nsuch that you probably would not attribute it to me if you found it lying in a\nwastebasket. It was dark and sinister, and it remains unpublished for now. I centered it upon a wicked wretch of a\nman, but it failed to hold my attention as a new idea began distracting me from it.My\nprogress on the story of the wicked prince stalled, so I readily used that as\nmy excuse to plunge into the new story that was taking shape in my head.I began working on what was to become Infinity's Star. For all the previous story had been dark and fraught with clever\nscheming on the parts of its characters, this story was exhilarating and\ninnocent. It was honest and alive. It felt great to write it.In short,\nInfinity's Star was--and remains--the fastest written story I have ever\nput together. It was born from a writer's block, making it a writer's dream. I hope its fast\naction grabs hold of my readers, as it still does to me.-David S.

And, while the action still clips along at a sprightly pace, Green fails to improve the by-the-numbers resolution that originally plagued this story about a lethal NFL linebacker who goes on a killing spree. Florida Marauders star Luther Zorn becomes a prospective client for attorney Madison McCall (first introduced in Green's Outlaws) when McCall's boss forces her into the role of sports agent. But Zorn goes from starter to suspect when team owner Evan Chase is killed in a suspicious swimming accident, and McCall quickly finds herself defending a client who faces a pileup of damning evidence, including his affair with Chase's wife, a parking ticket that places him at the scene of the crime and some incriminating scuba gear that the police discover at his girlfriend's house. McCall calls on her partner to investigate the case, and he digs up several clues hinting at a conspiracy involving moneyed interests and a corrupt cop. An attempt to arrest Zorn leads to an extended chase after the linebacker kidnaps McCall and holds her hostage, with the body count mounting as Zorn races toward a confrontation with a pivotal figure from his past. Green's strength is his ability to write action scenes that effectively present the intricacies of pro football, and McCall delivers another winning performance despite a rather generic supporting cast. But the cardboard bogeyman who surfaces in the climax remains just as ludicrous this time around as Green fumbles away his second chance to fix a formulaic ending.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That month two\ncops actually walked into a bar at Tysons Corner's Ramada Inn and ordered about\n100 people to stop dancing and issued a court summons to the motel.A\npolice captain actually sent cops around to different establishments in his\ndistrict to inform bar managers of the ordinance.This\nactually happened. The cops really did\nthis.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I hope if you read one you'll go ahead and read the others. Then maybe even try one of my 16 novels. Might work. I hope so.My favorite of the four spooky short stories...Ghost Brother. My second choice, The Banshee and the Witch, which is the longest short story at about 10,000 words and is about a witch who wants to live forever and might just do that.

His detailed overview of the cat-and-mouse game that allowed the Communists to subdue their religious opponents deepens our understanding of those complex initial post-war years in Germany.(Gary Bruce, University of Waterloo)Brennan blends the history of parties with diplomatic, education, and cultural history to reveal how both Catholic and Protestant organizations cooperated with, then questioned, then openly criticized, and finally resisted Soviet authorities and their German counterparts in the postwar period. A cleanly written history of a gray area, this book demonstrates more than just the details of religious policy or attitudes, but offers details about inter-group relations, watersheds in German history, and the phenomenon and influence of the Soviet Occupation.(Elizabeth Morrow Clark, West Texas A&M; University)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Freud is best known for his theories of the unconscious mind and the defense mechanism of repression and for creating the clinical practice of psychoanalysis for curing psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Freud is also renowned for his redefinition of sexual desire as the primary motivational energy of human life, as well as his therapeutic techniques, including the use of free association, his theory of transference in the therapeutic relationship, and the interpretation of dreams as sources of insight into unconscious desires. He was also an early neurological researcher into cerebral palsy. While of significant historical interest, many of Freud's ideas have fallen out of favor or have been modified by Neo-Freudians, although in the past ten years, advances in the field of neurology have shown evidence for many of his theories. Freud's methods and ideas remain important in clinical psychodynamic approaches. In academia his ideas continue to influence the humanities and some social sciences.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He left behind no story arcs, no further plot ideas or concepts of where to go next. He'd created a single novella and the concept for a series, but not a series itself.    A decade later, I was commissioned to expand the novella into a full-sized book and then create nine more books, thus turning Smith's idea into what became known as the \"Family d'Aloembert series.\" I'd read and enjoyed Smith's earlier Skylark and Lensman series, so I was eagerly anticipating this assignment.    Unfortunately, it was not all I'd hoed for. The novella certainly had action aplenty, but the writing, the universe and the characters left much to be desired. The text used bizarre words like \"ultratoilsomely.\" The characters were two-dimensional and way too goody-goody even for the 1960s, let alone the 70s or later. The history and development of the universe were painfully naive, with an anti-communhist screed straight out of the McCarthy era of the 50s. And while Smith was noted for the excellence of his villains, the ultimate bad guy here never once set foot onstage. Clearly this work needed a lot of rehabilitation.    Having to stick closely to Smith's creation hampered me considerably, but I did as much as I could to make the characters and universe more believable, and I tried to come up with stories that were exciting enough to please Smith's legion of fans. I got letters of praise that told me I was succeeding, which was most gratifying.    Still, as decades passed, the initially creaky concept grew more and more outdated. Finally, in the mid-2000s, I decided to update the series. I tossed out \"Imperial Stars\" in its entirety; instead, I wrote an entirely new first novel to introduce the universe and the characters, and I made major modifications to the remaining 9 books to fit the new beginning. The result is what I now call the Agents of ISIS series, something I feel is more appropriate for the 21st century.   The Purity Plotis book 6 of the classic series, superseded byPurgatory Plotof my Agents of ISIS. Whichever series you choose to read, I hope you enjoy it.--Stephen Goldin", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The constricted position mirrored my constricting heart. Instead of lighting lavender-scented pillar candles, which now glowed like skeletal bones in my living room, running my peony pink nails through Graham's soft hair, and snipping off the price tag of the Ralph Lauren colorblock matte jersey dress with a saucily short hem I had bought specially for this occasion, I'd be spending Valentine's Day alone, watchingPretty Womanfor the eighty-seventh time.This wasn't a crisis of epic proportions, I reminded myself. It wasn't a natural disaster which wreaked havoc on more than one continent. It wasn't the death of John-John Kennedy, prematurely killed before he had a chance to restore Camelot. It wasn't the miniscule amount of screen time Angel had in the series finale ofBuffy the Vampire Slayer.It was just Valentine's Day.Mouth agape, I gawked at the mostly empty box of chocolates. Surely, I hadn't become so depressed over a commercial gambit used to boost the quarterly sales reports for florists, confectioners, and greeting card manufacturers that I had demolished all of these chocolates? Unlike Christmas, Valentine's Day wasn't even a real holiday.\"Like New Year's Eve?\" asked a traitorous voice in my head, oddly sharing the raspy quality of Ursula's inThe Little Mermaid. I ignored it and continued my musing. Surely, I was depressed and weepy over something more meaningful, something deeper...something more impressive......something like existential despair.Frankly, I wasn't even sure what existentialism was exactly. I merely had overheard Jem discussing it with Dylan one night when we all had gone out for sangria and tapas. But it sounded just morose enough to warrant my present state of gluttony.The sound of someone knocking on my door jolted me out of my somber thoughts. My heartbeat quickened, and I raced to the jamb, hoping that somehow Graham had made it to Boston after all. His talk of blueberry crises was just a practical joke which I'd scold him for later--after I gave him a spine-tingling, toe-curling, welcome-back-to-the-Eastern-Standard-time-zone kiss.But when I flung open the door, it wasn't the blue-gray eyes of my British boyfriend I stared into, but the piercing green eyes of my ex-boyfriend, Doug.", "related": [], "rank": 3766976, "title": "Talisman Turner Minds the Gap", "author": "Cinda Fernando", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her favorite genre is murder mystery but each book brings forth characters who rely on God as they solve the puzzle in their life. Her readers also have a tremendous amount of input when they wonder what happened to this character or that one, even if they are secondary to the story. Barbara’s devotionals are sought after each year when she publishes a new one that reflects what God has placed on her heart. From Straight Pipes, her first, to Chaps, the latest, Barbara’s devotions take people to the place where God can touch their heart and leave a lasting impression. 2012 will see the release of her fifth about the Sermon on the Mount. Born in Canada, Barbara lived in the US for 12 years. There her writing surfaced as she worked as a journalist for six years with over 2500 articles published in newspapers and magazines during that time. Her readership expanded while in the States but now the Canadian public has discovered the gift that God has given yet another Canadian. She is a member of The Word Guild, Manitoba Writer’s Guild, The Writer’s Collective, and Christian Motorcyclists Association where each summer her books are used to inspire and encourage. Barbara has spoken across the US and in Manitoba, Canada for women’s groups and in church services on topics such as The Writing Experience, working in the ministry of Christian Motorcyclists Association, Love, Parenting, Time Management, and a host of others. With 11 books to her credit, each one surpasses the last, according to her readers. They look forward to Silence, the fourth in the Wilton/Strait mystery series, and Road Trip, her fifth devotional about the Sermon on the Mount in 2012. Barbara will allow some new characters to tell their story in a new series Finders Keepers which she plans to begin in 2012.  Developing a social media presence, getting published at Amazon.com and adding her books to their kindle collection in Canada, the US, Great Britain, France and Germany, and also adding her books to Amazon.ca has kept her busy this year. She has also attended a few workshops to add to her skill level. Barbara Ann Would love to meet you, whenever she is in your area. Check her schedule to find out when she will stop by.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They areidentifying\nmarket opportunities and target accounts, presenting solutions, and following-up.\nFollow-up is vital in the sales process and it is important in the on-going\ndevelopment of your business relationship with your target accounts. Typically, most small businesses are able to identify and\npursue prospects in some manner and then send an email with a link to a website,\nor mail a brochure or have a meeting to provide a sales presentation. However,\nwhere the ball often is dropped is in the follow-up stage. Andwithout\nfollow-through, sales are lost and as a small business your marketing dollars\nare lost. Many small businesses often quit midstream and think their\nprobable or existing customer is not interested in their offering. Small\nbusinesses become discouraged when the prospect says \"no, not at this time\" or the\nsmall business believes the target account always gives the business to their\ncompetitor, or they simply are overwhelmed with other work and forget to\nfollow-up. And without a shadow of a doubt, thosesmall businesses that miss\nthe last and most important element of follow-up are on-track to fail in\nclosing the sale and hurt their growth. Sales data showsit takes about seven to ten contacts with a\nprospect to close a sale. This is the reason to stay consistent, to be\ndetermined and committed in your sales and marketing plan.Being focused on your\nbusiness goals and follow-up plan enable you to build customer relationships.Your\nfollow-up actions show that your business is doing its part to nurture and\nbuild a relationship with target accounts.

An average day in the town’s library is disrupted, causing quite a stir, as Effie is whisked away by the very dutiful (and very handsome) Constable Alexander Dawes. Apparently, a stranger showed up asking for her, and then was found dead. While Effie is confused over why a man she doesn’t know came to town looking for her, she’s also very worried that this peculiar situation may cause problems with her employer. At first Constable Dawes is merely doing his job, but as time goes on, he finds himself more than intrigued by Effie and even ponders marriage, though his family will never support such an improbable engagement. The ever-popular Aitken beautifully imagines forbidden love and two very different families in a romance that will have readers hoping hard for the impossible and delighting in the exciting twist that finally reveals the dead man’s identity. --Carissa Chesanek", "related": [], "rank": 935576, "title": "Flowers for Miss Pengelly", "author": "Rosemary Aitken", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Having been a lifelong avid reader of dark fantasy and good (really bad) pulp fiction, he finally decided to conquer his dyslexia and try writing his own, using his treasured homeland and love of music for inspiration. With the help of a proofreader in Texas, USA, and an illustrator from Berlin, Germany, he has created 'The Storm Series', which currently consists of a trilogy of novels and two books of short stories. He is fan-friendly and welcomes all comments and reviews of his work. Search Facebook for Echoesofastorm or follow him on Twitter @Echoes198.

The population in the United States is aging, and many older adults will be faced with the need to maintain proper nutrition while their ability to effectively chew food is reduced due to changes in the dentition and muscles that control jaw opening and closing. Developed over the years through trial and error, this book will be a very valuable aid for older adults and those who care for them.\"Ira B. Lamster, D.D.S., M.M.Sc.Dean, Columbia University College of Dental MedicineEditor ofImprovingOral Health for the Elderly: An Interdisciplinary ApproachNew York City, NY\"This is a great resource for anyone faced with preparing satisfying and nutritious soft-food meals over an extended period without multiple re-runs. Ms. Benishek's recipes include the traditional as well as some creative and ethnic variations. Her approach and commentary is warm and down-to-earth. The Simply Soft Food Cookbook is a real gift for those with chewing problems who want to maintain an optimal quality of life.\"Suzanne Hughes, MSN, RNDirector of Population Health, Summa Health System AssociateEditor ofCardioSource, the online journal of the American College of CardiologyAkron, OH\"This is an absolutely delicious book! Every recipe can be enjoyed by those who have to eat soft foods as well as the general population. Ms. Benishek has done a thorough and professional job of organizing the material and presenting it for both the person who prepares the meals and the person eating her delicious offerings. Ms. Benishek's insightful book has taken us into the 21st century where those who still enjoy eating but require soft food now have an excellent cookbook to rely on.

This kind of life experience made writing for teens a natural.  That, plus the fact that she has never quite grown up.  She is extremely proud of this and will therefore not tell you how many years she taught art in high school after the band broke up. For this opus, MD Mascaro traveled to the Irish National Library in Dublin to research Irish families and banshees.  She loves research.  She loves travel more.  She loves writing off travel expenses to do her research.  It’s a win-win situation.    As a child, M D Mascaro’s parents told her she was sent to this planet by angry alien politicos who punished her for publishing the truth.  She now writes fantasy to avoid getting into any more trouble.   She resides in New Jersey with a son who is a wizard. Brandy and the Banshees is her first novel.", "related": [], "rank": 2732325, "title": "Brandy and the Banshees eBook", "author": "M D Mascaro", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He started putting his stories on paper the moment he could write; unsurprisingly, his first story, written at the age of six, was about a rabbit! He completed his first novel at the age of fifteen. Vincent's mother instilled in him a love of books at an early age: she got each of her children their own library card before they could even read, making weekly library visits a habit. The first real novel he read was \"Moby Dick,\" after being obsessed with an audio-drama version at his local library, which he insisted on hearing every time he went there. After that, a profound love for science fiction and fantasy took root and he devoured all of the classics, from Wells and Verne to Herbert and Ellison. He has been everything from a professional musician and lead singer for a heavy-metal band, to a book and album reviewer, to a full time adult college student studying anthropology and a published poet; he also spent twenty years in retail bookselling. His interests include: anthropology and natural history, Pre-Colonial American history, language, music, following horse racing, and cartoon art (he is fanatically devoted to comic books, classic comic strips, and animation). CARROT FIELD took 19 years to complete and get published, it is his first published novel. He presently resides in the mountains of Pennsylvania.

During the early 1990s, I marketed an outdoors product I invented and that I formed a small corporation to patent, manufacture and sell called the \"Rod Floater\" (now a registered Trademark). I traveled the U.S. making presentations to groups of Wal-Mart zone and district managers and received authorization to sell the product in two regions of Wal-Mart stores for five years. I also sold the product to Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's and Academy Stores, all of which still carry the product and I landed a national promotion for the product with Kerr-McGee Oil company who began using the product to promote their \"Mystik Brand\" outboard motor oil in 1992. In 1996 I licensed the product to TTI-Blakemore, a major fishing tackle conglomerate, from which I am still paid monthly royalties from sales of the product. I received a diploma from Liberty University for completion of theological studies in 1996. I served as a youth minister, Bible teacher and guest speaker in fundamental, evangelical Christian churches, from 1982 to 2003. I enjoy writing books and articles on Bible subjects. In 2003 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism; \"Hashimoto's thyroiditis\" being the cause. This autoimmune form of thyroid disease resulted in my also developing \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\", due to a compromised immune system with severe co-morbid \"Adrenal Fatigue\". I also suffered severe anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks early into the onset of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Hashitoxicosis). A common heart murmur I was diagnosed with in my teens called \"Mitral Valve Prolapse\", also worsened in severity of symptoms, with the development of these other health disorders. My eventual receiving of a diagnosis was a difficult process with proper diagnostic testing not being ordered by the first doctors I sought treatment from. These types of issues were inspiration for me to become proactive in my own health care and to self-educate myself on these health disorders, which I have done extensively since 2003. I now enjoy sharing this information with other patients experiencing my same health disorders, through e-books, books and articles. I have been written-up by Best-Selling Author: Mary Shomon, at her About.com Thyroid Disease website. She states of me: \"Jim has also earned the distinction of being the writer/blogger who has reviewed more of my thyroid books than any other patient advocate!\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is the best one-volume guide to the issues currently being debated with respect to the new genetic technologies, and the only one that illuminates the connections between medical and agricultural applications. Teachers will use it in the classroom, but beyond that it should be thought of as an indispensable read for anyone who wants to be informed about science, ethics, and public policy. (Paul B. Thompson, Michigan State University, W.K. Kellogg Professor of Agricultural, Food, and Community Ethics)Richard Sherlock and John Morrey have developed a timely anthology on the ethical dimensions in biotechnology that is both scientifically sound and philosophically provocative. Engaging readings as well as a compendium of cases offer many formats for teachable dialogue between instructor and students. The questions—scientific, philosophical, political, legal, moral—examined throughEthical Issues in Biotechnologyillustrate the urgent need for critical ethical scholarship in this rapidly emerging field. This anthology meets that need. (Courtney S. Campbell, Oregon State University)The most substantial and sophisticated treatment of biomedical ethics that I have come across recently, and a treatment that remains quite accessible to undergraduate students. (Dr. S. N. Fratantaro, Providence College)It is refreshingly atypical that the book does not just focus on human cloning or human genetic screening but takes on the whole topic of biotechnology. It is enterprising and clever to have a book edited collaboratively by a biologist and a philosopher, and the result is a balanced treatment. The readings have already been proven successful with students. With diagrams, study cases, examples, and suggestions for further research, the book is a comprehensive and well-expressed introduction to the science and ethics of biotechnology. (Research News and Opportunities In Science and Theology)All who are involved in ethics and biotechnology should be immensely grateful for [Sherlock and Morrey's] efforts. Balanced and teachable,Ethical Issues in Biotechnologyis a valuable contribution to the field, and a must-have for those teaching either undergraduates enrolled in upper-level courses, or graduates students, across the disciplines of science and humanities. (Technology and Culture)Sherlock and Morrey cover a fascinating and engaging set of cutting edge issues. This work covers biotechnology in the broadest sense of the word, contains masterfully selected readings, and challenges the reader to think into the future. It should be very useful to college, graduate, and professional students.

Eventually she got tired of temporary friendships and spent her spare time reading instead. At about eleven-years-old, she started writing short stories. She continued writing in her spare time until college when, between full-time school, full-time work, and the occasional date, she didn’t have any more time for writing.  In 2008, Tori returned to writing and finished her first novel. She wrote a third of that novel on her smartphone during lunches and breaks at work. It took awhile before Tori considered her writing to be anything more than a hobby, but by then she had finished a few books.  Writing taught her to appreciate the mischief her teenagers stir up, that the characters in her head fight back, and that she misses Seattle. Life is still teaching her that her children will grow out of it, and she can visit Seattle occasionally. She’s still looking for a solution on how to deal with her characters.

Eventually Shaun settled in Central Queensland Australia which is still his sentimental home, even though he presently resides in New Zealand.   His love for storytelling came at a young age, born out of an active imagination and the harvesting of mental images grown from the seeds of Enid Blyton's Adventure Series, Michael Ende's two classics and Tove Jannson's wonderful Moomins, among others.   His love for crocodiles comes from staring into the murky waters of the Fitzroy river and other waterways of Central/Northern Queensland and imagining a monster the other side of that murk staring back.   His love for all animals — tiny or huge, nuisance or pet — comes from being human.   In 2011 Shaun was diagnosed with stage three colon cancer.  He is currently in remission and regards his cancer as a gift, as it's enabled him to spend time with his young family and return to storytelling.", "related": ["B00IM1TT24"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Vol échte tips en aanwijzingen.\nTop-werk van de schrijfster Liesbeth Heenk. Ad Westen (7 oktober 2013 op Goodreads)Couldn't have spent my money better!After years of dabbling with converting my books to e-books, all of a\nsudden there is this little guide by Liesbeth Heenk, who tells you\nexactly how to turn your manuscript into an e-book on Amazon. Absolutely\n amazing. I bought her guide two days ago, mailed her one question and a\n day and a half later my book is for sale on Amazon. [..] I am a very happy person and will use your guide to publish the other novels I wrote. Kudo's to Liesbeth HeenkJoost Nillissen (9 October 2013)Just superb!I have been looking for detailed instructions how to make and publish\ne-books for some time now. And then I found this little gem! Well,\nlittle? To be fair, it is a fantastic description on how to make and\npublish an e-book, step-by-step. It guides you through the question on\nhow to publish, do I publish it myself, do I go for traditional, shall I\n go for print-on-demand?? It tells you how to price your e-book, why you\n should go for an e-book in the 1st place and why Amazon is such a good\nplace for e-books! [..] It also covers things like publishing rights, how to\n promote you book and more! But don't believe me; buy a copy and decide\nfor yourself! If I could give 6 stars this product would get them from\nme!- Paul (12 November 2013)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has written and stages many plays first of which was at the age of eighteen. Before the Islamic revolution his plays won prestigious awards in Iran, but after the revolution they were banned from the theater. This, among other reasons, encouraged him to immigrate to France where he pursued his career as a musician and writer with more freedom. He gradually distanced from theater and focused on his music and writing fiction. His first novel appeared quite late in his life in 1995. He has published three novels so far. Some of his works have been translated into French and were quite well-received among French reader. The Spell Chanted by Lambs is his fist work in English.", "related": [], "rank": 3633412, "title": "The Spell Chanted", "author": "Reza Ghasemi", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Eventually the aliens realised how pointless this was and, as a failed student, he was returned to Earth and left with a family who brought him up as a human bean. But, the persistent memories of new worlds, dragons and other creatures, continued to knock at his frontal lobe, desperately trying to break out. To avoid making a mess and calm his imagination, Tim began writing as a way to communicate with Earthlings. Fuelled by Chilli and Nachos and a bottle of wine, Tim manages to balance a love of loud rock music and fast cars (preferably red!) with emotional chic flicks, smart leather shoes and a well tailored suit. He has successfully infiltrated the humans and hides behind the façade known as a family. He learns from his children, but is regularly told to stop acting like a child by his wife. Naturally shy and unsociable by nature, he is selective of the human company he keeps, preferring to be around old books, bonsai and art. He cries at 'It’s a wonderful life' but sulks if fed evil vegetables disguised as Parsnips or Peas. He is bored by mundane conversation, excited by architecture and castles and fuelled by Caramel Latte Macchiato's. Occasionally, he likes to catch up with old acquaintances on Tatooine, Westeros, and Middle Earth, and stare at fantasy and concept art as if it is a window to his childhood adventures. He is always trying to learn lessons from the masters; Mr Charles Darwin and Mr Lionel Ritchie, about life and love. Tim's galactic mission is to translate his brain activity into a language that inspires and entertains you, transports you to different worlds and grants you an audience with the characters you have dreamt about, but never dared to remember. All of this in an attempt to redeem himself with his childhood alien abductors and travel the stars once more.", "related": ["B00IR1F3JW"], "rank": 645317, "title": "Children's Book: The Curious Disappearance of Professor Brown: Hilarious Detective Book For Preteens", "author": "Tim Flanagan", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book takes place at a trailer park up north. 'We're Done', Judy's second book, takes place in a middle school. It's about Luke, who first appears in 'What Did You Say?' Tash and Jon, from the first book, are also characters in this one. In 'What's It To You?', Judy's third book, 13-year-old Tim Stockdale (who first appeared as Luke's classmate in 'We're Done'), is figuring out where he fits in at Carlyle. For Judy, the middle school years are especially interesting since they can be some of the most challenging for kids. It's a time when kids are faced with new issues, and bigger problems, than many have experienced before. As they figure out how they feel, and decide how to respond, they're also figuring out who they are, and shaping the nature of the person they will grow into.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Marie Sanders claims to be a mixture of southern hospitality with northern know-how.  She taught in the public school system for 12 years and has served as a youth pastor for the past 16 years, observing the habits of the age group she hoped to write for one day.  The stories she told in classroom grabbed her reluctant readers’ attention and guided her toward putting the stories on paper.  Her story lines and ideas develop by combining a dash of urban real life with great storytelling fiction and imagination.  E. Marie seeks to grab the reader, youth and adults alike, in the very beginning and continues to build momentum throughout the story in order to make the reading experience a joy for those who frown upon the pastime.  Her first book, To K(no)w Avail, won the 2011 Favorite Book of the Year honors with From a Writer’s POV Magazine.  Her second book, Blindsided, is an Amazon.com Best Seller.  Presently, she is an English Instructor at Robeson Community College in Lumberton, North Carolina, and has begun her doctorate work at Lesley University studying adult education.  E.

Fifteen-year-old Willow is favored by her master, Rev. Jeff. Despite the laws against educating slaves, he has taught her to read and write, although he forbids her to read anything but the Bible. With terribly cruel plantation masters as her neighbors, Willow feels fortunate to have a place in a good home with a \"kind master.\" Just over the Pennsylvania border, Cato, a young black man, born free, is determined to assist as many slaves to freedom as he can. When their lives intersect, Willow's worldview is thrown into question and she is faced with a monumental decision. Hegamin has crafted a suspenseful coming-of-age novel filled with captivating and poetic language. Character building is strong, and Willow's growth and transformation is both heartbreaking and inspirational. A must-read for those who enjoy historical fiction.—Tiffany Davis, Mount Saint Mary College, Newburgh, NY", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

(Bill) Clark was born in Los Angeles and grew up in the shadow of the International Airport (LAX) in the community of Westchester. A product of Catholic schools and 50's Americana, Bill achieved his life's dream of becoming a naval aviator shortly after his 1961 graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. After a combat tour in Southeast Asia in 1965 flying his beloved A-4 Skyhawk from the deck of the USS Midway, Bill spent the next three years in the desert as a weapons delivery test pilot at Naval Weapons Test Center in China Lake, CA.  Bill retired as a Captain in the U.S. Navy Reserves with a combined total of 30 years of active duty and reserve service, and some of his combat exploits were featured in the book Iron Hand: Smashing the Enemy's Air Defenses by A. Thornborough. Later, in Clover, South Carolina, spending his days writing and restoring old cars, an avid story teller who would often recount old sea stories as well as discuss his own fanciful ideas of a good yarn, Bill with the encouragement of his family and friends sat down and literally put pen to paper and wrote Interesting Times.  Bill passed away in 2009 of complications from a surgical procedure. He is interred with some of his classmates in the Columbarium at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He worked for over 30 years in the Police, firstly as a uniformed officer, then as a detective mostly working in the fraud area and finally as an Immigration Officer based in Limerick city. He finished his career as the senior Immigration Officer for the Limerick region in Ireland. He retired in 2008 and set up his own immigration consultancy business but always wanted to write. He was always interested in human nature and the differences, but particularly the similarities, between all peoples who inhabit this small world of ours. During his life as a police officer, and later as an Immigration officer, he has met and dealt with practically all sorts of issues and peoples from the mundane to the extreme. He has also travelled quite extensively, both as an Immigration Officer and privately. He has been to most countries in the EU including the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Austria, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Malta and Croatia, as well as to Belarus and Moldova. KJ also travelled to Thailand and Singapore in Asia, to Australia, in Africa he has been to Algeria, Nigeria and South Africa, Peru in South America and to date has visited 30 of the States of America, his favourite country. KJ Glynn has always been interested in world affairs and indeed the future of our world. He has discussed these issues with many people, both at home and on his travels, and has come to the conclusion that similar social groups of peoples have similar opinions almost everywhere. He himself has finally come to the conclusion that we must confront the overpopulation issue sooner rather than later. He has written 'Depopulate' as a warning! He is currently working on another book and has also started work on the sequel to Depopulate.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Viva la diversity!    Jan aims to share thought provoking human conditions, touch on that bigger picture of spirituality, mystical, ancient traditions or quantum physics to offer you your soul freedom through the ancient art of storytelling; real people, unsung unlikely heroes and a touch of the magical. Jan confessed that she has not owned a television for over thirty years; she would rather be Angel Guide communing, or lost in a creative project, coach teaching, bare foot nature communing, loving up my loved ones and writing with. Jan recalls as a young child, being held captivated with magical yarns of indigenous cultures, saints, mysticism and shamanism then as a teen researching anything ancient mystical shaman which her awkward geeky adolescent soul hungered for. Inspired, she came to understand the spirit world that she saw, felt and understood is all of our inherent birthrights.  A lifetime of evening ferocious spiritual, quantum or philosophical reading while raising children (all much food for growth) followed by a long arduous post-secondary completion of world religions, philosophy and spiritual sciences, she completed a Spiritualist Minister Degree and yes, she is ordained. Not your typical minister type, she strives to carve a new path that takes all of the good of our ancestors, the magic of the cosmos and our positive hopes for tomorrow to make a splash!    Jan aims to offer insights and wisdom of our human condition with higher insights and to empower inspire. She envisions a whole cooperative global community sharing of all that is good in life.      Jan personally wishes you all good blessings on your journey!
