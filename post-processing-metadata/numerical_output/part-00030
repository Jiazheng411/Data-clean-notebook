As many Americans grapple with unemployment, diminished 401(k)s, crumbling stock market holdings and seemingly insurmountable debt, the bright-eyed and bushy-tailed financial sage comes to the rescue, offering this guide to understanding some of the most basic principles of money. In her signature charismatic style, Orman (The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom; The Road to Wealth; etc.) lays out \"simple truths that will help you to be okay no matter what happens in your financial life.\" These laws are essentially common sense standards, certainly reminiscent of phrases from the author's previous books yet still undeniably powerful. For example, law number one, \"truth creates money, lies destroy it,\" rings with simplicity while teaching a mighty rule about staying true to oneself and not embellishing to disillusion oneself or others. Each law is described in a separate chapter, with examples from Orman's life and several everyday folk. Indeed, readers will see themselves in these stories, and they, coupled with Orman's reality-based financial advice, will help make solutions clear for many. A guide included in the book allows readers to reflect on their financial past, order their priorities, organize savings plans and more. This is a shining example of Orman's now-perfected holistic approach to nuts-and-bolts economics.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Eric Alwin is the narrator, a disaffected middle-aged New York ad man who spends his weekends in Maryland caring for his father, Frank, a former politician who can barely speak or move after a debilitating stroke. The road to Frank's demise takes a sharp turn when he demands that his son accompany him on a difficult drive to Alabama to present his apologies to his estranged ex-wife. The trip succeeds despite some rough moments, but Frank is determined to get through a similar agenda with other family members. Gathering passengers along the way, father and son finally end up in Columbus, Ohio, meeting yet another (unexpected) relative. The concept of road trip as catharsis and reconciliation works well in the early going, but as the book progresses, the geographical structure makes the novel read like an awkward emotional travelogue, and the writing lapses into mawkish melodrama (\"What is forgiveness? Is it choosing to ignore and overlook? Water under the dam? Is it a test, or an embrace?\"). Tilghman injects little fresh life into his well-worn conceit.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Originally dismissed by the large New  York City crime organizations, the DeCavalcantes sought the  opportunity to move up in the crime world when their big-city counterparts began having legal troubles and when The Sopranos,  which recounts the life of a fictional Jersey mob family, became  such a hit on HBO. Unfortunately for the DeCavalcantes, they had  been infiltrated by an FBI informant. Although the show's  creator has denied it, much of The Sopranos is said to be based  on this real-life crime family, and DeCavalcante members were  even caught on federal wiretaps bragging about their similarity  to the TV mobsters. But while Daily News mob reporter Smith  draws many parallels between the DeCavalcantes and the fictional  Sopranos, the book does not quite live up to its potential. Much  of the writing seems disjointed and repetitious, and a few  superfluous anecdotes scattered throughout seem to have little  relevance to the rest of the story. Recommended with  reservations for large public libraries where there is a strong  interest in organized crime books.Sarah Jent, Univ. of  Louisville Lib., KYCopyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But once he arrives in xenophobic and unstable England, Rafael does little but whine about the weather and how much he misses his wife and son. Unfortunately for Rafael, his project is delayed, and while waiting to return home, he becomes infatuated with Cecily, a tender housekeeper who becomes his constant companion despite their language barrier. They fall in love (albeit excruciatingly slowly), but their affair is complicated by Rafael's conflicting feelings for his wife. Mary, meanwhile, plays a very secondary role until a late-book shift in which she becomes a paramount force in the narrative as it tumbles toward a surprising conclusion. Although Dunn nails Rafael's fascination with sex, and her eye for detail remains sharp, much of the prose feels stilted, and the interminably slow plot is hobbled by a wallowing narrator and facile treatments of isolation, religious tension and icy domestic life.(Dec.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although the story is set in the 1940s, there is no strong sense of time to it. Jill's perception of her arrogant, seemingly perfect sister and independent brother, and her struggle to bond with them through their adventures is a wonderful example of family life and the need to find one's place.

Fernandez is appropriately cautious and offers very clear guidelinesthat outline core principles that cannot be compromised in a restorative justice based domestic violence program. Neither a quick fix nor a one-size-fits-all approach is put forth. Rather, a range of options that can supplement the court process and support survivor's hunger for healing is offered. This is a must read for all in the restorative justice and domestic violence fields..

However, Will and my other characters spoke to me, as characters often do with authors, and insisted that they continue in further mystery solving adventures in rural America.  Look for It's A Place For Trees and Viking It Is for more of Will and the gang, on Kindle and soon to come in a Createspace edition.  I have additional stories in the works, to be published in the future.  Like Will, I am also a small business owner myself.  My interests include farming and ranching, foreign languages, fiction writing, hiking, cycling, skiing, photography, gourmet cooking, gardening, reading and travel.  I have traveled extensively in the US and Canada and have visited Australia, New Zealand and six European countries.  My goal is to get back into ranching and open an agritourism operation--perhaps not as big as the one described in Ranch Park, however!!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His hard-bitten prose flies off the page at you like the cracking of a machine gun, and he infuses this violent, gritty and fast-paced novel with enough subtle satire and unexpected weirdness to keep you riveted right until you flip the final page.”—Tony O’Neill, author ofSick CityandNeon Angel“Bloody and bloody funny, James Boice’s at once coolly objective and deeply human writing does the dystopian novel like no other.The Good and the Ghastlyreads like Cormac McCarthy executing a Kurt Vonnegut premise through a Joan Didion filter. An original, in other words.”—Andrew Pyper, author ofLost GirlsandThe Killing Circle“James Boice brings the prose as hard as his characters bring the fierce in this post-apocalyptic battle story. A true original, Boice knocks it out of the park again.”—Elizabeth Crane, author ofYou Must Be This Happy To Enter“James Boice’s sentences crack like hot electric bullwhips across the backs of America’s demons. By head-spinning turns arresting, violent, outraged, pointilistically detailed, tender and gut-busting hilarious,The Good and the Ghastlydances across a dystopian future in a mash-up of genre hooliganism and the inventive glee of literary madness. A page-turning adventure like none you’ve ever taken.” —Christopher Ransom, author ofThe Birthing HouseandThe People Next Door“The Good and the Ghastlyis the hallucinogenic fever dream of contemporary satire. Alternately brutal and lyrical, it field-dresses everyday being with poetic violence. A decidedly necessary addition to post-millennial literature.”—Darin Bradley, author ofNoise“Boice’s book is like a literary Magic 8-Ball. Ask it questions, shake it up, and watch the novel’s playful, hilarious, and terrifying hallucination of our future. From one smuck-up to another, you’ll be hooked by the beautiful beating heart propelling this romp’s incredible energy.”—Joshua Mohr, author ofTermite Parade“James Boice’s tale of the fearsome future—and the life of a sadistic striver named Junior Alvarez—is harrowing, heinous, and brilliantly imagined. Boice writes with jagged energy and a rollicking dark wit.

This book is a standalone and I haven-t read the first three books so I can genuinely say it does just that. Ms Sharman tackles some very tough subjects in this tale and she does it brilliantly. Her portrayal of Georgia and her very dysfunctional family pulls you in and even though we-re dealing with drugs, firearms, murder and lawbreakers you find yourself liking them. Georgia-s struggle to overcome her addiction is heart wrenching both during her withdrawal and after. This young girl has suffered worse than anyone should have to but still shows her inner soul to be anything but dead. While not a traditional romance, The Long Road Home is a story of love, a love of family and all that we do to protect what-s ours.- Reviewed by: Rachel C, Fallen Angel Reviews5 Books!-The Long Road Homewas simply one of the best I have read. There were romantic undertones in the book but it focused on addiction, belonging and how hard it is to feel like you are worth something when you hit rock bottom. I read this book after reading the McCassey brothers trilogy and this was a perfect way to round out the family. I felt like I got to know the characters in a very intimate way. Ms. Sharman really nailed addiction and the feelings of those around you while you try to kick whatever habit it might be.The Long Road Homewas brilliantly written with intense feelings of both love and conflict. The action scenes were thrilling with a very well developed plot line that made the book an exciting, sit on the edge of your seat kind of book. I can't wait for the rest of the McCassey books to come out. I love this family and will miss them when the series is finished. Lauren N. Sharman is one of my new favorite authors and I would consider her an automatic add to my to be read list.- Long And Short Reviews", "related": ["B00KC8Q522"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bremmer Mystery Novelist Growing up in Omaha, Nebraska, Patricia A. Bremmer had a strong fascination for mysteries and puzzles. As a young girl, she spent hours solving crossword and other word puzzles and devouring every Perry Mason book she could get her hands on. Patricia married at age twenty, and joined her husband on the road traveling across the United States with a stable of racehorses, giving her a feel for a variety of cultures and landscape. Not to mention an outstanding knowledge of horses. To earn extra money she made jockey silks and saddle towels to sell to trainers and owners at the racetracks. After starting her family, she moved to a small rural area in western Nebraska, which gives her the ability to write that small town country feel into scenes in her books as well as her big city experience.  Bremmer discovered her talent for storytelling in 2003 when she penned her first mystery novel, Tryst with Dolphins. Since then she spends several months of the year putting her plots to paper. She now has 8 titles in her Elusive Clue Series, 2 titles in her mysterious adventures for middle grade (written under P.A. Bremmer), 1 thriller and one picture book. The rest of the time is devoted to her kennel of West Highland White Terriers. An excellent speaker, Bremmer makes guest appearances at libraries, book stores and schools to captivate her audiences with her relaxed tone while discussing her writing. And, to add to the excitement of her appearances, she frequently includes her real life detective who has become the sleuth in her novels. Together they charm and entertain the crowds.  Patricia Bremmer, mother of three has nine grandchildren.

Some elements of the late 18th Century period, such as the clothing worn by students of Winchester College are difficult to research at a distance and requests for information from the college proved in vain.I chose to write the novel using accurate vocabulary for the period and verified every word with Dr. Samuel Johnson's dictionary, originally published in 1755. I added a little 18th Century flavor to the dialog by consulting Jane Austen'sPride and Prejudiceafter reading her book several times. Jane Austen and I are both natives of Hampshire, England; consequently, I feel some bond in that respect.A 2005 visit to the Hampshire village of Bramdean, and the small church of Saints Simon & Jude, built in 1170 AD, prompted the story. While my family was inspecting ancient headstones on the graves outside, I entered the church and sat on one of the pews. It occurred to me that generations of villagers had also sat there for the past eight hundred years and more. The worn flagstones in the aisles bore testimony to that fact and after a while, I had a feeling for the spirits of those generations baptized, married and buried there; I could almost hear their voices. The feeling stayed with me until my return to Tucson, where I decided to write a romantic story introduced and narrated by the ghost of the principal character, Thomas.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

M. Ulmer, a 1954 graduate from the US Naval Academy, served thirty-two years in submarines and submarine support related assignments. He authored Silent Battleground, Shadows of Heroes; Count the Ways, Missing Person, the Roche Harbor Caper and the Long Beach Caper. He contracted his first published book at age seventy-nine. Now, eighty-one, Ulmer has completed a novella, Where and When, and is well into a third Submarine action thriller, Smokeboaters.  He said recently, \"I'm working hard to figure out what I want to be when I grow up.\"      Captain D volunteers twice weekly at a local hospital.  He says of this, \"What a fabulous job.  On the way to work, if I had a tail, it would be wagging.  Interfacing personally with a hundred plus patients per month is likely the most inspiring experience of my life.  Many of these personalities find there way into my novels.  Art imitates life, I'm told.\"    In a recent Patriot Media, Inc. interview D.M. shared his career history and lined up his priorities: \"Thirty-two years in the Submarine Service was a good start. Next came Boeing Company (1979-96), but this was not my career either; my life-long goal; be a published book author.\"    Captain Ulmer went on to say, \"Getting old is not for sissies.  But if you want to keep it going just remember; sitting on one's laurels is fatal.  What you have done does not sustain; only what you do can achieve that.     Aside from writing exciting submarine thrillers, romance novels, and now launching a new detective series with his series included in Patriot Media, Publishing's Tea and Crumpet Capers, Ulmer enjoys sailing, flying in old Stearman Bi-planes, and continues to visit his Submarine friends whenever possible.        When he's not writing or working, he gives his time to his community of Redmond, WA.  In addition to his work at Overlake Hospital Medical Center, Ulmer volunteers at the Seattle Museum of Flight. He lives in Redmond, WA with his ever-supportive wife Carol.", "related": ["B001BZW5CO"], "rank": 1970446, "title": "Where or When eBook", "author": "D.M.

He was an impossibly confident, charismatic, and exacting man who studied his way out of segregated east Baltimore, and into a world of affluence dominated by whites. Lewis earned everything he got in life, except perhaps the one thing that set him on his path to success: admission to Harvard Law School. Family legend has it that Reginald literally talked his way into Harvard through an affirmative action program. It is this conundrum that leads his now-grown daughter--a formerWall Street Journalreporter--to interview his surviving friends, colleagues, and professors for insight into her father's legacy, and his influence on her own sense of self. Along the way, she reveals fascinating tidbits about her life growing up black in the predominantly white world of New York's wealthiest and most successful. The experience left her wondering where she truly belonged. InLonely at the Top, Christina explores her deep-seated self-consciousness and feelings of worthlessness with unabashed and poignant honesty. --Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 870335, "title": "Lonely at the Top (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Christina Lewis Halpern", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A lovely young woman named Dawn married me in 1972 and we were blessed with three wonderful sons – Daniel, Ben and Nathan. Sometime during the 1980s Dawn suggested I write a short story for the three boys, so each lunchbreak I would sit in my car and write and each night I would type what I had written. This was a very different challenge to the journalism I had been trained in as a reporter on a New South Wales country newspaper. When a chapter was completed I would read it to the family and their enthusiasm would encourage me to keep writing (the fact that Daniel, Ben and Nathan were also the starring characters may have strengthened their support!). The short story became a novel which was released in 1989 as “The Fortress of Migdol”. The feedback I received was very positive, and to my pleasant surprise this came from all ages and both genders. These positive responses, as well as our belief that the story had something worth sharing, eventually sparked the idea of giving it a new and more effective distribution. I took the opportunity to rework a lot of the writing and even added whole new events that brought greater depth and breadth to the world of Eldengard and its themes. Finally, after somehow ending up twenty thousand words longer, the new version was finished. “Dewthor and the Fortress of Migdol” was ready to leave home. Dawn and I live in the small bayside community of Woody Point, just north of Brisbane in Queensland, Australia. We have been married for 40 years and our three sons are now  in their 30s.", "related": ["B00AMLJZXK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He would probably have sold more copies had he gone down the autobiographical route, so he deserves credit for attempting instead an ambitious, almost novelistic interweaving of his father and grandfather. Small anecdotes, such as Madeley's childhood discovery of a trunk containing a jar of foil \"money\" made by his great-uncle, who died at the age of four and whose name was never spoken - \"don't mention John\" - contain a wealth of poignancy' Christmas Books, Daily Telegraph 29/11 'Lost love, abandonment, abuse and thwarted dreams 0 it's all here in the TV presenter's account of four generations of Madeley men.

I became another part of a poor but somewhat loving family that lived in Brookhaven Mississippi. Times were hard so my dad moved us all over Mississippi from job to job to support us. After spending a chunk of my life in Mississippi I decided to move to Texas to seek my own life. While living there I met the woman who I thought was going to be the answer to my dream. But like most of my dreams that dream faded quickly away. Then one day in 2002 my Dad called and told me my Mom had had a stroke. So I gave up my good job and packed and moved back to a small town in Mississippi to help my Mom and my then 72 year old Dad. Then came Hurricane Katrina and destroyed our house. But we survived and \"lived\" in a FEMA camper for about six months until our house was rebuilt. We moved back in and thought things would be good now, but I guess I forgot how life is. In the first part of 2008 my Mom was diagnosed with uterine cancer. But fortunately she got a hysterectomy and that took care of that, or so we thought. In early 2011 she was diagnosed with bladder cancer. She had a tough time, after all by then she was 73 years old, but in September 2012 after a few hitches she had her bladder removed. After recovering from the surgery she then had twenty-five treatments of radiation and so far all is well. She still has more bad days than good but she keeps going on.

Through his deep engagement with the logic of Deleuze's project, Zizek opens up new possibilities of thought beyond the terms of the current political debates on globalization, democratization, war on terror. Once again, Zizek has produced an utterly timely and radically untimely meditation.\" -- Eric Santner, author ofOn the Psychotheology of Everday Life:Reflections on Freud and Rosenzweig\"With all his ususal humor and invention, Zizek-- the acknowledged master of the 180 degree turn -- here takes a trip into \"enemy\" territory to deliver Deleuze of a marvelously rebellious child, one that seriously challenges Deleuze's other progeny with a surprising but convincing bid for succession. Those who thought Deleuze's forward march into the future would follow a straight path are forced to rethink their stance. From now on all readings of Deleuze will have to take a detour through this important -- even necessary -- book.\" -- Joan Copjec, author ofImagine There's No Woman\"Even Mr. Zizek's most devoted fans sometimes wonder if he would do them a favor by not writing a book this month. Anyone feeling guilty for not yet having read Organs Without Bodies: On Deleuize and Consequences , published by Routledge in December, may instead want to consult Mr. Zizek's essay on Gilles Deleuze (the philospher of \"schizoanalysis) in the winter issue of Critical Inquiry.\" -- Chronicle of Higher Education\"As a writer, Slavoj Zizek can translate difficult philosophical positions in a succinct way while maintaining its original force and insight....And so,Organs without Bodiesis a provocative and important book for Deleuzians because it successfully opens a reading of Deleuze that is anti-conventional and moves against the current....What all this points to is how Zizek is an unconventional thinker with radical and originary insight.  This makesOrgans without Bodiesa worthwhile and necessary read.\"  --Robert Ramos,Metapsychology Online", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book centers on his rivalry with War Admiral that culminated in a two-horse race to determine the winner. A streamer between the illustration and text on each spread offers a brief description of the event as if it were being broadcast by an announcer. In the paragraphs below it, the author describes Seabiscuit's life from his early, less-than-stellar beginnings as a short-legged, seemingly uncooperative youngster until he was named the 1938 \"Horse of the Year.\" The information is presented in a lively manner and is sufficient for brief reports. The illustrations wonderfully mirror the text using rich colors and eye-catching details such as a portion of a racetrack program and a vignette of the NBC newscaster. The horses are dynamically rendered. Seabiscuit's personality shines through, including his unique sleeping habits. One spread shows him sacked out for the night with his faithful stable mates that included a dog, a spider monkey, and a pony. A glossary of racing terms and brief information about the National Thoroughbred Racing Association Charities are included. Like Seabiscuit, this book is a winner.Carol Schene, Taunton Public Schools, MACopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

An Eye For Danger was exciting, thrilling,\nswoon worthy, and had me biting my nails and gasping in anger or surprise from\nbeginning to end. The suspense portion of the story with all the evasive\nmaneuvers while the hero and heroine are running for their lives made me think\nof The Pelican Brief. I spent all day reading this book and only reluctantly put\nit down long enough to make dinner... (more at (msromanticreads.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/review-christine-m-fairchild-an-eye-for-danger/) ... As for the story as a whole, I can only attribute my rapt\nattention on page after page to the fantastic dialogue and writing skills of Ms\nFairchild. The dialogue witty, sarcastic, caustic, emotional, but the\nconversations never stalled. Descriptions of situations or the world around them\nwere filled with details, sights, sounds, smells. I also loved the fact that I\ncould never put my finger on who was good or bad. The game kept changing, taunts\nand hints were dropped that made me constantly change alliances. The author also\nknows how to write really twisted villains. I'll just say there was a scene\ntowards the end that made my heart pound. This story was an emotional roller\ncoaster, but one I'd gladly hop on again for the thrill of the ride. If you love\nreading romantic suspense with an edge, you won't want to pass this book\nup.Disclaimer: I received a review copy from the author in exchange for\nan honest review.", "related": ["B00GU460T0"], "rank": 1023863, "title": "An Eye For Danger: Book 1 & 2 (The Goliath Conspiracy Series)", "author": "Christine M.

From the Newfoundland accent to the fortitude of a polar adventurer, Holden inhabits his subject. Some, including expedition leader Vilhjalmar Stefansson, later blamed Bartlett for the disaster that left 11 dead and dozens stranded on Russia's Wrangell Island. Defending his competency, Bartlett delivers painfully detailed accounts of food stores and physical conditions, especially during his 700-mile trek for help across the frozen ocean and Siberian coast. Holden handles this subtle defensive posturing with aplomb, keeping the tone even and matter-of-fact. Holden manages to render fresh Bartlett's descriptions of igloo building, dogsledding and polar bear hunting. Rattling adds nice atmospherics, too—the crunching of ice and snow bookends the tale. Bartlett played Chopin'sFuneral Waltzas the ice claimed his ship, and the music accompanies Holden's recounting of the event. The narration soars as the typically reserved Bartlett reunites with his rescued crew, an emotional breathiness imbuing Holden's voice.Based on the 1916 book.

Each fictional character in these novels is fashioned from real characters the author has met over the years. And how did the author meet these people and experience what he writes about? Art (which he prefers rather than Arthur), being of Irish/English descent, was raised in a tough Italian neighborhood in Northern New Jersey, just twenty minutes from Manhattan Island. As a teenager he joined a street gang and was headed for a life in prison except for the fact that he joined the U. S. Air Force, a move that got him out of the gang life. A bite from one of Viet Nam's most deadly snakes almost cost Art his right leg. From Viet Nam he was transferred to Europe and finished his tour of duty in England. Rather than return to his New Jersey neighborhood and previous life, Art chose to be discharged in England where he lived - in London - for the next two years. In London he worked as a Licensed Private Investigator. He came in close contact with many of Europe's criminal underworld. A short stint as a contract soldier for the South African Defense Force, during which he took part in several battles against Cubans training terrorists in Southern Africa, brought him in close contact with professional mercenaries. Returning to the States, Art lived and worked in New York City. He worked as a field agent for a Private Detective Agency in Manhattan. There he came to know even more criminals to base his characters on. Art soon moved to California where he worked as a County Investigator for many years. Marriage and a desire to be self-employed brought Art to Portland, Oregon where he became an independent Licensed Private Investigator, specializing in Criminal Cases and Missing Persons. He took assignments as an Independent Contractor for various Federal Law Enforcement Agencies working as an undercover operative.  Art is now retired and uses his 40+ years of experiences to weave together novels of suspense readers find hard to put down once started. The mystery, suspense and plot twists are all a result of his life's encounters. He finds the characters easy to develop because they are based on real life characters, even down to what they look like and how they dress.", "related": ["B009DQ3LK8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A maligned son spurned by a cruel father, “Hal” is athletic, ambitious, and yearning for empire, and he haughtily assumes the throne upon the greedily anticipated demise of his father. He then proceeds to develop the monstrous ego of legend. Castor’s lively descriptions of Tudor pageantry, political intrigue, and the daily goings-on will have much appeal to historical-fiction fans: picture tournament scenes, dastardly plots, military maneuvers, and the specter of London’s infamous tower. But it is the inner workings of Hal’s mind that set the story apart as a unique and highly psychological tale. Readers follow Henry’s descent into despair and paranoia as the years tick away, and the long-suffering wives are a tragic tale in themselves. Henry’s macabre visions of a zombielike child interspersed at pivotal moments throughout add an edge of horror to this powerful look at a dark side of history.

Fetters: A reoccurring dream kept Grant awake for several nights until he recounted this dream to his wife. The dream was about a Grasshopper that wanted Grant to tell his story. With the encouragement of his wife, Grant started to write about “Horace the Hopper.” This story is about a small green Grasshopper that wants to see the world and what he goes through to be on his journey.  Grant started this project in 1999 and self-published in 2010. In the past several years, Grant has written over 100 short stories of Fiction, Children’s fiction, Young Adult, Mystery, Fantasy, and Memoir stories. His current book “Night Walkers” four young boys are at the end of their summer vacation and they see a moving van rolling down the street.  Could that be new neighbors, yes it could be. But why have they moved into the Haunted House. A novelette, “War Dream” is now available in e-book format and print. This war story is an account set in an active war zone. A new recruit is on his first mission when all hell breaks out. In March 2012 Grant released his apocalyptic book explains how the misconception of the end of time and all mankind is driving hysteria around the country. “False Prophets” takes a humorist look at many of the false prophecies and their theories of how the end will come. Grant is an accomplished speaker in Toastmasters; he uses his speaking skills to give programs and book readings to children in the area. He belongs to several writing groups from Knoxville and Chattanooga, and in his spare time, Grant is a Design Engineer in the automotive industry. He lives in East Tennessee with his wife Sharon and their four cats. Soon to be released “What would Grant do?,” is a collection of short memoir stories from a time when he lived with his grandparents out on the family farm in Michigan. This book will be available in 2012.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Carr's task: to penetrate a German commando operation led by a Cambridge-educated scholar and soldier named Kordt. Kordt's mission, \"China Blue,\" is to cache munitions in India for use by invading Japanese forces now poised on the border. With Kordt is the historical figure of the independence fighter, Subhas Chandra Bose, accompanied by members of his nascent anti-British Indian National Army. Carr infiltrates \"China Blue\" through a wealthy Anglo-Indian beauty, Ashley Vora, a fervent supporter of Bose. Their affair is unconventional enough to serve as a welcome break from the unrelenting tension of the main plot and the more ambiguous relationship between Carr and Kordt. Allington's descriptions of Carr's escape from a German dungeon guarded by cobras, of his epic fight to the death with Kordt's seven-foot bodyguard and of the climactic confrontation between hero and villain after the German has single-handedly destroyed the Bombay docks, are riproaring stuff, stylishly written. Fine background detail adds depth to this engrossing thriller as Allington also evokes the beauty, poverty and mystery of India.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We want to benefit from our experiences while continuously striving to become happy people. Our lives can become very confusing when we interact with others. For instance, are you discouraged when someone says something critical about you? Does it make you feel good if a person expresses something flattering about you? Well, neither one is beneficial, because such peripheral messages are not in your power to control. They create false impressions and unpleasant feelings. We should not let flattery or criticism influence our choices. Accepting as true, other peoples' opinions and placing a value on those opinions puts a measure of control of your life in the hands of others. We are all driven by the same motives, tricked by the same erroneous beliefs, energized by hope, delayed when we are threatened, held prisoner by desire, and a slave to pleasure. With gloom everywhere, the weakness of our leaders and the disappearance of values, what is crucial to a happy and successful life? Character cannot be developed without effort. Only through experiencing of suffering is the soul strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved. Have you ever questioned why people behave as they do and why certain individuals seem to accomplish amazing things, when others who are given countless opportunities fail? Throughout my life, I was challenged with making difficult decisions. I immigrated to the United States when I was twelve years old. My wife and I have raised four children. I am retired from a successful business career and wanted to write about my experiences. I want to share my experiences with readers who may want to learn about growing up in a small town in Italy and using those experiences in America. Individuals need a value-based inspiration that will energize them and sustain them during difficult times.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Nick Hurst is an exception: tiring of life in a London advertising agency, he went to Kuala Lumpur to train for four years with a real Chinese kung fu legend taught by Shaolin monks. Sugong - or \"grandmaster\" - stood just over 5ft but had a swagger and well-muscled presence that belied his stature. Aged nearly 80, he could still hammer six-inch nails into a plank of wood with his bare hands. Hurst's account reveals the brutal training regime he suffered at Sugong's hands, at times literally, before winning grudging respect. But when the Englishman asked to write about his master's life, the response was initially hostile. It is an extraordinary story. Sugong paid for his early lessons by stealing opium from an uncle. Expelled from school, kidnapped and nearly killed in a family feud, he avoided army conscription by fleeing to Singapore, only to be dragged into life as a drug-runner to pay for his passage. To escape, he spent eight years at a Shaolin temple. Always restless, he left to live on his wits and fists in triad-dominated Taiwan, then founded martial arts schools and enjoyed peace and prosperity back in Malaysia before dying aged 83 in 2009. By bringing his dramatic tale to a wider audience the English pupil has amply repaid his debt to his master. -- Simon Redfern 20120617 It is an extraordinary story...

Kant was the last influential philosopher of modern Europe in the classic sequence of the theory of knowledge during the Enlightenment beginning with thinkers John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume. Kant created a new perspective in philosophy which had widespread influences on philosophy continuing through to the 21st century. He published important works on epistemology, as well as works relevant to religion, law, and history. One of his most prominent works is the Critique of Pure Reason, an investigation into the limitations and structure of reason itself. It encompasses an attack on traditional metaphysics and epistemology, and highlights Kant's own contribution to these areas. The other main works of his maturity are the Critique of Practical Reason, which concentrates on ethics, and the Critique of Judgment, which investigates aesthetics and teleology. Kant’s thought was very influential in Germany during his lifetime, moving philosophy beyond the debate between the rationalists and empiricists. The philosophers Fichte, Schelling, Hegel and Schopenhauer each saw themselves as correcting and expanding the Kantian system, thus bringing about various forms of German idealism. Kant continues to be a major influence on philosophy, influencing both analytic and continental philosophy.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We're all made up of so many different interests, beliefs and motivations. I love books, dogs, kind people, spending lots of time outdoors, juicing, making huge salads and fundraising for my local Humane Society.You might like one of my books if: you like a good love story that makes you laugh and makes you cry.you like the main characters in your reading to be someone you wouldn't mind being and someone you wouldn't mind marrying.you like animals in your stories: dogs, cats, horses, cows.you like books for kindle, iPad and other ereaders.you like to keep the rating at PG-13.I fell in love with reading as a little girl, devouring most of the books in my elementary school library. At some point, I decided I wanted to pursue a writing career, creating romance fiction that might provide the hours of entertainment and escape my favorite books have provided for me. I love character-driven books that leave me feeling as if I've really known these people and make me wish I didn't have to turn the last page.Romance fiction has always appealed to me because it deals with so many of the relationships in a woman's life. Not only the love of her life, but often her relationship with her mother, sister or best friend. Romance authors have so much room to explore many of the meaningful moments and transitions in women's lives. And who doesn't love a good love story?I most often write stories about love and life that are set in small Virginia towns like the one where I grew up. I like to think the flavor of my hometown shows up in my books both in their setting and through the characters who people it.Outside of writing, I'm actively involved in dog rescue, working with to place dogs and cats in need of rehoming. Helping an abused or neglected dog go on to have a wonderful life with a family who loves them is more rewarding than I can possibly say!Inglath", "related": ["B00GKKU12G"], "rank": 42845, "title": "The Nashville Series - Book Two - Hammer and a Song", "author": "Inglath Cooper", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 13, "rating_average": 4.4615, "rating_total": 58.0}

Tori is a philanthropist, entrepreneur, teen queen and author. Tori is a 9th grader at New Orleans Center for Creative Arts where she studies acting/drama. Tori is also an author with Atlanta based Delphine Publications and is set to release her first inspirational book, When I Decided to D.R.E.A.M. BIG in May 2013. Tori is very active; not only socially and civically, but also in sports. She has competed in competitive cheerleading and was on her school s volleyball team for three years. She has also been formally trained in piano, voice, acting, gymnastics, and dance. Last year, Tori released her first pop-rock single on her record label T Star Entertainment as a public service announcement to other teens encouraging them to be comfortable with being who God created them to be and whatever that is; Rock It. Tori s musical ventures are for the sole purpose of inspiration and encouragement. Tori is also a youth advocate for the Louisiana and Texas Gulf Coast Chapter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation through the Kids for Wish Kids Program. In 2011 she raised thousands for the foundation in order to help other children. Tori founded the Tori Turner s D.R.E.A.M. BIG Foundation at the tender age of 12 years old with a mission of financially supporting the dreams of youth around the state of Louisiana. Her foundation was birthed through her dream of becoming a professional actress, model and entertainer. In 2011, her foundation issued over four thousand in scholarships to deserving youth and put on the D.R.E.A.M. BIG Benefit Concert featuring Jive recording artist Kourtney Heart and Universal recording artists Final Draft. The concert also featured youth around the state of Louisiana and Mississippi that desired to showcase their talents as upcoming artists in the entertainment industry. The concert was partly funded by Lil Wayne s Family 1st Foundation, along with other generous sponsors. Last year the D.R.E.A.M. BIG Foundation also hosted the first Calling Teens to Action/Teens Making A Difference Community Service Fair. As the 2012 Miss Black Louisiana USA Talented Teen, Tori was awarded the National Miss Black USA Talented Teen Community Service Award which is given to the national delegate that has done the most in her community and beyond during her state reign. During her reign, Tori called teens to action through, community service/volunteerism and youth entrepreneurship, inspiring them to be the change that they want to see in their communities. She firmly believes that you are never too young to make a difference! Tori traveled the state of Louisiana as a teen change agent. She spoke at numerous events as an advocate for change in her generation and for peace through the premise of carrying out Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. s legacy. She believes that it is up to her generation to grasp hold to and carry Dr. King s legacy forward to future generations! In her spare time, Tori loves to serve her community through her foundation, her service affiliations and volunteerism with programs such as Home Mission, Inc. where she participates in the Feed the Hungry mission and Mark Ingram s Foundation; geared toward assisting children of incarcerated parents and many more! Tori plans to go on to become an academy award winning actress and a grammy winning musician. She also plans to attend college, majoring in the performing arts and business administration. Her message to others is to always D.R.E.A.M. BIG and believe in God and yourself and you can do whatever you set your mind to. The journey of one thousand miles begins with one single step and Tori continues to take steps toward her destiny!", "related": ["B00GFZMO5S"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Drawing upon the archives of colonial ballads, she describes the circumstances that propelled 400,000 English across the Atlantic in pre-Revolutionary times. Like today's country music, lyrics of that era relate tales of murder, rivalry, false promises, and cheating hearts. Brooks also uses her own lineage to illustrate the hardship of life circa 1770. With unprecedented population growth and an economy that shifted from subsistence to exports, 18th century England produced a new class of landless laborers, which included her forefathers. The old songs were kept alive by 20th century folk singers such as Davy Crockett Ward, his wife Lina, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, Attie Crane, and Horton Barker. In the 1930s folklorist Alan Lomax moved his School of the Air radio show to Virginia to collect the traditional tunes now stored at the Library of Congress. That collection includes the ballad of Two Sisters and a Beaver Hat, which concludes: \"Then young men have a care/of painted curled Locks. For such, though faire above, below may have the Pox.\" These ballads may be the best surviving records of what brought so many here.

The thought brought\nwith it shadow, a bone-deep chill. She looked up at the sky, but the sun still\nshone brightly, no clouds. Back into the woods. She'd run all the way out. Six\nmiles, maybe more. Keeping to the path, though she'd wanted to run wild into\nthe brush. Looking over her shoulder, tripping on exposed roots, crashing\nthrough tender growth, Natalie Forrester had run scared through woods she'd\nbeen exploring since childhood. She didn't want to go back there. Not ever. She\nshook her head, looked at the officer and said, \"No.\"\"You won't be alone, Miss Forrester,\" the deputy promised.But he was wrong. In the woods, you were always alone.\"I'm not going back,\" she told him. She'd give them directions,\nagain, more detailed, describe the trees at each turn more individually. The\nwildflowers at the entrance to Jackman Trail were the only red in bloom. She'd\nturned west there, followed an unmarked but well-worn path. She'd draw a map.\"Miss Forrester.\" The deputy's voice was stretched into patience.\n\"Several deputies will accompany you. They'll take you in, mark the site, and\nbring you right back out.\"She didn't want to see it again. Him, she corrected. He'd been a\nperson. A man. She'd recognized his gender by the shape of his body, the strong\nline of his jaw, where skin was opened by man or animal and bone exposed.\nSomeone's brother, husband, father. For a moment, as she'd stood before him,\nshe saw him animated. His face grim, he was holding a gun, his arms outstretched.\nHe fired and a white-winged bird lifted from the barrel of the gun and settled on\nthe shoulder of another man. Natalie's throat had closed. She'd struggled for\nbreath. And for a moment she was convinced she was dying. And then the image\nbroke, shattered, and she was again in the woods with a dead man.She'd noticed that he'd been shot. A small hole, off-center and\nburned black at the edges of the torn skin, had been blown above his eyebrow.\nHis shirt hung loosely from his shoulders. The wind, full of the salt air\nrising from the Pacific, lifted the shirt tails like ribbons on a windsock. She\nrefused to remember anything more.\"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"I've done all I can.\" \"Nottoo\nfar ahead.\"Natalie heard her father's voice, but she listened to the music in\nit and not the words. Her father had a voice that lifted like a question mark.\nHer mother said he spoke like he was always asking a question because he was a\nprofessor and that's what professor's did, ask questions. Natalie liked it because\nit seemed to her that he was interested in what she was thinking.She ran on, around a bend in the path, and then another. It was\nthe first day of spring and though the air was cool, they'd come out to\ncelebrate the opening of flowers and butterfly wings. She was six, in the first\ngrade, and he'd excused her from school for the day.\"Nat. Nat,\" her father called through the tall grass. His voice\nbarely reached her ears. The poppies swayed, covering the hillsides, and caught\nher attention. She left the path and started toward them. She touched each\nbloom gently, stroking their ashy petals, wading further into the rolling\nmeadow with the intention of touching every one of them. And she'd gotten lost.She remembered when she first noticed the absence of her father.\nHe was no longer calling her name. Natalie spun around in the field of wildflowers\nlooking for her father's slender body, his bright head of blonde hair. She was\nalone. She heard herself whimper, told herself to stop that, she'd be found.\nShe did what she often did when she became separated from her parents in a\nstore, she started calling for her father, wandering, looking for him. Stars\ncame out before the sky was fully dark and Natalie consoled herself with the\nthought that it wouldn't get truly dark. Not the blackness of a cave or beneath\nher bed. She talked herself to sleep and woke in the morning, stiff from the\ncold, hollow inside, her blood full of the fear of being lost. And then a woman\nstepped out of the woods and into the meadow and said to Natalie, as calmly as\nif she'd been lost only a few minutes, \"There you are.\"Not a month later, her father taught Natalie to walk the woods\nalone. To read the trees, recognize patterns in the brush. He didn't want her\nto live with a fear of the woods, to never again enjoy their beauty. He gave\nher a compass, stood her at the edge of the woods, with civilization\ncomfortingly at her back, and taught her to work direction. If she headed north\ngoing in, then out was south. After that, he walked her into the woods, first a\nquarter mile, then a half mile, eventually more than five miles in, and left\nher. \"I'll see you back at the car, Nat.\"She taught herself not to think of it as a battle, not to fight\nher way out of the trees, not to jump at the crack and hiss of the woods. She\ntalked herself into believing she could do it. She learned that the woods were\na constant. Familiar, if you knew what to look for, and deadly if you didn't. Thehike back in was longer. She didn't anticipate the signs of spring; she didn't allow her eyes to\ncatch on the colors and shapes; she didn't listen to the chatter of birds and\nsquirrels. Behind Natalie, seven deputies crowded the trail, some with little\nrespect for nature. They whipped at the tall grass with their arms, plucked and\ntossed the season's last blooms.When she picked up the scent of the ocean, fear began to bunch in\nher stomach. She curled her hands into fists and walked on. She used her body\nand its sense of space, remembered space, and stopped just short of where she'd\ncome upon him. The deputies piled to a stop behind her.\"I'm not going any further,\"\nshe said. \"He's around there.\" She pointed to a bend in the path. \"Right side.\nAn alder tree.\"They moved around her,\nstomping on fern and wild oat. There was poison ivy mixed in the greenery; at\nleast one of them would catch the spores on their skin.All seven deputies moved up\nthe trail, leaving Natalie alone.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Durbin. Joshua and his friend, Caleb, are caught stealing straw from Pharoahs stables and brought before him to be sentenced. The procedure is interrupted when Moses and Aaron enter the court accompanied by 12 strong Hebrew men. Hours later, Joshua, of Ephraim, and Caleb, of Judah, find themselves in the home of Moses. Along with Gaddi, of Manasseh, they are asked to find the body of Joseph, so his bones can lead Israel out of Egypt. Later, two young women are added to the group one of them a spy for Pharoahs priests, the Bakari. The assignment takes the group on a dangerous trek, followed from one Egyptian temple site or burial place to another by angry soldiers and Bakari priests intent on thwarting their mission. Joshua not only finds Josephs body, he discovers a lot about himself and God. As an added bonus, he finds the strong, faithful woman he s been looking for as a wife. The novel is a well-written, historically well-researched, fast-paced adventure that brings the story of the Exodus to life. Its a book that is hard to put down. Told from a unique perspective, the novel can inspire re-reading the biblical account of the Exodus with renewed interest. --By Rosemarie Howard For the Deseret News", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Addressed primarily to victims (Afraid to Bees) of aggression by other women in the workplace, family, church, school and even in feminist organizations, the author also advises the aggressors (Queen Bees) and those who enable them (Middle Bees). Many dramatic anecdotes describe harrowing wounds inflicted by aggressive female supervisors; devious behavior by competitive colleagues; and mothers-in-law who criticize and belittle their sons' wives. Dellasega provides strategies for dealing with bullies and cautions Middle Bees that their role will bring them guilt and anxiety. Queen Bees, she warns, will lose self-esteem and all possibility of satisfying connections with women. To overcome all three self-defeating patterns, the author recommends positive confrontation, working on self-awareness and reaching out to other women for more satisfying relationships. But Dellasega's simplistic categorizing of women into three classes and her assumption that all forms of relationship aggression fit into the same mold help make this a minor addition to the literature on female aggression.(Oct. 3)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(After he died I wrote to the New Zealand Defence Department to check\nif the medals were still available. They were, and I have them now in my desk\ndrawer.)He and my mother became\nleaders of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and I was raised in the 1950s\nand 1960s in an intensely anti-war environment. Yet at the same time my uncle -\nmy father's younger brother, who as a boy had been smuggled by Jewish groups\ninto pre-war Palestine - was a career officer in the Israeli army. I used to\nadmire the photographs he sometimes sent us, of him in his uniform, on\nmaneuvers in different parts of the Holy Lands.I guess that ambivalence\nabout military matters stuck with me. So in middle age, after I became a\nChristian, if I'd been asked my views about armed service, I might have\nanswered with something vague to the effect that of course we need an army, but\nthat it's better that Christians not serve in it. Because armies are for killing,\nand Christians shouldn't kill.Or I might have said that I\nclassified soldiers with lawyers and real estate agents. When you need them you\nexpect them to get down and dirty. Better they not be Christians.But in 2002 I started\nblogging, trying to place a Christian spin on events of the day. One of the big\nissues at that time was the looming US invasion of Iraq, and I became\nfascinated with notions of how Christians should regard war. I began writing\nblog posts based on the many questions I had. Questions such as: when can a\nChristian soldier kill?  Does God\nstill speak directly to military commanders, as in Old Testament times? What\ndoes a Christian soldier do when ordered on a suicide mission?(If you are interested, the\nUS Library of Congress subsequently added\nmy blog posts to a special\ncollection of 231 websites it had compiled as an online resource for\nhistorians and others wishing to research the war, and they also form the basis\nof this devotional study.)I encountered similar issues\nwhen I came to write my novel \"Brother\nHalf Angel.\" It is a thriller, about an underground seminary in China under\nattack from sword-wielding members of a local cult who still pay homage to the\nbloodthirsty extremists who tried to expel all foreigners from China in the\nnineteenth century. Members of the seminary - including a pair of idealistic\nyoung American missionaries - find themselves involved in tense debate over how\nfar Christians can go to defend themselves.So this study is primarily\nabout real soldiers and real warfare. But, as we all know, Christians are\ncontinually at war, a spiritual battle against a relentless and insidious enemy\nwho is intent on undermining our victory in Jesus. We are reminded of this in\nPaul's famous words: Finally, be strong in the\nLord and in His mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that you can take\nyour stand against the devil's schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh\nand blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers\nof this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly\nrealms.(Ephesians 6:10-12) So this is\na devotional study forallChristians as we engage in that battle.", "related": [], "rank": 2418515, "title": "A Psalm for the Battle: Reflections on Psalm 18, Christians and Warfare", "author": "Martin Roth", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She wrote on and off over the following years, occasionally losing the plot when life got in the way but always mindful that having a book published was on the bucket list.     This finally happened in 2007 when her Young Adult book In Too Deep was published by Scholastic NZ Ltd.  This was followed by High Speed and Where the Flag Floats published by Pear Jam Books in 2011 and 2013 respectively.  Both books are adventure stories for the 8-12 age group. In July 2013 the follow up to In Too Deep, Three Times Dead, was published by Standfast Publications Ltd.   D C Grant writes primarily about boys because she reads books for boys.  Her favourite authors are Lee Child and Bernard Cornwall and with these influences she was never going to be a romance writer.  Her interests include military history, target shooting and rugby union, unusual pursuits for a girl but primary sources for plot ideas, however she has been known to do the occasional crosstitch and even turn her hand to knitting. D C Grant currently lives in Auckland, New Zealand but was born in Manchester, England and lived for twenty years in Durban, South Africa.

Just like parents and guardians take an active role with school homework, this book will aid a child at home, to get a better understanding of the basic principles of reading music in order to enjoy a long and fulfilling music education.

JohnsonPaul F. Johnson has been writing software since the days of the old 8-bit micros in the 1980s, with his first published piece of software being made in 1984 for the BBC Micro. From there, his passion to learn and develop increased along with his love for Chemistry. For many years, he married the two at the University of Salford, culminating in commercial work for RiscStation Ltd. as well as working on the award winning Scribus desktop publishing application.For many years, Paul contributed a large amount of time to the Fedora Project (a community-based Linux distribution sponsored by RedHat), and in 2002, he started to become interested in the Mono project from Ximian. That was the beginning of the end of his time in education, and over the next 10 years, he learned how to code in VB.NET and C#. Ximian was sold to Novell, who in turn were bought out themselves, and from that, Xamarin was born. The rest is history.With the advent of a workable .NET system that can be used in a non-Windows environment, the stage was set and the hard work could begin. When Xamarin released monodroid, Paul could see that his years of learning could now be turned into profit and went full-time developing code for the platform. Shortly afterwards, he began working on iOS devices as well.At the start of 2013, Paul along with Andrei and his good friend Scott, formed Sporkish, the objective being to produce unbeatable software for the mobile world.This is his first foray into the world of books, though he has had many articles published in the Overload and C Vu journals of Association of C and C++ Users (he edited the latter for over a year). He is currently developing mobile applications for Farmtrack Pty (Australia) and HelloU (London, UK), and is in discussions with Packt Publishing on the publication of another book, this time on AI and Expert Systems.Paul is 42, lives with his wife, dog, cats, and son, and drinks way too much coffee!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was the impetus that got him started on pursuing answers to those questions. What he came to understand on that journey was that we are all one \"family,\" and that we are all intimately connected at the deepest level.  For the last 15 years he's worked as a therapist and social worker primarily with children with disabilities, and adults with mental health difficulties. He enjoys working with clients in a way that recognizes or focuses on the shared connection between them, and honors each individual's strengths and unique gifts.

Ted Steinberg’s explanation inGotham Unboundis erudite, wise, unfailingly readable—and alarming as hell. This is environmental history at its best, and a must-read for anyone who has ever wondered what lies ahead for New York City.\" (Edwin Burrows, coauthor of the Pulitzer Prize winning Gotham)\"Magnificently demonstrated in this unique, highly revealing history of Greater New York, prize-winning author Ted Steinberg is a pioneer in the field of ecological history. From Henry Hudson's magical discoveries in 1609 to Hurricane Sandy's rampant destruction, Steinberg narrates four centuries of never-ending landed fill-ins, destruction of estuaries, and building. Every page about this eastern landed frontier reveals the world's leading city from a fresh, crucially important perspective.\" (Walter LaFeber, winner of the Bancroft Prize and Tisch University Professor Emeritus, Cornell University, and author of The American Age)\"This is the best history of an American city I have read—stunningly original, brilliant in research and argument, delightful to read, and vital for our urban future. Whatever New Yorkers may have achieved in the accumulation of wealth or social wellbeing, they have written a tragic story in ecological terms. Henceforth we will not be able to think of the city without also thinking of it as one of the world’s most damaged estuaries and of the teeming diversity of plant and animal life that once lived here.\" (Donald Worster, winner of the Bancroft Prize, University of Kansas and Renmin University of China, author of A Passion for Nature: The Life of John Muir)\"Gotham Unboundgoes deeper than underground history; it is underwater history! Steinberg shows how the development of Manhattan's waterways and lands -- often out of sight -- shaped the creation of today's New York City. He reminds us that unnatural cities stubbornly remain part of the natural world -- and that world has a history. To really understand New York City, leave Wall Street behind, put on your hip-waders, and jump in the bog.\" (Louis Hyman, Cornell University)\"Steinberg brings to the center of New York's history what nowadays we mostly see only at its edges: the sea breezes and river currents, the creatures that swarm under and the ships that sail over the harbor's waters - waters on which the city's inhabitants have advanced with waste and fill for centuries. Even the trim outlines of Manhattan island represent the boundaries of aggressive settlement, as human New Yorkers, like successful Canutes, have pushed back the tides. Steinberg's story shows how literally the city is the product of ambition and invention, its very shorelines the result of commercial desires. Lively, deeply researched, and well told, a pleasure to read and cogitate upon.\" (Eric Rauchway, University of California, Davis)\"Ted Steinberg has written a historical masterpiece-- a remarkably original and superbly crafted book about the relentless making and unmaking of the landscape of America’s greatest, most protean city.Gotham Unboundwill enlighten anyone who cares about the past and future of New York.\" (Michael Kazin, author of American Dreamers: How the Left Changed a Nation and editor, Dissent)\"The story of how the wild and woodsy Isle of Manhatta in 1609 became the hyperdense city of today. In the centuries-long war between New York and nature, nature lost virtually every battle—but then suddenly, in 2012, Hurricane Sandy exposed the dangers of denial. Ted Steinberg has written a magnificent book that transforms our understanding not just of New York City but of the future that faces all of us.\" (Jon Wiener, Univ. of Calif., Irvine)\"Gotham Unboundis much more than a brilliant book about a great city. I am awed by Ted Steinberg’s ability to make so sprawling a story into a powerful parable about the challenge – and the ultimate folly – of aspiring to limitless growth.\" (Adam Rome, author of The Genius of Earth Day: How a 1970 Teach-In Unexpectedly Made the First Green Generation)“Like each of his earlier books, Steinberg's Gotham Unbound is a revelation: in this case of the water world that New York once was and thanks to global warming may yet become again.\" (Mike Davis, author of City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles)“What happens when one of America’s great environmental historians studies one of America’s great cities? The result, revealed in the pages ofGotham Unbound, bursts with as many fascinating characters and unforgettable stories as Manhattan itself.\" (Karl Jacoby, author of Crimes Against Nature)\"The great American city now has a fresh, insightful history that will open readers’ eyes to the ongoing role of nature in an evolving metropolis. It’s a grand account, epic in scope and full of amazing revelations. Give this book to anyone who cares about environmental and urban studies and keep a copy for yourself.\" (Clyde A. Milner, author of As Big As the West: The Pioneer Life of Granville Stuart)\"Describing an island estuary that became one of the world’s most densely populated cities, this fascinating, encyclopedic history views three centuries of continuous transformation of greater New York City through an ecological lens.\" (Publishers Weekly (starred))\"Richly researched and illustrated—a wholly edifying account.\" (Kirkus (starred))", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fee is a New Zealander who is a lover of great vegan food.  After adopting a vegetarian lifestyle in the 90's she experimented with many different ingredients in order to create more appetizing and appealing food as New Zealand, at that time, was no where near embracing vegetarianism. Early into the second decade of the 21st century, Fee had begun to learn about the welfare of farmed animals both overseas, but more importantly, within New Zealand.  It was this knowledge of the farming industry that led her to adopt a vegan lifestyle. She is actively involved with SAFE, a New Zealand organization which campaigns to stop factory farming along with other animal welfare issues, and she does what she can to help educate others to the benefits of adopting animal free living even if it is only for one day a week.  She has an active blog where she takes great delight in venting her frustrations (in a humorous way), with animal welfare, lack of vegan choices, environment, short-sighted politicians and other things. Fee has three children, two of whom are vegan, and two grandchildren.

Steve Kaplan, editor of the legendary magazineMinnesota Law & Politics, states, Hobbes can be provocative and even infuriating. But, his original take on subjects...are carefully argued, convincing challenges to idea too often taken for grated. Activist and author Matthew Matt Little sums up, Dwight Hobbes is one hell of a writer. The foreword is written by renowned historian, scholar and respected community griot Mahmoud El-Kati. --dhHosanna! Dwight Hobbes has finally weaved together a compelling compilation of his timely, important and his always interesting, though sometime unsettling, commentary on the world that he surrounds. It consists of a miscellany of his writings from various publications sandwiched into book form.In my view, this book is a welcomed dimension to his prolific catalogue of literary gifts as a columnist, critic, playwright, musician, lyricist, and poet. This in addition to his philosophical, ironic and comedic sensibilities, which inherently underlies his work. As a writer, Hobbes, has given himself his own moral assignment. He is part every man, part one of a kind and to say the least, he is a challenging personality. To his credit, he is aware of these traits with no apologies.Dwight Hobbes has for a number of years, been a veritable watchful and arresting gadfly with the pen, tackling nearly every social and political topic on the agenda of public discourse. By turns, through his newspaper columns, he has managed to cajole, assault, confound and annoy his readership without skipping a beat. And yet by some magical chemistry, he embraces his readership with occasional strokes of tender loving kinship, as a responsible member of a marginalized community.In some respects, Dwight Hobbes is a modern throw to the like of H. L. Menken and George S. Schuyler, two acerbic journalists who did not bite their tongues. Menken, of the Baltimore Sun, a European-American pain-in-the-neck or lower to the white power structure of his day from the 1920s to after the WWII era. Schuyler, an African-American, who wrote a nationally syndicated column in Black weeklies such as the Pittsburg Courier, who pointed his poisonous pen of detraction against the established African-American leadership of his times (late 1920s through the 1960s). But Hobbes , main thrust is employed as a surveyor, social critic, political agitant, and artistic exponent of the ways of Blacks and beyond.This book offers critical commentary of some of the most critical questions of our age. Hobbes begins with a bang, addressing his arduous and terrifying experience as a homeless person. In ruthless, uncompromising language, he describes homelessness in two places where he has had the experience. Twin Cities social service programs bend over backwards to put people on their feet, make them self-sufficient, you stand a fighting chance, compared to someplace like New York, where homelessness amounts to a living death sentence.In summation, let it be said that Hobbes sweeping panoramic view of social ills affecting African American life in part a service reminding us of the nitty-gritty reality of tolerated and unnecessary human suffering: The sweep through homelessness, endemic violence, abuse of women by men and vice versa, victims of incarceration, rape, in short, the mean street and Black conservatives are challenges to African American culture. His recitation of the sins of flesh is an obvious call to action. Something I Said is a book, which clearly outlines social problems begging for studied attention. Some of the horrific problems are but dramatic symptoms, which points to a far deeper intractable historical realty and that is the malicious doctrine of White supremacy, which establishes institutions, large and little, which in turn produces sustained pervasive acts against innocent people. In this age of post racial or multiracialism racism still prevails. And by racism, I mean white supremacy.In deed some of the questions raised by the author are seemingly self-inflicted, a matter of personal irresponsibility, and a bit of it is, but we must never allow ourselves to forget the larger, deeper trans-generational question of systemic racism, which has to do with power, oppression and domination. --Mahmoud El-Kati", "related": [], "rank": 2518490, "title": "Something I Said", "author": "Dwight Hobbes", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What kept me going?  I knew this book was inside of me; I had been carrying around the stories of two, black murdered Southern lawyers for a number of years and wanted to do something with what I had discovered. For years, I researched and wrote everything that I could find on the murders of Cleve McDowell of Drew, Mississippi and Henry S. Mims of Montgomery, Alabama. When I exhausted all information and wrote what I could, I still had no answers. So I put my creative mind to work in the context of historical, paranormal, alternative fiction and came up with The Plan. Please enjoy. And please write a review. I look forward to hearing from you.

Written in a creative style, and easily read in one session, it draws appropriately on art and poetry from therapeutic journalling. Many babyboomers experienced the stress disorders of parents surviving war. Some may also have developed \"Body Dysmorphic Disorder\".  Suzanne generously shares these life-threatening experiences and her intensive and very successful psychotherapy. This lasted intermittently for nearly thirty years. The story has much sadness and distress, but keeps producing wonderful surprises.  I found the telling honest, clear and engaging. It is rare for people to keep facing their pain, to discover the really deep origins of this, and to find the healing solutions. For therapists, there are good insights and learnings.  For those experiencing similar disorders there is hope.  For pastors there is a role model. An essential part of the journey is the spiritual renewal which was sparked by a taxi-driver and facilitated by a conscientious pastor. Read this book with an open heart, savour the insights, and find your own grace.

Natural resources are becoming increasingly scarce, and the planet's sinks for absorbing waste products are already exhausted in many contexts. In Extracted, Ugo Bardi tells the story of our planetary plunder from its beginnings up through the present. He tells it with verve and insight, and he offers a powerful perspective on what the implications are for the future. This newest report from the Club of Rome demands our serious attention.\"--James Gustave Speth, author of America the Possible: Manifesto for a New Economy and former dean, Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies\"Here is the book many of us in the sustainability world have been looking forward to: a comprehensive, readable, historically informed inquiry into the depletion of Earth’s mineral resources. Extracted should be on the reading list of every introductory class in economics—as well as environmental studies, geology, history, political science . . . heck, everybody should read it.\"--Richard Heinberg, senior fellow, Post Carbon Institute; author, The End of Growth“Although Ugo Bardi’s fine book focuses on extraction, it also discusses geological formation of minerals and ores, mining, metallurgy, coinage of precious metals, debt, waste, pollution, climate change, and the dark side of mining. Interspersed are short digressions written by other experts on related topics ranging from soil fertility and plants as miners, to peak oil and coal, and the Hubbert depletion curve. The book is clearly written and insightful. Highly recommended!”--Herman Daly, author ofEcological Economics; professor emeritus, School of Public Policy, University of Maryland\"Most decisionmakers and citizens view money as the primary driver of our societies. Yet our civilization is first dependent on extraction of natural capital—minerals, ores, and particularly energy–that are the precursors for everything in our economies. Ugo Bardi and guest authors provide an excellent overview on the history, significance, and future of minerals and energy and how this relates to our human ecosystem. Wide boundary thinking at its best.\"--Nate Hagens, former editor,The Oil Drum; former vice-president, Solomon Brothers and Lehman Brothers“Ugo Bardi’s book is an effective piece of work for stimulating thought and debate on this planet’s mineral wealth, and how we should view this issue within the framework of sustainability. The book goes into the history of how human society has used minerals, their relationship with the evolution of human civilization, and how we should use these resources in the future. There is a wealth of information in this volume that deals with important minerals like uranium, lithium, rare earths, copper, nickel, zinc, phosphorous, and others. Readers would find the material presented very informative and a valuable basis for discussions on minerals policy.”--Rajendra K. Pachauri, chairman, UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; CEO, The Energy and Resources InstitutePublishers Weekly-\"Our massive global mining infrastructure is showing signs of strain, writes Bardi (The Limits of Growth Revisited), University of Florence professor of chemistry, in this insightful if pessimistic description of the industry’s history, operation, and future. All mined minerals including carbon (coal, oil, gas) are unrenewable resources whose supply is already dwindling. Sadly, as with global warming, there are skeptics and denialists who insist that (a) it’s not true, and (b) technology will fix matters. These same opponents state, correctly, that we have extracted a minuscule fraction of the oil, iron, or even gold in the earth’s crust. But they ignore that, as ore quality diminishes and extracting becomes harder, the price rises. For example, platinum (essential in catalytic converters), silver, and oil cost four times more than in the year 2000. They also assume that technology will produce a 'universal mining machine,' which will consume ordinary rock, extracting whatever is valuable. Although theoretically possible, such a machine would require immense amounts of energy and leave behind unthinkable quantities of waste. Bardi concludes that things must change, and though his is not an encouraging book, readers will appreciate his intelligent, lucid, and disturbing account of our mishandling of mineral resources.”", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Life seems to have passed her by, but it's actually just beginning. Under Larry Baker's masterful pen, you are immediately transported back to high school with the once student, Nancy, now suddenly among the teachers. Baker's cast of characters, weird and distinctly Southern at times, are nonetheless a microcosm of people we all know, real but by no means stereotypical. Among them you will meet yourself either as you are, imagine yourself to be or aspire to become. There is of course no Nancy without the people she's about to both teach and learn from. And others are not always what they seem. As you begin to know more of who they are, you will also begin to know more of yourself. A compelling - and often funny - read from start to\nfinish, Larry Baker now has a permanent place on my short list of favorite novelists.\" Beverly Willett, essayist and columnist, Salon and Huffington Post.", "related": [], "rank": 1651010, "title": "The Education of Nancy Adams", "author": "Larry Baker", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
