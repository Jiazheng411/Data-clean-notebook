The version being reviewed here is the Omnibus volume which contains all 3 novels in the series.In the distant past an all but forgotten race called the Eldric fought against the demon hordes in the legendary Krell Wars. In a close fought battle the Eldric became victorious and banished the soul of the Demon Horde's leader, a sorcerer of immense power known as Drachar. After the battle the Eldric disappeared from the land, taking with them the knowledge of sorcery lest another rise up and miss-use the power and they, along with the war and knowledge of demons faded into myth and legend.Recent times have given rise to a prophecy that says the shade of Drachar will rise again and with him the demon hordes.Kaplyn is a prince of the realm who is desperate to escape the stifling confines of the Royal Court and sneaks away for an adventure. Kaplyn manages to find trouble soon enough in the form of bandits who have captured a stranger to the land. After rescuing this stranger, who goes by the name of Lars and has been shipwrecked on this land after a storm, they soon encounter Vastra, a sorceror who enlists their help to find a relic of the long dead Elric. All three soon become embroiled in a quest to discover just what happened to the Legendary Eldric and if possible, bring them back.Legacy of the Eldric is a classic high fantasy novel, inspired by JRR Tolkiens work (as many authors are) the novel manages to pay homage to the Lord of the Rings without any attempts at plagiarism. The central protagonists are rich in character and well fleshed out, Kaplyn the young prince desperate to have some adventure and avoid the drudgery of his high born life, while Lars is the tough but dependable fighter while the sorceror Vastra is the unknown quantity, somewhat dark and troubled and really only seeming to aid when there is something in it for himself. Vastra shows the weaker elements of the human psyche, greed, selfishness, anger and sometimes even malice but occasionally tempered by more positive character traits.The plot is quite fast paced with the minimum amount of world building needed to give background to the story while the 3rd person narrative is both clear and easy to read. Although the novel does contain the standard fantasy fair of Dwarves, Elves (at least their equivalent) and evil creatures, we are only really introduced to these as the story requires and nothing feels forced.Legacy of the Eldric is pure escapism, a high fantasy novel that manages to entertain from beginning to end with an easy to read narrative, interesting characters and intelligent world building, I highly recommend this novel to any fan of fantasy fiction. --sciencefictionandfantasy.co.uk/legacy-of-the-eldric.htm", "related": ["B001BXM3PU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For one thing, self-reliance and ecological living are crucially joined together, and Swann exhibited a high degree of devotion to addressing this point. This is a practical guide to more than just survival. It is a prescription for betterment.  -Planet Drum PulseAuthor Stephanie Mills brings the life of peace activist, self-taught economist and bioregionalist Bob Swann into vivid focus. Counting both Mills and Swann as friends and colleagues over the years, I was enthralled with this book and the important lessons for all in Bob Swann’s example of deeply-committed global citizenship. Stephanie Mills’ books not only enlighten us, but are complementary to her own committed activism as a preeminent ecologist, bioregionalist and practitioner of local economies, alternative currencies, simpler lifestyles. These are many of the tools we are re-discovering to help us adjust to conditions in a resource-constrained world, including deepening our spiritual and community commitments. - Hazel Henderson,Ethical MarketsStephanie Mills has described Bob Swann’s life with eloquence, elegance and profoundness and as a result, the book is deeply engaging and enchanting. On Gandhi’s Path is a lucid narrative of the life of Bob Swann who was a living example of simplicity, humility and radicalism. This is a book which describes how a man offered himself to serve the people and the planet selflessly. This book is a good guide to all activists who are working to transform the world.- Satish Kumar, editor,Resurgence Magazineand Visiting Fellow at Schumacher College", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's for sale on Amazon.com (paperback, Kindle & free \"Look Inside\" feature).     In a nutshell, I recommend markedly improving rehabilitation prospects and prison life and drastically decreasing the number of prisoners by: (1) repeal of three U.S. statutes and comparable state laws inhibiting prison labor and industries, freeing prisoners to work, (2) an exemption for prison industries from most employment-related laws, OSHA excepted, to allow laissez-faire negotiation between private employers and prisoners (not convict leasing); and to reduce the massive prison population, (3) an old-fashioned home monitoring device, a metallic collar, with or without modern electronic enhancements, and (4) corporal punishment [strongly recommended by Cesare Beccaria, the Bible, a dozen ex-slaves I quote, Gen. George Washington (as a general, not slaveholder), Thomas Jefferson (as a legislator), empirical behavioral evidence; and supported by the writings of Dr. Orlando Patterson, Gustav Radbruch, J. Thorsten Sellin and many others]. Personally, it took me over a year to get used to the idea of judicial corporal punishment. The empirical evidence was too strong in favor of judicial corporal punishment and against the failed social experiment of incarceration. I researched these issues for three years and have good support for all my facts and opinions.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Though she is originally from NC, she has called South Florida her home for over 12 years now and can’t imagine living anywhere else. Tammy graduated from College with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Communications and in Sociology. She wrote advertising copy for over 15 years for businesses and agencies alike. She also counseled mothers and children at abuse shelters and did case work with the Department of Social services. Those two things combined nurtured her love for writing and  her love for children. It was in early 2003 that she started writing books. What started as a hobby branched into a career as a freelancer ghostwriting for people who wanted their books published. This allowed her to work from home while her kids were little.  Now her girls are 6 and 8 years old, yet they still love hearing their mom make up children’s stories. It was their prodding that led her to put her stories in eBook format through outlets like Amazon. Tammy was shocked to see her books were downloaded more than 2500 times the very first month catapulting her to become a Kindle top-ranked author with school-aged kids. She is now self-publishing the books in paperback editions. Her titles include: Peyton Penguin Prefers Peas,  Kendall Macaw Loves her Ma,  Kids, Summer and a Shoestring Budget,  Jesus, Why does Matt have Two Mommies? and Jesus, Why can't the Animals Talk?", "related": ["B00J9VXPMQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She molded America’s youth, busted kids for smoking pot in the restrooms, and broke up illicit affairs behind the stage on a regular basis, so she finally decided to hang up her hat and let someone else have all the fun. (Liliana’s Addison Holmes Mystery Series, about a small town teacher who gets into a whole lot of trouble, is somewhat autobiographical, but she won’t confess to which parts). Liliana began reading romance novels with all her new found free time, and when she ran out of things to read, she decided to write her own novels. The result was a 150,000 word thriller--a dazzling adventure--where the heroine was a thirty-year-old virgin assassin (Yes, you read that right). She couldn’t imagine why people weren’t knocking down her door to read it, but she persevered and began writing a second book. She finally got the hang of things, and eventually learned that losing one’s virginity wasn’t all that romantic after all. All of her books involve some kind of suspense (she just can't help herself), laughter, and a lot of steamy sex. Since the failure of her first attempt, Liliana’s books have won awards such as: The Daphne Du Maurier, The Suzannah, The Linda Howard Award of Excellence, The Maggie, and many others. Her affiliations include Romance Writers of America and Mystery Writers of America. Liliana loves to cook, and is addicted to reading, Internet Boggle, kickboxing, and Bones. She lives in a big, rambling house in Texas with a couple of cats to keep her company. She loves to get emails from readers.

Set in both 1967 and the present day, the author creates a\nbelievable post-war atmosphere and the story relates how Steve becomes\ncaught up in a cruel people-smuggling racket through his friendship with\n Tan, a Vietnamese youth, and their efforts in trying to bring the\ncallous smugglers to justice. The writing is pacy, the situation totally\n believable, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The saddening thing is that\nnothing much has changed - we still have illegal refugees being\nseparated from their money and enduring dreadful conditions on packed\nboats only to arrive in Australia to be locked up in refugee centres,\nwith freedom still being elusive.  Most of all, this book is a homage to\n the brave survivors of the Vietnam War who did their duty and fought\nfor their country, only to return home scarred forever by their\nexperiences, and shunned by many of their country folk who opposed the\nWar, and a Government that didn't care. For those of us who remember the\n War, it stirs many memories, and for those not old enough to remember, I\n hope it explains why so many survivors have problems, and how bloody\npointless war is.

Like that film, this novel tracks a generation of poor villagers and their rich landlords through a period of cultural and social upheaval. The Choi family has ruled over their peasants \"for more than a hundred years.'' Though serfdom was abolished in 1893, the superstitious, fatalistic peasants resist change in the social order, preferring to stick with the life they know. They gossip about Lady Yoon, her son Chisoo and Kuchon, Chisoo's secret half-brother, as they go about their hard labor on their small plots of land. Most likely to engage American readers are the machinations of the ambitious servant Guinyo, who schemes to get pregnant and pass the child off as a Choi heir. Many plot threads are left unresolved. The translation, apparently striving for a somber restraint, is flat, and awkwardly integrated flashbacks and shifting points of view make for slow reading. Still, the novel offers an education in Korean history and mores wrapped in the accessible and compelling form of the regional epic.Copyright 1996 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00JOWF2GW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.8571, "rating_total": 34.0}

What holds true for the protagonists from the first line of the story is also applicable for readers, who will find their attention grabbed and held by a series of vignettes that open with go-getter Ramon's search for a surprisingly-elusive town when an inheritance leaves him the deed to land in Gotcha.\nFlashback to 1946 and a series of incidents that involve strangers, town secrets, desperate men, cover-ups and much more.\n'Simply hysterical' comes to mind as characters interact, special interests collide, and town politics vie with military might. It is, indeed, a debacle; and as events move to ever-increasing levels of irony & charades, so readers become immersed in strange backup plans, the efforts of a wacky character called the Pickle, and much more.\nSuffice it to say this rollicking saga is hard to put down, packed with a huge cast of characters, and presented in a series of encounters that nearly stand alone in each chapter. Don't look for genre reading here - or anything predictable. DO expect humor and entertainment: a blend often lacking in modern-day novels. - D.

She pulled over, swallowed painkillers and kept driving, but ten miles from her brother's house, before the painkillers could kick in, her vision began to blur as if her eyes were windowpanes and there was water running down the glass.She almost stopped driving at that point, but by the time she'd found a place to pull over, the water seemed to have stopped running and she could see clearly again. Things didn't feel quite right. On top of the pain, her brain felt foggy and disconnected. But she was less than ten minutes from Andy's, so it seemed best to keep on going. After all, she'd had these spells before.The symptoms had been milder those other times, though. Self-diagnosis followed by several tests to rule out more serious options had settled on migraine. The spells always passed before they cost her any significant time at work.And before they forced her to question the way she was living her life.Today, the real trouble hit two miles from her destination, and this time there was no warning. The whole world just keeled over like a ship run aground, except she knew the problem wasn't with the world, it was inside her head. Even though she was wearing chunky sunglasses with dark lenses, the daylight felt so bright that it blinded her, and her senses were scrambled and out of her control.No question about waiting for a safe place to pull over now.The safe place had to be right here, because another five seconds at the wheel and she would crash. She couldn't see, could barely move… She just managed to brake hard, bring the car to a halt and kill the engine, a couple of hundred yards from the Radford town boundary, and she could only hope she was on the shoulder not the road.Then she rolled the window down and sat.Fought the dizziness and pain.Waited, with her hands gripping the top of the steering wheel and her forehead pressed hard against it, for the moment when she would feel well enough to leave the car, or find the phone that lay in her purse.But the moment didn't happen. If she tried to open her eyes, all she saw was painful, blinding brightness. If she moved an inch, the world tilted and rolled. She groped for her purse, but it was out of reach on the floor of the passenger seat where it must have slid when she'd braked so suddenly.She lost track of time, although it must have been fifteen minutes or more. It felt like forever, a terrifying, featureless landscape of unraveling minutes in which all she could do was to stay motionless, keep breathing and think about what had brought her to this point. Andy had been right in his older-brother concern about her stress levels and working hours, and his insistence that she listened to Dad too much. This trip to Vermont was meant to signal a shift in her priorities, but her body was telling her that it had come too late.Cars went past. She heard thewhooshof the air and the hum of their engines. No one slowed or stopped. Maybe they thought she was taking a phone call or checking an address. The painkillers she'd taken earlier began to work and the dizziness eased a little. She thought again about trying to reach for the purse.But before she could make the move, she heard the sound of tires popping on gravel, the rumble and surge of an automatic transmission shifting gears and the slam of a car door.Even her hearing had gone haywire, because she couldn't tell which direction any of it was coming from. Behind her? Far side of the road? She didn't know whether to call out or stay silent.She heard footsteps crunching on the gravel shoulder. They stopped beside her open car window. A man cleared his throat. \"Everything okay here, ma'am?\" The voice was gravelly and slow and faintly threatening. Again, she didn't know what to do. Wish it would go away, or ask it for help?\"Um, yes, just resting my eyes,\" she lied, to buy a little time. Maybe in a few seconds she could summon the ability to open her eyes and move enough to look at him, see what kind of a man he was, whether he looked as if she could trust him.She tried it, letting a slit of vision appear between her lids, but the light and blurring hit with merciless speed and she couldn't see a thing.There was a pause. The voice stayed silent, but the feet didn't move. Then the man spoke again, deliberate and slow. \"I'm a Vermont state trooper, ma'am. You're going to need to look at me, and show me your driver's license.\"The woman with her head and arms on the steering wheel didn't move, in response to Daniel's request.He couldn't see her face at all, couldn't tell how old or young she was, or what she looked like. Dark hair with gleaming golden lights fell around her head and onto the wheel, as effective as a deliberate disguise. He could see the frame of her dark glasses, but on a summer afternoon those were hardly a sinister attempt at concealing her identity.She seemed a little on the thin side, the knobs of her backbone visible through a stretchy cream-colored top, as well as the faintest outline of a light blue bra. Below that, she wore a filmy patterned skirt.She was in her twenties or thirties, he decided. The skin on her hands was smooth and soft. Her nails were neat and clean and bare of polish. The clothing looked clean and summery and of good quality, suited to the late-model car she was driving and the warm July afternoon. A chunky purse lay on the floor in front of the passenger seat, and a bottle of water had rolled against the seat back.Nothing out of place, except for the fact that she didn't move.He assessed the situation. She could be on the point of passing out from drink or drugs. She could be mentally ill. She could be working some kind of a scam, luring passing motorists to stop and offer help, at which point her accomplices would appear out of the undergrowth for a gunpoint robbery. Daniel had been a hospital security guard in New York City for three years, then a police officer in New York and a state trooper here in Vermont for a total of five. He'd seen all of these scenarios and worse.\"Are you ill, ma'am?\" he asked, after weighing the wording of the question in his mind.\"Yes, a migraine. A bad one.\"\"I'd like to show you my ID.\"\"My vision is blurred, and I'm having a dizzy spell. I can't see.\"\"In that case, I'm going to have you feel the insignia on my shirtsleeve. It's a double chevron. I want you to know that I'm an officer of the law.\" Leaning down to the open car window, he kept his eyes on the screen of shrubby trees beyond the shoulder of the road, waited for the sound of slurring—either real or faked—in her voice.She reached up, found his shirtsleeve and felt the raised weave of the insignia, rubbing neat fingers across the fabric, brushing his bare upper arm with the heel of her hand just below the hem of the short sleeve. The touch was accidental, yet oddly personal. \"Okay. Thanks,\" she said. \"I do believe you.\"\"Do you need medical attention, ma'am?\"\"Yes.\" If she was faking, then she was good at it. If she was impaired by substance abuse, it didn't show.\"I'll call the ambulance,\" he said.\"No, that's…not necessary. Not an ambulance.\"First indication of something not quite right. He went on high alert. If the \"dizzy spell\" was bad enough that she really couldn't move, then why didn't she want an ambulance?But she was speaking again. \"Call my brother.\"\"Your brother?\"\"He's a doctor. Andy McKinley. He lives just a couple of miles from here. He'll come get me.\"Daniel knew Andy quite well. Doctors and law enforcement officers tended to know each other in a rural community like Radford. There was a connection between hospital emergency rooms and crime, and he and Dr. McKinley had been involved in various incidents together. Andy was a good guy. Understood the police angle. Went the extra mile. Didn't let any ego get in his way. Daniel would almost call him a friend.He didn't let on to this woman right away that the name was familiar, however. In his experience, personal information was best handled on a need-to-know basis, and he considered that most people needed to know very little about him.Some people—work colleagues, and his sister, Paula, for example—said that this showed in the way he talked, and the way he often paused before he talked, but he didn't care and he wasn't prompted to change.Andy's sister would learn of his connection with her brother soon enough. No sense wasting time or words over it now. \"Andy McKinley,\" he echoed, giving nothing away. \"Can you give me his number?\"Obediently Scarlett reeled off the digits of Andy's cell phone, then heard a moment later, \"Andy? It's Daniel Porter, here.\"What?The name ambushed Scarlett from out of the past. She couldn't take it in, couldn't react. Daniel—that other Daniel—had grown up in Vermont, somewhere near here. Indirectly, two steps removed, that Daniel Porter was the reason she was here, now, although he wouldn't know it, and she hadn't thought of the Vermont connection herself in years. Hadn't thought about Daniel at all, except for the maddening fact that he wouldn't stay out of her dreams.But now he was here.Because it had to be the same man.She couldn't know for sure, since the blurred vision meant she couldn't look at him and his voice wasn't enough to go on, but it had to be him. This man had said he was an officer of the law, she'd felt the insignia on his shirt and she knew that a law enforcement career had always been Daniel's goal.It had to be him.She waited for a whole slew of possible emotions to wash over her—anger, regret, embarrassment, self-doubt a...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

No se trata de meras\nteorías, sino de las mismasmedicinasque ellos tuvieron que tomar para\nsanar su matrimonio.Hacer un buen matrimonio implica por lo\ngeneral un aprendizaje y un crecimiento personal. La persona con la que uno se\ncasa tiene ciertamente unos puntos bonitos por los que nos hemos acercado,\npero, tiene también sus puntos no tan bonitos con los que tendremos que lidiar.\nLo más grave es que estos puntos neurálgicos son inversamente proporcionales a\nlos encantos. Eso significa que la persona que nos fascina con sus hechizos\ntiene también la capacidad de herirnos precisamente donde menos nos gusta.Lo anterior permite afirmar que hacer un buen\nmatrimonio es como hacer una maestría, y quizá mucho más que eso. Héctor y\nClemencia hablan con esa autoridad, y no tienen reparos en reconocer que en sus\nrespectivas familias de origen carecieron de los modelos apropiados, y que en\nel devenir de la vida de pareja tuvieron que enfrentar crisis importantes.\nEstas \"recetas\" son precisamente las fórmulas que les funcionaron, y que ahora\nlas ponen al alcance de todos nosotros.Bienvenidos Clemencia y Héctor con este nuevo\naporte. Mucha gente les va a agradecer estas \"recetas\". Ojalá que su lectura\nsea amplia y llegue a tanta gente que la necesita.

He wrote some 50 volumes of novels, poetry, short stories, fantasy, sermons, and essays. His influential body of work placed him alongside his eras great men of letters and his following was vast. Two decades after his death, his books were pivotal in leading C.S. Lewis to Christianity. He thus became the foundational member of Wheaton's Wade Center Seven.    After his death, most of MacDonald's books eventually went out of print as his name drifted from memory. However, he continued to be revered by an impressive gallery of well-known figures, including G.K. Chesterton (who referred to him as one of the three or four greatest men of the 19th century ), W.H. Auden (calling MacDonald one of the most remarkable writers of the 19th century), and Oswald Chambers ( ... how I love that man! ). In spite of such a following, however, MacDonald's reputation gradually declined throughout the 20th century.   MacDonald's most notable champion of the last century was C.S. Lewis, whose journey from atheism to Christianity was sparked by George MacDonald's prophetic view of God. Lewis persistently acknowledged his debt to MacDonald, whom he called his master. Lewis wrote: \"I dare not say that he is never in error; but ... I know hardly any other writer who seems to be closer ... to the Spirit of Christ Himself.... I have never concealed the fact that I regarded him as my master, indeed I fancy I have never written a book in which I did not quote from him.\" Both in his autobiography and throughout his writing career, Lewis emphasized that George MacDonald was the most significant impetus in his own spiritual pilgrimage.   MacDonald's writings can thus be seen as the spiritual soil out of which the faith of C.S. Lewis emerged. MacDonald's novels, fantasies, and fairy tales provide the imaginative foundation for Lewis's later writings, including the Chronicles of Narnia.   In spite of his own popularity, however, the spiritual roots of Lewis' s faith remain largely unknown. Lewis's words of 65 years ago are still true today. It has not seemed to me that those who have received my books kindly take ... sufficient notice of the affiliation [with George MacDonald]. Notwithstanding Lewis' s frequent emphasis on the Scotsman's influence in his own life, MacDonald's name in the late 20th century drifted into obscurity and his books became unavailable.   A resurgence of interest in the forgotten Victorian began to mount in the 1970s and 1980s, given initial impetus by Wheaton's Wade Center and the work of two Wheaton professors, Dr. Clyde Kilby, founder of the Center, and Dr. Rolland Hein, who released several editions of MacDonald's sermon extracts. MacDonald's name then exploded into public view in the years following, largely from the efforts of MacDonald redactor and biographer Michael Phillips. Building upon the efforts of Kilby, Hein, and others, and inspired by them, Phillips's work resulted in a new generation of readers discovering anew the treasures in MacDonald's stories, and led to a renewed publication of MacDonald's books on an unprecedented scale not seen since his own lifetime.   Now more than ever, thousands the world over are discovering why Madeleine L. Engle called George MacDonald the grandfather of all of us who struggle to come to terms with truth through imagination.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She's inexplicably drawn to the serene, isolated paradise from her childhood, where she soon learns that her hazy past has beckoned her for a reason.She shares the lane with two captivating neighbors who have an agenda or two, and she meets their friends: a seer who becomes Dana's ally and more, and a priestess who reveals a family secret from the past and plays a pivotal role in Dana's future. The witches' plans for Dana surface soon after she arrives. In Fern, she reacquaints herself with her own burgeoning powers while she pursues her dream, in spite of serious setbacks and welcome distractions.Never say never.*******************WandDana Quinn's staying power is tested as she forges new connections in Fern with the subtlety of a nor'easter. She turns on the charm and wields her increasingly strong powers as she tries to fit in with the women of the coven, but all's askew, as if the newest witch has tipped a tenuous balance among them.Villette Madden has met her match in Dana, and each is compelled to test the other's magickal prowess and patience. Deirdre Bast seeks a clear path to Liz Abbott, and Ivy Wynn has her most hectic year yet as the coven's advisor. Liz and Carla dance around identical secrets, and Zack Reese befriends Dana in his sister Hannah's absence as he helps Dana find the missing Julia.Dana discovers that \"fitting in\" is a whole new set of tricks when your status is permanent with the Fern witches. Beyond her immersion in the shadows with the dark wand lies a life-altering surprise.************************Silvery MoonAfter two years in Fern, Dana Quinn's love for the people and the place outweighs the challenges she's met. She now craves what she has feared, love and family, but wanting is only half the battle. The fight within her soon becomes a regrettable exercise in self-indulgence when events collide and send Dana and Carla reeling. To their dismay, Dana's powers fail her when she needs them most, and her search for answers leads her to the one witch she must rely on for help.Alexandra Conti, High Priestess and free spirit, initiates Dana in more ways than one. Hannah and Julia reconsider their relationship, while Liz searches for the dark woman she'll marry in a year's time. Jude gives Dana the ride of her life on a midnight run. Ruby Gray-Quinn surprises both of her mothers.Dana calls on inner strength and innovative magick while she hangs on to an old thread that might be her undoing. She has found her home, her people, and phenomenal power, but will she find the courage to embrace her new family and her own future when the past threatens to leave her wanting nothing?", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Along the way I decided that I want to make a difference, especially in the areas of health and fitness. It's all about that journey for all of us and I'm no different.As the son of a career soldier and a Japanese mother, I've had the advantage of traveling the world as a child and living in many different areas. While I don't have what anyone would consider 'roots\" to any one area, I do look at myself as lucky. Learning about different cultures, even within the United States, has expanded my perception.From early on in my life I was exposed to the healthy side of life as well as the unhealthy side. My father was a life-long smoker and lived his life unhealthy. I remember him saying how much he hated to eat spinach as well as many other veggies. It was no wonder that he suffered from many cardiovascular diseases which led to his passing in 1983 under the age of 50.Just as I was lucky in being exposed to many cultures, I was also lucky to see both sides of health. My Japanese uncle, Keiji, represents what one could be like when living a healthy lifestyle. Even into his late 90s he showed vibrancy. Seeing so many sides of life led me to look at my own. I did manage to serve in the Marines and the Los Angeles Police Department. I love action and fitness was part of repertoire in both lines of work.I've made my fair share of mistakes. Even in health and fitness. Like I said earlier, I'm like the average guy. Yet, I went on a quest to want to learn more, especially in the area of how we think and believe. My question became, \"What is that driving factor that leads us to do what we do?\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Emil wants to hire Matt to find the person who sent him a letter about the death of Peter Knight, whose drowning occurred during Matt's time at The End. Reluctantly Matt agrees, although he's not sure he wants to relive the memories of his first marriage as well as the poverty and dejection of the people in the slum. He visits the community organization headquarters, now called Hope House, where he talks to Melanie, Peter's sister, and to the director of Hope House, who adopted Melanie after her brother's death. Although suspense about whether Peter committed suicide is nonexistent, Matt's journey into the past and his misgivings about his life to date make a taut, compelling story.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B006NGUG6I"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Next, several chapters outline the main events in the subjects' lives', and end with \"10 Things You Should Know About\" and \"10 MORE Things That Are Pretty Cool to Know.\" In Washington, readers get broad strokes regarding the man's childhood and years at Mount Vernon, and then follow the time line into his military career. Specific moments in his career and in American history are highlighted, often in sidebars. Sacagawea follows the same format, beginning with the young woman's life with the Lemhi Shoshone and including her capture and subsequent sale by the Hidasta. Her role as interpreter for Lewis and Clark is shown as important to the success of their journey. Both books have sketchlike illustrations throughout. One drawback in these volumes is in the design. The placement of text boxes often interrupts the flow of the text and leads to some flipping back and forth to get all of the information. For example, a box outlining Washington's prowess in math but failure in spelling is placed mid-sentence, leaving readers to either abandon the sentence about his brother or flip back once it is read. The time lines are oriented horizontally, rather than vertically. The overall effect of these design choices detracts from the presentations.

Sometimes the talk is too cute, but the full-page, computer-enhanced art blends animal photos in sweet combinations.

Firstly, congratulations for finishing my\nnovelette!

In my short life, this is my first\nforay into writing fiction of this genre and I have found it challenging but\nextremely invigorating at the same time.Now that I have finally given this story my blessing\nand released it onto the world to pass judgment, Kenneth's life is literally in\nyour hands to decide his fate.If you want him to live and find Jenny I'd really\nappreciate it if you could go back to where you downloaded your copy of this\nebook and leave a review. For good or for bad, if my story has elicited some\nsort of reaction from you and made you invest effort in bringing these\ncharacters to life, as have I, thendon't\nkeep quietabout me, tell your zombie-loving friends, tell your Mom, heck,tell everyone you know!Share my story,\nspread it around and let the world know there's a new zombie writer spreading\nhis craft!I'd also appreciate it if you could send me an email telling me what you think of my\nwriting, my story or anything at all about Living Death. Alternatively, you\ncould also spend a minute to visit my site\nand subscribe to my\n(spam-free) mailing list. If you want to hear more from me, subscribe for all\nupdates, news, discounts and promotions of my work! Don't worry; if you change\nyour mind one day and decide you hate me with every bone in your body instead,\nyou can unsubscribe at any time.So here's the\ndeal:Let me know via review, blog post comment, email or\nany other method you can think of if you want Kenneth to live. If you detest\nhim so much that you want him to pull the trigger, let me know too. If I\nreceive50 responsesurging me to\nlet Kenneth live and find Jenny,I will\nwrite a sequel.If I don't, then you can think that he pulled the\ntrigger. I'll probably write a sequel for myself but it won't see the light of\nday. Instead, you can probably look forward to other some of my other stories\nin the future, just not a sequel to Deliverance.Kenneth\nCook's life is now in your hands, won't you help him out?", "related": ["B00F62XV7Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 3.625, "rating_total": 29.0}

She used her journals to process her emotions while living with an alcoholic mother, to discover her calling, to grow spiritually, and to search for answers to life's questions, big and small. Burch worked as an independent journalist for CBS, BBC and other news networks in the '80s, and her story of traveling in Afghanistan was featured in The New York Times. She was one of the first independent film crews to be allowed in the former Soviet Union after Gorbachev was elected. She produced \"Women in Limbo Presents,\" a national public television series about women's lives, and was president of the New York Film/Video Council. Burch later became a homeopath, wrote five books on homeopathy, co-founded the Catalyst School of Homeopathy, and is president of Inner Health, Inc. Burch's first memoir, \"Face Everything Avoid Nothing: Adventures in War, Filmmaking & Love,\" will be published in 2013. In this book, she describes her real-life adventures in her 20s when she was a war journalist in Afghanistan after the Soviet Invasion. In her recently published book, \"The Four Methods of Journal Writing: Finding Yourself through Memoir,\" Burch shares the profound techniques she used to write her memoir. Burch's discovery will inspire and guide you to write your own memoir. You may want to start with journal writing and see for yourself what wisdom you have inside of you. Burch is currently writing a series of memoirs about her 20s, 30s, 40s. She is married, a mother of a teenage son, and lives in a cohousing community in Cambridge, MA.

With Women at the Cross, Linda Lesniewski examines a powerful and significant, yet often unexplored, dimension of Christ's ministry--the devotion, loyalty, and servanthood of the women who came, who stayed, and who continue to come even today. Their inspiring stories will strengthen your faith and encourage you in your relationship with Christ. \"Linda Lesniewski has given us a book with a powerful emotional punch. It is a very moving account of a genuine reaction to Christ.\"--T. W.

We are politely but firmly directed back to the drawing board.\"-P. J.

Readers willing to dig deeper than the work of poets Derek Walcott, Linton Kwesi Johnson and Anthony Joseph will find that exciting new worlds of Caribbean poetry await. Although some lesser-known Caribbean writers tend to get bogged down in the exotic fecundity of their island landscapes, others write with a grace and steadiness that highlights personal experience within the larger context of culture and environment to reveal something universal. Trinidadian novelist, painter and poet Drayton (The Crystal Bird, 2012, etc.) most decidedly falls into the latter category. Her personal poems often focus on singular moments in her past, yet her evocation of the slippage between past and present, of how we manage to exist in both times simultaneously, speaks directly to readers. The exploration of how “time…magically overlaps generations” pervades this collection. Her narrators are buffeted by nostalgia, but are never fatalistic or cloying; instead, they treasure the past and the present as a single fabric of interwoven threads. One narrator, for instance, revisits a memorable beach and finds that the “scenery I knew has all but gone, / except for the sea. / Longing and waiting, I dream of the days / that never can be again. / The sea waits while I dream a dream / where I stand on the balcony of this precious day.” Drayton invests symbols with a similar complexity; the titular brown dove, for instance, is at once a symbol of maternal devotion, sexual allure, rebellion and quiet endurance, and rife with gender and racial resonances. Occasionally her more contemplative poems suffer from excess erudition, and she is sometimes prone to distracting alliteration, but she also delivers unmatched similes such as, “The morning stormed my day / like a drunken party crasher / with streams of gold and white ribbons / coming through the window.” Wise, kind and lively verse that truly “dances to a tune that’s / gloriously redeeming / of anger, hate, and envy. / It’s an awesome authority / with boundless energy.\"— Kirkus Reviews", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She is a reluctant divorcee whose young difficult\ndaughter, Annie, ran away as a teen ager. Faced with having to make a living\nwith few opportunities on Maui, she choses real estate.There is a\ncompelling mystery at the heart of this novel, a 'whodunit' that is very\nsatisfying on its own. However, I was equally enthralled with all I learned\nabout the Hawaiian culture and the world of Real Estate.This is a\nbeautifully crafted novel. The story lines weave together seamlessly. There are\nno awkward 'blind alleys' that are so insulting to a reader. That is not to say\nthe story is predictable. The moral and ethical dilemmas Laura faces are very\nreal. I found myself struggling along with her to make very difficult decisions.\nShe often surprised me.I will not hesitate to recommend this book to my\nmost demanding reader friends and hope we hear more from this talented writer.--Janet Cobb, Portland, Oregon", "related": ["B00J1M9W98"], "rank": 1820275, "title": "Paying the Price eBook", "author": "Madge Walls", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Knowing what it’s like to struggle with self-doubt and lack of confidence, her biggest dream (in addition to owning a castle) is to stamp out low self-esteem for everyone, especially young people. “Feeling bad about yourself is the number one deterrent to achieving happiness,” she says. “So for the sake of a better world, it’s got to go.” She lives in New Hampshire with her husband, three boys, her mother and various pets, and can also throw a tomahawk, if need be. For more information, visit her website: www.kristinaschram.com. She’s also on Facebook and Twitter.", "related": [], "rank": 1979275, "title": "Mayhem at Nepenthe Manor: A Pandora Belfry Adventure (Book One)", "author": "Kristina Schram", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Now she is also quite at home in the world of urban fantasy, though believes that love, faith, and hope are of a stronger magic than fire wielding and sorcery. She loves gun-toting good boys, and could have been a cop in another life except real blood makes her queasy. She'll have to stick to solving supernatural mysteries.

In all this time I have never come across a publication which complements the rather soulless and complex user manual so well...your excellent work is all I need to exploit the potential of this amazing dSLR.-Martin D.A well written, professional helpful guide- Brilliant, just what I was looking for! A manual that was exciting, clear to follow, had examples and was used by a professional who gave just the right amount of technical with explanations of why you use those settings, when to use those settings and so on, all properly explained. The book is a revelation, a joy to follow, well thought through and well written.-R.D.C.Really practical and tremendously helpful- Readers of this e-book can expect to benefit from a more rewarding photographic experience using this superb camera, and be better able to exploit its potential to match their personal objectives and photographic style. Highly recommended.-M.M.Really focuses on the Why- I found the Nikon manual good for understanding how to set things up but not much on the why - this book really focuses on the WHY.  The guide helped me understand why to use specific settings for specific needs.  The Custom Settings section helps to make firm decisions on how to apply settings by understanding the usage of each in addition to knowing how to set them up.-Benoit A.For Experienced User and Beginner Alike- It's clear,\nconcise and gets to the heart of the camera's multiple and often\nconfusing options. Very highly recommended - for experienced user and\nbeginner alike.-G.S.A.A clearly written, concise and useful explanationof the rationale for the seemingly infinite and often confusing settings options for the camera. Used in conjunction with the Nikon manual I feel more confident in understanding how to at last proceed in getting better photographs.-W.L.S.I would recommend this to anyonewho wants to get a quick start to using their camera.  Manuals are nice, but this eBook highlights the important information and gives a quick, easy to understand explanation of most all of the functions and controls.-Ray M.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All over the world people have felt the pull to go beyond their boundaries. If we do not find our wishes fulfilled in our own garden we tend to look elsewhere.Writing this book I delved into men's and women's psyches and presented the interplay of different mindsets and culturally divers attitudes. The task was made easier because I had firsthand experiences with eight men who looked to Russia and Asia for possible brides. Their experiences amused and intrigued me, for I noted, quite predictably, how some of their adventures ended badly or in disenchantment to say the least.This is not the kind of material I am usually involved with, for I like historical and cultural topics based on much research. This is not to say that there was no research involved in the creation of this work--just of a different kind.I enjoyed creating my characters and, at times was clearly amused with the story", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write \"somethingnew--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned.\" That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel becameThe Great Gatsby, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess,Gatsbycaptured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. \"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--\" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. \"Her voice is full of money,\" Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose,The Great Gatsbyis as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All these installments are also available to purchase separately if you wish.The Monday Collection, Volume Twowill be released in the fourth quarter of 2014 and will include the final four parts of the Jake Monday saga:Rainy Days and Mondays,Can't Wait for Monday,Mad Mad Monday(July 2014), andMonday Bloody Monday(September 2014).I get the question from time-to-time:what inspired you to write this story?\n With Jake Monday, my inspiration came from a multitude of sources.\nAuthors like Ludlum, LeCarre, Fleming, and Follet come to mind. Also, I\nenjoy watching series on television: \"Alias,\" \"Heroes,\" \"Lost,\"\n\"Supernatural,\" \"The X-Files,\" and \"Hannibal.\" All of these have\nelements that influenced my writing.The\n Jake Monday Chroniclesbegan in 2003 when I wrote a short story about an\nassassin named Jake Monday. I had no plans, really, but I had a sentence\n running through my head. The sentence that launched this series began:\n\"Jake Monday hated Mondays more than any other day of the week.\"The\n idea that a high-profile assassin would be unhappy, unsatisfied, and\nstruggling with his past and future, is not unique. I wanted to explore new\n areas of this theme. I thought of family, of a past hidden, of the\nmoral challenge of an individual that finds himself caught in a massive\nglobal conspiracy while grappling with the choices he has made,\nwillingly or not.So, Jake Monday is my Jason Bourne. Hallie is\nmy Sidney Bristow (from Alias). My villains...well, they are all my own.\n I love to draw villains who are deep, believable, and scary. Not\nbecause they always represent the antithesis of the hero, but just the\nopposite: my villains are not much different than all of us. I do not\nbelieve in \"grey areas,\" but I do believe the line between good and evil\n can be narrow. One wrong move and even someone like Jake Monday can be\nheading in the wrong direction.", "related": ["B00INZMHHS"], "rank": 1769729, "title": "Thank God it's Monday: Jake Monday Chronicles #3", "author": "Robert Michael", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Admittedly, Fort Trumbull was not the most shining example of New London, it didn't have big manicured lawns, or fancy houses. It was a little rundown and could have used a small helping-hand. In the end, Fort Trumbull was an old-fashionedneighborhoodthat was home to generations of hard-working, proud, happy families. That's all it was. So, I guess the City of New London figured no one would really care about such a place if they were told it would be made all shiny and new. If the City could dazzle, tantalize, and tease us with promises of things 'for the good of the whole community'.They were wrong.\"", "related": ["B0099RFUDC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In Martin's second Windflower novel, the principal police business puts our hero up against a gang of drug smugglers. But the book draws its most tense and poignant passages from a crisis in Windflower's personal life that tests his Mountie mettle.The Charlottetown Guardian: There is more than the plot that make this book a good read. The characters are lifelike, especially Sgt. Windflower, a northern Cree and a Mountie by profession who practises the religion of his ancestors. Other aspects of the book include descriptions of delicious meals, vivid scenery and short accounts of episodes in Newfoundland history.The Hamilton Spectator: Joyriding in a red Challenger, playing chicken with a moose on a back road outside Grand Banks, Newfoundland. That sets the tone. Everyone and everything are minutes away. All the faces you meet, you know. The Body on the T captures life's moments of joys and seconds of crisis. RCMP Sergeant Winston Windflower contends with a body washed ashore, with feeling his way into a new culture, with love and death, with a rogue officer on the lam and a secret mission. The Body on the T is a story of life's teeter-totter, hard landings and gentle recoveries, all told with passion and the absence of language so often deemed essential to stories of crime and resolution.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After devouring every Black Stallion and Island Stallion book written at the time—the process took over a year—she decided she wanted her own horse. That dream was realized a few years later, and Cathy went on to own horses and ride most of her life. Bonanza and Big Valley reruns every day after school enforced her love of all things western as well as a fascination with \"cowboy\" history.Always an avid reader, she first put fingers to keyboard in 1995 and penned her first novel. She enjoyed some success with smaller publishers, but it wasn't until 2005 when she finally got to see her first mass market paperback on the shelves of Barnes and Noble bookstores. There was no going back after that. In 2006, she started writing contemporary westerns for Harlequin American couldn't be happier. All those years of reading every horse book ever written andwatching old western TV shows finally paid off!These days, she is \"mostly\" retired from the corporate business world and writes full time from her home in Scottsdale, Arizona near the breath-taking McDowell Mountains, where javalina traipse across her yard, hawks fly overhead and bobcats hide in her trees. Her twenty-two year old twins have \"mostly\" left the house to live on their own, but return often, if only to use her washer and dryer and empty out her refrigerator—a situation that does not make her two spoiled dogs and two spoild-er cats happy. When time allows, she heads to her cabin in the mountains, always taking her laptop with her on the chance inspiration strikes.", "related": ["B00JM1HPUQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However I must add that The Little Mermaid needs to be added to the mix because of Linny's red hair. Now that you know this, you will be like me and will seek out the similarities that Ms. Brown wove into this fantastical tale. I actually read this book twice in the past 48 hours and the second time it felt like I picked up on more. Do not rush through this book. It's one that you will want to sit down and really enjoy. There are so many twists and turns that you won't know which way is up or down. I am still in a slight hangover trance. It is just that good. The plot was just genius. You have lore, supernatural, mystery, slight horror, a love triangle and some fantasy...all mashed up into one big ol cauldron of WTF!! In my opinion there is a cliff hanger (some reviews state that there is not, I felt as though there is). There is some language, a little drinking, and a few stolen kisses. This is definitely for the more mature reader only because I really do not think that a preteen would be able to follow all the twists and turns and get the full effect of just how brilliant this read is. Being that I have already read this twice in such a short amount of time, I am okay with having to wait for book 2 only because I did not mind rereading First Kiss. I enjoyed it even more the second time, so if I have to read it a third before picking up book 2 - whatev!", "related": ["B00EU59P7U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 17, "rating_average": 4.4706, "rating_total": 76.0}

Beginning in February 2013, she wrote numerous feature stories for the News-Sun, a local Sebring paper, including a four-part series about their daughter, Major Kristine Ratliff, RN, USAF, Retired. Kristine had suffered a severe traumatic brain injury due to a tragic auto accident in April 2010. Her daughter’s ongoing struggle to recover - learning to speak, to walk, to eat, and to care for herself - continues today. Major Ratliff’s journey back has become both an inspirational and motivational story.  Having served two deployments as a pediatric intensive care unit nurse at the Balad Joint Base Hospital, Major Ratliff’s most difficult time during her ongoing recovery was when she was placed in a nursing home. While it had been Kline’s greatest desire to write an inspirational book based on her daughter’s recovery, it soon became her cause: Today’s young male and female veterans cannot go to nursing homes. “Home Of the Brave” talks about the need for preserving the dignity and rights of the men and women who serve to keep our country free.
