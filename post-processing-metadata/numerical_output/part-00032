And it worked, except for a few not-so-small problems: your margins have evaporated, your bottom line wouldn't buy dinner for one at a greasy spoon, and your stockholders are out pricing tar and feathers. Where did you go wrong?InThe Power of Positive Profit, business expert Graham Foster attacks the issue of false business success promoted through volume selling, cost cutting, or both, and offers powerful business lessons and breakthroughs for making an appropriate profit while maintaining or even sharpening your competitive edge.Proclaiming that managers must never forget that the primary goal of any business is to increase the wealth of its owners, Foster examines the elements of finance, marketing, production, and support functions and presents a balanced profit-based model for the successful enterprise.A clear understanding of the relationship between sales price, margin, and profit is central to the success of any company or individual. Using his disarmingly simpleMoneyMathdiagrams and charts, Foster leads you step by step through the mathematics of strategic decision-making, exposes the fallacies of the myopic obsession with market share, and reveals the power of profit to promote genuine competitiveness while increasing shareholder wealth steadily over a long period of time.As Foster lifts you from a sales-only orientation up to the next level on the path to continued profitability, you'll learn straight-forward, commonsense methods for:Balancing your company's selling and management effortObtaining and maintaining healthy margins in salesMonitoring cash flow as an indicator of financial healthPricing for profit in the marketDeveloping a 'Plan B' as a hedge against tough timesFilled with entertaining and enlightening stories about the failures of competitive and market-share strategies and remarkable turnarounds achieved by companies that have implemented positive profit programs,The Power of Positive Profitis required reading for anyone who wants to stop being part of the problem and become part of the solution.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Despite increased knowledge about aging and improved longevity, myths and stereotypes abound. This book's title refers to the need to dispel those myths and to see old age as characterized by new opportunities and the development of new talents and strengths. Gerontologist and women's studies expert Cruickshank (Ctr. on Aging, Univ. of Maine) examines the issues from a decidedly feminist viewpoint. She elaborates on two basic ideas: that aging is affected more by culture than by biological changes and that awareness of societal beliefs and customs about aging is essential if women are to achieve \"comfortable aging.\" She also rails against \"medicalization\" and the overemphasis on bodily decline in old age. Cruickshank raises important issues, but at times her position might strike some as overly strident, as when she suggests that the aged are overmedicated as a result of an inappropriate relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and mainstream medicine. This thought-provoking book is recommended for academic social science and medical collections but would likely prove to be too dense for general readers.Linda M.G. Katz, Drexel Univ.

After her hand is badly injured in the bombing, the frightened and embittered girl is sent to stay with her grandparents in the country. Mieko fears she has lost the fifth treasure, the \"beauty in the heart\" which holds the key to her artwork. At her new school, she is taunted by some cruel classmates, and the anger she feels only deepens her sense of misery and loss. Eventually, she is lifted from her dark state by the patience and wisdom of her comforting grandparents and through the friendship of Yoshi, a gentle classmate. Mieko's recovery is further aided by Yoshi's Aunt Hisako, a stern but generous woman who goads Mieko into picking up her brushes once more. (Hisako's disappearance from the story proves mildly confusing, leaving her more of a device than a fleshed-out character.) Overall, this is a sensitively and beautifully crafted story that juxtaposes the strength of Japanese art and philosophy with the complex emotional wake of the bombing. Once again, this author has created a vivid portrait of courage, drawn from a time that deserves to be remembered.

Along with her beloved five-year-old son, TJ (the result of an affair and the reason her husband left her), Samantha arrives burdened with shame for her past sins—and afflicted by a debilitating illness. Unemployed, broke and without medical insurance, she must face her morally implacable father, a justice of the State Superior Court, whose approval has always seemed out of reach. Despite Samantha's fears, her homecoming leads to reconciliation with her nurturing mother, her \"perfect\" sister Lindsey (who gives voice to faith-filled messages) and her childhood friend Donnie Duncan, whose feelings for Samantha run deep. Samantha's relationship with her father, who makes the ultimate sacrifice for her, serves as the cornerstone of the novel. When Samantha's illness, a viral heart disease, becomes deadly and an anonymous stalker threatens her father, she triumphs over adversity to realize her potential for love and faith. Secular readers may find the story preachy, but the novel's traditional values will resonate with a Christian audience.(Mar. 21)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Specter analyzes the consequences of this inflexibility and draws some startling and uncomfortable conclusions for the health of both individuals and society. For example, though every reputable scientific study demonstrates the safety of major childhood vaccines, opponents of childhood immunization are winning the publicity war; childhood immunizations are tumbling and preventable diseases are increasing, often leading to unnecessary deaths. Specter, aNew Yorkerscience and public health writer, does an equally credible job of demolishing the health claims made by those promoting organic produce and all forms of alternative medicine. Specter is both provocative and thoughtful in his defense of science and rationality—though he certainly does not believe that scientists are infallible. His writing is engaging and his sources are credible, making this a significant addition to public discourse on the importance of discriminating between credible science and snake oil.(Nov. 2)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

You see my screenplay-in-progress at the time,The Middle of Nowhere, has a backstory involving a ground war on US soil.It is only meant to be a backstory, but in light of 9/11 I saw right away it would be a long time before the general public was ready to swallow that kind of scenario lightly. As we now see, I was right about this.Since I had committed myself to seeing through whatever project I completed next to the light of day (read: the general marketplace and, more specifically, your eyes), I think it's a good thing I waited. Of course, I had no idea it would take me almost 10 years to see my next project to completion anyway, but more on that in a moment.So the world was in crisis and I was without a writing project. Like most everyone after 9/11, it took me a while to care about anything like a writing project til the initial, and then the secondary (and so on) shock wore off. But eventually it came--the time when I had to writesomething, but what.The world, as I saw it, was in spiritual crisis. I thought I'd start there (as good a place as any). Things were no longer just changing. They had changed. The world was forever changed. It was no longer a \"going to happen\", it was happening. It had happened, before our eyes. There was no turning back. This reminded me of a concept I had come up with for some friends who were toying with the idea of starting a video game company.Initially it was based entirely on a setting--our world,thisworld, but changed. Forever, no going back style. In my spiritual explorations I often came across some version of the concept \"You create your own reality\". And it got me to thinking, what would that look like under a microscope? It would obviously involve the laws of physics--space, time, and matter at their most basic levels. So I had my concept. I had a setting--the world as we know it changing before our eyes at a spiraling rate into something we no longer recognize as our own. And we, changing the same. The only things lacking now were characters and a story. (Oh, is that all?) Creating Joe was easy, perceiving a great change through the eyes of an amnesiac who doesn't even know how things used to be. And Isaac Pressman, the hawkish eyes of the media observing it all from a great height, seemed a logical second. All I needed next was an average everyday person-like-you-or-me whose world I could demolish. Voila', the sculptress Savannah. And we had our cast. Now all I had to do was toss them into this reality and see what happened. What transpired took 9 years of my own spiritual evolution to unfold. And if you ask me, it was time well spent. How would life change if that process by which we are allegedly already influencing those universal \"constants\" were magnified to the point where we couldn't possibly ignore it (or most of us, at least)? What would it look like and what would it mean? [The Middle of Nowhere, incidentally--about the strange connection of four disparate strangers on opposite sides of a \"civil\" war over a dead patch of land--is still an iron in the fire, one I also hope someday to smelt into gold (or more like the silver screen). But first things first...] Free Will Flux asks the reader what you would do if the world suddenly started falling apart around you to where nothing you once recognized was familiar, nothing you once knew was true, and everything you once counted on, you could count on no more. Further, it asks what if you had more to do with all these great changes than you ever could have imagined.--Sage Kalmus", "related": ["B00I9E5G3U"], "rank": 2082974, "title": "Free Will Flux", "author": "Sage Kalmus", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her stories reflect the twenty years she spent as an officer moving through the ranks of the Tucson Police Department. During her career, she worked patrol to investigations, commanded undercover units and riot control squads and trained as a hostage negotiator. Always the one to rock the boat, she took a voluntary demotion toward the end of her career to supervise the department’s eleven man K9 unit. Her characters talk like real cops, think like real supervisors, and react like real people.        Prior to joining the police department, Alison earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in creative writing from the University of Arizona. When she retired, Alison went back to doing what she had always wanted to do—write.  Her first book, The Door at the Top of the Stairs combines her insights into human nature with her knowledge of the darker side of the human psyche.     Alison's life as a cop gave her a bizarre sense of humor, a realistic look at life, and an insatiable desire to live life to the fullest. She loves all horses & hounds and some humans…   To find out more, go to her website at www.alisonholtbooks.com.", "related": ["B00FSPXGZS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 4.0625, "rating_total": 65.0}

His longtime lover, Solesme, is dying of cancer, and a clumsy burglar has stolen his lawnmower. The 67-year-old Morgon soon realizes that the burglary was the beginning of a plot to brand him a terrorist; the architect of the plot, he also realizes, is Hugh Bowe, his former mentor. Even Morgon’s grown children are at risk, and his only ally is the lone policeman in his small French town. Thwarting Bowe takes Morgon to three continents. This unusual suspense tale generates the building tension associated with such classic international thrillers as Day of the Jackal, and it vividly evokes the more tranquil pace of life in both small town Provence and a Breton village. Add to that a handful of richly drawn characters, and you have a novel with appeal for both political thriller fans and anyone who enjoys international fiction. --Thomas Gaughan", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sent by the Red Glamor to recover the ikons that match the various Glamors, Havoc, Gale, Ennui, Symbol, Throe, and so on must journey across Charm undercover on the most dangerous expeditions yet. They will have to get so close to the volcanos that spew magic that death is the price of failure. Though costly, their efforts are not without reward. New friendships are forged, and beyond that, the truth is within grasping distance. Havoc and Gale may finally learn exactly who and what they are, and why they are. Chroma continues to fascinate, making readers anxious for the final book in the trilogy to be published, and hopeful that like Mr Anthony's previous \"trilogies\" it becomes something longer. Changelings don't only attract fellow characters, they draw the readers to themselves as well.—Amanda Killgore, Scribes WorldA new highlight in my library! I didn't know Piers Anthony was even writing this series of books but when I found the first book in the series and read it, I had to have the second. After having finished the second, I can't wait for the third. The characters develop before your eyes and you need to know what is going to happen next. It is one su prise after another to keep you guessing. If you love to read Piers Anthony books, this series is a must read.—James M.

Can they tell us things we otherwise wouldn’t have known? Michelle Herman explores these questions in a revealing narrative about her life, complete with vivid accounts of her dreams--disjunctive, conflicting iterations of non-reality that feature emaciated animals, the apocalypse, and age-morphing grandparents. Around these she merges the intellectual (Jung and Freud) and neurochemical study of dreams. The paradox of this piece is that Herman admits that most people aren’t interested in hearing about each other’s dreams, and yet she pulls readers by the hand into her dream life, and her waking life, neither of which escape analysis. But she remains engaging by forcing the random, obscure, and unshapen nature of dreams (and life) into a compelling story. --Paul Diamond", "related": [], "rank": 1467840, "title": "Dream Life (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Michelle Herman", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She\nstumbled now and then, whether from sheer exhaustion or the weakening\nhunger that had plagued her for days, she no longer knew. She barely\neven cared anymore, although, despite her condition, she was still\nfeverishly driven toward the Garden District. A tiny fragment of her\nsoul still cried out for life, a tiny fragment that still dared to\nbelieve there was hope.An\nunquenchable thirst had settled at the back of her throat, making it\nalmost impossible to keep her mind on anything else but water. In\ntruth, she was nearly delirious from it. That, coupled with the heat,\nmade putting one foot in front of the other almost unbearable, though\nevery painful step was taken with a singular purpose. If she were\ngoing to survive at all, she must continue onward.Lord,\ndid she even want to survive after everything that had transpired in\nthe last few months? Could she go on as if none of it had ever\nhappened? She was certain of nothing. That surety, the unswerving\nblind confidence of youth, of innocence, had been stripped from her,\nquite ruthlessly. It was sad, truly sad, for she knew she might never\nregain it. She was tainted now, changed forever. In her eyes, there\nwas no longer an innocent blush to the world. Nothing was the same.\nNothing.Still,\nshe pushed onward, her eyes downcast, half in shame, half in fear\nthat she would be noticed, and also to shade her eyes from the\nmerciless glare of the Louisiana sun. Her eyes were no longer\naccustomed to the harshness of daylight. They'd grown delicate from\nhiding in darkened back alleys. She'd spent her nights searching the\ndarkness for danger, and her days sleeping. Too many evils lurked\nabout in the night, ceaselessly looking for young, innocent victims,\nand she had quickly learned that it was much safer to rest during the\nday.Rest?\nShe had almost forgotten what that was like. It seemed now that she\nhad never really known. Or the memory was so vague, so elusive, that\nher mind simply couldn't grasp it any longer.Her\nbody had certainly forgotten. In the beginning, the exhaustion was\nunbearable. She felt it in every cell, intensifying every day until\nshe was certain she would either die or go insane from it. There was\nno rest for her, only short moments of nothingness when her brain\nsuccumbed to the fatigue and she drifted off to sleep only to jolt\nawake a few minutes later.And\nthen one day, in a rather startling discovery, she realized that she\nhad become numb to the exhaustion. She'd briefly wondered if this new\nnumbness was the beginning of death creeping in on her. But when it\nlasted for days without changing, she realized that she'd simply gone\nso far past fatigue that her body didn't register the sensation any\nlonger. There was very little that did register anymore, save for the\noccasional pang of fear. And the thirst. That abominable thirst.Despite\nthe hopelessness that dogged her, instinct kept her going. Her body\nseemed to be operating on sheer will alone.Keep going. Don't\nstop. Don't stop.The words rang through her head like a mantra,\ncontinuous, maddening.A\nshuffling noise nearby brought her head up. She warily surveyed the\npeople moving past her, only to quickly return her gaze to the\nsidewalk at her feet. She'd learned early on never to establish eye\ncontact with the strangers that crowded New Orleans for the Spring\ncarnivals. It was especially essential to a young woman alone. The\nknowledge had been poorly won, a lesson she would never forget.She'd\nbeen so naive, thinking the world was filled with compassionate\npeople, souls bound together with integrity, caring, sympathy. The\nsentiment was almost laughable to her now. It was unbelievable to\nthink she'd been so stupid after what she'd left behind. How could\nshe expect kindness from total strangers when she'd received none\nfrom the people she had once thought loved her?Now\nshe wanted no contact with anyone, except for that one familiar face,\nthe only person in the world that she was certain could help her. She\nhad placed all her hope on that one thought. All else had been\nbanished from her mind. If she could just make it. Dear God, she had\nto make it.Another\nglance gauged her progress. Bourbon Street was busy today, too busy.\nShe slowed a little as she approached a street corner. Intersections\nmade her nervous. She didn't like having to slow down, didn't like\nthe idea of having to stand in a crowd of people. She wanted to keep\nmoving, didn't want any questions, any knowing stares.She\nhugged the side of a building as she approached the corner, her hand\nautomatically going out to support herself when another wave of\ndizziness and nausea threatened to overwhelm her. The heat was too\nmuch for her. And the hunger, the thirst. She was weak from it all.\nShe barely had the strength to continue, but somehow she must.Signaling\nthat it was clear to do so, the people around her began to cross the\nlittle road that intersected Bourbon. She took a deep, bolstering\nbreath and willed her feet to move again. Obstinate as they seemed,\nshe managed to make it across the street.Keep\ngoing.If she could just gain some momentum, she could keep\nherself walking. She'd done it before. She knew it was possible to\nwalk for miles if one could simply keep their mind off the actual\nprocess, off the agony of it.Farther\non down the street, her steps faltered again, though this time it was\nnot from the heat. She had noticed a group of young black men\nlounging in the doorway of a nearby speak-easy. Jazz, the music that\npermeated New Orleans, filtered out into the street. The sound of the\nmen's laughter followed the music as they bantered amongst\nthemselves, and her heart began to beat a little faster in\nanticipation of their taunts.Just\nas she had feared, it wasn't long before she was noticed. She felt\nrather than saw their curious stares. Their laughter stopped, and she\nknew they had all turned to watch her approach.The\nsudden silence frightened her even more so than the laughter had.\nPainful as it was, she quickened her steps. She was suddenly reminded\nof the bad experience she'd recently had with a tourist, and all the\nfear came rushing back. She knew how she looked to these young men,\nknew what they thought. The same thing the tourist had thought when\nhe'd pushed her into that alley only days ago. The mere remembrance\nof it made her shudder with revulsion and self-loathing. She couldn't\nbear that again, couldn't survive it. Even the thought made her\nshrink in shame. The memories were horrible. She would never be able\nto purge her mind of that moment.She\nalmost stumbled and fell but then righted herself, forcing her feet\nto keep moving as she quickly made her way past the men. They watched\nher. She knew because she watched them through her lashes--ever\nwary--though she was careful to hide the fact, keeping her head\ndown.One\nof the young men stepped away from the door, his hand outstretched,\nhis shining dark eyes beckoning. She instinctively shied away,\nhastening her steps and averting her eyes, signaling that she wanted\nnothing to do with him.\"Leave\nit alone, Henry,\" his friend warned, putting a hand on his\nshoulder.\"She\nlooks so afraid,\" Henry protested.\"She'll\nbe all right,\" his friend said, following the girl with his\neyes.Henry\nshook his head. He wasn't so certain. \"I just wanted to help\nher.\"\"Let's\ngo back inside,\" came the suggestion.\"Forget\nabout her, Henry,\" another advised.Henry\ngave her one last look and reluctantly followed his friends back into\nthe cool, dim interior of the taproom. \"Did you see the way she\nlooked at me?\"But\nno one heard him. They had already been surrounded by the brassy\nmusic, enveloped in it, re-absorbed into their society, where the\ntroubles of a certain young woman couldn't touch them.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Clara lives in a shadowy, dystopian reflection of this world, alone but for a friend who cares for her and her romantic relationship with a street-savvy boy. Both girls are dealt harsh blows that each must face in order to move on. They are connected by a music box that allows them to interact with each other and the separate realms they inhabit. This fantasy novel is imaginative, thought-provoking, and unique. The story switches back and forth between the two protagonists, keeping the plot moving and giving readers a chance to see how their stories respond to each other's. As Clara struggles to survive in her depleted world, Claire is working through her emotions and moving into young adulthood, losing her innocence and gaining more knowledge of herself. Clara is the vehicle she uses to do so, but Clara is a well-formed character in her own right. The viewpoint switches are abrupt but the connections between the girls' lives become clearer as the book continues. Overall this novel is distinctive and refreshing.-Elizabeth Jakubowski, formerly at Watervliet Public Library, NYα(c) Copyright 2013.

Explanations of the various theories and theory terms are well done and written at a level that novice theorists can relate to. The authors demonstrate how self-care science can be fiscally and effectively applied to the care of patients/clients.\"--Doody's Medical ReviewsDorothea Orem's Self-Care Theory has been used as a foundation for nursing practice in healthcare institutions and as the basis of curricula in nursing schools for decades. This book explores the high-level theory of the application of Orem's Self-Care Theory, and how it can improve patient outcomes as well as cost-effectiveness of nursing care delivery. Written for nursing theorists, researchers, administrators, and graduate students, the text addresses the relationship of self-care theory and evidence-based care in nursing, and provides a solution to improving contemporary healthcare outcomes.The book is divided into three sections. Section one discusses the reason for the existence of the nursing profession, and identifies the performance of self-care. Section two covers three nursing practice sciences-wholly compensatory nursing, partly compensatory nursing, and supportive educative nursing. Section three offer suggestions on how health care organizations can incorporate this broadened perspective of what constitutes evidence based practice and on-going research methodology into every-day delivery of nursing services.Key Features:Includes case examples to illustrate the application of theory to nursing practiceProvides a current, cost-effective resource for implementing Orem's Self-Care Deficit Theory for effective evidence-based practiceBuilds the link between the application of Orem's Self Care Theory and improved patient and fiscal healthcare outcomes\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He knows the value of character. And he knows how to scare you. And he does it all like someone who has been writing since before King was King. Mark my words: The future for Krisch is going to be a bright one, and I'm hard-pressed to think of anyone who so completely deserves it.\"-- Kealan Patrick Burke, author ofThe Turtle BoyandKin.\"Where Darkness Dwells is a wonderful story, rich with imagination, adventure, and lots of heart and soul. And yes, it's scary! There is great complexity in the people and the town that Glen Krisch creates. He doesn't give us cardboard paper dolls to represent good and evil. These are living, breathing characters. Most everyone has their faults and even the more villainous characters are in possession of a soft spot. But yikes! The villainous characters do some seriously heinous things.\"-- Carole Lanham, author of The Whisper Jar\"Where Darkness Dwells, is fast paced with a lot of twists and turns that will keep you turning the pages, wanting to find out what happens next.

He has consulted to organizations and treated executives since 1980. In 2002 he left full-time teaching to join Home Depot and spent almost 4 years observing a CEO destroy a once proud corporate culture. He witnessed firsthand how and why contemporary corporate leaders destroy commitment, how the life of becoming and then being an executive places an enormous psychological burden and often leads to decision making that to an outsider appears irrational but inside the executive constellation is normal and right. His years in business schools have given him insight into how young managers are trained and educated, and how faculty collude in creating the “bottom line” executive, where responsibility and empathy is replaced with entitlement and greed. He gives numerous examples of how executives are driven to destroy a company while enriching themselves.  He maintains that the enactment of laws, blaming, and yelling will not stop this executive behavior. At the rate they are going, these executives will destroy corporate America as we know it unless we engage in a radical transformation in how we select, govern, educate, and train our corporate leaders. He is semi-retired and serves on the faculty at several institutions, occasionally teaches and has a private practice in Irvington, N.Y.  He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from CCNY, holds a Ph.D. from NYU and completed two Postdoc's; at the Institute for Social and Policy Studies, Yale and the Postgraduate Center for Mental Health in Psychoanalysis. This is his third book. He has also written many articles on work, leadership and mental health.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book is divided into 21 chapters, or \"keys,\" which are meant to parallel the 21 cards of the Tarot known as \"The Major Arcana.\" Guides to the cards' meaning and the main patterns for laying them out are included in appendixes to the novel. Recalling Cort zar's Hopscotch in structure, the book's conceptual bravado is undermined by its content, which lacks equal complexity. Centering around two rival families, the Opujics and the Tenckis, who are enmeshed in a series of military and sexual adventures, Pavic's fractured narrative seeks to achieve a hall-of-mirrors effect, but instead it's often simply confusing, an overstuffed short novel that contains enough characters and incidents to make up an epic. Taken on their own, Pavic's brief chapters tend to be compelling and assured, the work of a skilled and unconventional storyteller whose oeuvre is clearly as much influenced by classic episodic works such as Don Quixote and The Decameron as by recent writers like Borges and M rquez. But experimentation gets the best of him here. For all its structural intricacy, Pavic's latest fails to come together into a compelling larger narrative and instead allows its impressive parts to detract and distract from the whole.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B007QQR46O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Archie's more human than most \"real\" people, and\nfunnier, too. The satire bites, and the mystery satisfies.

The clever plotting\nwill satisfy mystery aficionados, while long time Zeltserman fans will\nbe pleased to hear that there is a fist of steel lurking under the\nelegantly tailored velvet glove.\"Roger Smith, author of Wake Up Dead\nand Mixed Blood\"It's a nifty change-of-pace for the usually\nhard-boiled Dave Zeltserman. Clever, sophisticated and witty, 'Julius\nKatz & Archie' will thrill fans of Nero Wolfe...and readers who\nnever heard of him!

While there are many other resources in this  area, this particular book is the only one that I have found that  combines recent research, best practices, personal experience, and  step-by-step recommendations by an authority who has ‘been there and  done it.’ I especially appreciated access to the forms and  questionnaires which are used in every step of the process. I consider  it a ‘must read’ for anyone in sales management who wants to hire peak  performing salespersons.”-Dr. Larry L. Craft, CEO, SalesPower Roundtable™ “Recruiting salespeople is the hardest part of a  sales manager’s job. The wrong decision can cost you thousands.

Within these pages  are the secrets to what I hear Sales Managers asking all the time: What  exactly is the “Best Salesperson Profile”?  How do you use Science to  measure Personality Traits?  And, can you discover hidden character  flaws when screening resumes? No longer does hiring a good salesperson  have to be a ‘roll of the dice’.” -Terri Dunevant - Award-winning Author, The Staircase Principle “You need a recruiting system--Steve Suggs, in  ‘Can They Sell’, tells you how to find and hire the right salespeople.  When you select the best, they are successful and don't leave.

Use his systematic approach and you'll achieve true sales success.” -Andrew Sobel, author, Power Questions, Clients for Life, and All for One. “Recruiting  is the #1 challenge facing sales managers.

A valuable reference source for every  interview.\"-Maribel Koella, CCIM, SIOR, 2012 Chair of the NAI Global Advisory Board \"Any company wanting to retain good salespeople  and increase the bottom line should absolutely read, ‘Can They Sell’.   Problems affecting revenue include the employee revolving door syndrome  that requires re-hiring, additional training and added paperwork  requiring extra help from administrative staff.  Compounding the  problems is delay in customer service thereby enduring the loss of  current clients, as well as delay in attaining new clients.  The money  lost unnecessarily is incomprehensible.  This book accurately pinpoints  the top producing sales personality along with instructions on how to  uncover these candidates on initial interviews.  If you own a business  or are a hiring manager, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain  by reading this book today! -Elinor Stutz, Inspirational Speaker and CEO, Smooth Sale, LLC, A Sales Training Company \"They say that you lose more sleep over the ones  you don't fire, than the ones you do.

Pay more  attention to recruiting and results will follow.\"-Kevin Graham – Managing Director of Empowered Sales Training “In today’s highly competitive business world  making a bad hiring decision can cost you tens, if not hundreds of  thousands of dollars, in both soft and hard costs, not to mention lost  market share. Steve Suggs demystifies the hiring and interviewing  process and provides concrete methods that will help you hire the best  sales people for your company. If you manage a sales team and are  responsible for hiring new talent, ‘Can They Sell’ is a must-read.” -Kelley Robertson, author of The Secrets of Power Selling and Stop, Ask  & Listen—Proven Sales Techniques to Turn Browsers into Buyers“I  wish I’d had the  information in Can They Sell? when I was a sales  manager.

Over three dozen scholars examine both major and minor aspects of the modern imperial experience. The chronological focus develops from the 16th century, when Ireland was the starting point of the empire, to the end of the 18th, when the 13 American Colonies were lost. The essays form an interlocking analysis of the origins of empire from an intellectual, military, economic, and technological perspective. There is some overlap; for example, several essays discuss the role of naval power, but each author approaches the topic with a different focus, such as technology in N.A.M. Rogers's essay and politics in John Appleby's. The various chapters, therefore, reinforce the overall picture instead of being redundant. Separate chapters in the first volume analyze the origins and implementation of the British imperial expansion, or contraction, in each region and then continue in the second volume, as do discussions of new subjects, such as the colonization of Australia. The interrelationship between the mother country and the Colonies also receives continued emphasis. Jonathan Israel's chapter, in Volume 1, on the continental perspective of British empire building helps place events in an even broader context. There is a short bibliography after each chapter. Three following volumes will see the empire through to its 20th-century decline.

Strelecky, an M.B.A. and inspirational speaker, gives some of these questions a fresh turn and brings the reader on a quick journey into self-exploration. Through a fictional account, he tells the story of John, who sets out on a vacation to escape from his unfulfilling life. But after a forced detour, he finds himself lost and his car very low on gas as darkness falls. Beginning to despair, John sees the lights of the Why Café in the near distance and heads in that direction. Despite its appearance, this isn't your typical cafe; it's one where the menu poses questions like \"Why are you here?\" Before long, John is facing up to what he needs to do to find his way to the life he really wants. This is a simple read but asks profound questions about the purpose of life and our role as individuals. While it often seems that John is overly obtuse, his questioning helps to draw the story out and offers a richer picture of the options available to anyone looking for more meaning in life.(June 1)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In Client Science, Marjorie Corman Aaron makes sense of intuition and translates gut feelings into an effective operating procedure for difficult conversations that we dread having. Her expert guidance and analysis will help lawyers handle tough client moments with grace, confidence, and control.\"--Russ Bleemer, Editor, Alternatives to the High Cost of Litigation\"In this highly readable book, Marjorie Corman Aaron focuses on the real world in which our clients make decisions.  She presents a clear-eyed, holistic review of our clients' needs, perspectives, emotions, and false beliefs.  Brimming with practical insights and supported by real-world examples, her advice will help counselors to assist clients in making wise decisions about risk -- which is, after all, what our clients want and need from their lawyers.\"--Joseph D. Heyd, Director & Associate General Counsel, Global LitigationThe Procter & Gamble Company\"Lawyers need emotional intelligence as well as analytical abilities. Based on years of experience both as a classroom teacher and a mediator, Marjorie Corman Aaron's new book, Client Science is a 'must read' for lawyers who want to communicate more effectively with their clients and create more productive relationships.\"--Robert H. Mnookin, Williston Professor of Law and Chair, Program on Negotiation,Harvard Law School\"Marjorie Corman Aaron explores the characteristics that distinguish a great counselor from merely a good lawyer. Knowledge, strategy and skill all define a good lawyer, but it is emotional intelligence and the ability to communicate effectively that define a counselor who understands that client communication is not just about speaking; it is also about hearing and translating.  Professor Aaron helps us understand how body position, posture, and motion all play a role in how clients listen, what they learn and how we are heard by them.  Client Science should be mandatory reading for every lawyer entering the practice of law today.\"--Regina M. Pisa, Esq., Chairman, Goodwin Procter LLP\"Client Science is a thoughtful and enlightened manual for perhaps the most difficult of all lawyering skills -- handling the client. Starting from a base of practical experience and social science, Marjorie Corman Aaron provides wise advice in an important area that is frequently neglected, if not ignored entirely. The book is not only clear and persuasive, it is one of those rare books that manages to be practical, entertaining, and thought-provoking at the same time.  I strongly recommend it to lawyers and law students alike.\"--F. Dennis Saylor IV, United States District Judge, District of Massachusetts\"Given the wide array of books addressing the many aspects of business and professional success, it is surprising how few texts there are offering practical advice for legal practitioners.  Marjorie Corman Aaron's Client Science is a gem, providing common sense yet thought-provoking perspective on the challenges of counseling clients and practical advice for doing it effectively.  The lessons are all the more powerful because they afford helpful insight and concrete approaches to lawyers at all stages of their career.  This is a book I expect to go back to over and over again as long as I am practicing, and I strongly recommend it to law students, lawyers, faculty and professional development managers.\"--Laura C. Hodges Taylor, Partner, Goodwin Procter LLP\"The bottom line is that effective communication skills are one of the keys to successfully representing your clients. Sure, skilled legal representation is important, but that's all for naught if, at the end of the day, your unhappy, confused, and frustrated clients end up seeking replacement counsel. So if nothing else, the lesson to be learned is that better communication results in better legal representation. This book will help you achieve both and is well worth the investment.\"--Nicole Black, Rochester Daily Record\"Professor Aaron is a 'communication scholar.' She has researched the subject thoroughly and documented references in copious footnotes...This book would make a great...gift for new attorneys.  It would be equally appreciated by experienced attorneys who aspire to be mediators.  It is virtually a manual on communication.  That it covers the topic so exhaustively makes sense because Professor Aaron is expert in both the psychology and the mechanics of communication.\"--Kerri W.

Barton is the author of several fast-paced mystery and thriller series, featuring lively characters and lots of action. \"Miz Scarlet\" (Scarlet Wilson Mystery series) is a teacher-turned-innkeeper, who throws herself into danger with a feisty determination to make things right, relying on cohorts like \"Captain Peacock\" and \"Colonel Grey Poupon\" to help her solve the clues. Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans.

Irby, UCSF School of Medicine\"The move to competency-based education is the most important development in medical education in the past decade. This book provides a critical insight into the idea of competence from a range of disciplinary perspectives. It is refreshing and at the same time challenging to find a book that does not simply argue for or against the concept of competence, or provides a 'cookbook' prescription for specifying competence, but rather encourages the reader to have a creative vision of the nature of competence and the implications for medical education.

The Cotillion Ball is the impetus for the series, but these novels are not pieces of fluff; on the contrary, Ms. Lower tackles serious and fascinating subjects through the eyes of her heroes and heroines. In this novel, the abolition of slavery drives the conflict between young and beautiful abolitionist Heather Fitzpatrick and Army lieutenant David Whitman, whose family owns a plantation in Georgia. A splendid cast of secondary characters, especially David's villainous, slave-owning mother, create page-turning tension as Heather risks her life to teach the slaves to read and write, and to find a place by David's side. You will cheer Heather and David on as they face seemingly insurmountable odds to create their 'happily ever after'. I highly recommend this novel to everyone who loves historical fiction and romance. Kudos to Ms. Lower for writing a series that is different, the setting and subject matter unique and quite engaging.Deborah Cordes, Author", "related": ["B00BTNA1QU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.3333, "rating_total": 65.0}

I had an English teacher from hell in high school who decided I was to be a writer because my father was a newspaper reporter in our small town. I did well in English and I am a voracious reader, but her approach left me hating writing.My experience writing this book was wonderful. Freed from the constraints that I had then, and knowing the delights of the creative process now as a visual artist and arts therapist, I let my imagination run away with me. What magic! The original version of this book was over 650 pages. I contracted that writers' illness called Diarrhea of the Pen. So of course, there had to be the months of write and re-write and toss out and add in, and toss out, but all in all, this was a great experience for me.I was correct in my assessment not to write when I was young. I know so much more about life and people now. Back then, I would have written what I thought other people wanted to read, what pleased others, but now I write for the story, the characters. Anna became real to me and she still is. There were times I thought she was dictating what she wanted me to write. There were things about her life she didn't want known and tried to skim over. Reluctantly brave, stubbornly plowing forward when she wants to just ignore it all, fierce in her love for her children, she is quite a character. I'm glad to know her.I hope you will be too because there are two more books coming about Anna. The second is In Crocodile Waters. Anna faces the monumental rage and jealousy of a woman she thought was a friend. In my third book, The Jaguar Hunts, Anna returns to the arms of her lover only to find her children are imprisoned by a sadistic remorseless enemy. She becomes the huntress seeking to free them.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.5, "rating_total": 21.0}

GeneralSimulation Modeling and Analysis with ArenaTayfur AltiokProfessor, Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, Rutgers UniversityPiscataway, New JerseyBenjamin MelamedProfessor, Department of Management Science and Information Systems, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New JerseyKEY FEATURES. Introduces the concept of discrete event Monte Carlo simulation,  the most commonly used methodology for modeling and analysis of complex systems. Covers essential workings of the popular animated simulation language Arena, including set-up, design parameters, input data, and output analysis. Reviews elements of statistics, probability, and stochastic processes relevant to simulation modeling. Chapters are devoted to a variety of Arena models capturing a range of real-world applications, including production lines, supply chains, transportation, and computer information systems.Simulation Modeling and Analysis with Arena is a highly readable textbook which treats the essentials of the Monte Carlo discrete-event simulation methodology, and does so in the context of a popular Arena simulation environment.”  It treats simulation modeling as an in-vitro laboratory that facilitates the understanding of complex systems and experimentation with what-if scenarios in order to estimate their performance metrics.  The book contains chapters on the simulation modeling methodology and the underpinnings of discrete-event systems, as well as the relevant underlying probability, statistics, stochastic processes, input analysis, model validation and output analysis.  All simulation-related concepts are illustrated in numerous Arena examples, encompassing production lines, manufacturing and inventory systems, transportation systems, and computer information systems in networked settings.Contents:  Chapter 1 Introduction to Simulation Modeling; Chapter 2 Discrete Event Simulation; Chapter 3 Elements of Probability and Statistics; Chapter 4 Random Number and Variate Generation; Chapter 5 Arena Basics; Chapter 6 Model Testing and Debugging Facilities; Chapter 7 Input Analysis; Chapter 8 Model Goodness: Verification and Validation; Chapter 9 Output Analysis; Chapter 10 Correlation Analysis; Chapter 11 Modeling Production Lines; Chapter 12 Modeling Supply Chain Systems; Chapter 13 Modeling Transportation Systems; Chapter 14 Modeling Computer Information Systems; Appendix A Frequently Used Arena Constructs; Appendix B VBA in Arena.Related titles:Boucher: Design of Industrial Information Systems,  0-12-370492-8Ross:  Simulation, 3rd edition, 0-12-598063-9Nelson et al: Introductory Statistics for Engineering Experimentation,  0-12-515423-2", "related": ["B00AHGWN1G"], "rank": 1816834, "title": "Benjamin Melamed", "author": "Tayfur Altiok", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I've had an overactive imagination since I can remember and found the best way to lull myself to sleep at night was to lay and think of new endings to my favorite movies or better yet take a minor character from a movie or book and create a story around them. I've always loved science fiction, one of my first memories of watching TV was of a young Captain Kirk in some kind of trouble. It wasn't easy being an expert trekkie in high school. But once I discovered Ray Bradbury the sky was the limit. I moved on to fantasy with great authors like Tolkien, Terry Brooks and RA Salvatore. Eventually it occurred to me to start putting my stories in writing. I am constantly amazed at how my stories seem to write themselves. I write like most people read. Once a story is done, I am lost until I begin another. I currently live in a small town at the base of the beautiful mountains in Utah. I couldn't ask for a more inspiring venue.

Shade is working for an insurance company that paid out $12 million in an accidental death case, but now has reason to believe that the insured is still alive. St. James is working on a story about the homeless that requires going underground equipped with a Taser for protection. Told in roughly alternating chapters, their assignments eventually merge as they separately, then jointly, uncover a massive case of fraud with murder a frequent byproduct. The bad guys, as deadly as they are, are pretty easy to identify, but the way the physically tough Shade and the gutsy St. James deal with them shows the protagonists to be a well-matched pair. The frisson of mutual attraction between St. James and Shade should make readers hope for future joint endeavors.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Conveying the hypocrisy and claustrophobia of middle-class life at the time it is likely to hit the spot with anyone who was intrigued by The Suspicions of Mr Whicher. Daily Express - Top titles for 2014 With deliciously dark elements of addiction, deception, torrid adultery and poison, this is the riveting true story of a sensational Victorian trial of 1889 ... Colquhoun's writing has a wonderful slow burn to it, and until the final page, she keeps us guessing: guilty, or not guilty? The Bookseller Meticulously researched, this vivid account follows every twist and turn of the case that's threaded with adultery, posion and addiction. It kept me guessing to the end. Woman & Home Exhaustively researched and not for the faint-hearted. Her descriptions of the autopsy carried out in the victim's bedroom would make Kay Scarpetta wince ... But there is another element that Colquhoun hauls blinking into the light: the changing moral climate of the time and the conflict between the patriarchal ancien regime and the emergence of the New Woman Daily Express [An] absorbing review of this old scandal ... [Colquhoun] highlights what the case can tell us about late Victorian England - its flawed legal processes and dangerous medical practices, its predatory appetite for gossip, and above all the uncertain position of its women. What Colquhoun reveals is a persistent doubleness - respectability concealing transgression ... Restlessness, rather than complacency, characterises the society that she describes Guardian Intriguing, forensic ... a moral fable of the age, intelligently told by Colquhoun, who places her sources cleverly within historical and literary context ... gripping The Times While [Did She Kill Him] is a carefully researched account, based on contemporary sources, it reads more like a novel Liverpool Echo [Colquhoun] builds an almost unbearable tension into the events ... This book is much more than a real-life murder mystery. Colquhoun has researched her subject thoroughly and presents a forensic account of the facts as known ... Colquhoun spins a tale rich in detail and atmosphere, and her meticulous research never overshadows her obvious talent for storytelling Herald Kate Colquhoun has complicated and fascinating story to tell. She has researched the case well, reading the original trial transcripts and contemporary newspaper reports in addition to the many previous accounts of the Maybrick case Literary Review Colquhoun's account ... is vivid and shocking ... giving us a keyhole through which to peep into an era when gender relations were almost as toxic as the pick-me-ups that probably killed James [Maybrick] -- Lucy Hughes-Hallett Sunday Times Colquhoun presents an absorbing picture of a society which would rather hang a woman, despite lack of evidence, than besmirch her husband's name Press Association A fascinating, meticulously researched book, full of period detail. Colquhoun's success in weaving together a series of complex topics is no mean feat and an even greater achievement is to have presented them clearly and simply Spectator Kate Colquhoun renders the story in a vivid, novelistic style ... gripping Financial Times A fascinating tale -- Craig Brown Mail on Sunday Enlivened by imaginative detail, Colquhoun's lively and perceptive narrative has the reader rooting for the friendless defendant Independent", "related": ["B00APYXTLI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His father was Director of Education and as was fitting the young Stewart attended Edinburgh Academy before going up to Oriel College, Oxford where he obtained a first class degree in English. Amongst his undergraduate contemporaries were Christopher Isherwood and W.H. Auden. Stewart observed the latter during their final examinations, where Auden emerged with a third, and later stated how the \"tears were coursing down his pale and ample cheeks.\" Stewart won the Matthew Arnold Memorial Prize and was named a Bishop Frazer's scholar.  After a short interlude travelling with AJP Taylor in Austria, including studying Freudian psychoanalysis for a year, he embarked on an edition of Florio's translation of Montaigne's Essays, which secured him a post teaching English at Leeds University.  In 1932, he married Margaret Hardwick, who practised medicine, and they subsequently had three sons and two daughters, one of whom is also a writer. By 1935, he had been awarded the Jury Chair at the University of Adelaide in Australia as Professor of English and had also completed his first detective novel, 'Death at the President?s Lodging', published under the pseudonym 'Michael Innes'. This was an immediate success and part of a long running series centred on 'Inspector Appleby', his primary character when writing as 'Innes'. There were almost fifty titles under the Innes banner completed during his career. Very early in his writing career, Stewart managed to establish himself as a late Golden Age Detective Story writer and as a highly cultivated and entertaining writer. In 1946, Stewart returned to the UK and spent two years at Queen's University in Belfast, before being appointed Student (Fellow and Tutor) at Christ Church, Oxford. He was later to hold the post of Reader in English Literature of Oxford University and upon his retirement was made an Emeritus Professor. Whilst never wanting to leave his beloved Oxford permanently, he did manage to fit into his busy schedule a visiting Professorship at the University of Washington and was also honoured by other Universities in the UK.  Stewart wrote many works under his own name, including twenty-one fiction titles (which contained a highly acclaimed quintet entitled 'A Staircase in Surrey', centred primarily in Oxford, but with considerable forays elsewhere, especially Italy), several short story collections, and over nine learned works on the likes of Shakespeare, Kipling and Hardy. He was also a contributor to many academic publications, including a major section on modern writers for the Oxford History of English Literature.  He died in 1994, the last published work being an autobiography: 'Myself and Michael Innes'. His works are greatly admired for both their wit, plots and literary quality, with the non-fiction acknowledged as being definitive.", "related": ["B00IJYGJHM"], "rank": 3023812, "title": "The Man Who Wrote Detective Stories", "author": "J.I.M.

The authors are to be commended for their passion and dedication in bringing to bear the immense resources of Western psychology to attempt to lessen human degradation, enrich the world, and increase human dignity and freedom. ...This book will be of interest to all mental health professionals, students, and professors in the social sciences and laypeople concerned with the plight of our world in a challenging age. We should read it not as the final world on a complex topic but as part of an ongoing crucial conversation that we all need to participate in, deepen, and expand so that we can cocreate a more sustainable world and a viable future.\"Jeffrey B. Rubin,PsycCRITIQUESFebruary 24, 2014, Vol. 59, No. 8, Article 1\"This scholarly treatment of profoundly human issues is a breath of fresh air. Although framed as an edited collection of independent essays, the book is obviously much more collaborative than is typical for a collection of scholarly articles organized around a theme. Many of the essays are co-authored by scholars who contribute to several pieces in the collection. The careful editorial work also contributes to this overall sense of a true conversation about critical topics. This provides a sense of continuity and real thematic organization that is unusual in scholarly collections. Having spent over thirty years reading scholarly collections of articles, most of which have the feeling of listening to a crowd of people having separate conversations on a subway--the same subway car being the theme--this collection offers a refreshing change. The contributors to the volume represent many strands of scholarly work and clinical practice in psychology. This integration of knowledge, practical wisdom, spiritually-informed reflection, and hands-on engagement in service to communities expresses the spirit of the \"socially-responsible\" in the title of this book.TOWARD A SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE PSYCHOLOGY FOR A GLOBAL ERA ALSO presents a much-needed integration of many dimensions in the human experience, which is lacking in many contemporary approaches to psychology. Arguing against fragmented models of the individualistic self, the authors in this work seek to illumine the profound extent to which individual health and global well-being are profoundly connected.The book essentially offers a perspective on psychology that makes sense to a person, such as myself, who is not a psychologist by training. That we live in a global era is now beyond any reasonable denial. This globalization demands an disciplinary, collaborative, and cross-cultural analysis that takes into account a variety of phenomena that have no borders. Pressing global concerns, including intergroup conflict; rapid societal transformation, urbanization, and national development; threats to the natural environment; physical and mental health needs; the status of women; and the struggles of disempowered groups have profound psychological dimensions. Yet, much of contemporary discourse and analysis either completely ignores these psychological dimensions, or approaches them without reference to the complex interplay of culture, economics, history, politics, and religion; in other words, a multidisciplinary and transnational perspective. This book offers a welcome addition to the quest to understand the real psychological complexities of globalization and to explore the roots of socially-responsible behavior in our global era.\"William R.

J.C.’s parents were both educators working at the middle school level, and he married into another family of educators. In his family, counting in-laws, there are now two retired principals, two retired teachers, a retired school counselor, and an active science teacher. In his youth, J.C. read quite a lot. The Call of the Wild was one of his early favorites, and into middle school he began to devour other books such as Anne McCaffrey’s Dragonriders of Pern series. Unfortunately, J.C. developed a form of dylexia that made reading from the page of a book difficult. It was later discovered that the curvature of the page itself caused the issue, and the advent of the eReader (with its perfectly flat screen) has allowed him to once again enjoy reading as he used to. He enjoys both indoor and outdoor pursuits including computers, cars, and camping. J.C., his wife, and their three sons enjoy hockey, and set aside time several times each season to watch the local WHL franchise.", "related": [], "rank": 1263150, "title": "Columbus", "author": "J.C.

It changed his life in many ways.  He became a pretty good marathon runner with a Personal Best of 2:59:40. Matt's running took on a completely different meaning in 2002 when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Over the next few years he realized that his life had been blessed beyond measure.  All the people in his life that had done so many wonderful things that he could never pay back.  He decided it was time  to \"pay it forward\". In 2009 he ran the New York City Marathon with his daughter  Kristen Martin.  They ran to raise money and awareness for the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research.  He has continued to run marathons for Team Fox despite the fact that he now finishes the marathon in the bottom 1% in a time of about 8 hours. Matt has used his running marathons with Parkinson's as a platform to speak to thousands of people about how to live positively when \"bad\" things happen to us. Matt believes that we all must live each day in anticipation that at any moment, around any corner, God can choose to intervene in our lives and give us an opportunity to participate in His plans. Being obedient to these \"divine appointments\" will bless our lives. Being aware of God's desire for our lives and knowing that we are participating in His desires leads to an amazing, exciting life.  It doesn't get any better than this. Matt wrote his first book, \"One Step Ahead of Parkinson's Disease\" in July 2012.  This book, \"It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This\" is a sequel to that book. Matt not only looks at his continual physical journey against Parkinson's disease, but the spiritual journey he has followed.  He draws from his marathon experiences to make lifestyle decisions for himself.  Matt takes a unique look at the people in our society who are invisible, marginalized, and living in the \"back of the pack.\"  Matt believes that we need to create a shared community which takes into consideration of \"the least of these.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has visions of exploring the Western Frontier, where she dreams of finding a peaceful valley to build a horse ranch all her own. She craves freedom and adventure. The only thoughts filling her lovely head are those of finding her own little niche in the world, where she can live her dreams far from the desperate and dangerous greed of her half-sisters. She never expects those dreams to be filled with nightmares or to fall in love with someone who accepts her every flaw, including her overwhelming need for independence. Bold, Brutally Handsome, and Persistent, James McCord O'Neil, better known as Hawk, is a Civil War veteran. Once he delivers his wounded brother home, he begins his own journey in the hopes of cleansing his tormented soul of the war*s bitter memories. His plans are to venture West, where the skies are open, the prairies are unending, and the mountains are said to reach the clouds. He never expects the beautiful and spirited woman he meets, in a small West Virginia town while gathering supplies for the trail, to haunt him more than any battle ever has. He figures fighting the war all over again would be easier than infringing on her independence. In order to win her love, he must devise a new battle plan.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I found that there were numerous answers to questions in my life, my career, and my family answered with simple everyday symbols in my dreams.After much prayer, I knew that I wanted to share the information I have researched over the past 17 years with everyone who may be interested in what their dreams mean. And I am sure they will be as thrilled as I am that the Lord would take the time to show us things we need to know in our dreams. In my case it may be the only way.. (laughter) because I am so busy with my hectic everyday life that I just don't always hear that small still voice speaking to me.I believe that the Lord will be sure to get the information we need to us somehow.. either through dreams and visions, or from friends, and those we trust in the Lord. Most of all with the Holy Spirit's guidance we can discover things that can really help us in our walk here on earth. God is Good!I hope these Bless whoever reads them. They are in different volumes because there is so much information, including scripture that trying to put it all in one book would make the book huge.. or we would have to take out stuff to keep the book from being too big.  And I want to do each subject thoroughly..

As a 'Pad brat' he was brought up on whichever RAF base his Father was posted to. He joined the British Army as an Infantry Junior Leader in 1972 at the tender age of 15, serving in the Coldstream Guards on ceremonial duties at the Royal Palaces, flying the flag in Africa, and on operations in both Ulster and on the UK mainland. In 1981 Andy swapped his green suit for a blue one with the Metropolitan Police. With volunteer reservist service in both the Wessex Regiment and 253 Provost Company, Royal Military Police (V) he spent twenty four years in front line policing, both in uniform and plain clothes. The final six years as a police officer were served in a London inner city borough and wearing two hats, those of an operation planner, and liaison officer with the television and film industry. His first literary work to be published was that of a poem about life as a soldier in Ulster, sold with all rights to a now defunct writers monthly in Dublin for the princely sum of £11 (less the price of the stamp on the envelope that the cheque arrived in.) The 'Armageddon's Song' series began as a mental exercise to pass the mornings whilst engaged on a surveillance operation on a drug dealer who never got out of bed until the mid afternoon. On retirement he emigrated with his wife to the Philippines where he dives for relaxation and is a member of the famous Asian running club 'The IGAT Runners'. The first three volumes of the five part series have been published in print and also Kindle form along with Abridged editions making them suitable for the Under 18's. The fifth, and final, volume has just been published.", "related": ["B00LDCER4E"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It went so much deeper. I did not expect all the twists and turns and how complicated each connection would be or how all of these little bits and pieces would come together to make me say aha! Did I say wow?  I did.  That is actually exactly what I said when I closed the book. . . . Loved it!  If you like some suspense to go along with your romance you are going to love The Power To See!\"Between the Pages: \"WOW! This one was a definite page turner! I couldn't read this fast enough to see how it was going to end! There are so many characters and their lives intertwine to create this soap opera type story! Ms. Davis has given us characters and a storyline that will keep you on the edge of your seat...will the good in people prevail over the bad? Will they help each other out of tough situations? Will they stand up to the evil that is Salazar? The story could totally become a movie or mini series! If you are looking for something different to read then this is the one for you!Verna Loves Books: \"I really enjoyed reading this book.
