Young  and inexperienced, she is willing to take her mother's advice about relationships. When her new husband  abandons her on their wedding night she makes peace with her new and lonely life until John's debts force  Mallory and her mother out of their family home. Seven years after her wedding night, Mallory goes in  search of her husband, and finds he has much more to offer than financial stability.", "related": ["B00LI91B0K"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 32.0}

Aimed at readers worried about snooping by entities ranging from the government to marketers, Holtzman plainly outlines what he calls the \"seven sins against privacy\" under which most violations can be categorized. He details the trails we all leave behind us that are increasingly finding their way into commercial and government databases. The book is divided into five sections: damage resulting from the loss of privacy, a historical overview, the legal basis of privacy, the mechanics behind snooping, and how to protect privacy. Holtzman includes samples of stories from newspapers and magazines of privacy violations, as well as an overview of the gadgets that trace our every movement, from cell phones to global positioning systems, police surveillance cameras, and chips that can be hidden in books and clothing. Advocating for a balance between security and privacy, Holtzman warns that \"data never disappears.\"Vanessa BushCopyright © American Library Association.

Now that her two children have reached their twenties, Angela and her husband live in Florida with Very Big Dogs (a direct result of watching Turner and Hooch and Sandlot too many times). This affinity for mastiffs has not been without its rewards—one of their dogs was featured on Live with Regis and Kelly as the second-largest canine in America.

Afterward, the dog gave out pawtographs at the airport. Angela admits to being fascinated by animals, medicine, unexplained phenomena, and “just about everything” except sports. Books, she says, have always shaped her life— in the fifth grade she learned how to flirt from reading Gone with the Wind.  When she’s not home writing, Angela often travels to teach writing workshops at schools and writers’ conferences. And to talk about her dogs, of course.

The name of the village is Bartley, Nebraska.  Family circumstances relocated my mother and I to Kearney, Nebraska.  I fell in love with this city.  Kearney is where I met the love of my life, my very own knight in shining armor, my husband Ron Carey.  We have been together for over 15 years.  I fall in love with him over and over again.  We have two beautiful children.  They are the lights of our lives.  We also have a funny yellow lab, who is also part of the family.      I started writing over ten years ago.  I was reading a lot of cheesy romances and every one of them that I read I kept thinking of things that I'd do different in each of them, so I decided to try to write my very own romance.  That first book was Jaguar, which I totally revamped from its original state.  The first version was as cheesy as those romances that I was reading (and still do sometimes).  I started African Sunset one night when I was waiting for one of my children to get up to bat.  It was either my daughter playing softball or my son playing baseball.  Anyway, I finished it a year later and it is now available for you to immerse yourself in.      I appreciate you taking the time to get to know a little bit about me.  I hope that you enjoy falling into my books.  Enjoy, take care, and God bless!      Love,                Nicole M.

The material may be old, but the slang still sings in these stories of scrappers attempting to become lords of whatever tiny domain they can conquer. There'sTrainspotting's volatile Begbie, at his mom's house for Christmas and trying to endure his sister's new beau in Elpseth's Boyfriend. In A Fault on the Line, Malky doesn't want to let anything—not even a horrific accident—stop him from missing the kickoff of a footie match. These stories of blustering, emotionally befuddled men and the luckless women who love them also includes less traditional (for Welsh) fare, like The Rosewell Incident, in which an alien race learns about Earth culture from a Scottish hood, and I Am Miami, about a retired Scottish school teacher who runs into a pair of disgruntled former pupils in Miami. Welsh shines most brilliantly when portraying his solipsistic Scots head-butting the rock-hard ceiling in hopes of escaping, be it through booze, drugs, soccer or sex, from a violent world that offers little peace but plenty of humor.(Sept.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ellison, Professor of Counseling and Urban Studies, Alliance Theological  SeminaryFinally urban ministry is receiving the kind of attention in  print that it deserves.  This work is must reading for those who wish to understand  and cooperate with God's plan for the city.-Dr. Tony Evans, Senior Pastor,  Oak Cliff Bible FellowshipThere are powerful word images in these pages  you may not have heard from evangelicals in a while--Christian community development;  a gospel that is both vertical and horizontal; a foreign mission field on our urban  doorstep; wholistic ministry.  Other word pictures will be more familiar and  less frightening--Jewish evangelism; ministry in the jails and to urban youth.   May God bless the reader as he discovers and rediscovers the challenge behind all  these words and through grace transforms image into reality, word into deed.-Dr.  Harvie M. Conn, Professor of Missions Emeritus, Westminster Theological SeminaryA  Heart for the Cityis one of the most important books I have read on urban ministry.   Each chapter is written by leaders and practitioners from every major field of the  urban church.  This volume provides vision, inspiration, philosophy, and practical  advice for fulfilling the Great Commission in contemporary urban America. -Dr. Lyle W.

Baldwin will surely ignite a fire under green thumbs who are already drawn to this realm of intriguingly textural plants, with abundant examples of gorgeous private and nursery gardens abetted by succulent displays of starkly upright and cascading forms, ruffled leaves, and rosettes.

Confined to a wheelchair, Albert Moore pays the detective handsomely for a simple jobphotographing people entering a shop called Nu-Cal Designsbut the assignment takes on frighteningly lurid complications. A bomb destroys the shop, Moore and the chauffeur of his limousine; glossy actress Melissa Moore Franklin survives the blast, however, and runs to ask Copp for protection from invisible killers. Himself a suspect in the crime, the detective is in danger from the police and the cunning perpetrators who keep murdering anyone in their way. Learning that the man who called himself Moore has been identified as movie mogul Bernard Wiseman, Copp interviews his ex-wife Justine and gets a line on the relationship between the real Moore and Charles Franklin, former and present spouses of Melissa. The twists double and redouble, tying the private investigator into stringent knots and casting him, at length, into the hands of merciless conspirators. The author sustains the heat that keeps Copp \"on fire\" throughout the rousing adventure of a likable hero whose daring is matched by a lusty sense of humor.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Moss's flat, high-pitched tones for Brown perfectly convey the psychopathic workings of his obsessive mind. When Brown escapes from prison, the tension in Moss's voice ratchets up. The novel is dark and dangerous, and Moss's pacing and precision give the telling extra oomph. Listeners will be loath to turn this off. Don't miss it.

I was also able, thanks to the hospitality of club employees, to be given access to records, the club museum and, on occasion, a lofty seat in the press box.My previous books have all dealt with some historic aspect of football (or soccer for those in the USA) but this was different. This time I was actually watching history being made. There was a real sense of occasion at every match as the so-called impossible dream of the 'treble' gradually became reality. It was a privilege to be on the streets of the Barcelona as the open top bus made its way from the port to the Camp Nou, hemmed in by over a million on the streets and another 100,000 in the stadium itself.Having accomplished one impossible dream Barcelona then set out on another, annexing another three titles before the end of the calendar year 2009. Just think: six titles in six months. Arguments will rage over where this Barcelona team stands in the pantheon of all-time greats but few will dispute their right to be there. It will be a long time, if ever, before any club does what Barcelona did between May-December 2009.I was lucky enough to see that history being made. I hope I have transmitted some of that in this book which takes the reader match-by-match, from pre-season 2008 to the World Club Championship in December 2009.", "related": ["B0081RLJE0"], "rank": 2972768, "title": "Barça - The Year Of Living Gloriously eBook", "author": "David Ross", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His books do not inhabit the same atmospheric world as such past thriller writers as Graham Greene and Eric Ambler, and he lacks the political sophistication of current ones like Gerald Seymour. But Ryan knows what his readers want and can always be counted upon to deliver a tough and fast-moving package. The theme here is a duel to the death between an SAS soldier and the man who trained him. Ryan's protagonist, Alex, has been recently commissioned from the ranks and returns from a hostage rescue mission in Sierra Leone to find someone has been gruesomely murdering MI5 officers, Hannibal Lecter-style (a skinning knife is involved). The security services believe the killer is an insider, SAS-trained, and Alex is ordered to track him down. As he gets closer and closer to the eponymous Watchman, the body count rises implacably. This one will glean no literary prizes, but bookshop tills will ring as merrily as they did for The Hit List and Zero Option.", "related": ["B00B3KKN4Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Vann Woodward Professor of History, Yale University\"...Faulknerian in its revelations and observations of human nature, clearly spotlighting the question of real responsibility not just for active human evil, but also for spawning its activity.... Wells shows us that lynchings were (and are) the tip of the iceberg, the cruel result of calculated manipulation of our base human natures and our cowardliness in not confronting evil when we see it, either now or then. While this book lacks Twain's humor, it rivals his incisiveness.\"Tex Wood, author (LIKABLE SINS) and English Professor, Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College\"Author does dogged detective work about a family murder.One of the most chilling recent books about local history comes to our eyes via self-publication. In 'A Game Called Salisbury' (Infinity Publishing), Susan Barringer Wells presents the story of a series of murders and retributive lynchings that had taken place within her family a century ago. The book is exhaustively researched and compellingly related. To be passionate about a subject is one thing; to tell the story in a fresh and focused way, as Wells does, is a rarer achievement.\"Rob Neufeld, ASHEVILLE CITIZEN-TIMES\"The study's emphasis on the media's role in the lynchings is of particular interest. Drawing on a range of newspaper accounts, Wells shows how journalists presupposed the men's guilt and fueled whites' desire for revenge. She also underscores the legal system's disservice to the murder suspects.... Wells's description of the scant punishment mob members faced...is notable for its exposure of the class prejudice that coexisted with racial prejudice in early twentieth-century North Carolina. A Game Called Salisbury makes for engaging, albeit disturbing, reading.\"Elizabeth Crowder, THE NORTH CAROLINA HISTORICAL REVIEW\"The author says in the Preface that the book was `a little about me,' but, in reality, the book is all about her, for throughout the book, the reader is entranced by her ability to delve into the grisly details of her ancestors' violent deaths, yet maintain objectivity, and compassion for the alleged murderers, whom she also labels as victims. Though she is not a trained historian, in this way she is able to maintain a historian's distance. But Wells tends to inject into the discussion her political opinions about events in today's era, which is a bit distracting. Still, overall, the book is well worth reading. It complements Alexander S. Leidholdt's study (`Editor for Justice') of lynchings in Virginia and the rise of Louis I. Jaffe, a Virginian Pilot editor, as a national crusader against the crime.\"Tommy Bogger, professor of History and Director of the Harrison B.

He and his Minutemen Civil Defense Corps, dedicated to reporting undocumented migrants crossing into the U.S., were merely the latest in a lineage of self-appointed patriots patrolling the border. Nearly 100 years earlier, Harry Wheeler, an Arizona sheriff, stormed through Cochise County asking illegal residents, Are you an American, or are you not? before rounding them up in the Bisbee Deportation. At the turn of the last century, Cochise County represented the New America that emerged from the nation's incorporation of northwestern Mexico, the immigration of Europeans to work as miners and the passage of constitutional amendments loosening the racial strictures around citizenship. Benton-Cohen uses the backdrop of the Wild West, with its bustling commerce and growing population, to wage a discussion on racial division and the power of white privilege—even where the black-white dichotomy didn't necessarily exist—in this richly detailed anthropological look into the creation of racial boundaries and their application in present-day immigration reform debates.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The plot was engaging and the characters endearing. Wilson's generation- and continent-spanning tale is full of love and hardship, war and family, history and mystery. In Ghosts of Anatolia, we follow the extraordinary and complicated character Sirak Kazerian, from his childhood in Anatolia at the dawning of the 20th century, through his education in Jerusalem, to his later life in America. Sirak learns that, though he has fled thousands of miles, he cannot escape his past--the “ghosts” of Anatolia emerge in ways no reader will expect. Wilson's story is a tapestry of contradictions: of boundary-crossing friendships amid religious conflict, of love and letting-go, of feud and forgiveness, and of the boundless power of faith to heal.LaVon Kellner, President of Ethis CommunicationsForeWord ReviewsBook of the Year Award Finalist in Fiction - Multicultural Category", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At the center of this somewhat unwieldy novel (supposedly based on real-life incidents) is Israeli spymaster Eli Katzar and the three women he recruits to form his \"Ezra\" team: Charlotte, an American princess from Scarsdale; Lily, survivor of the death camps; and Israeli-born Aviva. During a mission in France in the late 1970s, an Israeli scientist is murdered and Katzar realizes that one of the three has betrayed him. The novel alternates between Katzar's attempt to discover the turncoat with flashbacks of his own recruitment and training of the three women and the dangerous careers they survived as Israeli agents. Aside from its undue length, the book suffers chiefly from the fact that Courter telegraphs the answer to the key question far too early. 125,000 ad/promo; Literary Guild selection; author tour.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Yet “women long to achieve it, no matter how unattainable it is,” says author Regina Franklin. Even Christian women are being seduced by the worldly definition of beauty. But failure to distinguish between reality and illusion is costing women their true identity and even their lives.InWho Calls Me Beautiful?Franklin skillfully chips away at the belief that a woman’s body is more important than her character. Patiently pointing to Scripture, she convincingly shows that true beauty starts inside and radiates outward. It is this proper biblical understanding of God’s design for women that empowers them to move beyond the cultural standards and the world’s “ideal woman.”Who Calls Me Beautiful?helps you identify the factors that influence your own understanding of beauty and will encourage you to allow the Holy Spirit to transform your mind so that you can live out God’s understanding of beauty in your life.When you see yourself as God sees you, as He created you, suddenly you have the freedom to be the unique woman you are created to be in Christ. And you can then pass this legacy on to other generations of women.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book of rigorous science and heartfelt clinical brilliance provides a clear neuro-developmental map of how to understand the power and intricacies of our first experiences in life, and how they set a template upon which all later experiences are built. She also helps us to address some of the most important topics in society—how we teach hate and how we can teach love and respect. This book speaks not only to clinicians, but to educators and parents who wish to deeply understand and positively influence their children. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to teach with Susan and to learn from her.  She is a bright star and a clear author; she is able to distill complex theories and research into readily understandable concepts.” (Peter A Levine, PhD, author ofTrauma through a Child’s Eyes)“Susan Hart has unified her brilliant and compelling command of both the objective scientific and the subjective psychotherapeutic aspects of attachment into a cutting-edge synthesis that she calls developmental neuroaffective psychology. In this book Hart makes the often-confusing science of attachment highly accessible to both practitioner and researcher. The book’s contents are well balanced with a refreshingly adequate portion dedicated to translating theory into principles for treatment.” (Babette Rothschild, MSW, bestselling author ofThe Body Remembers)“Hart's book is striking for its integration of a contemporary neuroaffective perspective, dynamics, and the telling impact of dysregulation on development.” (Ed Tronick, University Distinguished Professor, Department of Psychology, University of Massachusetts, Boston)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From his Peace Corps work with the Garifuna fishermen on the north coast of Honduras in the late 60s to 13 years saving critical habitats for the Nature Conservancy and Conservation International to his founding of Ecotrust in 1991, Beebe stands as one of the most trailblazing American conservationists of the past 40 years. In his new autobiography,Cache: Creating Natural Economies, set for release this month, Beebe offers a tell-all look at his successes, failures, and the larger, often rut-ridden forks in the road between.At turns swashbuckling, introspective, and eccentric, the book shares a series of tales about such varied pursuits as his purchases of major swaths of land across the West, a groundbreaking debt-for-nature swap in Bolivia, and the creation of the world s first eco-bank, Shorebank Pacific. But Cache also maps Beebe s gradual understanding that the most sustainable preservation efforts need to begin with human economies a realization that ultimately led to the controversial 1987 uprising he led at the Nature Conservancy that resulted in his founding of Conservation International and, later, Ecotrust.In this excerpt, a young Beebe (who would later become a deadly effective fundraiser) recalls his stumbling first success convincing the notoriously reserved Portland patrons Howard and Jean Vollum to help the Conservancy jumpstart the protection of the 600,000-acre watershed along the 40-mile corridor of the Sandy River. --Portland Monthly", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We have three major monotheisms, each claiming to be exclusively right. The pre-Christian West, however, was far different. Greeks and Romans in the classical world paid tribute to multiple gods but had virtually no moral absolutes based in religion. Their culture had no widely-accepted concept of an immortal soul, or sin, or salvation and damnation. In the absence of divine prescriptions, the people of these cultures had to rely on reason and pagan wisdom traditions as the sole guides to right decisions and right action.To the modern mind, a world without moral absolutes is difficult to comprehend or even to imagine. Many would find the concept a bit scary. Yet this was the culture of pre-Christian Athens and Rome, and it produced the greatest flowering of civilization the world had ever seen. The rapidity of its progress in numerous fields has never been equaled. Think of the classical world's rapid developments in politics, philosophy, geometry, architecture, engineering, technology, transportation, science, and all the visual, musical, and literary arts. Ordinary Romans in the fourth century enjoyed a material standard of living that would be unequalled again until the nineteenth century, and life was good. The Christian movement, however, sought to turn attention away from this world to the metaphysical realm, and it proclaimed virtually every aspect of pagan culture to be sinful. In the end, the Christians triumphed, the brilliant Greco-Roman culture collapsed, and Europe entered the Dark Ages.This novel is about the struggle of educated pagans to defend their culture and their way of life from an incursive religion that wanted to seize control of civilization by any means possible. Their story takes place in a pre-Christian culture that seems strange and alien, yet reflects the modern world in curious and surprising ways. Writing this book was for me a kind of intellectual and spiritual journey. I hope that reading it will be a similar journey for you.", "related": ["B00631TX80"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The point is to create flies that will catch fish without requiring a master's class in fly tying, while teaching some of the most basic fly tying skills that will lay a foundation for further learning with different materials and more complicated flies.Neither the book nor the flies are intended to produce oooh's and ahhh's from the fly tying lords and masters. We've already mentioned that the flies are simple and straightforward, but the book is as well. There is an occasional depth-of-field or focus issue with the photographs, but certainly nothing that detracts from their educational value. Even if you've never tied a fly in your life, I'm pretty sure you can follow along and end up with flies very similar to those shown, which is the entire point of the book.I'm sure newbies to fly fishing, and especially fly tying, feel the same sense of fear and \"what am I getting into?!?\" that I am feeling about woodworking. Everything seems easy once you know how to do it, but that first step is always the most difficult. Andrea and Glenn are doing their best to make that first step as fun and free of anxiety as possible. Good on them!", "related": [], "rank": 1619980, "title": "Ten Flies, Simple Ties eBook", "author": "Glenn Van Benschoten", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jake Morrison is a bright, young and ambitious attorney\nhell-bent on achieving his vision of success. But his vision is about to become\na nightmare. Zara Jane is a real-live Angel, sent from Heaven above to guide\nJake through these pivotal changes in Jake's life. She ends up working at\nJake's firm and dating him, so that she can watch over him. They fall in love.\nBut Jake rejects the message and her love and his life spirals out of control.\nAs an Angel Zara Jane imparts wisdom and insight for his life and world, and\nexpresses her insight on the road that lies ahead, not only for Jake, but also\nfor humankind as a whole. After Zara Jane has been given\npermission by the Angel Oversight Committee that she would be allowed to live\nwith Jake and experience human emotions, like love, first hand. They end up\nliving together in her mansion in Beverly\n Hills, formingParadise\nParanormal Investigations, Inc.together, solving capers together. This book is designed to help\nstimulate your strategic thinking when it comes to luck, and love, to help you\nrealize that everything in our lives really can have mystical significance! Enjoy the journey!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The audience should be vast and include anyone who has ever thought of consulting a therapist. People now in therapy should read this book so they can determine whether they are receiving good or bad therapy. --Stanton Samenow, Ph.D. (Clinical Psychologist and noted Author)Dr. Hurd begins this very important, very serions book by making us laugh by taking a hypothetical patient to seven different therapists and giving us seven different opinions on how to solve the problem. This deftly demonstrates why patients should 'vet' any potential mental health professional before taking advice or changing any behavior. Then he goes into detail on how certain types of therapy can actually hurt a patient, by examining the flaws in Psychoanalysis, Insight Therapy, Behavioral Therapy, Mystical Therapy, Child Therapy and more. His astute analyses of bad psychotherapy should be extremely helpful to anyone approaching the idea of going into therapy because it exposes the dangers inherent in following harmful advice, and offers 'red flags' to look for when deciding whom to go to for help. His analysis of good therapy is so good that after reading this book, filled with specifics, a potential patient may simply follow his lead and find it unnecessary to seek professional help at all..... As a fiction writer, I found Dr. Hurd's book especially enlightening because when I devise conflicts for my characters, I have to imbue them with psychological and existential problems and then dramatize either their success or failure in solving them. My novel, 'Crosspoints, A Novel of Choice', in fact, has this very subject as its theme: the choices we make in life determine not only our future, but also our very identity. With this in mind, I found Dr. Hurd's demystification of psychology and his down-to-earth analysis of the root causes of dysfunctions brought about by faulty thinking to be spot on. His warnings that psychologists are people too, and may well have [their own] insecurities, obsessions and compulsions are spot-on too. They spell out the importance of interviewing potential therapists to ascertain their core values before granting them the position of helping you with yours. He also takes a look through a wide-angle lens at America's cultural demise, philosophical confusions, health care crises, and political powers gone astray; giving food for thought in judging the dangerous direction the country as a whole is going toward. Not only private individuals, but also politicians and professional therapists should read this book, for there is help for anyone and everyone in this rational and readable text. --Alexandra York (internationally published author)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That couldn't be her escort.WHEEEET! A second call echoed the first, turning the heads of passengers boarding and disembarking from the train.Opal Bright shaded her eyes with one gloved hand, her other balancing a large hatbox against her hip. Surely the dust-covered man a head taller than those around him wasn't her father's chosen emissary.But when he waved his once-white Stetson above his head and began shouldering his way across the crowded train platform, Opal's hopes plummeted.\"Miss Opal? Opal Bright? Your father sent me. I'm his foreman, Charlie Welch.\"She tried to keep her lips from pinching as she considered the man, from the tips of his mud-covered boots to his patched and frayed woolen shirt to his warm, brown eyes and half-smile. She failed.Mostly because she was irritated at having to wait so long. It was another sign how little she mattered to her father.\"You're over an hour late. And how dare you-you whistle at me as if I were a-a cattle dog to be called to your side!\"His expression didn't change, except for a tiny quirk at one corner of his mouth. \"Miss, I'm sure you'd like to get out of the warm sun for a bit. Allow me to escort you over to the café.\"She barely resisted the urge to stomp her foot, like little Susie back at the orphanage was prone to do. \"I don't want anything to eat and I don't want to accompany you anywhere. I've come for one reason.\"\"What reason is that?\" he asked, voice suddenly harder than it had been before. Those brown eyes appraised her and she suddenly felt as if this cowhand was looking for fault.\"I'm here for the gold.\"His eyes widened infinitesimally before going cold. Suddenly, he yanked her by the elbow, pushing through the crowd and taking her with him.\"I'll thank you to unhand me.\" She tried to wiggle her arm loose from his grasp, without success. Her hatbox bobbled and she nearly dropped it. An upset \"mrrow\" emerged from inside. A sound Opal hoped Charlie hadn't heard.The cowhand ignored her and bodily escorted her down the rough wooden steps from the platform to the dusty street below. \"Let. Me. Go.\" Opal yanked against his hold, but only succeeded in possibly giving herself bruises. His iron grip didn't slip.\"There isn't any gold.\" He spoke loudly, throwing the words over his shoulder. Almost as if he spoke to someone behind her.\"But--\" Opal gasped as he dragged her through a muddy spot between two buildings, ruining the hem of her traveling suit. The only nice gown she had left.\"I don't know what you're talking about, but keep yer trap shut,\" Charlie hissed, leaning close so she got a whiff of leather and soap and man. It was enough to make her shiver.\"I'll thank you not to behave so familiarly,\" she bit off, annoyed at her thundering heart. \"You're entirely too close.\"\"Well, I'll thank you,\" he mimicked her with a wrinkle of his nose, \"not to make such a fool announcement in front of God and ever'body. You've got a coupla mean-looking fellas interested in your arrival.\"A glance behind the broad shoulders shielding her from most of the boardwalk revealed he was right.

Mda’s gregarious and transfixing memoir,Sometimes There Is a Void, chronicles the upheavals that have sharpened his skills as a wide-ranging social observer . . . Mda’s autobiographical voice strikes a fine balance between outward engagement and inner exploration . . . To his credit, in a deeply unsettled life, he has nurtured this capacity to find within the creative act itself new, reviving forms of homecoming.” —Rob Nixon,The New York Times Book Review“A moving, funny, and deeply bawdy book that meanderingly describes the South African writer’s coming of age during a period when Nelson Mandela was more well-known for being a lady-killer than a politician, and the Boers of South Africa were boogeymen to young boys all over southern Africa. Into the alphabet soup of political allegiances jumps the young Mda, son of a lawyer—and a lover, not a fighter . . . The alternating warmth and horror of Mda’s recollections make “Sometimes There Is a Void’’ a strangely gripping book . . . Here is a man looking back on his life and country with joy and sorrow, and all their excessive gestures. He chafes against easy narratives. They were—he was—alive with ideas, growing up at the dawn of South Africa’s independence. But they were also alive with so much else: sex and food and booze, family life and music. Lift the lid off this big overstuffed book and all of it - or what feels like all of it - comes tumbling out.” —John Freeman,The Boston Globe“Born into a prominent South African activist family, Mda fled to Lesotho at the age of fifteen to join his father, a radical lawyer living in exile. He went on to become one of the most celebrated playwrights and novelists of the post-apartheid era.” —The New Yorker“Mda’s electric honesty is a live current through his remarkably gorgeous, urgent, poetic, matter-of-fact memoir. But don’t get lulled into thinking this is the book of one bravely truthful man’s journey into self-expression. Mda has shaken off calcification, identity, ego and walked usallinto sovereignty and selfhood. Read this, and be prepared to examine your own soul as never before. Speaking for myself, I know it’s been a long time since I have been so undone and remade by another person’s words.” —Alexandra Fuller, author ofCocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness", "related": [], "rank": 1632858, "title": "Sometimes There Is a Void", "author": "Zakes Mda", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ben knows nothing of his father or of the tribulations borne by Aborigines. But he learns all too quickly when a wealthy doctor refuses to treat Diamond as she lies dying. In retaliation, Ben breaks the windows of the doctor's house, resulting in a long, abusive jail sentence. Once freed, Ben is vengeful, but, unexpectedly, love enters his world in the form of the doctor's daughter, Phoebe. Set against the harshly exotic outback, this crisply paced family saga involves various complications, including the ruthlessness of Ben's father, while offering up a good bit of Australian and Aborigine history.

After school he went to Merton College Oxford where he studied Classics. His first job was as a cub reporter with the Yorkshire Post, after which he moved to the London Times sometime in the 1930s where he remained as a reporter until the outbreak of war. In April 1939 he married Jean Crichton, his wife and companion for the next 46 years. Too short-sighted for military service during the War, he served in naval intelligence where his first boss was Ian Fleming (of James Bond fame). After the war he joined the BBC and served as its Rome Correspondent for seven years. In 1953 he was promoted to Washington Correspondent where he covered, among other events, Nikita Khrushchev's state visit to the USA, the McCarthy era anti-communist 'witch hunts,' and the Cuban Revolution. In 1960 he, Jean and their four children moved back to Britain where he was appointed Foreign News Editor at Alexandra Palace in North London. Unsuited to desk work, however, he soon resumed the peripatetic life as the BBC's Diplomatic Correspondent and remained in this post until his retirement in 1975. He continued, nevertheless, to feature regularly on the BBC World Service long after this, and remained a frequent contributor to The Listener and other current affairs journals. His family and friends remember him best as a brilliant raconteur and story-teller with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of extraordinary and usually hilarious anecdotes from his long career as a foreign correspondent.

When a confrontation with Terry, a malevolent junkie, leads to murder, Billie and Mickey must cover it up. Billie has to learn to live with her guilt while supporting Jasmine, the heroin-addicted wife of the man she killed; Natty, her beloved, rebellious godson; and Monkey, Natty's faithful, handicapped best friend. This web of dependability is threatened when a reporter investigates Terry's \"disappearance,\" fueling a chain of events that uncovers all kinds of skeletons.

At age nine that was not a viable option. To bide her time she submersed herself in reading, and writing stories about surfing spies and other adventurers, that took her far from the desert to exotic locations, mostly Hawaii. Years later, when Georgina announced she had written a mystery novel, everyone who knew her expected it to be set in Hawaii. And they were right. Former business owner of a shave ice shop, her connection with Hawaii goes back many years including frequent visits to family friends on Oahu. Long appreciation of the Islands has brought her a profound love of the aloha spirit and the magic that is unique to Hawaii. Writing background includes: Sherlock Holmes societies, literacy coach, newsletters, plays, book clubs, creating amateur music videos and a role-play murder mystery. She is also the co-writer of a musical.  Also, she is a regular contributor to GreySave newsletter. The culmination of the passions for writing and Hawaii have inspired her mystery novels READS LIKE MURDER IN HONOLULU, READS LIKE MURDER IN KAHALA and coming next:  READS LIKE MURDER AT KILAUEA. A Disneyland fan from childhood, castles, wizards and other worlds were never far from her mind.  Forays into the realms of fantasy and science fiction also come from a classic base of fanzines.  As a lecturer at Summer School in Forks Symposium, her interest in supernatural swerved into a new line of enchanted thinking. DRAGONSHIRE WIZARDS OF THE WARRIOR BOND  is the first in a series exploring Merlin, his Order of wizards, and their heroic struggle to keep blood-drinking, Dark Wizards from overtaking Earth, and the Majiqal realms where Faeries, Elves, and other supernaturals dwell.", "related": [], "rank": 3587771, "title": "Dragonshire Wizards of the Warrior Bond eBook", "author": "Georgina M Donovan", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His favourite teaching method was role-playing often with quite unexpected and not so catastrophic results. One pupil once confessed, with typical candour and ambiguity, that he had taught her the creative value of madness. He attended fine arts school for a while as he continued to teach, studying cinema and video. He went on to make a number of works of video art shown in different festivals around Europe and directed some ten short television programmes about artists. He was one of the three organisers of an international video festival in Geneva, he founded a video art association and created a short-lived European bilingual magazine about electronic arts. He enjoyed the challenge of organising large-scale networks, coordinating a worldwide network of companies selling Internet domain names, for example. In a quite different sphere, he created \"The Hundred Venues\" with friends: a network of a hundred screening venues for electronic arts across Europe. For a year he played at being the CEO of an Internet start up. Apart from drafting business plans and convincing investors to give them five million, it was one of those rare times in his life that he systematically wore a suit and a tie in a vain attempt to appear different from the geeks who went about the office barefoot. Almost all of his activities have involved writing. Although professionally he mostly had to write reports and studies, he tried to create occasions to adopt what he called the Martian perspective, which entailed questioning the self-evident. He has brought that questioning perspective, along with a passion for images and what they can reveal, to novel writing and artwork together with a long-standing fascination for the dream world and the magic of fantasy.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story unspooled rather quickly from that point on.Encouraged by friends and family that it was one of my best works, I soon sold it to Focus On The Family, who published it through Breakaway Magazine.I've since refined the writing further, and kept in parts that were edited out by Breakaway (for their teen audience).

All too often, we face seemingly insurmountable challenges; these may arise from either our families or the communities in which we live. This book is a tribute to the unwavering spirit of all the brave men and women, across the globe, who refuse to become victims of circumstance. Being a responsible citizen entails more than merely making a statement or being a conscientious objector: it encompasses an iron-will and a determination to push oneself to the limits and beyond, in the hope of securing a brighter tomorrow. \"Serum\" is collaboration between the concerns that affect people in today’s society. I have tried to tackle a plethora of social issues ranging from drug addiction and alcoholism, to abuse and terrorism. In a pressurized world, we are oftentimes compelled to seek the support and guidance of those we cherish and admire most. In desperate and trying times, love is truly the guiding light to salvation. Surely, one of the foremost challenges we face today is intolerance. Racial prejudice and religious fanaticism are breeding grounds for the widening abyss between the overwhelmingly peace-loving citizens of this planet. I have attempted to highlight the dichotomy that exists in today’s world.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There were very-few turkey hunters\nback then, and only a select group of outdoorsmen even would try to take a\nturkey. The legends of turkey hunting told everyone how difficult taking a\nturkey could be, how many hours you had to spend chasing them, how quiet you\nhad to be, and how long was required to master a turkey call. Most people\nthought when you were hunting a turkey you had to use all the same cautions as\nif you were trying to capture a wild gorilla with only a throw-net. I wanted to\nwrite a book that would explain to any newcomer the equipment and the tactics\nthey could use to take a wild turkey. I wanted them to realize that a wild\nturkey wouldn't bite you or kill you, you didn't have to be afraid of making a\nbad note on a turkey call and spooking your turkey, and that really and truly,\nturkey hunting was a lot of fun. And, once you got into the sport, you'd really\nlike it. Question: What do you think is the biggest mistake most\nturkey hunters make?Phillips: I think there are two mistakes. They call too\nmuch, and they walk too much. I can honestly say that these are the two biggest\nmistakes, because I made both of them quite often when I first started turkey\nhunting. A friend of mine once said, \"Patience kills more turkeys than fancy\ncalling,\" and he was absolutely right. The thing we often forget when we're\nhunting turkeys is that these birds have short strides. When they take a step\nforward, they'll often move less than a foot. Often you'll have a turkey coming\nto you and decide, \"If the turkey was going to come within gun range, he should\nalready have been here by now.\" So, you get-up to move. You either flush the\nturkey that was coming to you, or walk off and leave the bird before he gets to\nyou.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science & Math", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There is a frighteningly comic interview between the beleaguered, bantamweight investigator and a mad giant who claims Tobin and his late partner have stolen a script from him.

Sometimes it's historical, sometimes it's contemporary, sometimes it's paranormal, and sometimes it's erotic, but everything I write takes into account the heroine's journey as well as the hero's!LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME is a historical erotic romance novella that kicks off three separate, but intertwined flapper stories. The first is a story about a married couple on the brink of divorce who are brought back together when they discover their inner kinks. The second is about a jaded starlet who finally meets a man who can make even a girl like her blush. The third is about a shop girl and social activist who finds herself in a torrid affair with her boss--the man she's planning a strike against.All three stories are set in a time when there weren't words for the BDSM lifestyle, but people still had the same urges. It's about people who are convinced that their sexuality will leave them isolated and alone--people who learn that accepting themselves is actually the path to love. Which character is your favorite and why?I loved every character in this book but if I have to pick only one, it's Leo Vanderberg, World War One Flying Ace. An American aviator who masters everything he puts his hands on whether it's an airplane or a silent screen siren.There is a moment in the story that Clara gets embarrassed and doesn't want to tell Leo how many lovers she's had. He laughs and says, \"I hope your list numbers in the hundreds . . . this way, when you admit I'm the best you've ever had, it'll really mean something.\"The moment those words rolled off his lips, I fell in love with him. And so did she.As the author, what surprised you about this story?I didn't know that films in the 1920s were so racy--it was before the Hays Code, so anything was allowed. And they did everything. I actually tripped over digitized pornography from this Jazz Age era and was so charmed by one of the films that I started writing a story for one of the women in it. That's how Clara Cartwright was born.What was the hardest thing for you about writing this story?I really pushed myself to think of sexual scenarios that were decidedly out of my comfort zone and I'm glad that I did. The Roaring Twenties gave me the perfect backdrop to explore the rougher stuff, like spankings, beltings, and even slapping as it related to the nature of consent.What do you find easiest and hardest to write? Dialog is usually easy for me but in this book, I spent a lot of time learning 1920s slang. It was time-consuming but so much fun! Now I try to use at least one 1920s slang term in daily conversation. It's the berries!Is there a theme or message that runs through your work?All of my books make the argument that love isn't really bound by rules. Your relationship is what you make of it. You and the person you love get to decide what makes you happy; society doesn't get to have a say. And even more importantly, that women don't have to conform to the shape of the boxes society wants to put them into. They can be smart and sexy. They can be nurturing and bad-ass.What would your readers be surprised to learn about you?I can't work without my shoes on. Seriously. The moment the shoes come off, I'm done for the day. My mind turns to mush.Which romance book or series (or other genre, if you don't write romance) do you wish you had written?HEARTS IN DARKNESS by Laura Kaye, for starters. Have you read it? If not, do so now.Also, Megan Hart's DIRTY.

This edition will provide students, scholars, and the general reader alike with a sound foundation for reading (and rereading) Haggard s classic novel.

His introduction is not only authoritative and lucid but stylistically engaging, as energetic as the novel itself an ideal introduction for first-time readers. The appendix topics are exactly what is needed, and the materials included provide an excellent context. The selection of non-fiction pieces by Haggard himself on questions of genre, imperialism, archaeology, and gender roles provides especially valuable insights into the author, the novel, and the times.\" (J.

Dr Mike Mouritz, Head, Sustainable Futures Unit, HASSELL, Perth, Western Australia 'Wendy Sarkissian is well known as an instigator of imaginative engagement processes that have enlarged the boundaries of participation theory and practice. In this book Sarkissian and co-author, poet-planner Dianna Hurford, bring together a set of participation practices that link the person and the planet through art, poetry, drama, planned surprises, and play. By drawing people away from their standard patterns of interaction, these inspiring and transformative tools and approaches have the potential to create plans, policies, and agreements that can really make a difference. There is much to learn from this thought-provoking book.' Ann Forsyth, Professor of City and Regional Planning, Cornell University 'Wendy Sarkissian and Dianna Hurford are the Margaret Mead and Mary Oliver of the community development world, combining youth and experience, poetry and playfulness, toughness and tenderness, to the challenges of living well and sustainably on our planet. Inviting us to the edge of the known world of community planning and engagement, they then gently push us off into space and give us the wings to fly: wings of beauty, creativity and relationship. It's a journey from paralysis to action, from isolation to connection, from homogeneity to polyphony: no less than a new way of being for community engagement practitioners committed to healthy communities.' Leonie Sandercock, professor, cross-cultural planner and film maker 'In Creative Community Planning Sarkissian and Hurford deliver an important message with punch and spice: It's time to go beyond business-as-usual civic engagement. It's not enough to find out the public's priorities and concerns or seek public buy-in on community plans and policies. The public represents a tremendously underutilized community asset: a source of wisdom and creativity in finding solutions to the complex issues (the 'wicked messes') that face communities everywhere. The challenge is to find ways to bring out the public's wisdom through creative community engagement. This book launches us on the path.' Dr Patricia A. Wilson, Professor of Planning and Civic Engagement, University of Texas, Austin 'Wendy and her colleagues have done it again. Raised the bar on our insights in how to undertake meaningful engagement programs. For me, as a planning practitioner who spends a lot of time on urban regeneration, often within communities that are disenfranchised in some way, this new book provides a wealth of creative wisdom that can help unlock opportunities that we never ever see coming when we begin a project.' Dr Mike Mouritz, Head, Sustainable Futures Unit, HASSELL, Perth, Western Australia 'Wendy and her colleagues challenge the idea that first comes knowledge, then comes action - for how can we begin to learn, to listen, to inquire, to wonder, to imagine if we're not already rooted in a place, in a history, in a web of social and political relationships and interactions? Wendy and her colleagues help us to recognize our connections, our interdependence, in far more intricate and intimate ways than most traditional (ecological or 'systems') views do and so they don't shirk from speaking of 'love' and care and respect and survival when they see that and more at stake in the ways we treat our places, our planet and one another.' John Forester, Professor of City and Regional Planning at Cornell University and the University of Amsterdam 'In Creative Community Planning the authors have produced an eye-opening, sometimes startling, account of new approaches to engaging the public in the decision-making that will affect their lives. In discussions of heart-centered processes, embodied work, role playing, and the power of silence (among much else), we learn how the boundaries of community planning are being expanded and exploded. Interviews with practitioners enliven the discussion; accounts of community planning experiences provide real life examples; and step-by-step techniques offer innovative approaches. An inspiring book that engages the heart as well as the mind.' Clare Cooper Marcus, Professor Emerita, Departments of Architecture and Landscape Architecture, University of California, Berkeley 'This is Wendy's best book yet. She and Dianna outline, in clear and inspiring language, how to elicit meaningful changes from and within communities. I can't wait to use it with my students!' Dr Carolyn Whitzman, Associate Professor in Urban Planning, University of Melbourne 'Creative Community Planning shows how to truly engage a community with freshness and fun so that participants can listen, laugh and interact with openness and insight. Creativity and artfulness -while risking complexities of emotion and conflict- come out of public processes with real solutions that have meaning for people in the community.' Arthur Orsini, Director of Child & Youth Engagement Programs, Urbanthinkers, Vancouver 'Wise, uplifting and heartening, this book will rekindle the passion for working creatively with communities in those feeling jaded by the compromises we have made. It made me feel young again.' Angela Hazebroek FPIA, Director URPS, Adelaide, and a town planner with 25 years' community engagement experience 'The book will be a valuable addition to the resources available to community planning practitioners. It reviews honestly what has worked and what has not within the authors�experience and reminds us that it is important to keep trying new ways of engagement.' Jenny Muir, Queen's University Belfast, Housing Studies\"This book is more than a pleading for the use of creative methods in community planning; it provides as well a priceless toolbox for the practitioners in the field of community development, especially for the ones working in the margins or borderlands of communities, in cross-cultural context.\" — Nicolae Cuta, 7 September 2011, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The John’s Hopkins University 2011", "related": [], "rank": 3298180, "title": "Creative Community Planning: Transformative Engagement Methods for Working at the Edge (Earthscan Tools for Community Planning)", "author": "Wendy Sarkissian", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Based on extensive fieldwork in Mozambique, South Africa, and Zambia; a familiarity with several other countries; and the creation of original datasets for 27 African countries, Pitcher uses a mix of methods to argue persuasively that the quality of democracy and the dynamics of political party systems have a decisive impact on the nature of market reform efforts across the continent. In so doing the book also makes a plea for bringing these two strands of scholarship together and makes a significant contribution to the comparative politics literature from which African cases have been largely missing. With carefully crafted cases and thoughtful theorization, the book is essential to our understanding of the politics of transition and reform of economies over the last two decades and going forward in Africa.\" - Gretchen Bauer, University of Delaware\"Full of intriguing and nuanced insights on the politics of privatization in Africa and a valuable contribution to the growing literature on institutional change. Policy makers, Africanists, and comparativists more generally will benefit from reading Pitcher's work.\" - Nancy Bermeo, University of Oxford\"This path-breaking work offers a systematic and nuanced treatment of the politics of private-sector development in Africa. Pitcher argues that governments' institutional choices about restructuring their economies are shaped by the political consequences of those choices. In new democracies, variations in party system stability and in the quality of democracy interact to influence states' willingness to remain committed to economic reform in the face of domestic opposition. Drawing on extensive field research and careful quantitative analysis of privatization processes, the book brings a wealth of new data and a fresh theoretical perspective to the study of economic reform in Africa and makes an important contribution to the broader comparative literature on institutional reform.\" - Carrie Manning, Georgia State University", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Many doctor visits ensued.  Each visit revealed the same diagnosis, ALS.  Doctors gave Edward a 2-3 years estimated life expectancy.  Edward and wife Charlotte didn't accept the doctor's timeline.They changed diet, added vitamins, exercises, and a lot of positive thinking--the disease progression appeared to slow.  After graduating to a wheelchair from a walker and having little speaking ability left, Edward decided to start writing.  His first book was begun on a Commodore 64 in the late 80s.  When someone loses their fine motor skills, it is difficult to manipulate a pencil let alone accomplish typing.  Edward didn't let this become a problem.  He types with a support under his arm, a brace on his hand and uses one finger to type.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Melva's imagination found fertile ground during a time when girls played with hand drawn paper dolls, or those cut from the McCall's magazines. Having developed a love for the written word as a youngster, she carried that love into adulthood.  When she enrolled in a creative writing class in order to quell the symptoms of boredom introduced by an empty nest, she activated the love she had kept bridled throughout her life. Like Grandma Moses with her late blooming career in art, Melva decided it was time to dust off her creative processes and bring her lifelong ambition as an author to fruition by publishing her stories and novels.

I hope if you read one you'll go ahead and read the others. Then maybe even try one of my 16 novels. Might work. I hope so.My favorite of the four spooky short stories...Ghost Brother. My second choice, The Banshee and the Witch, which is the longest short story at about 10,000 words and is about a witch who wants to live forever and might just do that.

Bernhard Reimann endured tremendous physical and psychological pain to survive WWII. After a year in a POW Russian camp he finally returned home to a demolished Berlin and started picking up the pieces by working in a hospital as a janitor, basically, as he had no papers or proof that he indeed was an accomplished medic and knew much about optics and microscopes. Slowly he proved himself and advanced in his field, studied at the University of Berlin and was in line to be a tenured professor there at Marburg. He received his Doctorate at age thirty-eight. In 1962 he was invited by the Scripps Institute in La Jolla, CA to be their Electron Microscope technician, a position that paid double what he was earning at that time in Germany. He discussed the possibilities with his beloved wife Beate and decided to take a chance. Several years later his wife and son were able to join him there, they became naturalized citizens in 1966, and learned to love America for which all she stands. He did a lot of work with diatoms (unicellular algae that form silicate shells) at the institute, writing numerous articles that were published in many scientific journals. Articles with titles like this: The Structure of the Cell Wall of Navicula Pelliculosa (Breb.) Hilse, published in 1966. In 1967 Dr. Reimann received a letter from the Chief of a Pathology Service at the William Beaumont Army Hospital in El Paso, TX, asking him to establish a laboratory for diagnostic electron microscopy, a civil service job. He took this job and stayed for another twenty years becoming a very involved citizen of El Paso. He served on the advisory board for the El Paso Zoo, formed the El Paso German Shepherd Dog Club, was active in solar energy discussions for the city and wrote many articles regarding the education system in the state, among other activities. He retired in 1987 with a Certificate of Honor from the Army for his service. He moved to his vacation home with his wife Beate in Capitan where he continues to reside today. His office is full of his writings, both scientific papers and fictional stories based on history and also science fiction. He lives alone now as his beloved wife passed away several years ago. He gets help from friends and stays active writing constantly more stories and opinions to editors and keeping apprised of world events. Hans; A German’s Soldier’s Tale, 1941 – 1945 is a compelling and heartfelt look into an era that few of us can fathom.", "related": ["B00F738RXM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I took a commission after that and joined the Fleet Air Arm as a helicopter pilot. I was married, had two kids and now have four grandchildren and one great grandson. I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask.

When her stepfather, Angus McCairn, demands that  Temperance move to Scotland to begin a more proper life, she is stuck. Dependent  on his control of her money, Temperance moves to Scotland but makes his life a  circus of women's committees and good works. To distract her, Angus makes an  irresistible offer--once she has found a wife for his reclusive nephew, James,  she may return to New York with a modest stipend. Temperance agrees, and heads  for the remote laird.Once Temperance arrives, however, she realizes that the challenge of finding  James a wife is equally as intimidating as the prospect of cleaning up a  tenement. The house is in shambles, the local town depressed, and his welcome  perfectly horrible. Faced with this task or the return to her stepfather,  Temperance digs in and focuses all her energies on making James presentable and  finding a willing bride. Impressed by her tenacity, James begins to care for  her, and it looks like the search for a wife may be over, if Temperance  agrees.Temperance is the heroine we've been waiting for. The descendent of Jane  Austen's women, she is smart, passionate, liberated, and true to her own ideals.  While at the denouement of most stories the heroine melts into a slushy pile of  self-contradictions, Deveraux's character stands strong in her convictions and  wins the respect of the readers, if not her fellow characters. Just like the  readers, romance heroines are securing the man, the fortune, and the good ending  through the quality of their characters, and not by the leverage of their  charms. Temperance is the hero that we all want to be, and Jude Deveraux's work  is an entertaining medium for inspiration.--Nancy R.E.

He was subsequently head hunted for a division of Siemens where he was tasked with business development in the former USSR, the Middle East and Africa. Hetman was Alex's first novel and took twelve years to complete. Published in 2009 it gained critical acclaim in the 2010 Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award (ABNA) and later became a #1 UK Kindle bestseller. Cold Black was published a year later. It followed the success of Hetman, gaining critical acclaim in ABNA 2011 and rose to #6 in the Kindle UK bestseller list. Both books have also now become top 10 Kindle Bestsellers in the USA. In July 2012 Cold Black became a #1 German Kindle bestseller; Hetman reached #4 in April.  The third Aidan Snow thriller will be released later this year. When not writing Alex works as a freelance consultant (clients include the UN), dividing his time between his two homes in Kyiv, Ukraine and West Sussex, England.

She was born in 1928 on a small farm and ranch in rural Texas. That means she experienced the Great Depression up close and personal, World War II, the Korean War, and Vietnam. She watched as the civil rights movement unfolded, and she grew up hearing about how women only gained the right to vote nationwide shortly before she was born. She left the farm life to go to the big city where she modeled and later ran her own interior decorating business. She raised five children whom she taught to believe they could achieve anything they set their minds to. Instead of retiring, she moved into her next career where she explored her artistic side and she created beautiful high-end ceramic dolls. Her faith and love of family have seen her through her fair share of crises. She faced financial hardship at times in her life, personal challenges, and even a bout with breast cancer that she fought back against with courage and a strong inner conviction to become a survivor, not a victim. These perspectives from country life, hardship, changing civil rights, and perseverance are reflected in her stories which are also peppered liberally with family love, taking care of one another, inner strength and courage. Some might call her opinionated; some say it's strong convictions; and many (lovingly) know that it's not a coincidence that one of her favorite characters is a mule :-)", "related": ["B008N9AI20"], "rank": 4819743, "title": "Adventures of Alec and Friends", "author": "Pauline Taite", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Told as a series of flashbacks, the novel vivifies the evolution of a nameless poet from an ambitious, back-stabbing academic to a sodden versifier for hire. From an early age, he possesses the unusual ability to channel poems, which come to him like a parade of ghosts. He has to shove the verse back in graduate school in order to get any work done and is 10 years into his marriage, on the tenure track, with a major book behind him, when his poetry dries up. He begins sleeping with other women, then starts drinking, and pretty soon, he is hardly in the classroom at all; he becomes mired in an endless cycle of poetry-book tours, alcohol, and sex. Satirizing the ruthless competitiveness of academia, poetic trends, marriage, indeed too many topics to recount, this novel also works as portrait of a poet's pathetic slide into despair. Darkly comic and compelling fiction.Joanne WilkinsonCopyright © American Library Association.

Through it all, he continued to write columns on a range of subjects - politics, cricket, literature, humour and sport - for a range of publications in India and abroad.

Time passed. She married, moved to west London, and had a daughter. She continued to write, and had a small book or two on countryside and nature subjects published. She worked for many years as a desktop publisher for Surrey County Council, and as a tutor in adult education.  And then, one day, she visited a friend who had just moved to the Isle of Portland, Dorset, and fell in love with the place. She has now lived in the Weymouth and Portland area for eight years, and still loves it. The wonderful Jurassic Coast, and Portland in particular, were the inspiration for her first novel, Isle of Larus.  Kathy also sings with, and writes lyrics for, the Island Voices Choir on Portland, and is a keen member of local writing groups, as well as enjoying studying the local flora.", "related": ["B00D0BK0EW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It begins ominously: 12-year-old Mitsuki Koyama, an orphan living with her repressive grandmother, must have an operation to remove her vocal cords, due to a malignant growth. Yet Mitsuki refuses, because her dream is to become a professional singer. Mitsuki is even visited by two death spirits, Takuto and Meroko, who inform her she has only a year to live. But the two spirits, once human themselves, are hardly frightening (Meroko even wears bunny ears to amuse children) and Takuto decides to help Mitsuki realize her goal. He transforms her into a healthy 16-year-old, who takes the name \"Full Moon\" and begins her rapid rise to pop music stardom. A romantic tangle between the three and Eichi, Mitsuki's long-lost boyfriend, also ensues. Tanemura draws cute kids in conventional big-eyed manga style, though occasionally she creates romantic images of striking beauty, and her manic layouts drive the story forward. There is little to interest adults here, but girl tweens should identify with Mitsuki's ambitions and romantic dilemmas. (July)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This is an important question to ask, because knowing how to avoid BS is an essential skill to acquire. There are a large number of \"experts\" trying to sell you get rich quick schemes, sure-fire methods to earn-more-while-doing-less, and variations of scams that go back to the beginning of time. If the world's oldest profession was the first iteration of freelancing, the second oldest profession was consulting for them. If you come across anyone proclaiming to be an expert, a guru, a wizard or whatever self-imposed title they've created - run away.I am a freelancer. I've been doing it for a few years and have written for some of the sites you might already be reading: Freelanceswitch.com; Workawesome.com; Donanza.com; and way too infrequently, my own blog, Brandscaping.ca. These are the most notable, but I want to be clear - I am not claiming to be an expert. I love what I do and I love working with the clients I've acquired. This has helped me bring in a comfortable income, but it's not a get-rich-quick gig. I traded my 9am - 5pm job for a 5am - 9pm workday, but being your own boss is a thrill like no other.  It demands hard work and requires you to keep the promises you've made to your clients, but if you're willing to put the effort into it, freelancing is much more than something you do while you're waiting for a real job. It's a career choice, and more and more people like you are making this decision every day. When you're ready to put a price on your talent, you're ready to start freelancing.  I've written this book based on the lessons I've learned, and I hope you find them useful for your career.I chose The Fortunate Freelancer as the moniker for this book because I've been told by other freelancers that I'm \"lucky\": I'm lucky that I have great clients; I'm lucky that I get to charge the rates I've set; I'm lucky to have a supportive wife. They're right, I am lucky, and I'm grateful to be fortunate in these areas, but it wasn't an accident. Before I made the jump to fulltime freelancing, I was working early mornings before I went to my real job, and then again once I got home. I continually refined my pitch in order to get new clients, and once I was confident I could consistently bring in new work, I became a fulltime freelancer.I went to networking events to meet the people in my community, and I engaged with them to learn more about their needs, the needs of our community, and how I could help with both. I asked my clients what they wanted and when they needed it, and then I gave it to them, but I also offered my expert advice when I saw opportunities that could help their business. Instead of waiting for opportunity to knock, I opened the door and met him as he was walking down my street (yes, that's a terrible analogy, sorry.)So yes, I'm lucky, but by working hard, working smart, and doing what's best for your clients, you can make your own luck too.", "related": ["B00HT9JGS2"], "rank": 3753874, "title": "The Fortunate Freelancer (Make Your Own Luck Book 1) eBook", "author": "Jason Finnerty", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Unlike traditional true crime\nbooks, Denele Campbell is fully aware that she is breaking the mold as\nthis is a story where the crime really is a victimless one -- at no time\nwas Campbell accused of forcing his \"victims\" -- and chronicles an\noverzealous criminal justice system intent on policing morals rather\nthan laws.Although true crime enthusiasts may wince at the structure of this\nstory, Denele Campbell constructs the story of John William Campbell\nwith surgical precision. It is important to A Crime Unfit To Be Named to\n understand the family and their prominence within Fayetteville, as well\n as the seeming progressive thinking exhibited in the decades leading up\n to Campbell's arrest and prosecution. Since no actual crime took place,\n this story is focused more on the zealotry of the prosecutor's office\nas well as the accepted social norms of the time, which Campbell\nviolated by engaging in (unnatural) sexual acts with a black woman. Told\n through court transcripts, medical documents, and the author's own\nresearch, any reader will find the tale of John William Campbell quite\nintriguing, never mind the money, resources, and time put forth to\nconvict and imprison a man, not of sodomy as we understand it today and\nthe way medical professionals understood it in 1949, but of engaging in\noral sex.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Today, however, the nuclear enterprise faces new and increasingly difficult challenges. It is imperative that nuclear enterprise leaders create a culture of safety in all levels of nuclear operations implemented by a team of technical and managerial talent with full accountability and proper priorities. InThe Nuclear Enterprise, a panel of expert contributors offers its views on the risks posed by nuclear weapons and nuclear power and the possibilities for reducing these risks globally, focusing specifically on issues of safety, regulation, and public perception.The authors, all specialists on various aspects of this challenging topic, begin with a discussion of safety issues surrounding nuclear weapons. They point out the superb safety record of the US nuclear weapons program since 1945 but caution that we are still working our way through safety challenges that were made more difficult by design decisions taken to meet military requirements set during the height of the Cold War. They then discuss nuclear reactor safety, including what to do with high-level radioactive waste, how to face the challenge of internationalizing the process of ensuring reactor safety around the world, and more. In their discussion of economic and regulatory issues, they focus on the importance of establishing and maintaining an independent authority protected from regulatory capture by either the government or the industry being regulated. The book concludes with an exploration of media and public policy issues, discussing how insights gained from the preceding chapters might be used to inform and raise public and governmental discussions regarding the nuclear enterprise in the energy and weapons arenas.The risk posed by the nuclear enterprise of weapons and civilian power plants is unique in its enormity.  Successful leadership in national security policy will require a continuous, diligent, and multinational assessment of newly emerging risks and consequences.", "related": [], "rank": 2901770, "title": "Sidney D.

Surviving on only organic fruits and vegetables, he enjoys writing, spending time with friends and family, and the many freedoms a simple life has bestowed upon him. In short, Peter is a writer, thinker, and experimenter in the fundamentals of life, whether that be in hydration or gender roles and sexual attraction. Above all else, he believes in individual responsibility, comfortability with self and other, and the absolute necessity of both doubt and risk--two things he actively encourages when it comes to you and his own works and beliefs.

In short order, Ben McCarthy, new partner in the respected portfolio-management firm of Canning & McCarthy, confronts a rash of problems: the burglary of the firm's office (although nothing seems to have been stolen); the disappearance of wise, cautious senior partner Jack Canning; and the discovery that Jack seems to have invested heavily and uncharacteristically in a near-bankrupt company whose stock suddenly shoots up at rumors of a takeover bid. The likelihood of SEC insider-trading charges almost ruins the firm; a broker friend of Canning's is murdered; the West Village townhouse Ben shares with his artist wife is vandalized. And all that is just for starters. Likable Ben uses wits and courage to thwart his unknown tormentors, attempting to spoil the coup he suspects they're planning. The wild rise of the ticker tape in the penultimate scene adds a suspenseful climax to this satisfying tale.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I read them, no, I swallowed them whole, sat back and began to rethink my entire life. Her books saved my life and for that I ll forever be grateful. Besides being a pioneer of Aspergers awareness, Aston is a wonderful writer. The Other Half of Asperger Syndrome (Autism Spectrum Disorder) is a clear, easy to understand page-turner as well as an eye-opener. Since this book was first written, she s worked with hundreds of individuals on the spectrum and stayed abreast of all the latest research which imbues and enriches this 2nd edition. --Rudy Simone, author of Aspergirls, 22 Things a Woman Must Know If She Loves a Man with Asperger's Syndrome and 22 Things a Woman with Asperger's Syndrome Wants Her Partner to KnowIn a comprehensive sweep Maxine Aston manages to cover all the concepts people in AS-linked relationships need. Without shying away from tough topics, Aston gives immediately useful advice and research-based guidance. This is the type of book I like to have handy, flipping to a random page to read during tough times since every page of the book is helpful. Aston's upbeat tone and many insights give clarity to the unique issues facing couples as they improve their relationships. --Ashley Stanford, author of Asperger Syndrome and Long-Term Relationships and Troubleshooting Relationships on the Autism SpectrumI highly recommend this rare treasure! Couldn't put it down! Through numerous examples, Aston clearly explains the differences between the Asperger and Non-Asperger partner. She encourages couples not to strive for the impossible but instead to try some of her invaluable insights and tips. A must-read! --Louise Weston, RN. B.

Kenya was a shy daydreamer who used her imagination to create the many stories she was able to see so vividly.  She won local area writing contests that fueled her desire to put those thoughts on paper.  With this new found passion Kenya was able to share her love with the world through writing.  In 2010, Kenya put her pen back to use and began writing her first story destined for the publishing world.  Endless Nights, Kenya’s first novel about a young woman who finds mayhem and madness in the very people she trusts.  Kenya doesn’t conform to one specific genre.  She encompasses the reality of her life.  She keeps the stories as true as they are given to her and lets her readers into her inner self, putting her vulnerability on display.   Kenya moved to Michigan in 2011, with her supportive husband and their two lovely boys, to further her career in writing.  Kenya’s upcoming novels include a children’s book titled, Where’s Daisy?

Athie, the daughter of a brewer, falls in love with Tappuah, the son of a poor livestock farmer. When Athie's brothers find out, they give her a task of servitude to take her mind off this romance to protect her chastity. The twist in the story comes when King Solomon, a rich monarch, sets his eye on Athie and tries to buy her love with promises of wealth and luxury. This is a test of her love for Tapp. Will she stay faithful to Tapp or will she get carried off by the rich monarch, his wealth and the luxuries he has to offer her?All lovers of romance will enjoy this gentle love story. There is a kind of sensuality in the way the romantic scenes between Athie and Tapp have been expressed. The twists and turns and the obstacles that hinder the love of these two young people make the story fast paced and exciting. The language used is exquisite and true to the age it is set in, and the theme is compelling. The cadence in the theme is noteworthy and it gives an interesting atmosphere to the whole tale. The narration is rhythmic and lyrical, which adds to the beauty and sensuality of the story. The right color and movement added to the plot has enhanced the vivid images that author has portrayed.", "related": ["B007QQDSGE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
