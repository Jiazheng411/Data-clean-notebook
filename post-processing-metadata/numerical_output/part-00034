Lady Talia resides at Carrisford Castle, which, unfortunately, is a strategic prize in King Stephen's endless wars. Six warlords have ravished it while trying to take flame-haired Talia to the altar by force, and each time, she has evaded marriage and gotten away with it-until Alex de Monteneau rides in proclaiming to be her new guardian and lord. Her first act is to hit Alex over the head, and her first words are that she will never marry him. Sparks flare quickly between the combatant pair, especially when Alex tries to force Talia to marry a man of his choosing. Predictably, he falls for the fiery termagant himself, but war stands between them, a war that Talia hopes to escape and which Alex, the King's man, cannot avoid. Needham's characterizations are inconsistent at times-as when King Stephen, sounding like a modern-day aristocrat, says, \"Blazes, Alex!

Her lungs burned as she dragged air into them. The sound of her heart pounding thundered in her ears like the roar of a powerful storm.Just another nightmare. I'm safe in my bedroom.But the thought didn't assuage the terror that constricted her chest as if she were standing in front of the altar right now. She could still see the red stain fanning outward on her fiancé's snowy-white shirt, and Gregory's hand reaching out to her. The screams in the church resounded through her mind. The scent of her fiancé's blood filled her nostrils as though she were still holding his body clutched to her.Will I ever be free of the memories, Lord?She raked a wavering hand through her sweat-damp hair, then reached for the lamp on her bedside table. After two failed attempts, she finally managed to pull the chain, and a soft glow flooded the black recesses of her room. But her mind still remained in the clutch of darkness, had since the day her fiancé had been murdered right in front of her two years ago.Glancing at her clock, she noted the time and realized she'd only gotten a few hours of sleep. She flipped back the sheet and climbed from the bed. She might as well work since she had to get up early anyway to drive from Albuquerque to her meeting in nearby Santa Maria Pueblo this morning.Thankfully she had something to concentrate on other than her past. She could do nothing about what had happened, but she could prove her theory was right, hopefully with the help of Zach Collier's cousin. If not she would find another way. Her job at the college depended on it.Hawke Lonechief finished the dregs of his coffee and motioned for Anna, the owner of the café and his cousin, to refill it. \"I'm gonna need it this morning.\"\"Another all-nighter?\"\"How can you tell?\" Hawke took a tentative sip of the black brew, relishing its strong flavor, just the way he liked it, no sugar, no cream.\"Cousin, we grew up together. I know when you haven't gotten any sleep. Do you ever see your mother?\"\"Sure, we had dinner together two nights ago.\" And his mother had basically read him the riot act, although in her case it was mainly said with her usual few words. She was worried about him. But, for him, working held the haunting memories at bay.\"You're the chief of police, so why are you doing everything down at the station? What are the other officers for?\"Hawk shrugged. \"What's wrong with working?\"\"Nothing, if in moderation. But you don't know the meaning of the word.\"He grinned. \"Sure I do. It means steering clear of any excesses. I don't have time for excesses.\"\"You don't call nearly living at the station an excess?\"She fluttered her hand in the air. \"Nope. Don't answer that. I never could change your mind while we were growing up. I don't know why I even waste my breath trying to now.\"\"I'm responsible for the safety and well-being of thousands of people. I don't take that responsibility lightly.\"\"And you shouldn't, but what about your mother? Have you left Aunt Evelyn to fend for herself on the ranch?\"Stung by the rebuke of his well-meaning cousin, Hawke straightened in the booth and cupped the mug between his hands while he drank some more coffee. \"Charlie's wife got sick. Somebody had to take care of his small children. I couldn't ask him to take his usual shift last night.\"Anna wagged her head. \"There's always something with you. Go home. Get some sleep.\" She sent him a quizzical look. \"You are going home, aren't you?\"\"Yes, I am as soon as I meet with someone. Then home it is.\"\"Good, because that ranch is too much for Aunt Evelyn alone.\"\"That's why I hired some more help.\"\"Who?\"\"Lighthorse's oldest son, John.\"\"Good. He's reliable. She needs someone who is.\"\"Ouch.\" The persistent reproach in Anna's voice needled Hawke. \"As I told you, I have responsibilities I can't shirk.\"\"I know and we appreciate it. Crime is down at the pueblo since you took over as police chief. But we both know what this is really about.\"The door to the café opened, and a petite woman with long blond hair tied back in a ponytail entered. Hawke zeroed in on her, rather than continue the conversation, because there was no way he would get into a discussion with Anna aboutthat.The attractive woman scanned the tables and booths until she found him and then immediately headed in his direction. As he watched her move with assurance and economy, alarm bells—bells he usually listened to—went off in his mind. What had possessed him to agree to meet with this woman? He should have told his cousin Zach no.Behind the pleasing features, he glimpsed a woman on a mission. The determined set to her chin and the focused look in her blue eyes alerted him to be wary. He didn't need trouble. He'd had enough of that to last him two lifetimes.Exhausted from no sleep in twenty-four hours, Hawke tried to paste a semblance of a smile on his face in greeting. Once he made a commitment, he didn't back out no matter how much he wanted to. The corners of his mouth twitched in protest. He gave up and rose instead.\"Dr. Kit Sinclair?\"\"Yes. You must be Zach's cousin, Hawke Lonechief.\" She grinned and took his hand to shake.The brief, firm exchange didn't relieve the tension building in his gut. He waved his arm toward the seat across from him. \"Please, sit.\"After she slipped into the booth, Anna, who had been hovering on the side observing the meeting with more interest than Hawke would like, approached. \"What can I get for you?\"\"I've heard great things about your coffee here at the café from Zach Collier. That's all I need.\"That and the man across from me to agree to be my guide to Desolation Canyon.\"You know Zach?\"\"I'm a professor of history at Albuquerque City College. We have worked together on a few projects.\"\"Science and history working together?\" The waitress poured a mug full of the wonderfully fragrant coffee.\"Thank you.\" Kit lifted the cup to her mouth and drew in a deep breath of the aroma, one of the best smells in the world, especially since she tried to avoid sleeping as much as possible. She could use the whole pot after last night. \"I helped Zach with some of the history behind his Aztec codices, at least the part that involved the Spanish conquistadors. That's one of my specialties.\"Normally she wouldn't go into so much detail except that she wanted the man across from her to know the information. Zach had told her Hawke Lonechief was the best person to help her, possibly the only one. He knew every square foot of Santa Maria Pueblo, and he could survive where most people couldn't. The place she wanted to go to wasn't called Desolation Canyon without reason. It was a hard, rough, barren land.Like your life.The thought came unbidden into her mind. She shoved it away.After the waitress left, Kit lounged back against the cushion, trying to relax her taut muscles. Even running through the mental relaxation technique a friend had taught her did nothing to alleviate the stress mounting in her as she got closer to discovering if her theory was right or not. Nor was imagining herself on top of a mountain, looking out over a beautiful vista right before the sun went down doing the trick—not when dark-brown eyes studied her with an intensity that stole her breath, her composure.She did her own survey of the man. He was dressed in tan slacks and shirt with an emblem indicating he was a tribal police officer. His short black hair surprised her. She had pictured him with long hair on the hour drive from Albuquerque. What else would surprise her?\"Now that we have finished sizing each other up, why do you need a guide? Zach didn't tell me much. Just that you two worked together and you were a friend.\" Hawke finished his coffee and set it on the table.Direct. She liked that. \"I'm looking for evidence of the Lost City of Gold.\"\"Who isn't? But at Santa Maria Pueblo? I don't think so.\"The territorial tone of his voice warned her this might not be an easy sell. \"I think there was a lot of truth to the legend that sent Coronado all over the Southwest looking for it. Working with Zach, and what I discovered while in Spain researching the topic for my dissertation, has only reinforced my conviction, which has grown the past several years.\"One corner of Hawke's mouth hitched up. \"Sure. Who wouldn't want to find a place so full of gold that all your worries would be taken care of.\"She stiffened at his mocking tone, but she realized that after all this time the tale did sound far-fetched. \"I think there was a place that prompted the legend, but I'm not saying it exists today as it did five hundred years ago or that it was as grand as the story said. If it did, it probably would have been discovered.\"He folded his arms on the table and leaned forward. \"Do you make it a habit to go around telling people you're looking for the Lost City of Gold?\"\"No,\" she said with a chuckle. \"They would think I was mad.\"\"Are you?\"\"No. Sorry to disappoint you. I'm perfectly sane. But I need a guide, and Zach said you were the best, that you helped him and Maggie last year with the Aztec codices. I trust Zach's opinion.\"\"So you trust me?\"\"Yes.\" Did she have a choice?\"You shouldn't.\" His almost-black gaze drilled into her. \"If there is a City of Gold out there and you're looking for it, I wouldn't trust anyone. People do a lot of nasty things for money.\"\"To put your mind at rest, I haven't advertised the fact in the Albuquerque newspaper.\"\"That's comforting, because after what Zach, Maggie and I, to a lesser degree, went through last year because of the codices, I would hate to see that happen to you.\"She inclined her head. \"I'm touched by your concern.\"\"If something happened to you at Santa Maria Pueblo, I would have to deal with it.That'smy job, not being a tour guide.\"His use of the wordtourstung Kit. \"I wouldn't require much of your time.

Using her own experience of moving to an unsettled village in Michigan in the 1830s, Caroline Kirkland not only describes the life and times of individuals immersed in the growth and establishment of a community, but she also subtly imbues her text with a sophisticated cultural criticism. As a displaced Easterner and a newly identified Westerner, writing under the name \"Mary Clavers,\" she describes mud holes, drunken husbands, local politics, and Victorian American values in her witty and often sharply ironic voice: \"I should be disposed to recommend a course of Michigan to the Sybarites, the puny exquisites, the world-worn and sated Epicureans of our cities. If I mistake not, they would make surprising advances in philosophy in the course of a few months' training.\" The idea for her regional description of village life was sparked when her friends responded enthusiastically to the letters she was posting from Pickney, Michigan, renamed in the book Montacute. When the book was published, however, she found that her satirizations of her neighbors' clothing, habits, romantic illusions, and gender conventions got her in so much trouble with her small community that she vowed she would never be so honest in her writing again.-- For great reviews of books for girls, check outLet's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14. --From500 Great Books by Women; review by Leslie Thompson-Scott", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In his family, reading often replaced the television as entertainment and from an early age literature was an integral part of his life. He graduated from the University of Memphis with a degree in Political Science in 1980. The next couple of years he spent several months skiing many of the resorts in the West and through good fortune managed to survive a few winter mountaineering and climbing adventures along the way. Life has a funny way of changing dreams, and for the next twenty years, most of his adventures were confined to raising a family with three children and traveling the country as a corporate citizen. Most Monday mornings would find him waiting in an airport buying the latest Tom Clancy or Lee Child novel. After reading thousands of geopolitical thrillers through the years, Zack turned his dream of writing a novel into a reality that was five years in the making and wrote the first in a series of Ryan Black novels, CRESCENT RISING.

He was promoted to Master Sergeant, Chief of Detail Section, \"A\" Battery, 936th Field Artillery Battalion, and Arkansas National Guard, two months following his nineteenth birthday. He might have been the youngest Master Sergeant in Korea, if not the entire army.

Jefferson Nighthawk, the first and original Widowmaker of previous Resnick series, has long been retired and wants to quite literally cultivate his garden. His immediate clone, Jason Newman, is thinking of retiring under a new identity and emulating him. Jeff Nighthawk, clone of Jason, hence clone of Jefferson, is a crusader determined to protect the weak and the innocent regardless of incidental moral ambiguities--and Jason knows too much about moral ambiguities to let that pass unquestioned or unfought. Yet all three come to something of an uneasy truce, thanks to said alien menace. Resnick's usual gifts for hard-boiled space opera, including even plausible future weaponry and not too much cynicism, keep things humming toward an ending indicating possible sequels.Roland GreenCopyright © American Library Association.

Instead of approaching the subject from a single narrow perspective, the author takes readers on a far-ranging philosophical journey aimed at changing the way mainstream America thinks about our planet. It is an eye-opening discussion that will likely lead to some serious introspection about our world, the role the reader plays in it, and the manner in which humans abuse it. Rogers begins with a broad discussion of humans and their relationship to environmental problems, pointing out that, \"we cannot make ethical decisions by ignoring all but one of the species on earth and by ignoring how things function in this ancient place nor by ignoring how our behaviors affect other species, societies, and ecologies around the globe.\" Her discussion of \"obligate consumption,\" out of control spending, the widespread corporate focus on quarterly earnings, and planned obsolescence, each of which damages the planet in some way, unfortunately rings all too true. The second section of this book is an attempt to \"rethink core issues\" in preparation for a different way of contemplating the earth's problems. Rogers says it is the responsibility of humans to \"live by nature's operational rules\" which embrace diversity and use \"information rather than brute force to solve problems.\" This section naturally flows into the next part. This is the bulk of the book, and it addresses the numerous challenges faced by mankind. Here Rogers covers such diverse areas as the over-fishing of the oceans, the use and abuse of land, humans' unhealthy reliance on corn, the condition of the world's soil and water, poverty, and war, which she labels a \"uniquely human practice\" and \"an abuse of ethical/moral behavior.\" Finally, in section four, the author talks about how humans can achieve \"freedom and prosperity.\" Rogers suggests such strategies as \"de-cluttering your life,\" living close to where you work, purchasing Energy Star appliances, and eating \"only those varieties of food that grow or live nearest to our homes.\" By the end of Thinking Green, Rogers recognizes that readers may be more overwhelmed than encouraged. \"It's easy to feel depressed and lose hope when we think about the severity of our social, economic, and environmental problems,\" she writes. \"But doing nothing is guaranteed failure.\" That, it seems, is the very point of the book. In Thinking Green, Rogers gives readers the background, perspective, tools, and hopefully the courage to do something daringly different--and potentially, to help change the relationship humans have with this very precious, very fragile planet.Barry Silverstein --ForeWord Clarion Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Even a strong wind on a sunny day could send me scurrying for cover, let alone seeing lightening and hearing thunder. I was frightened; I needed something to not exactly take away the fear but to at least change it. That need was filled one day in November, 1955:I was watching television; I don't remember if it was a commercial, a news story, a trailor for a movie, or what. What I \"do\" remember was seeing a formation of bombers coming toward me and the words \"...could be anywhere in the United States...\"--What the hell? I saw and heard and remembered only what a ten-year-old would see, hear, and remember. After that, any plane in the sky renewed this memory of 'anywhere in the United States.' I particularly remember seeing a benign Piper Cub turn toward me and all I saw was the body of the plane and a thin line of its wings. To me an attack position.Eventually these fears settled down but I never completely lost that fear of weather; I did, however, develop an interest in planes, war, and, of course--in the fifties--nuclear war. I remember once at my one-room country school house when a jet went over and broke the sound barrier, which produced a sonic boom, which brought from a frightened classmate, \"God, don't drop a bomb!\"From the fifties deep into the eighties we lived in fear of nuclear war; the nineties brought treaties that lessened that threat. However, the bombs still remained and the missiles still waited in their silos, ready to go on just a few minutes warning, which finally inspired this novel.I was living and working in Grand Forks, North Dakota, at the time, when it still was home to the Strategic Air Command (SAC): a cluster of missile silos and a fleet of B-52 bombers and their tankers. With the same armament at Minot, a sister city farther west, North Dakota at the time was considered the third largest nuclear power in the world. Today, thanks to those nineties treaties, we in North Dakota have lost that ranking. A sigh of relief to some, to others...?But when I lived there, yes, I was smack dab too close to too many, major, bulls-eyes.One day I stopped on US Highway #2 next to the Grand Forks AFB just as one of those \"lumbering\" B52s was taking off. From the north it would cross the highway as it gained altitude. I was impressed, but was allowed only that one witnessing as the air force police soon came out and told me to \"move along.\"Anyway, during reasearch and the writing of the first draft, I experienced several nuclear nightmares, sometimes night after night (which somehow I was able to remember in the morning, write down a description, and relocate to my main character's nightmares.) Also, at that time, there was a popular song that concluded with a whining, piercing, guitar, a sound that--in a sleep state--could be easily mistaken for a siren. Often I would leave the radio playing as I drifted off to sleep. On one particular night I--in that \"sleep state\"--awoke to that piercing guitar and I thought, \"This is it.\" And for one long moment I lay there waiting for the nuclear explosion that I wouldn't even hear before vaporization...And then, thank God, the song ended.", "related": [], "rank": 1687587, "title": "Winter in July: The Doomsday Clock is ticking.

The 'Other Data' found in this book will spark the necessary inquiry to surface the roots of these challenges and ultimately lead to the elimination of inequitable outcomes plaguing our schools. Equity warriors everywhere will find this useful resource packed with effective strategies, user-friendly processes, and helpful tools.\" (Jennifer Frentress, Director of Teaching and Learning 2010-04-20)\"This book provides numerous and explicit examples of ways to use hidden data to reveal the other truths behind student achievement and to inform decision-making processes. The authors spell out for practitioners the 'So what?' and 'What now?' aspects that many practitioners find challenging after analyzing data. I highly recommend this book for teachers, counselors, site and district administrators, parents, and any other stakeholders interested in using data as a tool to identify gaps in access and opportunities for success in school and beyond.\"(Tonia Causey-Bush, Director of Research, Evaluation, and Accountability 2010-04-06)“This easily digestible guide takes a real-world approach at revealing the truth behind student and school assessments.

Bentley, Assistant Professor of Educational Psychology 2010-05-03)\"This volume provides an energizing alternative to accounts that press for even more attention to numbers. The ‘wallpaper’ metaphor offers powerful suggestions for uncovering inequities, and the rich portrayals offer words of advice to those who care about the education of our nation’s children.\" (Robert Calfee, Professor Emeritus 2010-05-07)\"My teachers and I have used Dr. Johnson’s previous work to dramatically increase student outcomes at the elementary and high school level. Data Strategies recognizes the complexity of the context of student learning and how effective schools use more than just “snap shot” data sources to reveal what impacts student learning the most in your specific school. Data Strategies gives real-world examples and step-by-step strategies for involving students, families, teachers, and principals in culturally responsive leadership. Using data to uncover inequities in our schools is a powerful, transformative, and critical strategy for the long-term success of all our children. Data Strategies provides hope for all our schools in a compelling, thoughtful way.\"(Deborah Peterson, Retired Principal 2010-04-16)\"Dr. Johnson brings together compelling evidence to create understanding and urgency around improving learning for ALL students. The book's case studies and charts provide undeniable evidence that disparities do exist, but also offer hope through powerful real-life success stories.\"(Sara Arispe, Executive Director, Accountability and Data Quality 2010-05-20)\"Schools can’t make up for the fact that we as a society have left many of our children behind. But schools can make a difference for a lot more children than they currently do. Ruth Johnson and Robin Avelar La Salle provide a comprehensive overview of how to use data to provoke questions that lead to the kind of quality education that all students deserve. This book should be required reading in every school district.\"(Gary Anderson, Professor 2010-04-20)\"It serves as a valuable resource for educational leaders striving to be both fluent with accountability discourse and sophisticated in tackling educational inequities. Rather than denouncing what is weak, Johnson and La Salle provide guidance to help educators take seriously their obligation to craft effective teaching and learning environments and to do so with transparency and aplomb.\"(Martin ScanlanThe Journal of Educational Research, 20122012-05-01)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Danto may be one of the few critics whose work reads better in book form than as a journalistic review. His critical judgments are often less ends in themselves than jumping off points for explorations of particularly vexing problems in aesthetics, threaded through with references to art and philosophy classics, all of it undertaken in clear language and with an even, appreciative tone. In these 40-plus pieces, each of which is six to eight pages long, Danto covers younger artists like John Currin and Renee Cox; older living masters like Gerhard Richter and Sol LeWitt; New York School artists like Philip Guston and Joan Mitchell, whose reputations are still settling; and Modernist masters like Malevich, Giacometti and Picasso. Given an art scene and museum world driven to a great extent by power, glitz and internecine politics, Danto's reflective approach can be a welcome respite for insiders and a friendly introduction to aesthetics as it continues to play out in real time.

Some characters I love, some I hate and some I'm not sure what to think  of. Ardis the warrior is perhaps the foremost. But I do know that I want to know more. I enjoyed this book a great deal. I would highly recommend it. Reviewed by Kathryn Bennett for Readers' Favorite\"5 out of 5! Patricia C Lee's new book, \"Destiny's Past\", is a fascinating mystery. It stars when Kelly is about to perform an autopsy and realizes the corpse is still breathing! Next she finds out the corpse, Jarek, is from  2000 years in the past.

Chief Supt. Colin Harpur and Asst. Chief Constable Desmond Iles (after 2007'sGirls). Harpur and Iles's criminal nemeses, Mansel Shale and Ralph Ember, share control of the drug trade in their unnamed British port city, which is just fine with Iles so long as their business is conducted without too much violence. When Hilaire Wilfrid Chandor announces his intention of getting a piece of the pie by leaving a body in Manse's house and stealing his art collection, all parties go on alert for Manse's response. Nothing appears hidden from either crooks or cops, who often echo each other's thinking. Meryl Goss, who comes from London determined to find her boyfriend (Graham Trove, the mysterious body left in Manse's home), provides an extra catalyst to the drama. The cynical charm of James's mysteries is evident, from Chandor's bizarre calling card to the rough justice of the ending.(Sept.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For too many years, she'd been a good princess, behaving as was expected of her, careful not to make waves in the family or do anything that might result in a scandal. After all, her brother, Cameron, had created more than enough of those.But time was running out and if she had any hope of taking control of her life and her future, she had to make a move. And she knew she would never have a better opportunity than tonight's masquerade ball.What better way for a princess to shed the restrictions inherent to her title and all of her own personal inhibitions than to be someone else—at least for one night?Still, she couldn't deny that she was nervous. Actually, she was more than nervous—she was terrified. But she was also determined.She hadn't planned to be a twenty-eight-year-old virgin. As a teenager experiencing the first stirrings of physical attraction, she'd been cautious. Not that she'd thought of her virginity as any great prize, but she hadn't been anxious to throw it away, either—especially not with the possibility of a reporter or photographer lurking around every corner.While a lot of her friends boasted about going \"all the way,\" she'd been content to wait, at least until she met someone really special. Unfortunately, that special someone never did cross her path, and now her mother was ready to offer her as a virgin sacrifice to Anthony Volpini, the Duke of Bel-lemoro.Marissa shuddered at the thought. No way was she going to let that happen. She'd shared one brief kiss with Anthony a few years back, and the memory of that lip-lock was not a pleasant one. The prospect of experiencing anything more intimate with the lecherous duke made her skin crawl. So tonight, she was dressed as Juno. And the goddess knew what she wanted.As she made her way toward the ballroom, the elegantly engraved invitation trembled in her fingers. Her first test would be at the door, where her cousin and his wife, Prince Rowan and Princess Lara, would be greeting each and every guest. If she could get past them—No, she wouldn't let herself thinkif.She had to be confident. She had to ignore the butterflies frantically winging around inside her tummy and refuse to think about all the reasons she should abort her plan—and she knew there were many. She couldn't have second thoughts about what she was doing, because if she didn't go through with it tonight, she would forever be a helpless pawn in her mother's unending games.Drawing in a slow, deep breath, she took a step forward as the line of guests advanced. She couldn't help but smile when she caught a glimpse of herself in one of the antique mirrors that lined the halls. She'd worried that her plan would fail, that she would somehow be recognized, but as she curtsied to the prince regent and his wife and neither of them showed so much as a flicker of recognition, her butterflies began to settle.Really, she had nothing to worry about. With the auburn wig, emerald-colored contacts and elaborate mask covering half of her face, her own mother wouldn't be able to identify her. Not to mention that the gold sandals on her feet added a full four inches to her usually petite five-foot-four-inch frame.The one-shoulder toga-style gown hugged her breasts, nipped in at her waist and flowed to the floor with a slit halfway up her thigh on one side. It was more suggestive than revealing, but it made her feel sexy and daring—and nothing at all like the demure and conservative Princess Marissa.She liked sensual fabrics and bright colors, but she didn't often wear them in public. She preferred to blend into the background, unnoticed by the paparazzi that had always shadowed her brother's every move. She'd certainly never worn anything so vibrant and bold, and she knew there was no way she could hide in the background in this outfit. But tonight she didn't want to hide—she wanted to be noticed. She wanted to be wanted.Tonight, \"the prim princess\" was finally going to lose her virginity.Dante Romero hated costume balls. He felt ridiculous enough in the finery he was required to wear for state functions without having to dress up and pretend to be someone else. As if being born a prince hadn't required him to do enough role-playing on a daily basis, he was now trapped in the role of King of Ardena.It was his birthright and his burden, and one he hadn't expected to assume so early. Unfortunately, his father's health had rapidly deteriorated over the past few years to the point that King Benedicto and his advisers—and especially his doctors—had agreed it would be best for the country if he passed the throne to his son. It was a position Dante had been groomed for throughout his entire life, his inescapable destiny.Not that he was looking to escape. He acknowledged and understood his responsibilities to his family, his people and his country. But he was barely thirty-two years old and he'd always thought he'd have more time before he had to accept those responsibilities—more time to be free before he gave his people a queen.But his father had been unrelenting. He hadn't worried too much about his reputation as a playboy prince, but he was the king now and his country needed a queen. He needed a partner to share his life and a mother for his children—the future heirs to the throne.That was one of the primary reasons he was in Tesoro del Mar now—not just to shake a few hands and smile for some photo ops, but to meet Princess Marissa Leandres, the only daughter of the Princess Royal and a cousin of the prince regent. His father was optimistic that he would find the princess \"acceptable enough\" to consider issuing a proposal of marriage, which would go a long way toward strengthening the ties between their respective countries.It was, Dante understood, as good a reason as any for a king to choose a bride. Unlike the childhood song that claimed \"first comes love, then comes marriage,\" Dante knew that it was more likely \"first comes coronation, then comes marriage.\" The official ceremony had taken place only a few weeks earlier, and now the clock was ticking.And so, at his father's insistence, he'd paid a thousand dollars for a ticket to this masquerade ball to benefit the Port Augustine Children's Hospital and dressed himself up like Jupiter, just because Benedicto was certain that Princess Marissa would be in attendance and because he had yet to figure out how to refuse anything his ailing father asked of him.\"She's not unattractive,\" his mother had informed him, although she'd seemed slightly less enthusiastic than her husband about the idea of the Tesorian princess as her son's bride. \"Just a little more conservative than the women you usually date, but she is always stylish and well put together.\"Unwilling to rely on his mother's description, he'd done some research on his own. Finding pictures of the princess hadn't been very difficult—though she wasn't frequently on the covers of the tabloids, she did make public appearances for noteworthy causes. It seemed that the Port Augustine Children's Hospital was one of her favorites.He would agree that she wasn't unattractive. In fact, when he studied her face more closely, he realized that she was actually quite beautiful, if not the type of woman who would ordinarily catch his eye. Medium height, average build, dark hair usually tied back in a braid or secured in a knot at the base of her neck. Her eyes were also dark, her smile as unobtrusive as the rest of her.It shouldn't have been too difficult to pick her out of a crowd, except when the crowd was attired in fancy costumes and elaborate masks. As Dante looked around the ballroom of the royal palace, he realized that he was surrounded by gods and goddesses and various mythological creatures, some that he recognized but many more than he did not. Even the staff were in costume: the waiters as slaves and the security guards as gladiators.It was as if he'd stepped into another world, and he had to give credit to the decorators for their efforts. The boundary of the dance floor was marked by tall Roman-style columns wrapped in green ivy and twinkling lights. Beyond the dance floor were round tables covered in white linen with laurel wreath centerpieces. Marble pedestals topped with busts of ancient philosophers had been placed around the perimeter of the room.Some of the guests were in formal attire and carried simple stick masks as a nod to the theme; others had elaborate costumes and face decorations that ensured they remained anonymous. For Dante, the one benefit of being unrecognizable in his costume was that he'd been able to forgo having bodyguards flanking him as he moved through the crowd.He stepped out of Medusa's path and fought against a smile as she turned to give a blatant once-over to a centaur. He decided that even if he didn't manage to locate Princess Marissa, it wouldn't be a boring night. But he wasn't willing to give up on his mission just yet. He scanned the crowd again, looking for someone who was trying to blend into the background—an observer rather than a participant. The harder he looked, the more convinced he became that his task was futile.And then he saw her.The dress was of the richest emerald where it was gathered at one shoulder, with the color gradually transitioning from green to blue until it became a vivid sapphire at her ankles. Her hair spilled down her back, a luxurious cascade of silky red curls. Enormous hammered-gold earrings dangled from her ears and wide bracelets of the same style glinted at both wrists.Her mask was an elaborate design studded with blue-and-green jewels with a fan of peacock feathers on one side; behind it, her brilliant green eyes ...", "related": [], "rank": 521344, "title": "Royal Holiday Bride (Reigning Men)", "author": "Brenda Harlen", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But somewhere along the way, the 20% of Canadians belonging to public sector unions managed to negotiate bulletproof job security, salaries that far outstrip anything comparable in the private sector, and incredibly generous pensions. The net effect? The way things are set up, many public sector workers will collect more income in retirement than they earned during their working careers.And the 80% of taxpayers who don't belong to a public sector union—most of whom have no true pension at all—get the privilege of paying for it all. Nearly every one of those public sector union pension plans is underfunded to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars, and taxpayers are legally on the hook to make up the difference, as well as any investment losses, until death do us part. How is that fair to anyone?This book will open your eyes to one of the greatest legal asset re-allocations in the history of the world. Some call it pension envy, some call it pension apartheid. We call it a Pension Ponzi plan, an unsustainable funneling of money from one group of Canadians to another. Canadians are being bilked out of their hard-earned money and cheated of secure retirements in order to gold-plate the pensions of those who have engineered the system in their favour.Pension expert Bill Tufts and journalist Lee Fairbanks investigate the history, the present situation and the future repercussions of a system out of control.", "related": [], "rank": 2894150, "title": "Pension Ponzi", "author": "Bill Tufts", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

National Catholic Reporter editor Jones completed the book with Orbis editor Ellsberg. Through quotes from letters, diaries, and personal interviews, a powerful narrative of faith and courage emerges, ranging from the first American Catholic women missionaries to go abroad to today's members. The sisters learned, loved, healed, taught but especially shared the lot, even to death, of those they served. From the carefully edited fragments of personal accounts of work in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the United States, there emerges a realistic picture of a community ceaselessly challenging itself, ever in transition, ever opting to help the poor.

When I taught, all the other teachers were older. When I became a high school principal, everyone on campus, except the kids, was older than I was. I became intrigued with the concept of 'youth' and wondered if there were common difficulties that had been faced by young people through out history. I read and researched the lives of both famous and infamous people in history. Did they face the same issues as I faced? Were there the same types of confrontations then as now?When my youth was long passed and I retired, I helped different school districts as they searched for a candidate to fill the vacancy they had in their district. On one of these assignments I spent a year in Lone Pine, California. I had traveled there on a number of occasions, but this prolonged stay allowed me to get to know some wonderful people. From that experience came the story of Jason and White Feather. Values of honesty, loyalty, and friendship are mentored to a young boy entering his teenage years by a spirit warrior, a father, and a cowboy named Rod.I hope you enjoy the read. The sequel will follow Jason in his journey of life, stay tuned.", "related": ["B00E1XG0QU"], "rank": 3313916, "title": "Jason and Whitefeather", "author": "Dan King", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is joined by a second one and a third until the bowl is brimming with 10 flies. Suddenly the chef, a large lizard, arrives and eats up most of the soup. The bugs flee, but the chef chases them, hoping to have them for dessert. As soon as they leave, a sneaky spider emerges and enjoys \"soup for one.\" The humorous text is brief, with only one rhyming couplet per page. Each verse ends with a number, so the rhymes are fairly predictable, like, \"Oh, good heavens!/Not soup for seven!\" The vocabulary is simple enough for beginning readers, and the novel premise and charming illustrations will keep youngsters engaged. The large text is printed on full-color illustrations. Long's bugs are drawn with simple lines, big round eyes, and lots of personality. The artist uses a clever combination of photo images and digital drawings to create the backgrounds, so the soup spoon and saltine cracker look realistic, while the flies look like cartoons, heightening the humor by the contrast. The simple rhymes and engaging illustrations make this a good pick for those looking for a fresh concept book.-Donna Cardon, Provo City Library, UTα(c) Copyright 2011.

In fact . . . I probably would have become addicted to this book and carried it with me wherever I went; bisexuals let alone teenaged bisexuals get very few reliable toeholds in our society even today. Torn is a brave and memorable achievement in teen fiction. It is unflinching in its accurate depiction of the curious lust for experience that is basically synonymous with being a teenager. The characters delve into drugs, drinking, and sex just as zealously and carelessly as teenagers do in real life, and they careen into the wall of consequences just as hard . . . However, when the characters err in judgment, they get caught and are forced to examine their actions along with their motivations and must somehow make amends. Perhaps most importantly, Torn tackles that complicated identity question of am I bisexual, or [gay or lesbian], or just experimenting? with a huge heart and an honest appraisal, and best yet for bisexuals the answer resounds with hope for teenagers who find themselves genuinely attracted to both sexes . . . Lehman has crafted her characters with such kindness and with such attention to realistic detail that they are easy to become addicted to . . . These are insecure gay, lesbian, and bisexual characters who are fiercely devoted to each other, who hold one another accountable for everything . . . Torn is a page-turner whose ending might possibly astound you.  ----Marilyn Jaye Lewis, Lambda Literary Foundation", "related": ["B00DPKXZXQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 4.5556, "rating_total": 41.0}

Add to the mix the cultural differences between a Mexican healer brought up among the Apache and a proud Welsh miner determined to be a strong provider for his family, and you have the ingredients of potential disaster.  As inDragon & Hawk, many of the events really happened. The locations are historically researched, and many of the characters Evan and Reyna interact with were real people.  The Jones family saga then continues in Book Three:Dragon's Legacy.", "related": ["B00JXLLAGA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Shortly thereafter, his family uprooted to the suburbs of Long Island, New York, where he attended school up until the middle of his junior year of high school, when his family uprooted yet again to Colorado Springs, Colorado. After working many retail and customer service-related jobs, Ondre took a job as a disc jockey at a local night club, where he met the future mother of his now-thirteen-year-old daughter, Autumn, and where he learned that many jobs are just like high school; only there was a paycheck at the end of the week and a lot more nudity. Later he became general manager at a couple of adult/lingerie shops and got to meet even more interesting characters. Many of these experiences have influenced his writing style and general thoughts on the world and the crazy, self-involved people that inhabit it. Some of his influences include eighties horror flicks, novels by authors such as Thomas Harris, Bret Easton Ellis, Clive Barker, Jeff Lindsay, Chuck Palahniuk, and Jim Carroll, just to name a few. In his spare time he usually takes in a good movie or a bad eighties flick. He likes to read and just travel to new places in general.

What emerges is a lovely portrait of a colorful corner of the country and, more important, a vivid account of a type of intrepid travel experience that sadly no longer exists on the well-traversed European continent.

The story revolves around Laurie, a footloose Australian journalist for a Singapore business magazine who becomes emotionally involved with a top computer salesman and is drawn into his circle of business colleagues. Later, Laurie accepts a job at his rapidly growing computer company, Orion Management Systems, and trails him from the office to his rented flat, trying to get the evasive salesman to commit to her. In the end, though, readers don't much care about the pair's plight or those of the corporate types they work for, because all are equally two-dimensional. Nayman ignores the emotional possibilities of characters this world destroys-Laurie's friend Susan, for instance, a former reporter who is institutionalized. Nor does she devote much attention to the motivation of Laurie herself, who jokes a lot and says things such as ``Marketing strategy. Recommendations therein. Approval necessary. Discussion required.'' Most of this largely superficial book reads this way.Copyright 1995 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 4677852, "title": "Jetlag eBook", "author": "Michele Nayman", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Several years later, in 1999, Loren ended up in Florida where he started a career in Information Technology.     Over time, Loren became disturbed by the reckless manner in which our government was running up the national debt. Despite the lack of fame, fortune or influence, decided to take on the political establishment, rather than watch our economy go up in smoke. With a critical eye, well versed in the art of complex problem solving, Loren probed the ancient knowledge of our founding fathers, in hopes of discovering a solution.     What he found were the stories of Athens, Rome and England--tales in which an endangered people were forced to reassert control over their government. Most shockingly, he discovered the exact same capability built into the Constitution which would allow the American people to reassert control over the federal government! Convinced that this revelation must be shared, Loren packaged this startling discovery in a heart pounding action novel--all in hopes that it would inspire the American people to take action in order to save the United States from economic Armageddon!", "related": ["B008R51O14"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Léon Le Gall is smitten with comely Louise Janvier the moment he sees her riding her rickety bicycle through town. The two begin spending their days together and are soon inseparable. A short time later, they’re caught in artillery fire. Each presumes the other is dead. Ten years later, Léon is living in Paris, a devoted husband with a four-year-old child. Louise, however, is never far from his mind. When he catches a glimpse of her at the train station, a conflict of conscience ensues. Should he stay faithful to his wife and family or follow his heart? He’s tempted to do the latter, as his marriage has grown stale, and his job is driving him mad. Against the brutal backdrop of war, Capus renders a powerful tale of love lost and found. --Allison Block", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The second edition has been updated and revised to be even more useful for students.\"Randolph Tate'sHandbook for Biblical Interpretationis an indispensable reference for any student new to academic biblical studies. I have required the previous edition as a textbook for my biblical hermeneutics classes since its publication. Tate provides just the right amount of information for hundreds of terms that are the working vocabulary of biblical scholarship. The brief bibliographies point to the next level of depth for students ready to investigate further. For those who have been out of seminary for several years, Tate provides longer articles to introduce recent literary and agenda criticisms. No seminarian, seminary graduate, or graduate student of Bible should be without this work.\"--Roger L. Hahn, Nazarene Theological Seminary\"Hermeneutics has become a huge, difficult area in recent years, with a plethora of different methods, schools of thought, and divergent views on how it should be conducted. Tate'sHandbookis an important resource for students and scholars who don't have time to keep up with the various movements and who find themselves confused by current shifts. It is an invaluable resource for serious biblical understanding.\"--Grant R. Osborne, author ofThe Hermeneutical SpiralPraise for the first edition\"This is an extremely helpful reference tool, and Tate deserves the gratitude of scholars, students, and lay readers alike for producing it.\"--Steven L. McKenzie,Review of Biblical Literature\"This is the most complete and up-to-date manual of biblical criticism. Very likely to be the authoritative standard resource on its subject, it is indispensable for everyone who seeks to understand why and how new types of literary criticism are developing into the leading paradigm of biblical studies. Highly recommended.\"--International Review of Biblical Studies\"A helpful tool for beginning students as well as advanced graduates and even professors.

Born in Maine, live now in Maine, grew up here and there. Went to a great high school and a few meh colleges (or maybe they were just meh in comparison). Married in 1995, have three kids, plus various and sundry pets of one species or another. Not enough? Sorry; that's all there is here. Every author starts as a reader, and the same is true for me. Some of first 'real' books I remember are the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov, the Hornblower books by C.S.Forester, and Lad by Albert Payson Terhune. The, ah, let's just say 'eclectic' nature of these first few began a trend that continues today, as I read just about anything. You want a list? Okay. In no order (except as they occur to me): Dan Brown. Robert Heinlein. Stephanie Bond. Dave Barry. Lisa Mantchev. John Ringo. David Weber. Isaac Asimov (yes, still). David R. Palmer. Spider Robinson. Randall Garrett. Frank Herbert. W.E.B. Griffin. Clive Cussler. Gemma Halliday. Is the picture coming into focus? No? Exactly. There's way too many authors out there to limit myself to a single one, or even a single genre, though I do tend to return to science fiction. 'From these seeds did a mighty tree grow.' I've been writing for years, dating back to high school, but only recently have I started getting 'out there' into the world.

She'd parked at the precise angle the kidnapper had requested, followed his every instruction in the ransom note she'd found under her wiper blade the same day he'd been taken. So why hadn't he called yet?Frustrated, she shoved her hands into her coat pockets. Nervous tension turned to moisture on her palms as she clenched and unclenched her fists.\"He'll call,\" she whispered.If he wants the ransom money, he'll call.Cool night air seeped through her coat and raised chill bumps on her skin. She shivered, caught up in the involuntary response that quickly turned to speculation.Maybe Thomas was already dead? Murdered by the brazen kidnapper who 'd taken him at gunpoint from the parking garage in full view of a security camera?A low mechanical stutter dragged her gaze to the west. She heard a rumble she recognized as air brakes on a big rig. Welcoming the distraction, she stared at its two pinpricks of light in the distance, watching the semi crest a shallow rise in the endless ribbon of asphalt she'd used to find this godforsaken rest stop in the desert above Los Angeles—The rasp of the telephone ringing cut through her thoughts.In one heart-stopping motion she yanked the pay phone's receiver from its cradle before it could ring a second time and pulled it to her ear.\"Yes. I'm here.\"\"Listen carefully. I'm only going to say this once.\" The kidnapper's disguised voice modulated over the phone connection. \"Leave the receiver off the hook. Take the money and walk straight out into the desert. Stay in between your headlight beams. Fifty paces out you'll find a hole. Put the case in the hole and cover it with the dirt piled beside it. Come back and I'll tell you where to find him.\"Dragging in an uneven breath, she willed a measure of courage into her bloodstream and straightened her spine.\"How do I know he's still alive? I want proof.\"Dead airspace stretched between her and the man who'd kidnapped her business partner and soon-to-be husband, Thomas Avery, three days ago.\"Fair enough.\" Commotion crackled at the other end of the line, sending anticipation through her body in waves.\"Eve—\"\"Thomas! Thomas, are you—\"\"He's still breathing.\" The man's voice boomed over the connection, barely drowning out a thud in the background. Had he landed something against the side of Thomas's head to shut him up so he could reclaim the phone?\"Don't hurt him!\"\"Shut up and bury the damn money!\"Like a robot operating on a battery charge of fear, she released the handset and felt a tug on her left earlobe as the receiver dropped.A falling glimmer of gold caught in her car lights for a second before disappearing into the darkness on the ground at her feet.Desperation needled her nerves and threatened to undo her composure. It was her earring. A gift from Thomas the day he'd proposed.She stared down at the pea gravel but couldn't pick out the golden hoop. She'd have to find it later, after she'd followed the kidnapper's instructions. After he told her where to find Thomas. Nothing else mattered.She turned and hurried to her car, opened the driver's side door and pressed the trunk release. It would all be over soon. Thomas would be freed. They could go back to their life together. The wedding was less than a month away. She hadn't even gotten the chance to tell him the Paris account he'd worked so hard to broker had come through the day he was taken. Her bridal gown collection would be strutted on fashion runways worldwide, thanks to him.Emotion squeezed her throat shut as she fumbled for the case. She would give him the good news when she had him back.Her fingers trembled as she wrapped them around the handle. She pulled the stainless steel briefcase from the trunk and closed the lid.Half a million dollars in unmarked bills. It seemed like a pittance for a life. She couldn't screw this up. She knew full well the consequences if she didn't do exactly as she was told.People died.People you love died. But not this time. She'd done everything right. No cops. No questions. No witnesses. Just what he'd asked her to do.Her doubts vanished as she made her way out into the desert, walking in a straight line, relying on the glare of the headlights to hold back the darkness and keep her on track.The soil under her feet was soft and sandy, swallowing her steps as she moved deep into the night. The tangy scent of damp sagebrush clung to the air, but it offered little in the way of comfort.A blue-tailed lizard darted from a clump of dry grass and scurried across the path in front of her.Her heart jolted in her chest, drumming against her rib cage, but she fought the urge to jump back. Instead she kept moving, kept pushing forward, counting off the paces stride by stride, pounding down her fear with the beat of each number in her head.At forty-eight she stopped.Searching the ground two feet in front of her she saw a black hole carved out in the desert floor just where he said it would be.Caution pricked her brain, leaving her thoughts to bleed out unchecked. This could end like her half sister Shelly's kidnapping had. In murder, obscured by a trail of unanswered questions.Eve pulled her shoulders back and gained a measure of certainty as she stared out across the desert landscape. Was he watching from somewhere out there? Gauging her level of commitment through a set of night-vision glasses, or goggles or whatever they were called?Well, she wasn't going to disappoint him. She wanted Thomas back. Alive.Stepping forward, she went to her knees, put the briefcase on the ground next to the hole and shoved it in.It clunked against the earthen bottom a couple of feet down. Using her hands, she pushed the gritty soil in, listening to it patter against the rigid case like hard rain. In a matter of minutes she'd filled the hole and smoothed the last mound of dirt over the top. She scrambled to her feet, dusted off her hands and hurried back to the phone.Clutching the receiver, she raised it to her ear. \"I buried the money like you asked. Now, where's Thomas?\"\"Directions to his location are taped to the bottom of the call box.\" A click at the end of the line was chased by a dial tone.Eve's heart skipped a beat as she hung up the handset and slid her open hand, palm side up, into the narrow crevice between the telephone and the metal deck underneath it.Feeling with her fingertips, she located a piece of paper. Crushing it against her palm with her thumb, she pulled it out.Tension locked on every nerve ending in her body as she fumbled to open the folded note. Tipping it toward the headlights, she made out the address at the heart of the crude map. 16800 Pacific Coast Highway. Storm drain two…A glitter of gold on the ground caught her attention. Her earring? She'd almost forgotten about it.Fisting her hand around the map so it wouldn't dissolve, she took a step forward and squatted down to pick up the hoop from its spot in the loose gravel.The semi she'd spotted miles out was on top of her now, vibrating the earth under her feet. Headlight beams flicked across her as the truck rumbled past on the highway a stone's throw away.\"Gotcha.\" Eve hooked the earring with her right index finger and started to straighten.The ear-splitting squeal of rupturing metal penetrated her awareness.Time slowed as a brilliant flash of fire stabbed toward her on the left, sheathed in a deafening roar. Her teeth rattled in her head.The ferocity of the blast hit her full force.Percussion sent her skidding across the gravel like a tumbleweed. Her head slammed into the ground with a sickening thud that resonated to her toes.Pain burned along the left side of her neck and across the top of her shoulder in hot trails of molten heat.Stunned, she gasped for breath, her lungs on fire with the stench of her own singed flesh. Panic dragged her over the edge into an abyss. Darkness folded around her. She blinked, trying to focus her vision.A copper-penny flavor bubbled inside her mouth.Blood?She closed her eyes, struggling to make sense of the last few seconds.An explosion. From the telephone call box?Realization gripped her mind as she digressed into a seizure. She succumbed to the convulsion.There was no fighting the involuntary earthquake ripping through her muscles.The squeal of truck tires locking up on asphalt penetrated the ringing in her eardrums.Hope flooded her senses. She wouldn't die alone tonight. The semi's driver would stop.The seizure dissipated.Going with it, she relaxed into the dust and drifted down into unconsciousness, acutely aware of the golden hoop hooked on the index finger of her right hand and the map crushed in her fist.Who would save Thomas now?Eight months later…J.P. Ryker stared at the west-central Idaho landscape from the helicopter window and followed the direction of pilot Henry Brashear's finger point.\"There it is,\" he said, his voice coming in loud and clear over the bulky headset J.P. wore to drown out the drone of the rotor blades.\"The Bridal Falls Ranch. Homesteaded in 1890 by Miss Brooks's great-grandparents, Parnell and Evelyn Brooks.\"\"Frilly name for such a rugged place,\" he said into the mouthpiece as he sized the mountain peaks jousting for the sky.\"It's named after the landmark Evelyn Brooks discovered.\"\"A waterfall?\"\"Yes.\" He let out an audible breath. \"The prettiest veil of water on the entire mountain, according to every hardy Br...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And with the duchess’ help, Catherine transforms herself from mousy chaperone to the talk of the town. Marks has fun with her characters, their situations, and clever plot twists, creating the ideal escapist read. Readers who enjoyed Miss Quinn’s Quandary (2008) and An Agreeable Arrangement (2009) will scoop up Marks’ third historical romance. --Aleksandra Walker", "related": [], "rank": 321553, "title": "His Lordship's Chaperone", "author": "Shirley Marks", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 20, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 80.0}

Hart has a detailed and accurate understanding of nature which serves as an interesting foil to the action, not a common aspect of books of this sort, and all the more intriguing as a result.

But there was resistance as well.J.M. vividly remembers one or two of his young friends refusing to play with him, claiming he \"always told such big stories.\" Were they lies? Embellishments? J.M. gives a shrug and says, \"They were stories. Fiction. What is fiction but well-told lies with all the trappings? Stories require imagination, in both the hearing and the telling. Those other kids had none. So, I'll let you guess. Who did I feel sorry for; them or me?\"With a grin, he offers, \"Here's a clue. I never grew bored, and the stories only grew larger!\"His early travels took him to quite a number of other states, but he finally settled in Maine, where the rural settings and the locals caught  him by the heartstrings, and there, for 25 years, he lived happily.Due to the devastated Maine economy, J.M. has become a Texas transplant. Though Texas has its good points, J.M. still loves Maine, and still calls himself a Mainer. He  still has a home there, and whenever he can, he steals back to Maine to  write, hike the Appalachian Trail, and of course, to visit his dear friends.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I’ve worked on a farm, herded cows on horseback, chopped cotton, stomped silage, bucked hay bales, plowed fields, and milked cows. I played football, basketball, and went out for track. I liked school despite being bored much of the time.  I finished college on my timeline, adding the electives of getting drunk, experiencing hangovers, and chasing young women. I was tested, ‘short armed’ in El Paso, Texas and rejected for flat feet. Eventually I became a school teacher. I completed a master’s degree, got married (45 years), bought and sold property, raised 3 kids, supported dogs, cats, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, a goat, pigs, horses and cows. I have felled big trees, cleared land, and built fences. I have built different kinds of farm structures.   I’ve traveled across twelve of the western states and lived in six of them. I’ve been an archer, a skier, sailed a boat, and paddled my own canoe. I’ve been a smoker and a drinker. I quit smoking but enjoy a glass of wine now and then. I’ve been in more churches than Carter has pills, studied religions, and been “saved” via sprinkle, splash, and dunk.  Well, I got wet anyway.

It was beautiful, conveying truths, beauties, and\nsorrow of life. Many were lyrical, and held a simple beauty that I truly\nenjoyed...It opened up with World Class Artists, which I\nfound lovely with its subtle, almost lyrical language. It was a nice opening into\nthe book...No One was very bittersweet and lonely, and the verse about\nher looking at the stars reminded me of a poem I wrote for myself. The Truth of the Matter was good, in pointing out how\nmuch truth can be misconstrued by rumor, and that we should do our own\nlistening to what is really going on--or even better, mind our own business.\nLove that little piece of wisdom...What About Us spoke about America's growing need\nto care for itself. I've thought about this for quite awhile. If we drain\nourselves caring for everyone else, how will we adequately tend to ourselves?I could really relate to Close Your Eyes. Just from\nthis poem alone, I'd think the author and I must be soul sisters. We both see\nbeauty in different ways, especially when we close our eyes and open ourselves\nto everything that is around us...I loved List of Some Days. Although not by the same title, I\nhave a list of things I want to do in my life, and I loved reading Shannon's\npoem. Made me think of all I want to do.But oh man, I LOVED The Perfect Costume, covering the\nsubject of the idea of women and beauty in modern thinking. I loved the\npersonal feeling and sense of regret and almost loneliness. But there also\nseemed to be a strength conveyed in the poem. This collection deserves as space on my shelf, and I\nenjoyed reading it.\"Elora Shore, Pendragon blog", "related": ["B00BTHSAW8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The last time I handled it poorly, but I think\nI have found a way to fulfill us both in this regard.\"Michael stiffened, fear filling him once\nmore. Public humiliation wasn't a part of the BDSM world he enjoyed, not at\nall. But as Dominic's pleasure was his own, he struggled to say no to his\nmaster.Dominic reached into his pocket once\nmore and removed a leather half mask and showed it to Michael. \"This will allow\nyou anonymity. Where we are going, you\nwill be on display. You may be touched, prodded, and pulled, but I will not\npermit anyone to fxxx you. After our last encounter, I won't tolerate your\nabuse. My hope is this will be a way for you to ease into this aspect of our\nplay as I know it is not your favorite.\"His master tugged the mask into place.\nMichael wasn't able to see, as there were no holes for his eyes, and that made\nhim breathless. Not being able to see what was about to happen to him had his\nheart racing. He would have to trust his master implicitly, and after the last\npublic performance, Michael felt hesitant. The mask stopped at the top of his\nnose, permitting him to breathe easily.As the car stopped and Michael heard the\ndoor open, his heartbeat escalated even more. He felt the tug of the chain on\nhis collar and began to pad out of the car, unsure of where to place his hands\nonce he arrived at the edge of the door.\"Stand as you get out, Michael. Walk\nbehind me.\"Michael moved to the seat and twisted\nout of the car, slowly placing a bare foot down until it hit solid ground. He\nfelt Dominic grasp his hand and help him up.\"There are no stairs from here to the\nfront door. I'll guide you in. Put one hand on my shoulder.\"Michael followed his master's\ninstructions to the door of wherever it was they were going. Music grew louder\nas they approached, and Michael assumed it was the BDSM club where he'd first\nmet Dominic and his master's other two slaves, but the music was much louder,\nthe beat much more seductive, and when they turned to the right instead of the\nleft after entering, Michael knew this was somewhere he'd never been before.Dominic grasped his wrist and pulled him\ncloser. \"We're going up a long flight of stairs. There is a post to your right.\nGrab it and I'll follow you up.\"Michael grasped the guardrail and felt\nhis master tug his chain. When he put a foot down, it met cold metal. He slowly\nmade his way up stair after stair, bodies bouncing into him on occasion as they\npassed him on the left. A couple of times, his balance was thrown off, but\nDominic was behind him to catch him on those occasions.\"There are three more steps, Michael.\"Michael counted off the last of the\nsteps and stopped at the top. He sensed Dominic pass him and felt his leash\nbeing tugged to the right once more. The music lessened as they seemed to enter\na hallway. Michael felt as if he was in a more enclosed space and assumed it\nwas a hall. The farther down the hall they proceeded, the quieter the music became.A door opened and another tune played\nbehind it, although much lower than the space they'd come through. Michael was\ntugged, and he then heard the door close behind him. Once inside, the cold\ntiled floor switched to a soft carpet under his feet. Fingers reached out to\ncaress his body as he was propelled forward, tugged by the chain. He had no\nidea how many people were touching him, but it appeared to be dozens as they\nwalked a long path.\"Two more steps, Michael, and then we'll\nbe on a large stage.\"A stage? Michael's stomach turned, and\nhe began to tremble slightly. Unsure of what was about to happen to him, he\nfeared the worst. Once he was on the dais, he was turned to face the direction\nthey'd just come from and one of his hands was lifted.\"I'm placing your hands in cuffs hanging\nfrom sturdy chains in the ceiling. No matter how hard you tug, you won't be\nable to free yourself. I will choose when your torture is over,\" Dominic said\nat his ear.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He quit physics to explore his love of the sea, eventually becoming captain of the Grandcamp (a cargo frigate) which capsized after an unexplained blast in the hold. When his lifeboat arrived in the San Francisco Bay Area, he decided to stay, working at Vacuum Genesis, a video game company (www.vacuumgenesis.com). The first game he designed was recalled from the market due to a programming fault that caused hard drives to accelerate until they broke into high-velocity shrapnel. He moved on to teaching, working at several small colleges and universities, but quit when some of his students spontaneously combusted upon entering the workforce.  This is his first published novel. Handle it carefully. You can follow Matthew’s blog at icanwritefunny.blogspot.com.

Ryerson was (among other\nthings) a farmer, arborist, tire manufacturer, postal worker, customs official,\nsolider, father, husband, and a steward on the North American passenger liners.Although the bare bones of\nRyerson's life are known, he did not like to tell stories about himself, so great-grandson Thomas\nRyerson has fleshed out this 'semi-fictional' biography with historical\nresearch and first-person interviews. The result is a pleasant surprise\n- a blend of fact and conjecture that makes the life of this world-traveler\ncome alive in a way that probably would have embarrassed the man.From his childhood - to service in the Boer War (he deserted his\nCanadian army post in order to travel to England to enlist with the sole\npurpose of actually taking part in the war), his marriage, and service as a\nsteward, the reader gets a sense of what Edwy must have been like as a young\nman. Later there was a move back to Canada, several changes in his work career,\nand the loss of two sons, (one in childbirth, the other from tuberculosis).Set and told through the prism of\nhis son Tom's eyes during the depression of the 1930's, the book employs flashbacks to tell each phase of Edwy's story. It is difficult if not\nimpossible to tell what parts of the dialogue and setting are fiction or fact,\nbut this is not the aim of the book.As it stands,A\nBigger Worldprovides a look back through the eyes of a well versed and\nexperienced writer, and one who set out to tell the story of his\ngreat-grandfather who was much more in life than just a Titanic survivor. Reviewed by Tim Trower, The Titanic Commutator, Indian\nOrchard, MA.", "related": [], "rank": 2958062, "title": "A Bigger World", "author": "Thomas A.

However, he would attest that his artful skills and craftsman-like approach to weight loss might have less to do with his professional experience and more to do with his personal experience.  Admittedly battling a minor weight problem throughout his life, Matthew met the manifestation of his worst fears as his college years began, uncontrollably spiraling from low-end 200's to the mid-300 pound range in just over a year. After countless attempts to regain control of his weight, he frustratingly and helplessly realized that the available consumer weight loss products and services offered nothing but the empty promises of charlatans eager to take one's money, dignity, and hope.  The few legitimate products and services that were available were, in his eyes, tarnished by their own pessimistic preaching of \"slow and steady\" and \"moderation is key\".  With well over 100 lbs. to lose, \"slow\" and \"moderate\" quickly became unwelcome phrases. At this point, Matthew dedicated his education to all things weight loss.  Following a B.S. in Nutrition and Dietetics from Youngstown State University, as well as an M.S. in the like from the University of Akron, he finished his formal schooling with a prestigious internship at the Family Health Council in Pittsburgh.  Of more interest, Matthew had also been able to go from his highest weight of close to 350 lbs. to a low near 200 lbs.  More importantly, he continues to maintain his weight loss to this day.", "related": ["B00CICSW44"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 25.0}

Fast-paced and full of adventure, it is a book that entertains its readers from the first page. It is amazing how the author sustains the thrill and suspense until the very last page. Obviously directed at young adult readers, the main protagonists include the two young princes who face moral and spiritual trials as they make their journeys through their lives. And they live in a world inhabited by kings, queens, princes, princesses and wizards. Surely, these elements will appeal to our young readers. The author, however, has another intention and this is to write a book that will serve as a guide for young people who are living in the real world. Making choices in life can be difficult and this is the dilemma that the characters in the story like Princes Brandan and Joachim are facing. And making the right choice is indeed a struggle that each of us has to deal with every day. This book is a must read for people of all ages.", "related": [], "rank": 2361899, "title": "Palace of the Twelve Pillars", "author": "Christina Weigand", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.375, "rating_total": 35.0}

Robert Stake's careful analysis lays out the problems, the pitfalls, and the dangers of such an enterprise, and provides masterful, amply illustrated, easily understood, and reproducible solutions.  All of us who study multiple sites will be grateful for this enormous gift, which analyzes and teaches simultaneously.\"--Howard S. Becker, PhD, author ofWriting for Social ScientistsandTricks of the Trade“Stake does it again: takes up a murky research problem, such as how to integrate multiple case studies that do or don’t have a common subject, and shows us how to solve it.  This book could be the basis for a superb graduate seminar or simply the 'manual' for a research team facing a dozen piles of results from case studies.  It would also be excellent supplementary reading for a course in qualitative research methods that would provide students with an appreciation of the difficulties and possibilities of drawing conclusions from words.”--Les McLean, PhD, Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (Emeritus), University of Toronto, Canada\"This book fills a major gap in the qualitative research and evaluation literature.  Although multicase studies are a commonly used strategy, I know of no published work that provides a comprehensive, in-depth, and practical guide to the conduct of such studies.  The book embodies the author’s extensive experience and deep understanding of this approach, and manages to be both groundbreaking and user-friendly.  The detailed examples of case studies are a major strength of the book.  This book would be appropriate as a textbook for advanced courses in qualitative or case study research, and also as a guide and resource for practicing researchers and evaluators.\"--Joseph A. Maxwell, PhD, Graduate School of Education, George Mason University\"Stake offers a very detailed, honest, and perceptive account of the methodology of cross-case analysis, and the dilemmas of generating both the 'case' and the 'generalization.'\"--Research Professor Ian Stronach, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK\"Stake's book provides the reader with hands-on experience in doing multicase research, offering theoretical insights, useful worksheets, and technical detail. The international Step by Step Early Childhood program implemented in Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia is an ideal study area, with rich contextual data furnishing glimpses of the complexities of changing the patterns and ingrained practices of educational systems.\"--Henriette Heimgaertner, Bernard van Leer Foundation, The Hague, The Netherlands", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

These are the women who believe that without obsession, that there can be no love. They believe that love is a drug and that it carries a nasty little addiction with it. When they read about these men, they allow themselves to believe that they are the object of his obsession. These women first became addicted to the romances that our Grandmothers read and they have now moved on to the contemporary form of Alpha male. These romance novels of old are the books that birthed men who would stop at nothing to stalk and take down the woman that they could not get out of their system. They would manipulate and coerce until they had her at their mercy. As these men stalked their prey with every fiber in their primal being, the women became more addicted to them and resistance became futile. Yes, there are women who need that kind of romance. This genre of books has become harder to find and women find themselves turning over stones and digging through boxes at garage sales and thrift stores. It is for these women that I came up with the series: 'Blackmailed Brides!'

I felt like I was listening to a dear friend talk while I was reading it. I felt that \"Lazy Bones\" was about me. I am a short-cut taker and I always joke that it is because I am efficient. \"Where Did the Time Go\" was very heartwarming. Venkataraman talks about how her dad is losing it a bit, but that it's a good thing because it means he is more carefree, it instantly made me feel better about aging. I always watch my kids and envy how carefree they are. I had never thought about the elderly that way before. It made me happy. \"Beyond Belief\" was very cute and had a really charming dynamic between husband and wife. I really feel she saved the best for last though. \"High Finance\" was my favorite. It showed such a wonderful family bond.\n I really like Venkataraman's writing style. She conveys so much heartwarming emotion without spelling out what she wants you to feel. This is a great read. I would recommend it as a purse book. Stuff it in your purse and pull it out and read it in line at the bank, or in the waiting room at the pediatrician. It will definitely bring a smile to your day.\"This collection of humorous essays captures snippets of real life.

As a well trained soldier I have been taught to bless the Lord at ALL times! My thoughts went straight to the Lord and all I could do was speak well of my Creator, knowing that He was working even this thing out for my good! One of the secrets to my healing was not to hate the person, people that caused my pain, but to pray for them, yes pray for their happiness. I must admit I choked a few times calling certain names but I prayed for them in spite of. It was then my life began to change. Walls began to crumble, I started walking in clarity and peace. I did not realize I was setting my own self free, you know why? Because love, NOT hatred, NOT bitterness, but LOVE sets us free! When you can love no matter what the offense, then you will see blessings coming that you have long forgotten! You will thank the Lord for your journey! Yes thank Him! I learned many lessons, one was that worship is a place, yes a place, inside of you that is set a part for just you and your God. I learned to let go of the past and the people that were not allowed by destiny, to walk into my future. Everybody is not supposed to be in your life, forever! Yes some people come for just a season and they are gone. I learned to take the good and use the bad as fuel, oh some of my pain was self-inflicted, yes I know, we always want to blame the other person. Sometimes I broke my own heart! But I prayed for the happiness of my enemies and also for my own happiness. My worship is personal, it is a release, a place of safety, a place of love...worship is love...the place I've been searching for all my life...I finally found it....thank you Lord.", "related": [], "rank": 4666791, "title": "From Heartbreak To Worship", "author": "Hollye Lexington", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I do wish it could\nhave been spread out more, but as I turned the last page, I'm glad I\nstayed with it. I think the author wove his own magical threads in\ncreating characters and worlds that were very believable.

She continued writing, but then set it aside to work and raise her family. Now that her children are grown, she’s thrown herself back into writing. She’s always enjoyed the darker side, such as ghosts, vampires and monsters, especially the werewolf lore, so paranormal romance was an easy fit.  She’s won multiple awards for her books, including top novelist, Golden Pen from the Heart of the West Romance Writer’s of America, and finalist for best first book in the Golden Quill.  She has also received a bronze medal from the League of Utah Writers.  She is an active member for the Utah chapter of Romance Writers of America. Joy lives in Roy with her husband Steven.  She has three children, Jony, Tanya, and Ty.  And three wonderful  grandchildren who keep her young.

Voted the most likely to die before the age of 30, and educated on the streets of the Jersey shore with  priorities that valued partying above all else, he quickly fell into a world of bikers, drinking and drugs.    Shortly after his first child was born, he had an after death experience that should have changed his life; it didn't. He remained trapped in a world of drugs and riotous living. Five years later, he overdosed again.    With God’s mercy, he was given a second chance - a second time, and began a new life.  Years later, God blessed him with a new wife Patricia, and wiith her assistance they began their first journey into the field of writing, by producing a Construction Manual for his given trade of handrail installation.     Several years later, he felt inspired  to write: “The Genesis Chip” which has now been retitled,  “The Genesis Incident”. This time-travel action/adventure novel, takes you through the exciting days of Creation. With his wife by his side, they enjoyed many hours of editing and rewriting and were able to  achieve a 5 star rating on Amazon. See the reviews at CreationMakesSense.com.     The Berardesco team just finished a short story prequel  entitled  “A.K.A. The Vapor\". Follow the amusing journey of Madison Marino,as she transforms herself into Rebecca Weege, one of the many colorful characters featured in \"The Genesis Incident\".   “Face to the Floor”, is now Butch's third writing. It is the true account of his raw and incredible journey from real-death to real-life. It is currently  being read and studied by inmates to help  them overcome addiction and the sin that so easily besets us.", "related": ["B00E9YL3HM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And, these stories all have an air of mystery to them. They take you places that you never thought you'd ever be able to go. They're  emotional, suspenseful, and even-sometimes-fun.I've always been told that an author has to have something special to help them stick out from other authors. For some, like me, it's the type of story or plot of the story; for others it's the writing style. But, for Xunaira, it's the provocation of thought. No matter what story of hers you are reading, she finds a way to get your brain working--in a good way.For example, in Footsteps in the Attic, every page makes you wonder more and more about the noises, and what the girls find. It never ceases.In The Novelist, you think about the man, and revel in the amazing person he was. You sit and wonder about everything he could have been through in his life, and how amazing it must have been. And, for a novelist, like myself and X, it holds an even bigger meaning; we strive to be that novelist that has a life's story to tell.

Attempting to arrest a rapist who attacks her colleague then continually thwarts her attempts to bring him to justice--to a horrific nightmare where her new baby is kidnapped--this scrappy detective does everything in her power to control these events. Kai Lawson, a partner she doesn't want, fights against and in the end accepts is the hero in these first few stories. The bald-headed, purse-carrying hotshot knows just how to pull her crank and the outcome is entertaining. Their blockbuster story will get you totally invested in this series.In the last three books, along comes Lisa Jordan, a kick-ass kinda gal who loves wearing the shield as a Vegas detective and enjoys the more strenuous aspects of her job. She steps in for a while as Aurora's partner while Kai is MIA. Her story begins here and ends the series as she fights her attraction for wealthy casino owner, Jeff Waters. After one wild night, the charismatic charmer digs his way into her heart and that of the three-year-old nephew in her care. The fact that he leaves her speechless, literally, detracts from his appeal for Lisa since as a self-professed chatterbox, it's the first time ever. On the other hand, everything else about the man is fascinating. She can no more fight her memories than stop herself from rescuing him from two killers holding him hostage in revenge for the mistakes of his father.", "related": ["B00KUW54UO"], "rank": 83166, "title": "Vegas Series", "author": "Mimi Barbour", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 27, "rating_average": 4.5556, "rating_total": 123.0}

His father has just gotten out of prison for writing bad checks, and his mother, disgusted with her son's academic performance, kicks him out of the house and tells him to live with his father on the Miccosukee reservation. Life there is rough; his father is either drunk or making protein health/body-building drinks. Although he could go to school on the Rez, the teen decides to attend the public high school in the zone of his mother's address. On his first day there, he recognizes the girl doing the announcements on the morning show as his best friend growing up, Pippa. Hoping to reconnect with her, he talks his way into a film class she is taking and becomes her partner for a class project on their lives. Trent desperately wants to have a relationship with her; to recapture the ease of what they had as children, but his self-destructiveness and his disturbed life on the Rez stand in the way. What could have been an interesting novel about a half-Native teen adapting to life on the Rez, one foot in and one out of the culture, has few elements to distinguish it from any other book about a young male from a broken family who is uninterested in school. His musical talent is mentioned but never pursued, as is the film project. Too much time is spent in the setup and the ending is rushed, giving short shrift to what should have been the focus of the novel-the film project and Trent's acceptance of his heritage.—Suanne B.

The author's\nobservations on Australian life as an immigrant and his perception give the\nbook a genuineness and honesty that readers will appreciate. The humaneness and\nthe concern enable readers to grasp the author's feelings, emotions, and\nexperiences.I found the book\nvery fascinating because it exposes readers to a totally new way of life in a\nforeign land; the author's comments and opinions are strongly expressed, making\nthe narration more effective. The book also tells readers about the extensive\nresearch the author has done on topics relating to tribal population,\nethnicity, and other details regarding the culture of Australia. The perception about\nAsian children and their education in Australian society is quite an\ninteresting fact and he speaks about racism, the existence of colonial\nmentality, and the discrimination he was subject to as a student at university.\nBut what makes the book likable is that it has been written with no malice or\nbitterness and just as the author's experiences as an immigrant.

It was the\namalgamation of a few ideas that had been swirling in my head for a while.The changing face of aging in America is fascinating to me. On\nthe upside everyone's a lot healthier.  We've got exercise, supplements,\ninjections and surgery to make sure that sixty is the new forty. Personally I\ndon't feel much different at forty-five than I did at twenty-five and I enjoy\nmy sports just as much if not more. Unfortunately though, I do look different\nand these two truths are hard to reconcile.  My character Edie, like most\nwomen, struggles with this too:\"She tried\nto convince herself that her body just needed to be healthy, it didn't need to\nlook good for pictures anymore. But it was so disheartening to see the slump of\nfat positioned stubbornly around her middle, the slackness in her upper arms,\nand the sag of skin above each kneecap. At least here in the woods she didn't\nhave to face it in a three-way mirror as she had back at home.\" While we are physically healthier, mentally we seem a bit\nunbalanced. The country is in a nearly constant state of anxiety over a perfect\nstorm of falling birth rates, baby boomers draining social security, and the\nhangover of the recent stock market and real estate crashes that fog our\nvisions for the future.Add to this the changing healthcare industry. Pot is now legal\nmy state, almost unnecessarily since medical marijuana has been freely\navailable to anyone with the ability to keep a straight face as they rate the\npain of an old shoulder injury for a doctor who sees patients three at a time.\nAlternative medicine is growing in popularity, insurance premiums are going up,\nand an unexpected emergency room visit costs enough to bankrupt a middle-class\nfamily. Pretty grim stuff.But that's why I chose to write something fictional. I wanted to\ntell a story that brings this anxiety and hopefulness together in an exciting,\nfunny and dramatic way. Life knocks my characters around and the blows they're\ndealt are all that harder to recover come from at their age. But they are still\nin control, still responsible for making choices that impact the quality of\ntheir lives.We're all growing older, every day, together and alone. How we\nface this, and what we do about it, those are still our choices to make.", "related": [], "rank": 2438260, "title": "Silver Springs", "author": "Jennifer Baisch", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
