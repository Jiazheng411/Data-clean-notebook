GA is also the only segment that does not emphasize being \"in command.\" Instead, GA training has traditionally focused on rote execution of flight maneuvers. New studies reveal a proactive approach to general aviation flight operations successfully improves general aviation accident odds. Based on FAA-mandated pilot-in-command authority and responsibility for flight safety and operations, Pilots in Command: Strategic Action Plan for Reducing \"Pilot Error\" provides private pilots a how-to guide to cockpit decision making. Using a step-by-step model, pilots discover how to use available tools to avoid pilot error. The book also identifies inherent pilot habits commonly practiced by general aviation pilots and presents methods for self-retraining to eliminate the problematic behaviors. General Aviation training is changing to meet the facts of rising accident trends and subsequent investigation into its origins and prevention. The strategies Craig presents inPilot in Commandare developed from FAA-participated research and continued review. It is effective decision making that produces effective flight, and Craig expertly weds the two in a hands-on approach pilots can apply every time they fly.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But for the most part, he finds, the media avoided or trivialized the AIDS story in its early years, and even today betrays homophobic bias and a head-in-the-sand attitude. In this thorough, often gripping study, Kinsella, a former Los Angeles Herald-Examiner editor, shows how the media and medical experts fumbled the AIDS story. Randy Shilts, the gay San Francisco reporter who wrote And the Band Played On , is portrayed as an ambitious news-hound who sometimes overdramatized or misreported information. Dan Rather, Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw get low marks for their handling or noncoverage of AIDS news.

Filled with inspirational stories and effective guidance, Caregiving also addresses how to communicate with difficult patients and those in denial, how to facilitate non-stressful family interaction, and other important topics.

This time around, Lick is down on his luck in southern Idaho, licking his wounds after a series of rodeo setbacks. His romantic life takes a turn for the better, though, with the calamitous arrival of the beautiful Teddie Arizona Grant (\"T.A.\"), who survives a plane crash after fleeing Las Vegas—and her husband, after stealing some of his cash. Subsequent chapters fill in the blanks: T.A.'s marriage to casino owner F. Rank is strictly one of convenience, while her theft is connected to an effort to stop a lucrative exotic animal hunt organized by Rank and a high-level animal trainer (stage name: Ponce de Crayon). T.A. is hunted down by Rank and his evil henchman; she escapes, and Lick (with an assist from Cody, who arrives mid-book, now 29 and married) attempts rescue. The plot is numbing, but more or less beside the point.

While much of the historical information can be found in references such as The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Russia (Cambridge, 1994; o.p.) and in books on each topic, the strength of Schultze's book is that it offers an array of informed commentary in a concise format and gives excellent coverage to the past decade. For example, there is up-to-date information on the status of women, changes in the media and the arts, and much more. The author knows the culture well and does a good job of contextualizing the material with only occasional lapses into lists. There are suggested readings at the end of each chapter, a glossary, and a six-page bibliography. However, the illustrations are disappointing-a mere 16 pages of grainy, black-and-white photos that have been inserted in the middle of the book. In addition, the crude map seems to indicate that Russia and Turkey share a border, and, while two Siberian rivers are marked, the Volga, which is so important to Russian culture, is not.

This novel begins after a pleasant family cruise runs amok and a surly Poseidon jettisons Charlotte halfway around the world, and she is compelled to face off against tumultuous and arrogant gods. This time, tsunamis, natural disasters, and monsters from Hades are destroying the world. Fate steers the cousins to Olympus to have a serious chat with Zeus, restore Earth to order, and save all of humanity. And Charlotte thought seventh-grade math was rough! The action rarely stops, gathers momentum, and goes extreme. Following the 13-year-old cousins as they duck in and out of trouble is half the fun; meeting the irascible and complicated cast of Olympian characters is the rest. From a cameo appearance of Apollo roller-skating around the crystal decadence of Olympus to the girls' eventual confrontation with a thunderously lusty but mostly ineffectual Zeus, the humor is raw and rich. Complementing the story's action, and tempering the humor, is the reappearance of the demonic Philonecron, Poseidon's psychotic grandson. He lurks and schemes in the shadows, creating ever more tension. The young mortals right the immoral wrongs of the gods, but it's the deft blend of intricate plot development, flippant tone, and a fresh twist on an ancient theme that gives this novel its winning finish.—Alison Follos, North Country School, Lake Placid, NYEND", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They maintain that the failures of the press to scrutinize the Bush administration's preemptive war on Iraq and to question the administration's policy on torture of captives are the most egregious examples of the press taking its cues from government officials. The press is now so accustomed to getting information from government sources that unless someone within the government challenges a view or policy, no other side is heard. Cozy relationships between the press and insider sources have made the press easily manageable. Exploring the refreshing independence the press showed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when the administration was caught off guard and unable to manage the coverage, the authors offer suggestions on how the press can recover its independence on a broader scale.Vanessa BushCopyright © American Library Association.

As the story opens, three visitors find shelter from a blizzard at Pat Scully's hotel in Fort Romper, Neb.: a nervous New Yorker known as the Swede, a rambunctious Westerner named Bill, and a reserved Easterner called Mr. Blanc. The Swede becomes increasingly drunk, defensive, and reckless. He beats Scully's son, Johnnie, in a fight after accusing him of cheating at cards. When the Swede accosts a patron of a bar, he is stabbed and killed. The story ends ambiguously at a point several months later, when timid Mr. Blanc confesses to Bill that he feels somewhat responsible for the Swede's death because he failed to act when he saw that Johnnie was indeed cheating at cards.   --The Merriam-Webster Encylopedia of Literature", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

You want me to give your sister sex lessons?\"\"Not precisely.\" Matt, the youngest Malone brother, bit off the words. \"We prefer to call it sensual appreciation training.\" Nick and Drew gave shuddering nods of agreement.Boz paced to the window. The request didn't disturb him as much as his reaction. His sixth sense didn't sound an alarm. Instead, it pawed at his innards, riling him up like a thoroughbred at the starting pistol. On the other hand, his common sense screeched like a banshee.In times of turmoil, he hid behind the precise and slightly haughty demeanor of the duke. He did that now as he made an exact quarter turn towards the eldest, Nick. \"Okay, sensual appreciation training, then. Why does she need to be trained by anyone other than her future spouse?\"Nick tossed back the whiskey in his glass. \"You want to know why three over-protective brothers would ask this favor?\"\"Or perhaps,\" Drew suggested, \"since Lily is such a spectacular female, he wonders why we make this request now. Men will surely commence falling at her feet tonight.\"Matt couldn't get past his objections. \"Maybe, you two could explain all of this to me again. I loved Moms as much as any of you, but she's gone. We can forget this odd-ball notion of hers.\"Nick shoved his youngest sibling. \"Damn it, you know better. 'Twas no flighty notion. This plea came from our dying Mother and we gave our pledge of honor. How can you suggest we forget? Is that how little she meant to you?\"The errant brother gave a chagrined sigh. \"I'm sorry. Of course, you're right. It just goes against the grain. Way against it.\"\"Just pretend I'm not here.\" Sedgewick couldn't stifle a grin at the typically boisterous interaction between the brothers he met before he could lace his own shoes.At the reminder, they returned their attention to their chosen victim, errr best friend and Drew explained. \"We never introduced you our family closet's skeleton. God knows we've moldered in the country for years to keep it quiet. Now we're forced to London and we've already imposed on you to help with Lily's debut. Yet, we must ask for so much more.\"\"Indeed,\" Nick added, \"however, we have no choice. The fact is, Mother was married before she met my Father.\"\"What?\" The Duke's shock stretched his chocolate eyes.\"Once upon a time, Mother was the Duchess of St. Albans. The poor thing was pledged at birth to Montgomery Claremont, the late and unlamented Aubrey's sire. She fostered at a convent. The Claremonts didn't fetch her until the eve of her wedding. From the far-too-frank descriptions she gave to convince us of the import of her request, we learned that Monte got his jollies from her pain.\" Nick's anger made it clear that he would love to dig up the long-dead Montgomery and inflict a little pain of his own.\"His son shared that trait,\" Boz commented.\"The Nuns taught her to do her sacred duty, no matter how distasteful she found it. Well, one night, he proceeded from kicking down the service entrance to whips and chains. When he passed out, Moms got loose. She grabbed the knife he incorporated into their little escapades and stabbed the bastard. Then she ran away,\" Drew filled in when Nick's words muted to indecipherable growls.\"Too bad she didn't finish the job or Aubrey would never have existed,\" Sedgewick noted.\"Pops found her hiding in the woods bloody, half-clothed, and terrified of anyone male. He hid her while Claremont searched. He also gave her sensual appreciation instruction. Before long, the teacher and the pupil fell in love and discovered I was on the way,\" Nick added, with a quirk of his left brow. \"By then Monte had a wee one of his own en route. He divorced Mother and kept her dowry.\"\"Our parents married before the ink dried on the documents, just before Nick arrived,\" Drew added.\"They lived quietly and we've done the same. The old scandal died eventually, helped along by the monumental dirt in Monte and then Aubrey's daily lives. We hope it's behind us, but the ton has a long memory,\" Nick said.\"So you've sought my influence for Lily's debut,\" Boz murmured, understanding the aide he agreed to give without questioning why it was needed.\"Mother,\" Nick insisted, \"believed no woman should go into marriage without knowing what to expect in the bedroom. She insisted that you must teach Lily. Whether you noticed or not, she worked hard to foster your attachment. On her deathbed, she made us promise to come to you with the request and insisted you wouldn't deny us if we told you the truth.\"The end of Nick's sentence concerned Boz. \"I've known Lily since she arrived in the world. Now you want me to teach the scrawny brat about sex? The thought holds all the allure of getting romantic with my little sister.\"Matt turned his words against him. \"First off, she's not your sister. Second, the brat trailed behind you on every step of your visits for years, up till recently when they stopped altogether.\"His face colored, causing his visitors to grin, despite the touchy subject. \"Teaching her about sex would require her to arouse me to some degree. Frankly, I don't believe that's possible.\"\"I've never laid eyes on the young lady,\" said Vladimir Batalova, who'd quietly arrived a few minutes back, \"but I'd bet my share of Wanderer's next voyage that it's inevitable.\"\"Lily?\"\"Lily.\" The Russian's confidence grated on Boz's nerves.Lily.Matt interrupted his thoughts. \"You didn't let me finish. While you've been gone Lily grew up.\" He allowed that thought to germinate. \"She matured and blossomed. If you make me say that again, I'll strangle you and enjoy it.\"\"Assuming I agreed to this harebrained notion,\" he said with a calm he didn't begin to feel, \"what would be the boundary?\"\"Her maidenhead,\" Nick said.\"Damn,\" the duke muttered while his sixth sense bubbled like freshly poured champagne. He wanted to refuse. He should refuse. Given the skeleton in his own family closet, not refusing could and likely would be tragic. But the bloody sense he'd never damned as much as today wouldn't let him walk away.", "related": ["B00KJ7RZGQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With the ability of cardiac ultrasonography to define the anatomy of cardiac defects with great precision, diagnostic cardiac catheterization is seldom required, and interventional catheterization has largely replaced diagnostic studies. Dr. Rudolph began his career in pediatric cardiology in a physiology laboratory, and he has contributed greatly to our understanding of fetal circulation, postnatal adaptation, and the pathophysiology of congenital cardiac defects. As an experienced clinician, he correlates the clinical features of various cardiac defects with the resulting pathophysiologic features. His understanding of the dynamic nature of cardiac defects from fetal life to adolescence is well presented and makes for a clear and interesting book.The book is unique among the current textbooks of pediatric cardiology. First, it has a single author, and except for abundant schematic figures and a few tables, it has no illustrations. The first four chapters discuss our current knowledge of cardiopulmonary physiology. Chapter one deals with the fetal circulation and postnatal adaptation. Chapter two, on functional assessment, will certainly be helpful for trainees in cardiology. Details of pressure measurements, cardiac output, intravascular shunts, and dye dilution are presented clearly and concisely. Oxygen uptake and delivery are covered in chapter three, and chapter four reviews prenatal and postnatal pulmonary circulation. These four chapters will benefit neonatologists, perinatologists, and pediatric and adult cardiologists who seek a current understanding of cardiopulmonary physiology.The next 14 chapters deal with specific cardiac defects. Each chapter follows a similar pattern. The specific lesion is discussed with regard to morphology, hemodynamics, and postnatal circulatory adaptation. The symptoms, physical examination, and diagnostic studies are presented clearly and concisely. Each chapter contains a section on principles of management, which includes the natural history and the therapeutic options. The book is easy to read and reflects the experience of an outstanding clinician who is also a renowned researcher.The book does not attempt to be a comprehensive review of every cardiac anomaly but covers in detail the most common defects. It is a personal book, containing many clinical pearls and reflecting Dr. Rudolph's own views. Students, residents, and cardiology fellows are all fascinated by the spectacular technology of cardiac ultrasonography and Doppler studies but pay less attention to the pathophysiology resulting from the anatomical defects. Dr. Rudolph clearly shows how the clinical findings correlate with the anatomy and explains the physiological consequences. Cardiac ultrasonography is relegated to its rightful role as a very important and reliable diagnostic tool. A clear understanding of the dynamic nature of congenital heart disease, and how the clinical picture reflects the pathophysiology, places the clinical evaluation of the individual patient in proper perspective. For cardiologists trained in recent years, this book should be required reading.Jacqueline A. Noonan, M.D.Copyright © 2001 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.

Unfortunately, Harry's mischievous cat, The Goog, was in Grandma's truck when she drove to school. When he runs away, he leads Harry and Doug on a chase that takes them to all of the places that students are not supposed to go: specifically the teachers' lounge and the boiler room. Finally, all is well: The Goog is caught and taken home, and Doug and Harry learn that the party is for their teacher, who is getting married. Kline does a good job of maintaining a sense of adventure and a hint of danger as the boys head into forbidden places. Fans will be pleased with this newest installment in the series.

Air Force General and computer whiz Brian Maguire had a good life. He had a billet of some importance(working on the Star Wars program) and a beautiful female companion with whom to share his off-hours. Little did he know that she was a Chinese officer and a spy. Maguire is soon thrust into the middle of a plot in which China tries to take over the United States without ever firing a shot. And unless Maguire comes through in a hurry, they are going to succeed.Bill Berry's first novel, THE ROAR OF THE DRAGON, is a unique cyber-thriller built around a Chinese web of espionage designed to gain access to US Star Wars satellites. It is fast-moving, with some well-developed characters and a well-thought main idea which keeps the reader curious as to what will happen next. It has all the elements of a good action/spy thriller: murder, sex, blackmail, car chases. Throw in a few power-hungry politicians and 200 ICBM's aimed at the US, and you have one good story. There are a few inaccuracies with regards to some of the military workings of the book, but they don't diminish at all its readability or plot line. At times the book is so believable it's scary, considering it deals with nuclear weapons.The book is well presented, with a simple, eye-catching cover and a readable font. Techno-fans, as well as spy enthusiasts, will find something to enjoy in here.Review by Rob Ballister, MWSA Lead Reviewer --Military Writers Society of America", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Despite some very good products and information, none could solve my problem.Being a creative and innovative person, I set out on a task to find a way to address this and a few other problems with conventional raised bed or container gardening designs.  This issue in the Extreme Green series of guides tells you exactly how I achieved complete freedom from invasive roots while solving other problems that helped extend my growing season.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 1763, with the peace treaty that ended the French and Indian War, France and Spain handed over all the territory east of the Mississippi, as well as Canada, to the British. In this one stroke, settlers both on the East Coast and on the frontier came under British rule. Calloway's enthralling chronicle follows the lives of settlers, Indians and immigrants as this new British rule affected them. He demonstrates convincingly that the seeds of the American Revolution were planted in 1763, as a near-bankrupt Britain began to impose heavy \"taxation without representation.\" The year brought bloody skirmishes between Indians, who were being pushed off more of their lands, and settlers; Calloway also narrates the expulsion of Acadians from Nova Scotia and their resettlement in Louisiana. This first-rate cultural history, part of Oxford's Pivotal Moments in American History series, reveals that the events of 1763 changed not only the political geography of a nation but also its cultural geography, as various groups moved from one part of the country to another.

This was when the Internet was in its infancy. You couldn't just jump on Google for all the answers!  But I love all things Egyptian so this \"research\" was actually fun for me.As work, family, and life in general consumed me, my writing took a back seat. But I never gave up my desire to become published. One divorce and two layoffs later, I found myself with a lot of spare time on my hands.  I kept thinking of Kama and Amonmose, resting patiently between the pages of my manuscript, waiting for me to resurrect their story. Then, I went to Egypt for my 40th birthday, and I knew more than ever that I had to share the history of Ancient Egypt and Nubia. I've tried not to bore the reader with too many historical details, but the rich culture of Egypt and Nubia just can't be ignored.  So, you'll find the Author's Note in this book overflowing with historical facts for reference.  I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.", "related": ["B00JQS5FIO"], "rank": 1128947, "title": "Pharaoh's Desire", "author": "Chanta Rand", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.9, "rating_total": 49.0}

I was in a bind. Should I\nchange her character, I wondered? Make her more likable?But after much thought, I\ndecided not to. Payton was so strong in my mind and so entertaining without a\nfilter, that I had to chance it and let her be.Now, just about every single\nreader tells me that they love Payton's character.I am glad I did not listen to\nmy writing group onthataspect.As for Diago, I hated the\na-hole in the beginning, but I, like Payton, grew to love him.In the original ending, which I\nchanged after umpteen requests, I cried buckets as I wrote.I even cried during my many re-writes!\n(I am a cry baby, btw.)I enjoyed the company of every\nsingle character in Gringa, including Tongue the fargin SOB, and Christa the fargin nympho!They all brought something to\nthe table as many readers pointed out.My fans have asked, so I will\nbe publishing the original ending of Gringa, but it will be FREE to anyone who\nhas read Gringa, free to my fans.I will be doing that in the\nnext couple of months, so watch my Wordpress blog and ...make sure you have fargin Kleenex.Enjoy!", "related": ["B00LNM8EXE"], "rank": 8933, "title": "Beast of Mexico - There are men who make you want to rescue them, protect them, save them - he was one of them. : A romantic suspense, romantic crime, crime lord novel (Book 1 in the series) (Gringa)", "author": "Eve Rabi", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 53, "rating_average": 3.9245, "rating_total": 208.0}

Anyone involved in the war on terror--and who isn't?--will profit from Maloney's insights and observations.\"\"A vivid yet insightful view of what the Global War on Terror really means in Afghanistan's unforgiving mountains and churning cities. Sean Maloney's combination of on-the-ground experience in Afghanistan and his background as an experienced military historian and analyst bring real insight to a fascinating and strategically vital situation. It has been a new world since 9/11, and Sean Maloney has expertly chronicled a part of it. This is history written from the front line, not the academic desk, by a Canadian with much experience of the emerging nature of conflict worldwide.\"\"Sean Maloney is one of my favorite observers of the contemporary geopolitical scene. He is that rarest of academic creatures--a fun read.

This was exactly the kind of individual who could get away with   skimming budget funds if she wanted to. No one would suspect someone as lovely   and as, well,wholesome-lookingas Cait Walsh. Not of fiscal misdeeds.Still, it would be bad form to deny a teacher her glitter. The school   board had approved the office supplies change, but he wondered who'd   orchestrated it and why. Something seriously strange was afoot in this   district.He studied Cait. She was young, dynamic and closer to his   sister's age than his. Twenty-five, maybe. But unlike Sis, this shapely woman   was a neat freak who used round vowel tones as weapons. She challenged him with   that reserved posture, that combination of clarity and caution. With those huge   gray-green eyes, freckle-splattered nose and forehead creased in concentration   over God knew what, she was cute as hell.Which annoyed him. He had too   much to do. A leak to pinpoint. He had no intention of finding anyone \"cute as   hell.\" Least of all a potential embezzler from Wisconsin.He saw her   lift a bulky beige tote with the letters \"CLW\" stitched in green. It looked as   heavy as a golf bag, but shorter and twice as dense. She had it crammed with   papers, scratch 'n' sniff stickers, lots of stuff he couldn't see. He'd have   offered to carry it for her, but she grabbed it tight. Didn't look like she'd   trust the FBI with that thing. Huh. Suspect behavior.\"What's the 'L'   stand for?\" He pointed to her monogram. \"It wouldn't be Lynn, would it?\" He   squinted. \"Leigh? Or Loretta?\"\"None of the above.\" Cait locked her   classroom door.Then again, maybe secrecy was just part and parcel of   being a woman. They always thought they had to be so mysterious.\"So,   what? You're not going to tell me? Think I'll laugh?\"She nodded,   standing still and staring at him in the hallway.He puffed out some hot   air. He'd have to brush up on his chitchatting. Not a good idea to alienate the   staff so soon, even if he had suspicions about somebody. He'd known her   for...what? A whole fifteen minutes? And already she pretty clearly despised him.   Well, never let it be said he couldn't make a strong first impression.\"I   won't laugh.\" He tried to radiate sincerity.She gave him a thorough   once-over. \"Livie,\" she mumbled. \"After my grandmother Olivia.\"\"Oh.\" He   shrugged. \"That's not so bad. Olivia's nice, too. Why'd your parents shorten   it?\"At this she chuckled. \"Think about it, Mr. Ellis. You couldn't have   grown up around here. Even in Wisconsin--the 'Dairy State'--having the initials   C.O.W. is hardly a woman's deepest desire.\"A laugh erupted from deep   within him. So there was a sense of humor behind the snow queen façade. Good.   Maybe she'd thaw a bit, they could talk, he'd figure out her angle and,   hopefully, discount her from his investigation. He needed to concentrate on   forwarding his career...and on keeping his father from disowning him. Ogling   attractive women was his brother's department, not his.\"You have bright   parents,\" he said finally. \"Bet you appreciated their foresight.\"\"I   did.\" She surprised him with a grin that lit up her whole face. For a moment he   was rendered speechless.They strolled outside toward the parking lot.\"Okay,\" she said. \"Now that you know my secret, what's your middle   name?\"Sheesh. He hadn't been thinking. Sharing his middle name could   only land him in boiling water. \"Mine's not real interesting.\"The light   in her face vanished. She turned huge, distrustful eyes on him. \"So?\"He   grimaced. \"My middle initial's 'M,' how 'bout you guess?\"\"What? I   practically told you mine outright. There's no reason to hedge with me. It   couldn't be that terrible.\"\"Oh, don't be so sure. Your parents altered   yours from your namesake's to be less embarrassing, my parents did nothing of   the kind.\" He hesitated, praying she'd back off. The name recognition, he knew   from years of painful experience, could be instantaneous. But no such luck. This   Miss Walsh was a persistent one.Her forehead crinkled. \"Hmm. Well, it   couldn't be Michael or Matthew, could it? Those aren't unusual enough to upset   anyone. Max, maybe? What about Mitch? Or, Marvin?\"\"I wish,\" he muttered.   And he did. For maybe the ninety-thousandth time he wished he came from a family   that wasn't internationally famous.They reached their vehicles, and he   changed the subject. \"Look,\" he told her, \"why don't you jump in with me? It'll   be easier than taking two cars. I can drive you back here later.\"\"Oh,   um...sure.\"He opened the passenger door of his red BMW and held it for   her. She slid into the black leather seat, her eyes bulging at the rows of   gadgets on the dash. He knew how impressive it looked. He liked his cars   complicated, his women simple. Yet another reason the chilly and changeable Miss   Walsh posed a problem: She did not seem simple. But someone was meddling with   funds and, although instinct and experience told him Cait didn't have the   bearing of a ringleader, she might know who was at the center of these thefts.", "related": [], "rank": 867748, "title": "Double Dipping (Sweet Book 2)", "author": "Marilyn Brant", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 30.0}

A natural storyteller who loves inventing characters and worlds for them to live in, Linda lives in Auckland with her husband and two daughters, and the rest of the time in the rich, fertile land of her imagination. Her first novel The Dragon's Apprentice, was a finalist in the Junior Ficion Category for the New Zealand Post Children's Book Awards in 2003.  Circle of Dreams Timeweaver is Linda's third title with Scholastic.  The idea for Circle of Dreams came to her one day when she was looking at an old leather-bound book in a second-hand shop and it seemed to have a character all of its own. She began to wonder 'what if' and 'maybe' as all writers do. The rest followed from there. Linda writes mostly children's fantasy but has, in the past, dabbled in adult book. None have been published yet. Her major influence in writing for children came when she was reading 'The Wednesday Wizard' by Sheryl Jordan.  It was written in a style that she admired and has since aimed to achieve. Linda's books do not deal with the 'serious' issue of life as so many books today do. Fantasy is all about visiting a different place for a while and she doesn not include any war, politics or religion in any of her children's stories. Her books do not aim to teach, preach or advise - they are the books you read for the pure pleasure of reading.  Although her books are aimed at the 8-12 year old reading group, they can be enjoyed by older readers who enjoy an uncomplicated fantasy that will export them to somewhere new for a while.", "related": ["B00B15Z1P2"], "rank": 1084184, "title": "Runeweaver (Circle of Dreams Book 1)", "author": "Linda McNabb", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Not put off by such a trivial matter as having been born a hundred years too late, James struggled on against the modern world and amassed a comprehensive collection of late Victorian to early twentieth century adventure fiction consisting of authors such as Verne, Wells, Conan Doyle, Buchan and Rider Haggard in which to immerse himself.With a sweet tooth for late nineteenth century French fin de siècle, literature that did little more than influence his drinking habits enough to dilute his ennui, and a penchant for old fashioned adventures (inevitably involving service revolvers, tweed and stout hearted chaps struggling against all manner of insidious foe) The Adventures of Augustus Fuller was published by the author in 2011 to reinvigorate the classic adventure genre, brimming with anarchists, intrigue and all manner of insidious foe.Visit jamesrickon.com for all the latest news, reviews, artwork and goings-on.", "related": ["B0088OVJTQ"], "rank": 2708059, "title": "The Adventures of Augustus Fuller eBook", "author": "James Rickon", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Being left-brained means that I approach things in a very logical and skeptical manner, one that is not conducive to turning off my mind. Being left-brained helps me solve a lot of problems but there are some problems where a logical approach runs contrary to finding a solution.My wife, an artist, is right-brained and comes from a very different world. She finds turning off her mind something as easy to do as flipping off a light switch. As her exploration of meditation grew, I chose to support her by attending classes and trying to accomplish this also. What I discovered is that what was easy for her was not for me.Interestingly enough, I was able to use my mind to solve my problem and in doing so discover a way that others can do it too.  Using logic to defeat logic? Of course! It worked for me and I hope that it also will work for you.What I found in learning how to meditate is the answer to other life lessons, ones that you too may be struggling with.  So while this guide does reveal how to get left-brained geeks to meditate, it also explains the problems you encounter in life when relying on a one-sided approach.", "related": ["B00D4AVIKE"], "rank": 3390392, "title": "Meditation For Geeks (and other left-brained people) eBook", "author": "Philip Rastocny", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The difference between Frank and all the others is that he was an employee of the club and was therefore on the inside looking out instead of being on the outside looking in like the rest of us. Despite that advantage, I still sensed a certain reluctance by Frank to put pen to paper. He believes that those \"who attend the matches\" or who work behind the scenes at a football club have \"a more rounded view than armchair supporters\". He also recognises that the days of ghost-written autobiographies, what he quaintly but accurately describes as pre-1980s B.C. (before computers), are gone to be replaced by a plethora of publications written by supporters who claim to be \"the voice of the man of the terraces\". If growing up our dream job was 'to play for Liverpool Football Club', closely following behind it might have been 'working for Liverpool Football Club'. Accepting that he would never be good enough to be a professional footballer, Frank can certainly speak with authority as someone who was employed by the club through a quite momentous decade in that club's history. The important thing about stories like Frank's (just as it was with authors like Brian Reade, Neil Dunkin and Peter Etherington before him) is to get the balance right between life as a Liverpool supporter and life per se. Yes, of course it is useful to get an idea of the man behind the name but not at the expense of getting too involved in that man's private/domestic life. That is an important part of the whole story but it does not make the whole story. People will buy this book because they know Liverpool Football Club not because they know Frank Gamble. Frank gets the balance right as he talks about his upbringing under an Evertonian father whilst being astute enough to realise that \"in places like Liverpool where football is as important as air and water, your choice of allegiance is the first major decision you will probably take in life\". He decided that Red not Blue would be his choice and was captivated by the skill of Peter Thompson who became his first big favourite. As the Sixties became the Seventies his love-affair with the club continued to blossom and he recalls fondly the pilgrimage to Rome in 1977 remembering that the train they had to board at Lime Street \"didn't look as if it could reach Edge Hill never mind Folkestone\". Many older readers will certainly endorse that observation! Towards the end of the 1970s Frank answered an advertisement placed in the Liverpool Echo newspaper looking for a Lottery Sales Manager to work for LFC's Development Association. A phone call from club Secretary Peter Robinson led to an initial interview and he was called back for a second interview with Chairman John Smith, after which he was offered the job. His immediate boss would be a man, Ken Addison, whose name is familiar to thousands of Liverpool supporters. Ken, the Commercial Manager in charge of the Development Association, told Frank \"This is your extended family\" as he introduced him to his new colleagues. Frank's remit was to ensure that \"sales remained at an acceptable point\". He was so fired up to pay back the faith that Ken and the Board had put in him that he \"relished every day\" even though as time went by he became aware that going to work at Anfield \"was becoming more and more like a soap-opera\" ! Life in Britain was changing. \"The economy was dire, jobs were falling at catastrophic rates\" but they were still expected to maintain their revenue streams. But \"the most frustrating thing was seeing the enormous commercial potential the club had during its halcyon days unfulfilled, when they had people there who were not given the chance to use theirs\". Chairman John Smith became obsessed with cost-cutting at Anfield. Opportunities were missed to promote the club to the wider world, as Frank recalls when he poignantly says \"These were the days and times when the club should have pushed the pedal to the floor in terms of pulling away from our rivals commercially. We have been playing catch-up with our rivals to this day. We were so slow out of the blocks and it cost us dear\". Through his daily work Frank gradually became acquainted with the legends of the club himself and immediately noticed how down-to-earth they all were but how focused and committed they were as well. \"Their attention to detail was truly amazing and their knowledge of the game unsurpassed\". In particular he remembers Chief Scout Geoff Twentyman : \"LFC owes this man an enormous debt of gratitude for all the diamonds he unearthed and his dedication to the cause\". Frank worked for the club at the time of Heysel but not Hillsborough. The longest chapter in this fascinating book is devoted to the first tragedy. Hearing the before, during and after testimony of a club employee is very revealing. Britain was \"an angry society\" in 1985, a year in which there was so much unrest and disorder at football grounds throughout the country. The violence that surrounded the 1985 F.A. cup semi-final at Goodison Park was \"a bloodbath waiting to happen\". The following month in Brussels blood flowed for real in the most appalling way. Frank was deeply traumatised by what he saw that day, sadly knowing that the inevitable aftermath was that \"we were out in the wilderness, despised by everyone\". Working for the club no longer gave such pride and enjoyment. \"There was a stigma attached to being part of the organisation involved in such a terrible event. But because the organisation had been held in such high esteem beforehand, the fall from grace was incalculable\". Maybe Heysel was the catalyst that was the beginning of the end of Mister Gamble's time as an LFC employee, an employ for which he surprisingly never had any sort of written contract. Life changes for us all and we have to make decisions that change the way our lives run. If you work for the football club you have supported through thick and thin all your life, that allegiance does not change because your own life changes when it comes to employment. \"Just because the boy becomes a man doesn't mean you leave all that stuff behind. You never do; in fact the intensity grows as time goes on\". Frank Gamble's idea for this book was to try and express what it was like crossing the threshold of just being a fan to depending on that commitment for your livelihood. His idea bore fruit and it is a quite remarkable account of what it was like to work for Liverpool Football Club during one of the most successful periods of the club's long and illustrious history. Only two things disappointed me. One : that there are no photographs included in the book. Two : that there are factual errors I believe should have been spotted and corrected before publication. Despite Frank's closing words \"It's how I remembered things. If my recollections are incorrect, then I apologise\" I was disappointed to read about certain matches I remember very clearly when the order of events was not as described in this book. Putting that aside, though, this was a most interesting book to read because even if it did not tell me much historically that I did not already know, it was enthralling to hear the account of someone who was actually employed by the club; and that is the main reason why I would recommend this book to all Liverpool supporters ... because it hasn'the most frustrating thing was seeing the enormous commercial potential the club had during its halcyon days unfulfilled, when they had people there who were not given the chance to use theirs\".

His life has included highs and lows including near-death experiences. He was once diagnosed (incorrectly) with liver cancer and his treatment in a UK NHS hospital included supervision by a hospital consultant who believed that pain brings you closer to Jesus. He did not therefore have any analgesics on the ward after major surgery and a doctor (from the same perverted church) stayed by his bed always, asking whether he has seen Jesus. Later he was going profoundly deaf with progressive bilateral nerve-disease and was healed by a spontaneous miracle - in that moment, he became able to heal other people. All his work since then has been directed at 'healing', whether executive coaching, writing self-help books or more academic papers.Dr Angus McLeod is a coach and author.

Hoecheck and his minions pursue shareholder value through such dirty tricks as insider trading, corporate espionage, blackmail and murder. When Madeleine joins the firm, she and another new employee, PR expert Tony Oldbridge, find exhilaration in the company's frenetic, results-oriented pace, and in each other, as they begin a torrid affair. But disillusionment with the firm soon sets in, and the couple determine to expose the criminal activities of their rapacious chief. After the go-go 1980s, a novel set on the cusp of the acquisitions boom seems quaint rather than cutting. Harman's predictable narrative is further diminished by stock characterizations and by his cloying sense of wonder at the evil deeds men do to burnish the bottom line.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The tale of a 12-year-old boy who falls in with smugglers could trace its lineage back to the swashbuckling stories of Robert Louis Stevenson and may find its modern-day offspring in such works as Iain Lawrence's High Seas trilogy. Jim, an orphan, is sent to live with relatives along the Devon coast. There he accidentally witnesses the deeds of a troop of night-riders, or smugglers, and becomes caught up in their shadowy, dangerous world of excise men, sea caves and illicit cargo. Forced to sign on for a voyage (\"You've got to become one of us, so as if you give us away you'll be in the same boat,\" explains Marah Gorsuch, a mesmerizing, larger-than-life night-rider who might be friend or foe), Jim faces hurdle after hurdle. From a skirmish with a British frigate to a nightmarish chase on horseback to run-ins with soldiers and gypsies, the plot stays rip-roaring, and the atmospheric prose (\"the strange moan of the snow-wind\") supplies a polished, literary veneer.

Adrenalin surged through him,\ndissolving the tension and nerves that had accumulated during the four days of\nwaiting. He had an exalted sense of connection to the thoughts of the men\naround him - almost tasting their fear, aggression and blood lust.Will\nreached the front of the riders and led them up to the brow of the hill. His war-horse, an enormous grey stallion,\nrolled its eyes and sidestepped nervously. Will reached forward and stroked the\nstallion's quivering neck, murmuring soothing words. He urged the stallion\nforward and braced himself for the sight of the Morg on the plains below. He\ncould feel his men watching him, drawing their strength and courage from him, and\nwas glad his helmet hid his expression.He could not falter before them.They\nreached the crest of the hill and fanned out there, forming a long line. Will drew his horse to a halt and looked down\nonto the Jade Plains. The\nsight that greeted him made Will gasp. The Morg army was a seemingly endless,\nblack carpet bristling with spears and standards; stretching back and\ndisappearing beyond the hazy southern horizon. It appeared an army from another\nworld - a sea of black cloaked figures carrying broadswords and axes. Many of them rode birds with glowing eyes and\nhooked beaks - the Yangtul. The birds' silver-grey\nfeathers glittered in the morning's sun. Their cries were feral screams that\nmade the hair on Will's neck prickle. It was impossible to get a good look at\nthe Morg from this distance as they shrouded their bodies in cloaks. Only the\nMorg shamans were bareheaded, with gleaming bald skulls and maniacal grins. The\nshamans carried long white-tipped black staffs, and there were scores of them. Will\nrealised with alarm that their own army had only twenty wizards, and it had\nbeen a struggle to find even that number. Magic was far weaker in Orinians than\nin Ennadil and Tarzark. Not only did the Orinian army only possess a limited\nnumber of wizards but they were all cowering at the back of the army, ready to\nflee at the first sign of defeat. They would be little use Will realised\nbitterly.Around\nhim, Will sensed his men's growing panic as they viewed the approaching Morg\nwar machine. If he did not act soon, terror would seize them and they would be\nuseless in battle. Will dug his heals into his warhorse's flanks and rode forward,\nalong the line of riders. His men were frozen to their saddles, gaping in fear\nat the Morg. He drew his sword and held it aloft, gaining their attention.\"Look\nat your enemy!\" He shouted. His voice\nechoed across the valley. \"Don't shrink\naway from them. Look at them! They are our enemy, Isador's enemy! They have taken the Ennadil Territory and\nthey will take ours. We are all that\nstands in their way.\" He paused here a\nmoment, his throat burning. Then, he\nshouted.\"This\nis our land!\"A\ngreat roar went up among the army. It\nrippled through the riders and boomed off the sides of the valley. Will stood up on his stirrups.\"Look\nat them! They have come to rip this land\nfrom us! I will die to protect my home and the wraiths of my ancestors will\nguide my sword as they will guide yours. Are you with me?\"This\ntime the roar was deafening, like rolling thunder. The soldiers drew their\nswords and Will saw that their fear had been replaced with righteous rage. They were savage, terrifying warriors who\nwould follow him willingly to death. Will\nturned his stallion on its haunches and together they charged. In the valley below, gathering like a giant\nblack wave, the Morg army surged forward to meet them.", "related": ["B008UAZQP6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has been instrumental in the contributing development of instructional materials for academic use at the University of Dublin (Ireland) and the University of Anthwerp.  He had had his share of controversies, but always kept steadfast to his goals, and status as an authority on Information Technology, fictional writing, and even musical arts.

The prologue originally was just supposed to be a short story to cope with the murder of a friend of mine. When some of my classmates read it, they loved it and insisted that I wrote more. Every day during class after I finished my classwork or during lunch and at home, I would read over what I previously wrote and then add more. As I wrote, it was like a movie that I was watching in my head and I would write down what I saw. My friends and I would sit in the back of our biology class and I would read what I wrote to them. They were so into it, some of them referred to it as a black soap opera and couldn't wait to know what happened next. Even during the summer, a couple of my friends would call me and ask me to read what I wrote over the phone or tell them what was happening. At the time, I didn't have a computer or laptop, so \"A Thug's Redemption\" was hand written and I would keep the pages inside of a 3 ring binder. Some of the pages would rip at the binder holes, but I managed to keep them all together, which is strange because I am one of the most unorganized people ever. But \"A Thug's Redemption\" was my baby, and I took care of it, kept up with it, and never lost 1 single page. By the time I finished, it was 896 handwritten pages. I was 15 years old and had just written my first REAL novel. It's a feeling I can't describe, even to this day.It was hard finding a publisher and at first I did go with Publish America, but my dream was always to have my own publishing company. I purchased my rights back, did a little research and started making things happen. I am one of the hardest people to impress and what a lot of people don't know is I wrote a book before \"A Thug's Redemption\" when I was 14, called \"Scoochies & Hoochies\". (Don't laugh). It was a juvenile story that I ended up not liking because there was no real plot, just a series of events. So, I scrapped it. I am not easily impressed. But when I read \"A Thug's Redemption\", I find myself holding my breath as if I don't know what will come next even though I do because I wrote it! I feel the emotions of my characters, I see them, I can relate to what they've experienced trying to grow up and survive while living in North Philly. My purpose in writing this book is hoping that my readers will be able to relate to the characters' struggles as well.A lot of Urban Fiction novels glorify the drug game, sex, violence, money, hustling and all the ills that plague our inner city youths. What separates \"A Thug's Redemption\" from a lot of these other tales is, it does not glorify those ills. It speaks of them, but with a lesson to be learned and with a hope that our young black males will be more conscious of their actions and be more aware of the repercussions that comes with their actions. My story gives hope that sometimes you can make it out of a bad situation un-harmed when making the right decisions. But it also teaches the law of Karma and how cause and effect works on the good and bad side of things.In closing, for those who purchase \"A Thug's Redemption\", I will tell you; you will laugh TREMENDOUSLY. You may cry, your heart will race and when reaching the conclusion you may close the book and say: \"Damn...it's really real out here. That could have been me or someone I know...\" But I promise you, you will LOVE this story, and may flip back to the first page to read it again. Thanks for your support.

It is not a traditional fantasy but similar to a fantasy\nwhere fae magic is really a high form of science humans don't quite\nunderstand. This introductory novel is very detailed in explaining the\nhistory of how this came to be and sets up an extensive, very detailed\nworld for the remaining three novels of the serial to use. It is not\nlight reading and would not be a good choice for your first science\nfiction experience. So why read it?Because it will expand your mind into the possibilities of what could be in the realm of reality...Dare to dream of a\nworld where your essence is the start of an adventure--your very core serves\nthose around you and those around you appreciate and love who you truly are.\nVisualize technology derived from your life itself--technology which forms\nitself to serve your needs--technology that does not shape your mind but is\nshaped by it. Add to that a computer which watches over you with parental-like\nconcern and can materialize into existence any form you can visualize. Your\nimagination is the tour guide of your mind. You are imagining a world\nseventy-three light years away. You are imagining Sophista. It's because you\nare a Child of Sophista.The Saeshell Book of\nTime is indeed a live book. Much of the human mind is a giant pattern matching\nneural net. When it cannot find a pattern for a new situation it has\nencountered, it must build a net that matches the pattern of the new data.\nFrequently, there is not enough data to create the pattern. Rather than\nfreezing like a panicked squirrel, it uses a unique device to prevent this--it\nuses \"imagination\" to fabricate data and finish the pattern.The Saeshell Book of\nTime is unique in that it exploits this aspect of the human mind; by refusing\nto complete a pattern essential to the story it forces the reader to complete\nit themselves. It is a function the human mind must perform compulsively. Quite\nsimply, the book is alive because it is made from you--made from your own mind.\nBy each reader completing the pattern, each reader creates a unique experience\nfor themselves. What each reader thinks and says about the book is a reflection\nof who they are. I deliberately implemented this structure in the book to force\nmy target gifted teen audience to argue about the book and what it means or\nwhat its philosophical implications are. Every reader comes away with a\ndifferent concept of the book created by differing mental prejudices they\nbrought with them.One of the\nmischievous pranks I played in the book was to obscure what was science\nfiction\nand science fact. Many times, what appears to be science fiction is\nactually\nscience fact. A good fantasy keeps you guessing so that you are forced\nto\nimagine the whole serial as reality. In that vein, Tova, one of the main\n characters of the book,  is the actual\ncomposition of a number of real people. Some of these high school\nstudents have made major discoveries in genetics and bioscience.The school in the\nbook is based on the slight extension of an existing  school, the\nadvanced mathematics program used in the book a small extension of\nsymbolic\nmanipulation programs currently used in mathematics, the basis for the\nadvanced\nlife form's mind based on an extension of a paper from Cambridge\nNeuroscience...\nThere are many people today, hidden from the public eye, with\nbreathtaking\ntalents and intense emotional sensitivities. Like the Children of\nSophista in the novel, they feel that they would not be well received\nby the public.Leap into the world of The Saeshell Book of Time---learn how it\nfeels to be an advanced mind with an evolved physical form, in the not\ntoo distant future, living among the humans and the political intrigue\nof the present day world.", "related": [], "rank": 3320822, "title": "The Saeshell Book of Time", "author": "Rusty Biesele", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I joined the Royal Navy straight from school, did four years at engineering college and then went to sea for three years in destroyers. I took a commission after that and joined the Fleet Air Arm as a helicopter pilot. I was married, had two kids and now have four grandchildren and one great grandson. I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She loves challenging herself and would write on a dare. On a normal day, she would be found in her herb garden collecting spices for her kitchen or ingredients for her potions; in her huge eclectic Provencal kitchen with the big modern oven cooking pots and pans of food for her family of one husband and three kids (an ardent daughter and two boisterous sons) that'll probably last for weeks; in her library with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and an e-reader in her hands as she reads the latest short story erotic hit; or scribbling pages upon pages of different erotic lifestyles, searching for the one that feels like it was inspired by just the right mix of passion, storyline, and sex. She loves going crazy on weekend nights with the hubby. Aside from these activities, the rest of the time she'd be found in front of her laptop typing the latest Sandra Ross concoction for her readers.", "related": ["B00K92ZHJS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 48, "rating_average": 3.7708, "rating_total": 181.0}

It's 1957, and after winning a boxing match at which he represents the police department, beat cop Moodrow is rewarded with a promotion to the rank of detective. His \"rabbi,\" or mentor, is inspector Pat Cohan, a proud Irish cop who has been on the take for years--a fact Moodrow is unaware of. Cohan allows Moodrow to court his daughter, Kathleen, and the young cop couldn't be happier--until a neighbor asks him to inquire about a homicide that the police don't seem interested in solving. Moodrow soon learns that higher-ups in the department have indeed quashed the investigation, and in his bullheaded way he pursues the few leads on his own, even though airing the complete story will tear his cozy world apart. Solomita offers a well-plotted narrative and nicely evokes New York City a generation ago. This is hard-boiled police fiction at its best.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Food That Really Schmecks immediately became a best-seller, and continues to sell 35 years later. It's more than a book of wonderful recipes - it also describes the Mennonite way of life. The success of that book led to two more Schmecks books and many other cookbooks. Edna has received the Order of Canada among many other awards.Over the years, Edna developed longstanding friendships with many of Canada's greatest writers, including Margaret Laurence, W.O. Mitchell, Sheila Burnford, and Pierre Berton. In 1991 she established The Edna Staebler Award for Creative Non-fiction to recognize the first or second book of a Canadian writer.To Experience Wonderis the first book to explore behind the scenes of this successful writer's life. At the age of 97, Edna leads an active life at her cottage on Sunfish Lake, where she writes, reads, and welcomes the many aspiring writers who come to visit.", "related": [], "rank": 4413142, "title": "To Experience Wonder", "author": "Veronica Ross", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Two technically sound strategies, the segmentation-free and integrated segmentation-recognition strategy, are investigated and algorithms that have worked well in practice are primarily focused on. Baseline systems are initially presented for these strategies and are subsequently expanded on and incrementally improved. The sophisticated algorithms covered include: 1) string sample expansion algorithms which synthesize string samples from isolated characters or distort realistic string samples; 2) enhanced feature representation algorithms, e.g. enhanced four-plane features and Delta features; 3) novel learning algorithms, such as Perceptron learning with dynamic margin, MPE training and distributed training; and lastly 4) ensemble algorithms, that is, combining the two strategies using both parallel structure and serial structure. All the while, the book moves from basic to advanced algorithms, helping readers quickly embark on the study of Chinese handwriting recognition.", "related": [], "rank": 4800784, "title": "Chinese Handwriting Recognition: An Algorithmic Perspective (SpringerBriefs in Electrical and Computer Engineering)", "author": "Tonghua Su", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As if all that weren’t strange enough, investigators soon discover that the identity of the man Miranda has known for almost two months is completely fictional—in a very real sense, the man simply doesn’t exist. Miranda and her partner, David Morgan, are officially unable to work the case, but they work it anyway, off the books, and soon the questions mount up. Could Miranda somehow have murdered the man without remembering it? Or is she victim of an extremely clever frame-up?

He became part of the New Age movement, but found it also lacked essential meaning. So he set out to discover what genuine spiritual truths might still exist in this modern day­—a task that lasted twelve years and spanned the Western Hermetic tradition, Sufism, and several Eastern traditions. From this work he developed the Fool’s Journey, a synthesis of perennial spiritual teachings, which will appear in a forthcoming book.The Universe Is Fakeis one approach to this material for those not especially religious or even spiritual. He gives workshops and teaches classes on these and related subjects.Mr. Cameron recorded a CD of original music,Memories of Home, using ancient tunings from Sumer that date back five thousand years.The Universe Is Fakeis his second book.

I was born in El Paso, Texas, but raised predominately in Oklahoma City, with a few places in between (Georgia, New Jersey, Arizona, Kansas). I moved to San Diego, California in 1980. In 1989, I moved to Santa Barbara, California where I completed my Bachelor of Arts in Film at Brooks Institute of Photography in 1992. I moved to Las Vegas, Nevada in 2003 where I completed my Masters in Education in 2005 through the University of Phoenix online program. While I worked 25 years in Insurance, and 13 years in Hospitality, I gained a few credits in the Entertainment Industry. My credits in video production include the management of “The Newport '69 Pop Festival” footage; with many famous artists from the sixties pop culture such as Mother Earth, Grassroots, The Smiths and Jimi Hendrix. This brought me many private and exclusive dealings with the Jimi Hendrix Estate, The Experience Museum owned by Bill Gates, and ISIS Productions in London. I have also produced videos for clients such as the Santa Barbara Historical Museum, David H. Murdock, and his Arabian horse farm \"Ventura Farms\" in Thousand Oaks, California. It was here I shot a PSA for the National Association of Handicapped Riders, with Ronald and Nancy Reagan. I began writing at the age of sixteen, and have several life long projects (Short stories, Screenplays, Poems & Novels). Life seems to push you in the direction it wants you to go, only to realize you’ve been on the path you’ve needed to be on the entire way. I lost my father in 2001 to heart disease, and my mother in 2010 to colon cancer. Most of my personal relationships have been short lived. I did not officially come out as a gay man until I was thirty-four, and I still consider myself a late bloomer. I have always forged forward despite life’s attempts to keep me down and away from what I most desire. I have three beautiful sisters, seven awesome nieces and nephews, and five grand nephews! I’ve met and made friends with some pretty spectacular people. My love for a beautiful angel brought me back to my writing, and what I learned through this (again) life long project, was that I have learned a lot about myself, life and love. Mostly, I feel like I finally learned how to write. I’m very proud of myself in its completion and am excited to finally become a published author, even if it’s of my own making.

She solved both\nproblems while listening to Green Day's new CD and Hunter's drum moves on top\nof it. There's an open audition for a drummer with a band who has an actual\nrecord playing on the alternative radio stations and Hunter plans to line up at\nthe crack of dawn Saturday to have his chance. Until then, it's all about the\nmusic.     She\nprops her chin in her hand and watches Hunter roll through a series of beats,\nending with a crash of symbols. Then he flips his sticks into the air, spins on\nhis seat, and catches them. When he looks at her, he's smiling and she can see\nthe fire in his eyes. For Hunter, it's always been all music all the time. Even\nshe makes more of an impression in the songs he writes than in hislife. And she's OK with that. Sort of.     She\nprobably shouldn't be. Sometimes she wonders if they ever really progressed\nfrom friends to boyfriend-girlfriend. It's almost two months since their first\nkiss and she still has trouble thinking of him like that.     \"Hey.\"\nHunter rises from his drum set and crashes on the bed beside her. \"You're\nfrowning,\" he says. \"It wasn't bad, was it? I practiced that song for hours. I\nmean, that'sthesong.\"     \"For\nthe audition?\"     \"Yeah.\nEvery drummer gets one song.\"     \"I\nthink it's great. I like'Bleeding Love'better, though.\" Her cell phone is set up to play the Leona Lewis tune instead\nof the standard ring.     \"Because\nit's a drippy love song,\" Hunter says. \"I need a song with the moves that will\nshow my style.\"     Loud, thunderous songs,\nshe thinks. Genny likes the ballads he writes, even if they sound angry, rather\nthan soft, and the words sometimes make her feel like she's balanced on the tip\nof a knife, waiting for that slide down the blade.     She\nrealized a few weeks ago, listening to Hunter perform his latest love song,\nthat she was waiting for him to declare his feelings for her. But so far his\nsongs are all about how temporary love is, how the human heart seems \"to have\nwings, like a bird/cutting through the sky/the distance between you and I/a\nfrayed and snapping ribbon.\"     The\nwords really bothered her. Still do. Which only means that she's conflicted.\nShe wants him to love her. And then she doesn't. She wants to be someone's\ngirl, but maybe not his.     \"Why\ndon't you use one of the songs you wrote?\" she asks.     He's\nshaking his head. \"No way. I don't want to blow this.\"     \"Your\nsongs are good,\" she insists.     \"But\nGreen Day is better,\" Hunter says. He rolls over and wraps an arm around her\nwaist. \"And you're the best.\"     He\nlowers his head and presses his lips against hers. It's this moment Genny wishes\nshe could change.Shouldn't I be burning\nup with passion? Shouldn't I feel something? Something other than the brush of\nhis whiskers against my cheek? Something on the inside that makes mewanthim?     \"Hey,\nyou with me?\" His face is just inches from hers. His blue eyes are cloudy.     No,\nshe's not with him, but she wants to be.     She\ndoesn't like disappointing Hunter. They've been friends for so long. . .     She\npulls his head closer, until his lips, cool and full and soft, meet hers.Why doesn't the room feel like an oven?She\nwonders.Why can't I want him like that?     Hunter\ndeepens the kiss, rolls her onto her back and pushes her lips open. His tonguefeelslike a tongue. Wet and warm and\ntotallynotwhat she wants in her\nmouth.     Hunter\nis her first real boyfriend so she has only what she's heard other girls say to\ngo on. And this definitely isn't it. Serena, her BFF, says Victor's kisses give\nher fever.     Hunter\nis bolder today than ever before. She feels his hand move from her hip and over\nher blouse. When it makes it to her breast, she waits for her blood to heat up.\nOne beat, two,ten,but her pulse continues\nto move along with the speed of a tortoise.       I am not an ice princess.She\nknows some of the boys at Fraser call her that behind her back.     She\nis saved from finding an excuse to push out of his arms by his mother's voice.\nShe bellows Hunter's name into the small apartment, then the front door closes\nwith a slam. There is nothing quiet about the woman. Hunter's mother is thin\nand stands about five feet two, but she has a chip on her shoulder the size of\nNebraska and doesn't mind sharing it every chance she gets. This includes a\nlong-winded whine about the job she wishes she had to the lengthy hours her\ntoes have spent pinched inside her pumps.     Genny\nbreaks loose and rolls off the bed in one fluid motion. She slides her feet\ninto her high-tops, her hair out of her eyes, and practically vaults to the\nwindow, where she pauses for a moment and looks back at Hunter. He's sitting on\nthe edge of the bed; confusion makes his face soft.     \"Your\nmother's home,\" she says, but it sounds weak even to her.     \"You\ndon't have to leave,\" he protests.     She\nopens the window. \"It's almost nine o'clock,\" she points out. \"I can't be late\nagain.\" She swings a leg over the sill and ducks outside. The metal beneath her\nfeet is rusted but sturdy.        Hunter\nmakes it to the window and sticks his head into the open air. \"You OK?\"     \"Yeah.\"\nShe nods, but wonders if Hunter can see that what just happened between them\nmoved her about as much as an ant could move Mt. Rushmore.What is wrong with me?\"But I need to go.\"     The\nfire escape is nothing new to her, but she admits, to herself anyway, that this\nis the grandest act of avoidance she's committed since she started dating\nHunter. She's never left his place through the window. But other than a few\nkisses, Hunter's nevertouchedher\nbefore.     And\nit doesn't feel right.     She\ndescends the three stories smoothly, riding the ladder to street level with her\nsneakers glued to the bottom rung. She's had a lot of practice--she's been free running\nfor four years, rooftop to rooftop, high above the city. Hunter will never join her. In addition to his\nfear of dying young and tragically--all the greatest musicians do--he has a\ngenuine fear of heights.     Genny\nis as graceful as a ballerina and as strong as Paul Bunyan and she likes it\nthis way. Being the offspring of a super model and a professional home run\nslugger should have its advantages. The clothes are great--she's wearing a\nfifteen hundred dollar Versace blouse right now and the color is the truest\nmatch to her purple-blue eyes that she's ever found--but the physical attributes\nshe inherited from her father are better. She's captain of her high school\nvolleyball team and can throw a curve ball that makes the boy's baseball coach\nscream.     She\nlaughs as she hops off the ladder and lands squarely on the sidewalk.     She\nthinks she might try bungee jumping this summer. Solo. Hunter might watch, a\nsafe distance from the edge of the bridge. Her mom and dad think the sport is\nsuicide. Serena doesn't do anything that will mess up her 'do.'     \"Hey!\"     Genny\nlooks up. Hunter is smiling. That was the first thing she noticed about him,\nthe first day of ninth grade--he grins and it takes up his whole face. Not many\npeople are that committed to happiness.     His\nblond hair, curly and long enough it gets in his face, catches the light from\nthe street lamp and looks like sunshine.     \"What?\"     \"Bring\nyour guitar to school tomorrow.\"     \"Really?\"       She's\nno good at playing the guitar. Hunter taught her a few chords, mostly so that\nshe can play harmony to his crazy drum moves, but her limited skill doesn't\nseem to bother him.     \"I\nhave a new song I want to try out,\" he explains.     She\nshrugs. \"OK.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My first book back was non-fiction called ‘How to be a Great Employee ’, a book which companies give to their staff. It has enjoyed excellent success and is being used by such corporations as AT &T;, Simmons Mattress and Morton’s Salt to inspire and occasionally amuse their staff. A stage play followed called Hating!Dating! which I have had the great joy of seeing in several professional theater productions.     Patterns is my first novel in 25 years. It begs the question: what happens to society when reality as we know it is shaken by a series of unexplained events?  The novel doesn't quite fit any genre perfectly, it is psychological, somewhat of a thriller, and the book is quirky and humorous in parts.  Two more novels, a sequel to Patterns called Miracles: The Tribunal of 8 and The Afterlife Meddler’s Society will be available in 2014.", "related": [], "rank": 3642125, "title": "Patterns eBook", "author": "Thomas Smith", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His first attempt started as a 42-page character profile which expanded into a full-fledged story line. This initial dabbling was worked and reworked over a twenty year time frame eventually evolving into a series of not one, but nine books. Since writing those nine books, he decided to try his hand at a more classic trilogy, which has become Jeremiah Stone. The story surrounding Jeremiah Stone takes the theme from the Bible’s Book of Job and places it in a world where angels and demons exist alongside mortals. The modern day adventure series follows the choices a man makes in life if he were given a single gift from both God and the Devil. Imagine the possibilities of what those two gifts could be. In addition to these series, S Scott Twigg has written a romance novel, two sci-fi adventure stories named Dream Savior and The Burden of Immortality, and a coffee table book called Determination containing several short stories and life-lesson snippets. Jeremiah Stone, Limbus, Azazel, and Beginnings are the first of his novels to be published. S. Scott Twigg is a native of Washington State, where he is married and has one son.", "related": [], "rank": 3991561, "title": "The Ferryman: An Opus Wright Novel", "author": "S.

I’m a cat lover and a former retail slave. I slung gasoline and cigarettes at people for five years while I wrote my first 20 (published) stories and I can safely say that I NEVER want to do that again. In fact, if I can avoid any real deal-with-the-general-public jobs in the future, I will. I am very definitely not cut out for retail. I’ve been writing since I was seven years old, when I wrote what was arguably the only novel I’ve ever written. It was called “And Jessie, Too” because the title fit? I don’t even remember what my justification was for giving it that title, but what I do remember is the heap of trouble I got in with the school when one of my teachers discovered the notebook that the first half of the story was scribbled in. You see, AJT was about a seven year old sociopathic serial killer that was going around and killing students at Hayes Elementary. I named names. It wasn’t so much because I hated my classmates- at that point, I’d been given no reason to- as it was that I’d not developed my writing enough quite yet to be able to come up with new and interesting character names.  Hell, Jessie even killed Emma Westlund, I mean, come on. I obviously wasn’t planning to kill my classmates. I’d simply begun reading Fear Street.  I was a very prolific writer from age 7 to about age 13, when I stopped really trying and instead focused on video games and Sailor Moon. I didn’t really create anything original until I was 16 and began keeping a travel diary during a road trip with my mom. We went to Vegas, by way of South Dakota, Wyoming, Utah, and finally Nevada.  After that trip I began toying with an idea that eventually became Paper Dolls. My mom had put the idea of “real” anime characters walking around. With massively disproportionate eyes and mouths that could do things that aren’t found in nature. The original draft was 25 pages of 9 point font before I dropped the project because I grew bored of it.  When I was 21 I started reading books again and I started work on Paper Dolls. On May 31st of 2011 I went to a Caribou Coffee and uploaded Paper Dolls to Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It took six years to pen the first draft to this book because I needed that time and space to get to a point in my grieving where I could dive into the character influenced by my twin brother. When I was able to do that, the writing experience was fast and therapeutic. From my perspective the entire writing process helped me work through his loss and the story itself has a valuable message for all those that grieve. Concerning how this book relates to other pieces, love is the universal message. We are here to be love and to share love with those around us.

It is a story\nthat gives hope to those who face hardships in their service for the\nLord.  Most of all it shows that God's love for us brings unexpected\ngifts in unexpected ways.  We just need to learn to trust Him!How Many of us have started down a road we knew God\nput us on, only to find that not far up the road there's a road block?  A\n trial we just don't understand.  Why would God burden us for a work\nonly to have us run into a problem that keeps us from it?  Learning that\n God's ways are not our ways, and trusting that His ways are higher than\n ours, is a journey of growth in our spiritual lives.  When that lesson\nincludes physical, mental and emotional hardships we wonder why God\nallows such things to happen. Why doesn't He heal us, or take the\nproblem away?  At some point God opens our eyes and we discover that\nthrough these hardships God creates a different way for us to serve Him,\n and though our \"thorn in the flesh\" may never be taken away, we can\nstill find great joy in God's true plan for our lives.-Amy Broyhill Ward", "related": ["B00KG252XM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That's right I said have because my imaginary friends never left. As to young people I understand that in this transitional phase before adulthood the things that were cool when you were a child if you still think they are cool it's not cool to admit it. As an adult . . . well let's just say what I understand about being a grownup isn't worth mentioning. As to chickens I am the founder, owner, and operator of D. V. B. Nonprofit Chicken Ranch. Our motto is, We are not a 501 (c) (3) charity. It's just we've not been making a profit since 2006 and are darn proud of it! This is also how long I've had chickens in my employ. That's right I said employ. My chickens are a unionized workforce and are members of the Backyard Chicken Laborers local #1. That means they get full medical benefits, paid vacation, and full retirement. Medical means when one gets sick I take them to the vet. Paid vacations means when they molt in the winter and egg production drops I do not take measure to force them to produce eggs such as putting a light in the coops. Retirement means that when they stop laying eggs, a condition known as hen-a-pause, they can live out their life and not worry about going into the stew pot. My close association with the flock means I have a fair understanding of the health and well being of chickens. I understand not only their biological and physical needs but psychological and spiritual needs.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Having never heard of this author but reading the blurb which interested me I wondered what I would find.

She says she gets nervous when her book went out 'out there' in the hands of other peoples, I understand that a lot having read alongside Indie authors for a while now. Putting that aside I cannot allow it to sway me from the actual book and story telling though.My email told her I LOVED it, I really did love this book. The flashbacks that Lexi got even in moments of tenderness what heart wrenching. The dialogue was great in the book, kept me really entertained between the girls before she left for a trip. Very entertaining characters, very real life like people. Lexi has a lot to contend with from her past, awful things. And every now and again throughout the book we took a glance of some of her sufferings when being brought up and about her mother and brother. It was glimpses that made me continue to read, always wondering when the full story would be revealed. If I had any downfall in this book, it was to say that Lucca is just a little too perfect.The book leaves you with a cliff hanger. It goes slightly into the next read, so now, I am hanging on the edge of my seat wondering ......what next!!!!

Mike’s first two novels, Melting Point 2040 and Secession 2041, tell action-suspense stories of a future America segregating toward division. He is currently writing a third novel in that series describing a pathway toward reuniting the nation around a common but politically neglected moral principle. While set in the same time span as the trilogy, Suicide Escape is intended to be able to be read and understood independently of those novels. The story focuses on what is, unfortunately, a timeless challenge.

Like all great fiction, this book introduces the reader to people, places and unique circumstances, unknown and hard to believe at first, but we are taken in and swept away by this extraordinary story.

He didn't count on a mutual attraction to get in the way.BEND BUT NEVER BREAK is about a mother who will face the monster from her worst nightmare in order to reach her daughter. It's about a woman who may have been a victim of a fierce attack in the past, but she completes self defense training to ensure it never happens again. Rachel's Wilful ThoughtsThe characters are richly detailed, with a clear sense of good guys versus bad guys. The storyline is solid with the romance serving as the icing on the cake without too much detail. It is first and foremost a story of suspense, as the twists and turns provide the reader with an interesting diversion because nothing is quite what it seems. Teasing and twisting storyline, as much a thriller as a romantic novel.  Down to earth characters give this book an eerie sense of reality. I couldn't put the book down once I started to read it and eagerly await the author's next book.

Besides being a writer, she is an artist. One can often find her \"makin' love to the color\" (painting) with loud music blaring. Her goal as an author is to make readers laugh, cry, think, and become intimately connected with her main characters.
