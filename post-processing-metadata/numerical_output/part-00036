He has no idea where he's going or why he has to go there--he just knows he has to go. Atop his lovingly built Harley, he takes off into the mountains. After staying the night in a travel trailer with a kind couple, he starts off again, only to end up careening down the mountainside, victim of a hit-and-run. When he wakes, he swears he's either dead or has a serious head injury. How else can he explain the elves, half-elves, and other bizarre beings that suddenly intrude on his happy-but-weird existence?When the itch to move on starts up again, however, John knows he can't stay. With the promise that he'll return, especially to his new lover, he heads off into the sunset. During his travels, he meets a drunken but proud dwarf--Hemas--and together they continue on toward White Palace, the city John feels himself drawn to. What he finds there, however, is only the beginning.This is one of the most awesome fantasy stories I have ever read. I stayed up ‘til odd hours of the morning, then jumped back on again to finish.

She tossed back her hair, which fell in golden waves across her shoulders, then put an index finger to her lips, as though to nervously bite her nail. Oh, yes, he liked the shy schoolgirl routine, and Valentina could pass for a freshman, too, though she was nearly twenty-eight.\"Hi, there. You must be Ms. Haspel,\" he said, drawing in his sagging gut and probably wishing his thinning hair were two shades darker.She reached across the desk and accepted his hairy paw. \"It's nice to meet you, Mr. Leonard, and thanks for the interview.\"\"Well, as I said, we only have one position to fill, so the competition is fierce. Please have a seat.\"She settled down and leaned toward his desk, keeping her blue eyes locked on his. \"Can I ask a question before we start?\"\"By all means.\"\"Does the company have a sexual-harassment policy?\"His lip twitched. \"Of course.\"\"Well, I've had some problems in the past.\"\"I'm sorry to hear that.\"\"Yeah, the one guy was married and claimed I was a stalker, which was totally not the case. The other guy kept saying I was making lewd remarks. He even said I flashed my panties, and there's no way I did that.\"He hesitated. \"Are you serious?\"\"Yes. I like to get dressed up for work. It doesn't mean I want to have sex with everyone I see.\"He cleared his throat. \"Of course not. But you should know that we have a dress code. Business casual.\"Valentina nodded and gazed salaciously at him. \"Is what I'm wearing okay?\"He swallowed before answering.* * *HANSEN was sitting in an SUV parked outside the four-story office building. The complex was comprised of ten equally nondescript buildings: the headquarters for a lengthy list of companies that were, according to an intel report, \"assembling stacked layers of silver and nonconducting magnesium fluoride and cutting out nanoscale-sized fishnet patterns to form metamaterials.\"Grim had explained that metamaterials held the key to developing cloaking devices to render objects invisible to humans. Leonard's company in particular was developing paint for military vehicles and fabric for military uniforms. This was all quite serious business, which was why Hansen could only shake his head as he listened to Maya and Leonard. What the hell was she doing? All she had to do was get hired.Admittedly, she'd hated the tired old plan of playing dress up to ensure Leonard took the bait, so overplaying the role was her way of protesting. She wouldn't just be the attractive new hire; she was now the quirky sex addict who'd called way too much attention to herself. Hansen was a breath away from reporting her misconduct to Grim, but then he thought better of it and just sat there as Maya told Leonard she was always available for overtime and \"after-hours\" work. Hansen grimaced.* * *AT 10:05 A.M. Nathan Noboru parked his utility van at the curb outside William Leonard's seven-thousand-square-foot home. Sprawling front lawns, well-manicured grounds, and tree-lined brick-paved driveways unfurled to a grand entrance shadowed by twenty-foot columns painted in a glossy antique white. This part of southwest Houston was called Sugar Land, and it was sweet indeed: Multimillion-dollar homes were nestled among well-tended golf course greens and tranquil lakes. The senior citizen manning the neighborhood guardhouse had taken a perfunctory glance at Noboru's forged work orders and immediately waved him through.With a sigh, Noboru grabbed his utility belt and started up the driveway. But then he slowed, furtively glanced around, and scratched his crew cut. He gazed out past the lawn toward the neighboring home, another mansion where an old man in a pink shirt and oversized sunglasses stood near his Mercedes, preparing to load a golf bag into his trunk.Off to Noboru's left lay another spectacular three-story château with a tremendous brick facade and five-car garage. Noboru studied the windows, trying to spot the lens of a telescopic camera or other such observation device. Nothing. He continued on, but something wasn't right.Or was that just his paranoia? Again. They weren't after him anymore. He had a new life now. He needed to believe that.Noboru shifted up to the front door, made a call, heard the phone ring inside the house, and then he tapped a series of numbers into his phone and heard the rapid ringtone of the alarm being disarmed. He took out his double-sided lock-pick set and got to work. Three, two, one: The door opened—And if the explosions hadn't started at the back of the mansion, he would've already been dead.Twin thunderclaps resounded, and the ground literally shook beneath his feet as the door slammed back toward him, knocking him to the ground.He rolled over, shot to his feet, and sprinted down the driveway. He might as well have been back in Kao-hsiung, chased through the crowded streets by Horatio and Gothwhiler, the night air humid, the sweat pouring down his face. Several more explosions ripped through the house, and he stole a look over his shoulder as huge windows burst outward, sending showers of glass to the driveway while flames shot through the holes and wagged like dragons' tongues.He reached the van and whirled around. Clouds of black smoke backlit by more roaring flames now devoured the entire mansion, while fiery debris floated down like confetti and got trapped in the thick canopy of leaves and limbs.The old man who'd been loading his golf clubs was now backing out of his driveway. He stopped, climbed out of his car, and hurried over while dialing a number on his phone.Noboru's mouth fell open. This was supposed to be a pathetically simple entry to place electronic eyes and ears. In fact, he'd balked over how rudimentary the whole operation was (he was entering through the front door!) and had loathed the fact that Director Grimsdóttir was wasting his talents on such a menial task. He had only been employed by Third Echelon for less than a year, but didn't his four years with Japan's Special Operations Group, its own Delta Force, count for anything?Apparently not…; but what was going on now?Were Horatio and Gothwhiler tailing him? Did they know he'd be here? Were they trying to finish the job? If the others learned about them, about Noboru's real past, he would never be trusted. Grimsdóttir had promised him a new identity, a new life, and utter secrecy.A voice crackled in the nickel-sized subdermal embedded in the skin behind his ear; it was the Grim Reaper herself. \"Nathan, I'm looking at the satellite feed—\"\"I know! I know!\" Noboru ran back to the van and yanked open the door. \"Ma'am, you'd better call Hansen!\"* * *VALENTINA was about to stand and thank Leonard for the interview when the man's BlackBerry rang.\"Please, let me take this, but wait,\" he said. \"I want to introduce you to the rest of my staff.\"\"All right.\"He shifted away from the desk and headed toward the window.Suddenly, Hansen's voice came through her subdermal. \"Maya, get out of there. Now!\"Even as she gasped, Leonard cried, \"What? Oh, my God!\" into his phone.\"I'm sorry, Mr. Leonard, I need to go.\"With that she started for the door, which suddenly took a bullet, the wood splintering as she ducked and craned her neck to see two more rounds punch through the office window, the first striking Leonard in the chest, the second in the shoulder. Blood sprayed across the back wall as Valentina dropped to her hands and knees, drew her SC pistol from her purse, and crawled toward the door.She chanced a look back at Leonard, lying there, bleeding, reaching out to her, his mouth working, a word barely forming: \"Please…; \"ALLEN Ames was on the building's roof when the shooting began. He'd been up there only as an observer, gathering intel on the comings and goings of visitors to the building and hoping to get some up-close-and-personal pics of at least two of Mr. Leonard's \"special\" friends from Beijing.Ames felt at home on rooftops. He'd grown up in Brooklyn and had spent years atop apartment buildings, hanging out with his friends, getting drunk, and dreaming of a better life that would help him forget about the fire…; about the screams from Mom and Dad, about Katy's face at the window, looking at him, coughing…; until she fell backward into the flames.Now, twenty years after that fateful night, Ames was staring down through the telescopic sight of his sniper rifle. The shooter had set up on the roof of a building across the street from Leonard's and had only revealed himself to take the shots. He'd been in Ames's sight for all of two heartbeats before he'd vanished behind the air-conditioning units. Ames had been on the roof since sunrise, and he'd neither seen nor heard the shooter's approach, so the man might have been there even longer and had obviously cloaked his heat signature.Ames cursed, slung the rifle over his shoulder, and muttered, \"I'm going after the shooter.\"The SVT, or subvocal transceiver, a butterfly-shaped adhesive patch on Ames's throat, just north of his Adam's apple, picked up his voice so it c...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the beginning of the story, Lenny is dominating his victim and mentally torturing him. Not for long though, because Lenny puts a gun to his victims head and pulls the trigger. Melinda reads about the homicide in the newspaper. This former FBI agent currently teaches courses in criminal psychology at the local University. Although she is thoroughly embroiled in family crises, Melinda still finds time to keep up with her profession. It appears the author is setting the stage for Melinda to become a sort of private investigator who uses her knowledge to capture dangerous criminals. While this is a fairly interesting premise, starting the story with an ugly sadistic murder soured this tale for me. --Amazon Top ReviewerThe opening chapter of this crime fiction novel sets up the classic structure for a cop-vs-serial killer scenario. We meet the serial killer, Lenny Malcolm, a loner whose job as a grocery bagger in a Northern Virginia suburb makes it easy for him to spot abusive fathers. He then stalks and kills them, seeing this as his vengeance against the stepfather who abused him as a child. The cop is Melinda Bennett, a retired FBI agent whose former colleague consults her after the second murder occurs. Then Bennett's grown daughter Jane and little grandson Zeke, moves back home because Jane's unpleasant, possibly abusive, husband has dumped her for another woman. Thus, barely 20 pages into the book it's obvious that the soon-to-be-ex fits the profile of ideal victim for Lenny and Bennett will become involved in the case. (That's not exactly how it happens-but close enough.) Not just the plot falls victim to the obvious. Although the language is smooth, the style is repetitious and the final result is a slow-paced, didactic story with very little suspense-except when you keep wondering why the cops in the book would allow Bennett to be so intimately and extensively involved in an ongoing investigation that involves her own family --manuscript review by Publishers Weekly, an independent organization", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My husband very sweetly told me I could get fat(ter), saggy(er), blotch(ier), and my pores could continue to expand like crop circles all over my face and to him, I would still be the relatively young and desirable woman he married. Bless him. My mother simply took issue with the idea that older women were no longer hot, and chided me for putting myself down.That’s when I realized I needed to clarify my mission, and now that Formerly Hot the blog has grown intoMy Formerly Hot Life, the book, I’ll take this opportunity to do so again.The book is not a marathon fishing-for-compliments trip (although I won’t be turning any down). I know I still look fine, and on a good day, great. I wholeheartedly agree with my mom’s estimation that a woman’s hotness is not necessarily inversely proportional to how many candles she has on her birthday cake.I wrote the book to have a laughing look at the unvarnished truth about getting older--the good, the bad, and those unexpected b----slaps that still seem to come out of nowhere, even if you’re relatively well adjusted to the fact that you’re not forever 21. It’s about those moments--whether it’s when you’re the one wishing your neighbors would turn down the damn music because it’s after 10 (can \"kids these days, sheesh!\" be far off now?), or when you’re bracing yourself for the whistle from the construction crew that never comes--when it is suddenly ultra clear that you’re occupying an entirely new category of human being.When I first realized I was a Formerly--the term I came up with to indicate that you’re formerly what you were, but you may not be quite sure what you are yet--my main indicator was how far away I had moved from the standard perfectly symmetrical, thin, perky-boobed female ideal (not that I had ever arrived.) It became pretty clear pretty quickly that this whole Formerly transformation had only partly to do with my looks. In fact, the shift was much more profound.And wonderful. The longer I spent on this side of young, the more obvious it became that Formerly Territory was a much happier place to live, for me and the hundreds of women I spoke to about it. There are distinct upsides to being a Formerly, ones that no one talks about. I used to feel like a composite of other people’s opinions of me; now, I am comfortable with who I am, and other people’s opinions are, well, just their opinions. I follow my instincts, what’s comfortable for me, rather than what I think I \"should\" do or what everyone else seems to think is the move. Life feels less intense, less dramatic, more relaxed and peaceful.  In other words, time passes. Things change. And that’s cool.Except when it’s not. Getting older, even if you’re not old, can sometimes suck! It would be nice not to have to look up every texting abbreviation someone sends to me before replying, for instance. I used to know such things. I’m not going to tell you that I welcome every wrinkle and pucker as a symbol of the rich and wise life my trusty body and I have lived happily together. I am regularly shocked by the new iteration of me that stares back from the mirror. I promise never to intone that you must \"embrace your life changes,\" or that 50 is the new 40 is the new 30 is the new 29. You are what you are but you don’t always have to be smiling about it.On balance, though, even as I’m letting go of the stuff I thought was indispensable to happiness when I was younger, I’m happier than my younger self ever could have imagined. That’s whatMy Formerly Hot Lifeis about--laughing at ourselves and our obsession with youth, even as we see that life is so much richer on the other side of young. The women I’ve spoken to for the book wouldn’t trade where they are today for another chance for a teenager’s body, and that’s a message I hope the readers of this book can carry with them for all their days.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 3.8, "rating_total": 38.0}

Her story is narrated by her unnamed son, 15, who is growing up Canadian suburb with his mother, his elder brother and his South Asian-descended father, Roger, as Adele slides into early-onset dementia. Within 40 pages, Roger is killed in an industrial accident, and the narrator's brother, an aspiring poet, leaves home after Adele ceases to recognize him. After the narrator himself tries to leave but returns, he finds Adele now cared for by a dubious caretaker named Meera. In an embedded narrative, Chariandy unravels the hidden tragedies of Adele's youth, which included an encoutner with the spectre of the book's title. As the narrator seeks a sense of his family's history and an understanding of what his mother's Soucouyant experience actually amounted to, he grows closer to Meera, who brings baggage of her own. Adele's, Meera's and the narrator's relationships with their mothers intersect affectingly in this haunting coming-of-age story.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet we lack a full understanding of how and why it operates as it does, and in particular of the political forces that affect it. In The International Monetary Fund in the Global Economy, Mark Copelovitch makes the case that the IMF's behavior responds to the interests represented by the major financial powers, as well as to the goals of the IMF's professional staff. Copelovitch presents a series of clear-headed, theoretically grounded arguments, then subjects them to empirical assessment. He analyzes an original database of 197 IMF programs over twenty years, and then provides two extensive country studies, of IMF relations with Mexico and Korea in the 1980s and 1990s. Both the statistical analysis and the detailed narratives provide compelling evidence for Copelovitch's political economy arguments. The International Monetary Fund in the Global Economy is a careful, persuasive application of the ideas and methods of modern political economy to a crucially important topic. It will be of interest to any serious scholar or student of international political economy, international relations, and international economics.\"Jeffry Frieden, Professor of Government, Harvard University\"This is an outstanding piece of political science that combines richly detailed case studies based on primary documents with impressive quantitative results.  Copelovitch argues convincingly that banks heavily influence IMF lending, but their influence depends on the composition of capital flows and the consistency of the interests of the major powers.\"Randall Stone, Associate Professor of Political Science, University of Rochester\"This book represents a major contribution to the growing literature on the IMF and, more generally, to the understanding of the political economy of international organizations. Using an original 'common agency' perspective, Mark Copelovitch presents an innovative way to address decision-making at the international financial institutions, which is driven both by the major shareholder governments and by the bureaucratic staff of these organizations. Copelovitch shows that both the intensity and the heterogeneity of the preferences of the IMF's major shareholders determine whether a country will receive favorable treatment from the institution. The book furthermore shows that the nature of IMF lending has changed because of major historical shifts in patterns of international financing from concentrated sovereign bank lending to decentralized portfolio investment and bank lending to the private sector. The greater collective action problems generated by these new forms of international finance force the IMF to make larger loans with more extensive conditionality in order to reassure global markets. Copelovitch substantiates his theoretical claims with both sophisticated statistical analysis and detailed case studies. This is a must-read for both scholars of international political economy and policy-makers interested in the IMF's evolving role in the global financial system.\"James Raymond Vreeland, School of Foreign Service and Government Department, Georgetown University and author of The IMF and Economic Development (Cambridge, 2003)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has held workshops in Las Vegas, Reno, and Atlantic City wherein he’s coached hundreds of successful Craps Players. He also loved his Handicapping Sessions where he had steady group of bettors attending, and he led the discussions of the day’s Horse Races. The “King of Sports” was fast becoming another favorite form of gambling. He became a computer programmer because he couldn’t find any computer software for winning at the races. He wrote a successful program that exposed qualified long shots and made lots of money. Although he has many other interests (and books to match), he seems most comfortable within the Gambling World!  He was first introduced to his favorite pastime while serving in the Air Force during the early years of the Viet Nam war. It won’t surprise you to learn that it was during that period where precious time away from the conflict was spent on diversions. Playing various card and dice games were the favorites. He eventually became proficient in Backgammon, Poker, and his true passion: Craps. After the war, his ability to succeed in those games led him to Nevada where he learned the casino business. It was during his years as a dealer that he left behind his “street game” and learned to win within the confines of the casino rules… and any Craps player can tell you “that’s not easy”! He took off for three years to pursue the ponies from coast to coast. The excitement of the racing was great… the nights in hotels or motels weren’t! So, he returned to the Pacific Northwest where he played at the local tracks, and took occasional trips to Nevada. It was about this time when Casinos in Oregon and Washington began to pop up, and once again, he was immersed in Craps! Today, he operates several Websites, Blogs, and a Membership site on his favorite subject… you guessed it: Gambling!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dr. Scraper was one of my students at the University of Nebraska at Kearney in graduate Logotherapy courses. He demonstrated a thorough understanding of the Franklian approach to psychotherapy, and I profited from our discussions of Christian spiritual formation. He lives what he teaches. You will experience healing and growth from Dr. Scraper's insights in this book. He speaks to the two major predicaments we encounter every day: 1) People are pursuing pleasure and thrills and coming up empty. You will learn here how to seek meaning and discover the mystery of excitement and fulfillment. 2) Like most people you are probably faced with battles against evil, both in the world and in your own heart. This book will give you practical, specific helps in overcoming evil as you intentionally travel through three stages in the maturation of your Christian faith. I recommend you pick up this book AND that you prepare yourself for major challenges and some surprises! --Paul R. Welter, Ed.D., Diplomate, Viktor Frankl Institute of LogotherapyThe Rev. Dr. Randy Scraper has written a remarkable treatise highlighting the necessity for establishing a meaning matrix for Christian spiritual formation. He parallels the classical Three Ways of the spiritual path with the tenets inherent in the philosophy/psychology of Viktor Frankl s Logotherapy. Logos (Word) becomes Meaning for Frankl. If the aim of the Three Ways is Union with God, Logotherapy aims at wholeness -- integration of body, mind, and spirit around a meaning matrix. This visionary work presents an avant-garde approach to spirituality for our time. --Ann Graber, Author", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The billowing cloud\nof smoke that Memphis had seen on the television was dissipating, but the thick\nscent of something burning still filled the air. Mathers glanced over at Memphis as he drove, as if\nsizing him up.

Her work as a phone sex operator and erotic stories author, gives her the opportunity to stimulate both her readers and callers. Giving pleasure is her top priority and one she relishes doing.

She has already written a fictional story for young adults called Mindy's Favorite Room. Ask Elaine is yet another book that is a departure from erotica. It is one she hopes will make a difference in someone's life, when making certain decisions. What means the most personally to Elaine is her book Skippy, a fictional children's story written with the love she feels for her dog who died in 1988. He is forever in her heart.

One can wake up each day to a new truth and focus on it. Each day's devotional message focuses on one verse, the meaning in that verse, and a response to pray back to God, starting with a brief interesting introduction about the \"sons of thunder\" and the transformation of John to the \"disciple whom Jesus loved.\" A must read for those who wish to know the message of the Bible and learn more about Jesus Christ in an easy, uncomplicated way.It was a delight for me to come across a book that was so easy to understand and follow. I enjoyed the light feel of the book and the fact that, for once, the verses from the Bible really made sense to me. My personal favorite to meditate upon was chapter 21 of the book that talks about how we should focus on God's plan for our lives instead of getting distracted by what others are up to. Keeping Christ and his teachings as the center of our lives and following the path chosen by him for us, while trusting his plans for us, will smooth out our lives and help us to lead a joyous and blessed life. A must read for those who wish to focus on Christ's life in a simple and easy way.", "related": ["B004IK8GU4"], "rank": 12509, "title": "The Daily Devotional Series: The Gospel of John", "author": "Kristi Burchfiel", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 17, "rating_average": 4.0588, "rating_total": 69.0}

Yet in exploring-via a peculiar haunting-the powers of belief and imagination, the author of Lorelei and Children of the End turns in an involving yarn, pitching some new twists into an old formula. Nightmares about his youth drive 40-something attorney Jeff Dittimore to return to his childhood town, where further apparitions and uncanny conversations with friends from his past lead him to understand what happened many years earlier, when his two school chums disappeared. Finally, Dittimore joins the apparitions and childhood friends in \"the land of Nod,\" a realm that is both real and not-real, to fight for himself and others against monstrous forces. Through strong characters and atmospheric settings, and by varying Dittimore's present-day, first-person narrative with a few third-person excursions into his protagonist's childhood, Clements delivers yet another soundly told and entertaining, if rather traditional, horror tale.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was a sailor, an airman, a journalist, a travel courier, a cartoonist, and a history teacher. After turning to full-time writing, he wrote adventure stories, war novels, political thrillers, and also created a sequence of crime novels around the quirky French Chief Inspector Pel, centered primarily in Burgundy, but occasionally Paris and elsewhere. Harris was unusually versatile and wide ranging as an author.

I have to admit I was expecting a\nMay-December (summer) romance and almost had that...but Joachim's twist\nof unconditional love prevails.The dialogue is in-depth, the characters' connection is credible and the\n realistic events added to the story are concise. The way Joachim honed\nin on the little idiosyncrasies, adding Norman Fallon (Nina's ex-lover)\nwith a spin of jealousy on Clint's behalf to having Clint disappear from\n Nina's life for a short time, bestowed a fabulous change of events\nmaking me think, \"Oh no, this can't be happening.\"This holiday novel is highly recommended for believers of romance and\ntrue love triumphing over all other issues in life.

In America, he speaks in healing and prophetic seminars, teaching the mechanics of ministry anointing release, and in leadership conferences, ministering to hundreds of pastors. He preaches in many local and regional church conferences, hosting schools of the supernatural, helping to equip the people of God in a release of the miraculous so they can extend the rule of His Kingdom in their own communities. He has made numerous media appearances on Christian television programs and radio shows. As a revivalist, his work is marked with an apostolic/prophetic anointing for the release of God's power. In his revival conferences, one of his main messages is the release of the glory, drawing people into encounters with a mighty God. Ministering in a prophetic flow, he has spoken the personal word of the Lord to thousands individually, producing a greater sense of identity, motivation and clarity of direction. Operating in the revelation gifts of the Spirit, physical conditions are revealed, creating faith to receive healing. He actively hosts international crusades and has preached to crowds of tens of thousands, evangelizing in extremely remote areas of the world, with heavy influence in closed countries of the Middle East and Asia. He has worked with indigenous ministers in establishing many churches worldwide, licensing and ordaining hundreds of pastors. James holds a D.D, a Th.D. and a Ph.D. He has taught for over twenty years in several Bible schools, including Christ for the Nations Institute in Dallas, Texas, and Kingdom Faith Training College in Horsham, England.

When she isn't writing, she might be doing one of these other things: oil painting, graphic design, photography, singing, perfecting her Gollum voice for everyone's amusement, or enjoying nature. Sometimes she mangles some songs with a string instrument and calls it violin playing. Once somebody thought it was a good idea to give her a black belt and a teaching license in Shindoryu Aikijutsu.

While still in grade school, a lady who worked with my mother took us to our first National Quartet Convention where I became an avid fan of southern gospel music.  Since 1977, I have been singing baritone with a local gospel quartet known as the Dayton Ambassadors. Historically the state of Ohio has maintained an active role in the promotion of southern gospel music.  Many gospel artists, including some of the Nation's finest, were either born, or lived a portion of their life, in Ohio.  Development of these ministries and the events that have taken place along the way has become a valuable part of Ohio's history. Over the past two years, desiring to preserve a portion of this history, I have completed extensive research interviewing gospel artists throughout the state.  I then compiled this information into a unique collection of history to be shared with everyone.   To help the reader more fully appreciate \"life on the road\" the stories of these gospel artists are presented within the context of eight road tours covering the entire state of Ohio.  Traveling along on each tour we will experience a variety of emotions from laughter to frustration.  At each stop we will learn some fascinating facts about the town and while in town we'll stop by and visit with a few of those southern gospel artists and/or groups who claim the town as part of their heritage.  Each tour will end with a short walk down memory lane as we view photos of those gospel artists whom we have just visited. So come on!  Open the book, climb on board and prepare yourself for eight exciting tours across the great state of Ohio where we'll meet some truly inspiring people.  Hope you enjoy the book! Richard L.

His father taught school during the winter, and worked in the coal mine during the summer.  Growing up with the disability called dyslexia, Steven had a difficult time reading and writing. So, to compensate, he would pick up picture books and pretend to read while embellishing the stories with his version of what really happened.  Through his teenage years, little children would come to his house from all over his home town, Sugar City, Idaho: population 560, and ask if he could come out to play and tell them stories. One old neighbor lady called him the Pied Piper.  Despite his reading problem, he graduated from college with a Master's Degree in Industrial Education. Steven has taught school, over the last thirty-eight years, in Utah, Idaho, Oregon, Wyoming, and Colorado. All his life, Steven loved to make up stories, but with dyslexia, he knew he would never be able to record them on paper. Then came the great, dyslexia-proof, user-friendly, spell checking, grammar correcting computer, and life started all over again.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She later began a career in real estate wherein she met and became involved with a married man. The experience drew Micalle into deep reflection, compelling her to research similar types of relationships and their effect on all who surround and are involved in an affair. Through her extensive findings, Micalle was inspired to share her research with others and thus, she embarked upon the journey of authorship. More than anything, Micalle enjoys spending time with her daughters and fifteen nieces and nephews with whom she has discovered the fountain of youth.

Registration and interpretation/reporting modules of a computer-assisted radiologic reporting system were created to help the radiologist in his or her task. However, the radiologist is also expected to write a report with diversified language according to diagnostic technique(s), population type (client vs. patient, pediatric, adult, geriatric), pathology, and across all anatomical areas.

The only way to catch the true cajun accent, unfortunately, is to spell the words wrong. I regret that this turned her off from this book, but it has to be this way to lend the right substance to specific characters. There are a few errors not related to the spelling that I am having looked over and corrected however. Please try to keep the setting and the flavor of this southern thriller in mind as you read, and once you wrap your mind around the accents you will see that it makes sense.

With less pages to fill than a novel, PSYCHIC DETECTIVE gets right to\nit--opening like a movie script and with a delicious Sherlock Holmes feel to it.\nA fan of that genre, I was captivated immediately. A historical mystery, the\nscene is set in 1883 in a small town in California where the detective, Henry\nLarson, has arrived from the fabled Pinkerton Agency in New York to investigate\na series of murders. Brainstorming takes place over a steaming cup of herbal\ntea and the villain is dubbed \"The Grim Reaper\". How enticing is that? As the\nauthor so aptly puts it: \"Like Lambs to the Slaughter\". As in any good\nmystery, there are red herrings, a plethora of clues and some blind alleys.\nEven rattlesnake involvement! But to even things out, there's a touch of\nromance and the author does an excellent job of bleeding in backstory, so\nessential to a historical mystery. And he does it in such a talented way that\nit doesn't interfere or detract from the plot and flow of the story. In fact,\nthe little book is an easy read; it zips right along with plenty of dialogue\nand would be a perfect companion for an afternoon at the beach. Without giving\naway too much, I will tell you that there's an interesting twist at the ending\nhaving to do with the psychic talents of the detective. Loose ends are neatly\ntied up via the last chapter and epilogue, leaving the reader completely\nsatisfied. Good job.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although he was born in Argentina, Duggan grew up in England, and was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford. After Oxford, he travelled extensively through Greece and Turkey, visiting almost all the sites later mentioned in his books. In 1935 helped excavate Constantine's palace in Istanbul. Duggan came to writing fiction quite late in his life: his first novel about the First Crusade, Knight in Armour, was published in 1950, after which he published at least a book every year until his death in 1964. His fictional works were bestselling page-turners, but thoroughly grounded in meticulous research informed by Duggan's experience as an archaeologist and historian. Duggan has been favourably compared to Bernard Cornwell as well as being praised in his own right as 'an extremely gifted writer who can move into an unknown period and give it life and immediacy.'

(23 April 1884  -  13 September 1968) aka TP, was an English writer, philosopher and mystic. He authored many essays and books and was a life-long spiritual truth seeker, being particularly involved with spiritualism and a movement devoted to the preserving the Chalice Well and Bride's Mound of Glastonbury, England.   On a visit to Istanbul (then known as Constantinople) prior to the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, he heard of 'Abdu'l-Baha head of the Baha'i Faith.    In November 1910 TP met 'Abdu'l-Baha   and had the privilege of interviewing him over a nine day period in Cairo and Alexandria. The meeting must have had a profound effect on Tudor Pole, because he embraced the faith and for the following decades he would remain active in the Baha'i Faith.    While a major in the British army Tudor Pole (in collaboration with Sir Winston Churchill) came up with the idea for 'The Silent Minute' which TP claimed was divinely inspired, and during World War II, all over Britain and the Commonwealth, millions of people joined together every evening at 9.00pm just before the news, to the chimes of Big Ben, to pray for peace.   Tudor Pole remarked at the time; \"There is no power on earth that can withstand the united cooperation on spiritual levels of men and women of goodwill everywhere.  It is for this reason that the continued and widespread observance of the Silent Minute is of such vital importance in the interest of human welfare.\"   In 1917 he wrote Private Dowding: The personal story of a soldier killed in battle. In the introduction Tudor Pole explains how this encounter with the Deceased entity who called himself Private Dowding, was his first experience of clairvoyantly inspired automatic writing;   On Monday, 12th March 1917, I was walking by the sea when I felt the presence of someone. I looked round, no one was in sight.  All that day I felt as if someone were following me, trying to reach my thoughts. Suddenly I said to myself, 'It is a soldier. He has been killed in battle and wants to communicate.' That evening I happened to call upon a lady who possesses some degree of clairvoyant power. I had forgotten about the soldier, until she described a man dressed in khaki, sitting in a chair near me. He was gazing intently in my direction. She said he was mature, wore a small moustache, and seemed somewhat sad. Not a very intelligent character apparently, but an honest one. I came home and sat down at my writing-table. Immediately my pen moved. Did I move it? Yes, in an involuntary sort of way. The thoughts were not my own, the language was a little unusual. Ideas were mainly conveyed in short simple phrases. It would really seem as if some intelligence outside myself were speaking through my mind and my pen.   Private Dowding is now considered a 'classic' in Afterlife literature. Wellesley Tudor Pole continued to author several books including, The Silent Road, A Man Seen Afar, and Writing On The Ground.", "related": [], "rank": 361844, "title": "Private Dowding: The personal story of a soldier killed in battle", "author": "Wellesley Tudor Pole", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Duvinsky combines various elements of psychology, Buddhist teachings and even components of martial arts to form a treatment that he claims can promote physical and mental well-being. The author contends that the human desire to control situations and emotions engenders most common psychological issues. His process to avoid this psychological unease involves imagining losing control and allowing the resulting emotions to emerge unchecked. The book is written for the layperson, but without familiarity with the terms used in the book, the text can quickly become confusing. Fortunately, the guide begins with a glossary. Each chapter describes a particular problem—control, fear, anger, shame, the last a construct not often mentioned by therapists—and presents topical case studies. Every chapter provides concrete exercises, allowing the reader to put theory into practice. The case studies are of particular note, providing insight and clarity to the author’s methodologies. They are also entertaining. When a professor, suffering from a fear of public speaking came to the author. His dilemma was traced back to an incident in his childhood when he was forced to push a wheelbarrow of pig manure through his village. By reliving this event in exquisite detail and facing his fear and shame, he was finally able to rid himself of it. Throughout the book, the author quotes from and explains how his methods derive from various psychological constructs and belief systems. Educates and entertains via psychological insight and sardonic humor. -Kirkus Indie", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A.J. Llewellyn believes that love is a song best sung out loud.  Serena is a night owl who starts writing when everyone else in her time zone is asleep. She has loved reading all her life and spent most of her childhood with her nose buried in a book. Although she always wanted to be a writer, financial independence came first. Twenty-some years and a successful business career later she took some online writing classes and never looked back. Living and working in seven countries has taught her that there's more than one way to get things done. It has instilled tremendous respect for the many different cultures, beliefs, attitudes and preferences that exist on our planet. She likes exploring those differences in her stories, most of which happen to be romances. Her characters have a tendency to want to do their own thing, so she often has to rein them back in. The one thing we all agree on is the desire for a happy ending. She currently lives in the United Kingdom, sharing her house with a vast collection of books. She likes reading, traveling, spending time with her nieces and listening to classical music. She have a passion for science and learning new languages.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This is a heart-warming story about sisters trying to bond\nonce more and a woman trying to make a new life for herself after a\nlife-changing event. This is a story about relationships and the title,\nJan's Families, is not just about blood-related relationships. I find\nmyself sympathizing with Jan and understand her trepidation regarding\nher twin sister. On the other hand, Jan, Nancy, and other characters\nremind us about what people can achieve if they stay resilient and never\n give up on living. Overall, Barb McIntyre crafted a beautiful story and\n proves yet again that she definitely is a special gem in the writing\nindustry.The following is from the official OnlineBookClub.org review posted by  Saoirse200I foundJan'sfamiliesto be a very good book, telling the story ofJanand how she is putting the pieces of her life back together after the death of her husband. I found the story ofJanto be very heart-warming. In only a few yearsJanwill gradually develop into a new person with a different perspective on life in general.I\n really liked the writing style the author used, it was easy to read and\n interesting. I found the author to have a very unique way of writing;\nshe managed to add in the perspective of different characters throughout the story with Jan still remaining to be the main character.I loved Jan'sfamiliesand I would highly recommend it to women.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I planned to separate Rane and War for part of this story, they haven't spent one night apart since they met, but War's injury came out of the blue and as such I treated it as a gift and it has opened up a number of possibilities that wouldn't otherwise have existed, now, War must protect his \"protectors\" just as much as they protect him and he cannot abandon the amulet if he wishes to look upon Rane; this \"blindness\" with which War has been inflicted will have a huge part to play in the next stage of the journey.The entire story was inspired by the discovery of two things near my home, a Stone-Age arrow head and a stick upon which there are some very strange carvings; both found in 2011 but it wasn't until 2012 that this story found its voice and asked me to write it. I'm really pleased I did and I'm enjoying the process of creating this story scape very much, I think largely because the landscape around my home, being post glacial, invokes the era in which this story is set.", "related": ["B00A9HSWVI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The epic film, set in the American South in and around the time of the Civil War, stars Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Leslie Howard, and Olivia de Havilland, and tells a story of the Civil War and its aftermath from a white Southern viewpoint.It received ten Academy Awards, a record that stood for twenty years. In the American Film Institute's inaugural Top 100 American Films of All Time list of 1998, it was ranked number four, although in the 2007 10th Anniversary edition of that list, it was dropped two places, to number six. In June 2008, AFI revealed its 10 top 10 - the best ten films in ten American film genres-after polling over 1,500 persons from the creative community. Gone with the Wind was acknowledged as the fourth best film in the Epic genre.- It has sold more tickets in the U.S. than any other film in history, and is considered a prototype of a Hollywood blockbuster. Today, it is considered one of the greatest and most popular films of all time and one of the most enduring symbols of the golden age of Hollywood.

This volume marks the successful passing of the torch lit by Sayers and Wilson to a new generation. All involved in classical Christian education would benefit highly from heeding these new voices.'' ---Jason R. Edwards, Grove City College''This book is an important contribution to the classical education movement. . . . The authors speak . . . based on their unique combination of training in math, science, philosophy, and literature, as well as their crucial experience as classroom teachers. The book suggests what may yet be possible for those answering the call of the scholar-teacher'' ---Phillip J. Donnelly, Baylor UniversitySome of us, after having immersed ourselves in the Trivium, thanks to Dorothy Sayers' essay and many other wonderful resources, have found ourselves wondering, 'What else?' We know there are seven liberal arts, including the Quadrivium, and we don't know exactly what to do with these other four, where to go next. Clark and Jain's The Liberal Arts Tradition has the answers, and provides them in a clear, concise, non-partisan way.

With every book, every story, you'll find elements of other genres--fantasy, mystery, romance, paranormal, suspense, YA, women's literature, all with a touch of humor because what doesn't kill us should make us laugh.To find her on the web, please visit:Website: ReadLaurenS.comTwitter: @ReadLaurenSFacebook: facebook.com/LaurenStewartAuthor", "related": ["B00IA9TLBM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 17, "rating_average": 4.4118, "rating_total": 75.0}

Eventually she got tired of temporary friendships and spent her spare time reading instead. At about eleven-years-old, she started writing short stories. She continued writing in her spare time until college when, between full-time school, full-time work, and the occasional date, she didn’t have any more time for writing.  In 2008, Tori returned to writing and finished her first novel. She wrote a third of that novel on her smartphone during lunches and breaks at work. It took awhile before Tori considered her writing to be anything more than a hobby, but by then she had finished a few books.  Writing taught her to appreciate the mischief her teenagers stir up, that the characters in her head fight back, and that she misses Seattle. Life is still teaching her that her children will grow out of it, and she can visit Seattle occasionally. She’s still looking for a solution on how to deal with her characters. Maybe she should stop fighting them; these are their stories after all.", "related": ["B00JCE20KS"], "rank": 871747, "title": "Flynn's In (Lexi Frost Series Book 2)", "author": "Tori Brooks", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her\nfrown deepened, and she seemed to struggle for words. \"You're not... er... you likewomen, not...\"The meaning behind her question\nstruck him like a blacksmith's hammer and heat swamped his entire body. \"Aye,\"\nhe mumbled, bending and retrieving the reins. Unable to meet her excited gaze,\nhe looked out over the reflecting pool instead. After a moment, he recovered\nenough to look at her again. \"Yes... I likewomen.\"Heaving a loud sigh, she sagged, a\nwide smile curving her lips. \"Good.

I've also written Fifty Shades of Jezebel and the Beanstalk and The Sexperts: Fifty Grades of Shay, and The Sexperts: Girl with a Pearl Necklace.Question: Why do you use a pen name?Answer: I have a wonderful family, but they don't need to know their daughter/mother/sister/cousin/aunt writes sexy stuff like this.

Entirely different from this one, it was going to tell everything about everyone I knew, more like a \"soap opera\" type of thing! I traveled a lot back then, had lots of sex and smut stories on everybody I was around.  However, to my surprise, Spirit picked me up out of my box, shook me up a little and dropped me to the ground.  I started writing alright, about something I knew absolutely nothing about! In 1993, I was in a tornado with my four year-old grandson, who clung to my chest. We were blown out of a house, landing in a field under a satellite dish! During this time, I was either knocked out or blacked out and stood before God (the Supreme Being) and his judgment. My sister-in-law, who had previously passed on, was leaning over shoulder and said; \"Not now Lord; for she still has many things to do.\" I went around, wondering what it was that I was supposed or meant to do.  I was afraid that, at any time, God might decide that I was not doing things right and take me home.  Now, I know.  What I had thought was the worst and scariest thing that ever happened to me actually was the best!  Giving me many gifts and blessings! Shortly after the tornado, my grandson would talk about our Guardian Angels.  \"You know, he would say the ones we saw during the Tornado\". I would agree with him and go on. Never realizing that he too could and did see Angels. One day when I was driving with a friend down a gravel road, by the cemetery where my grandfather is buried, I suddenly saw this huge Angel standing in the middle of the road.  His purple robe and giant wings were a sight to see.  I asked him who he was; and he said \"Cervihel\", my Guardian Angel. Okay, now I was thinking first that \"I have never heard of Cervihel\" and second \"Am I going totally crazy?\" When I got home, I called my neighbor, Patti; she had a lot of Angel books, and she couldn't find him in any of them.  So, she finally went on the internet and looked him up.  He, of course was there.  Cervihel, is an Angel of strength!  He helped David slay Goliath. Now, I am thinking, \"WOW'! I really have seen an Angel\"... Then, I started seeing Angels everywhere, literally all over the place, around other people, in the sky, trees, and fields. What a wonderful gift I was given! One day, I was in the bathtub; and the Angels blasted me with information, telling me things I'd never thought about before.  Two hours later, I was able to get out of the bath.  I started writing; and when I'd write, they'd talk faster. It really was hard, at times, to keep up.  They had so much to tell me and they had waited until I was ready to receive this information. Then, I not only discovered my Angels, but I could tell others who their Angels and guides are. Angels are giving me information about troubles in someone's life that had kept them from moving forward on their paths.  I have never been wrong when I channel for others. One day, when I was channeling for a girl I had just met, I saw her deceased mother over her right shoulder.  I described her mother to her; and sure enough, she appeared as when she was the happiest in her Earthly life.  She had a message for her daughter; and I gave the message to her.  To my surprise, she knew exactly what it was!  Then, the channel of crossing over was opened. Someone asked me what I thought about meditation, that I should learn to meditate.  I walked outside and saw a Rainbow; it was bright and beautiful.  The next thing I knew, I was doing a guided meditation for others; helping keep the balance and giving them positive direction in their lives.  All done by clearing my mind and asking the Angels to help. So now I not only meditate, but also do guided meditation to help others. Ever since I was in the tornado, I had healing energy in my hands; and everyone would say, \"Oh, so you do Reiki?\"  My answer was \"No, I Don't.\"  I knew what Reiki was; because my neighbor and friend Patti is a Reiki Master, and so is her sister Mary Lou. Then I was working one day for a chiropractor and had a patient come in with some severe problems; and they called me to the back to an exam room to do some energy work on him. I did not know this man of many gifts was a Reiki Master.  After he came to the window to pay his bill, he asked me how long I'd been doing Reiki. We then had a discussion and he (who is now a dear friend) gave me my Reiki I and II attunements.  What a wonderful gift that was.  Opening more channels of health for others!  I also began to get more information for my clients as I worked on them.  I could actually see what organs were blocked, where trouble was on their path, and so being able to be of more help to them and their healing process. I still receive and heal others through Reiki; I firmly believe in the energy work.  One day when Patti was doing Reiki on me, I received my master's attunement through Jesus.  Who better to attune you!  When I got off the table and told Patti of my experience, she agreed that now was the time for me to complete my master's.  I am now a Reiki Master, using the energy every day to help others. Well, I thought that I had opened all that there was to open.  Wrong!  I then started seeing the ascended masters and print in very small letters being filed into my mind.  As crazy as this sounds, this book is the Angels' gift to you.  Spirit sent me back to write this work, channeled from Spirit through me for you.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Saltzman was born near Washington, DC in 1988. Wow, just wrote about myself in the third person. Weird. Who does that? Anyway, not sure what to put here, since The Daily Marvel's my own imprint, I can pretty much put whatever I want. Let's see...I currently live in Charlotte, which is okay, I guess. It actually has buildings to go along with all the NASCAR, which a lot of people don't know. And...whoa, I have to use 2,000 more characters on this bio? For real? I really wish I was more interesting... Let's see, when I'm not writing, you'll often find me futilely flirting with waitresses, watching atheists debate creationists, pretending to have educated opinions about films on the internet, writing Amazon author bios, etc, etc. Am I done now? What? 1,700 more characters?! Okay, okay. Why do I write? That's a question people often don't ask me. I'd say, because writing--like reading--allows you to escape the reality that might not have turned out exactly how you wanted it to. Writing lets you create entire worlds based off the things you want to see, worlds you can sneak into when real life smacks you upside the head with unwanted surprises. I write because it's the best way, as I've discovered, to learn about myself. To create a character based on your own flaws is the best way to discover that those flaws exists. And guiding your characters on a journey to overcome those flaws may lead to the best way to overcome your own. But mostly I write because, as I've discovered through my quarter century of life, the world is full of stories. Every person you meet has thousands of them in their head. Think about it the next time you casually walk by someone in the grocery store. Think about all they have seen--all they have experienced--in their lives. It's a beautiful thing, really, an infinite web of experience that connects us all.  And sometimes, I like to write about it. I'm not a perfect person. I have a lot of growing up to do.

It will\ninform you about certain aspects of the pastor's role such as prayer and\npreaching. It will challenge you to think about possible ways to build teams\nand facilitate church growth. It will offer practical guidance for specific\nchurch situations like church discipline.The scholarly approach to the\ndevelopment of this book is of value. A Biblical foundation is laid for most of\nthe guidance offered. This will make you \"dig deep\" in a way that will be good\nfor you.            That which commends this work above\nall else is that it comes from a pastor's heart. I have known Scott Moore for\nalmost thirty years. We served together in neighboring churches for many of\nthose years. I grew to appreciate Scott's dedication to the Lord, his\ncommitment to the pastoral calling, and his friendship.            As you digest this book you will get\na sense that the writer has \"been there.\" He lives and ministers by the suggestions\nin this handbook. Scott loves other pastors. He does not claim to provide every\nanswer to every situation pastor's face. But you will find helpful information\nthat will refresh your heart as you go about the high calling of pastor. Darryl Wood, Th.D.Pastor, First Baptist ChurchVincent,\nAlabama", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This has been followed by Blood Diamonds Conspiracy; Driven By Lust; Baring Her Soul and From Serbia with Love and now The First Madonna, the second book in the Nicolina Fabiani series. I refuse to be constrained by genres as you will see. See details on my website above. Readers have commented that my writing is controversial, compelling, descriptive and evocative, and they become involved with the characters. What more could a writer ask for? I am unable to restrain myself from becoming emotionally involved in humanitarian issues, as well as with my clients, readers and it comes through in my stories. I currently live in my hometown in Auckland, New Zealand and love to travel to other countries and have been to Europe many times, as my very talented partner Harald,who designs my covers,is from Germany. This has given me the opportunity to fall in love with historical landscapes and their cultures, and also indulge in three of my passions, good food, wine and great conversation. I have gleaned many ideas and settings for my stories by traveling to well known cities in Europe, and also through the small villages, each with their own special story, which have enabled me to create believable and sympathetic characters.", "related": [], "rank": 1087614, "title": "THE ETERNAL MADONNA: And The Garden of Eden (Nicolina Fabiani Series Book 2) Revised Edition", "author": "YVONNE CROWE", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.8333, "rating_total": 29.0}
