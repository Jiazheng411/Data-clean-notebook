Although the wedding reception was in full swing, the ballroom crowded, he spotted her without difficulty. She was standing slightly apart from the mass of people between the bar area and the dance floor and there was something about her isolation amidst the crowds that drew him.For a moment he was content to stand just inside the open French windows and observe her. The bright disco lights swirled around the darkness of the room, playing over her long blonde hair and highlighting her in a myriad of different colours that washed over her shapely figure in the long green dress.She turned slightly and suddenly their eyes connected. He was momentarily taken aback by how beautiful she was. The snapshots taken by his private detective hadn't done her justice.Their eyes held for what seemed like a long time but was probably only seconds. He felt a sudden fierce buzz of adrenalin. The fact that she was desirable was going to make his task all the more pleasurable.Cat dropped her eyes from his as her friends returned to her side. She was used to men looking at her but there was something about this man's dark steady gaze that was different. It wasn't just the fact that he was simply gorgeous; it was the way he had looked at her—like a hunter weighing up his prey. She had felt suddenly vulnerable and breathless all at the same time. It was a sensation she had never experienced before and it had left her strangely shaken. Even now, surrounded by the friendly chatter of her colleagues, she could still feel the heavy sensation of her pulse-beat as if it were in tune with the bass of the music pumping around her.She took a long drink of her water and tried to dismiss the feeling. Maybe she was just hot. London was sweltering in a heatwave and, even though it was nearing midnight and all the doors and windows of the room were open, the temperature had to be around thirty degrees.Maybe she was also a little too wary of men at the moment, she acknowledged to herself wryly. Recently she had found herself carefully judging every man who spoke to her, wondering if they had been sent by her father or half brother. Crazy really, but the closer she got to her twenty-first birthday the worse these feelings of distrust and anxiety became. Her birthday was now a little under three months away and she couldn't wait for it to pass, she just wanted to get it over with and forget it.She shouldn't feel like this, she thought sadly. A twenty-first should be something to look forward to, a time of happy family celebrations. If her mother had been alive she felt sure things would be different. But the problem was that the only family she had left was her father and half-brother Michael, and both of them had their minds solely on the money she could inherit if she fulfilled the terms of her grandfather's will and got married before the date of this birthday. She was just a pawn as far as they were concerned. They wanted to move her one step forward towards marriage and thencheckmate,all the money would come pouring in. Well, she wasn't going to marry for money; she would go to hell before she went along with their plans and she had told them so quite implacably, not that they had paid her any attention.Why couldn't her father's main concern have been for her happiness—surely it wasn't too much to ask?The question stirred up the shadows of the past. She felt them inside her now…felt the acute loneliness that had stalked her since childhood. It was amazing how that feeling was never far away, even in a room filled with people. It was the curse of the McKenzie money.'Hey, Cat, do you fancy dancing?' Some friends caught hold of her on their way towards the dance floor.Thankful for the interruption to her thoughts, she put her glass down and allowed herself to be drawn along with them out on to the packed floor.For a while Cat forgot everything and became absorbed by the music. She was here with the rest of the workforce from the advertising company where she had worked for the last three months to celebrate their colleagues Claire and Martin's wedding. The couple had got married in the Caribbean last week and now they were partying in style at this top Knightsbridge hotel. Cat could see them on the centre of the floor, entwined in each other's arms, dancing slowly even though the beat was fast.That was how love should be, she thought wistfully. Maybe one day she would meet someone who made her feel like that. Someone who loved her, someone she could trust. She had thought that she had met that person last year. Ryan Malone had been handsome and charming and little by little she had found herself falling under his spell, had started to think that this was the real thing. Then she had discovered that Ryan was in fact a business associate of her brother's and that all he was interested in was wedding her for her inheritance. That discovery still hurt. It had made her more wary than ever about trusting men.As she turned something made her look distractedly back towards the doors, searching for the man who had been watching her earlier. She had the distinct feeling that his eyes were still on her. He wasn't there and she couldn't see him in the room. She was obviously imagining things. She tried to dismiss the feeling and concentrate on the music but she couldn't get the memory of that dark, broodingly intense gaze out of her mind.Nicholas watched Cat from his vantage point. She was a good dancer, her movements were lissom and she had a natural rhythm that was very sexy. He had heard it said somewhere that if you were good at dancing you were good at sex. Maybe later he would test that theory; he was looking forward to feeling her move sensuously beneath him. Possessing that curvaceous body was going to be a real pleasure.However he was deliberately not making a move on her too soon. Instead he was carefully monitoring the situation to see who approached her. He wanted to know if her father or brother had any spies in the camp. He knew they would want to protect their golden heiress. He wouldn't even have put it past them to line up a suitor for her. They had three months to secure the inheritance. He knew that Cat was just as hungry for money as the rest of her family and no doubt the three of them would be determinedly working towards getting their hands on the cash.Well, Nicholas had different ideas. While he had breath left in his body he wasn't going to allow them to get their hands on that money. He knew it would only be used to wreak more destruction in people's lives.The very name McKenzie made anger and distaste shoot through his blood like venom from a snake bite. Carter McKenzie was a snake, he thought acidly, a sly conniving, dishonest reptile. Eight years ago Nicholas had made the mistake of trusting the man with a land deal. Carter had lied to him and dishonestly duped him. As a consequence Nicholas had lost a lot of money trying to put things right, but what really infuriated him was the fact that he had almost lost something far more precious than money. Carter had tried to rob him of his reputation…and had almost succeeded.It had been a lesson hard learnt. Since then Nicholas had built his own empire and was wealthy beyond his wildest expectations, but he hadn't forgotten his old enemy. He had bided his time, watched and waited from afar. During that time he had noted that Carter McKenzie's son and daughter were exactly the same as their father. Michael McKenzie certainly hadn't broken the mould, he was no more than a con artist, and Catherine…Well, she had financed them through one shady deal after another, was complicit in their greed.According to his sources, there wasn't a lot of money left in the trust fund that she had been using up until now, and without the rest of the McKenzie inheritance she wouldn't be able to fund them for much longer.Roll on that day, Nicholas thought now with determination. Because he intended to step in, sweep Catherine McKenzie off her feet and take what was theirs. Carter was going to rue the day he had ever crossed him. Revenge was going to be very sweet.Cat left the dance floor and with quiet resolution he moved after her, surprised to see that she was heading for the main exit with speed. It was as if she was suddenly running away from something. He lengthened his stride and followed her.A few minutes later Cat was standing outside in the heat of the night. The London street was strangely deserted; even the doorman who had been on duty at the hotel earlier was gone.She felt better being away from the crowds. The panic that had gripped her on the dance floor seemed absurd now. Of course there had been no one watching her. Even so, all she wanted to do now was get back to the quiet safety of her flat.There was a taxi rank across the road and she had thought she would just be able to jump into a cab straight away, but the rank was deserted. A gentle breeze rustled through the trees in the park opposite but apart from that there was an eerie silence. Cat delved into her handbag and took out her phone to call for a taxi. Then she turned to go back into the hotel to wait.It was as she turned around that she bumped into a youth wearing jeans and a T-shirt. For a moment she thought it was her mistake and was almost about to apologise to him, tell him she hadn't seen him. But then he pushed her hard against the wrought iron railings and grabbed for her handbag and phone. Shock rushed through her as she realized she was being robbed.Her phone was torn easily from her grasp, but instinctively she held on to the straps of her bag and for a moment a struggle ensued. She had a fleeting glimpse of his face; then the bag was wrenched away and he turned to run. He didn't get very far, a second later he had fallen heavily on the pavement. She heard the thud of his body and then the sound of her phone and the contents of her bag clattering across the concrete.It was only when a dark shape detached itself from the shadows that she realized someone had tripped him up....", "related": ["B00JGABO14"], "rank": 288634, "title": "The Greek Tycoon's Innocent Mistress (An Innocent in His Bed Book 2) eBook", "author": "Kathryn Ross", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hardly a fitting resting place, she supposed, for correspondence written on vellum embossed with an ornate gold family crest. On the other hand, considering her initial response had been to decline its autocratic summons, it was a miracle that she hadn't tossed the whole works in the garbage.But the name at the end of the typed missive, signed in bold, impatient script, had given her pause. Raffaello Orsini had been married to her dearest friend, and Lindsay had been crazy about him, right up to the day she died. That alone had made Corinne swallow her pride and accede to his wishes. Whatever the reason for his sudden visit to Canada, loyalty to Lindsay's memory demanded Corinne not refuse him.Now that she was just two short hours away from meeting the man face-to-face for the first time, however, she wasn't so sure she'd made the right decision. What did one wear to an invitation that smacked more of a command performance than a request?Eyeing the limited contents of her closet, she decided basic black was probably the most appropriate choice. With pearls. Dinner at the Pan Pacific, Vancouver's most prestigious hotel, called for a touch of elegance, even if the pearls in question weren't the real thing, and the black dress made of faux silk.At least her black pumps came with a designer emblem on the instep, a reminder of the time when she'd been able to afford a few luxuries.A reminder, too, of Lindsay, a tiny woman full of big dreams, who hadn't believed in the word \"can't.\"We'll buy some run-down, flea-bitten old place in the right part of town, and turn it into a boutique hotel, Corinne. I'll take care of housekeeping and decor, and you'll be in charge of the kitchen.We'll need a fairy godmother to accomplish that.Not us! We can do anything we set our minds to. Nothing's going to derail us.What if we fall in love and get married?It'll have to be to men who share our vision.She'd flashed her dimpled smile.And it'd help if they were also very, very rich!And if they're not?It won't matter, because we'll make our own luck. We can do this, Corinne. I know we can. We'll call it The Bowman-Raines Hotel, and have a great big old BR emblazoned over the front entrance. By the time we're thirty, we'll be famous for our hospitality and our dining room. People will kill to stay with us….But all that was before Lindsay went to Sicily on holiday, and fell in love with Raffaello Orsini who was indeed very, very rich, but who had no interest whatsoever in sharing her dreams. Instead he'd converted her to his. Forgetting all about creating the most acclaimed hotel in the Pacific northwest, she'd moved halfway around the world to be his wife and start a family.And the luck she'd believed in so fiercely? It had turned on her, striking her down at twenty-four with leukemia, and leaving her three-year-old daughter motherless.Swamped in memories, Corinne blinked back the incipient tears, leaned closer to the mirror to sweep a mascara wand over her lashes and tried to remember the last time she'd worn eye makeup. Far too long ago, judging by the finished effect, but it would have to do, and really, what did it matter? Whatever the reason for his sudden visit, Raffaello Orsini certainly hadn't been inspired by a burning desire to evaluate her artistry with cosmetics.Downstairs, she heard Mrs. Lehman, her next-door neighbor and baby-sitter, rattling dishes as she served Matthew his supper.Matthew hadn't been happy that his mother was going out. \"I hate it when you go to work,\" he'd announced, his lower lip trembling ominously.With good reason, Corinne had to admit. She frequently missed tucking her son into bed, because her work too often involved late nights and time during his school holidays. It was the nature of the beast and much though she'd have preferred it otherwise, there wasn't much she could do about it, not if she wanted to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table.\"I won't be late, and I'll make blueberry pancakes for breakfast,\" she promised. \"Be a good boy for Mrs. Lehman, and don't give her a hard time about going to bed, okay?\"\"I might,\" he warned balefully. Although only four, he'd recently developed an alarming talent for blackmail. He was becoming, in fact, quite a handful. But Corinne hoped tonight wouldn't be one of those nights when she arrived home to find Mrs. Lehman exhausted from fighting to get him to bed, and Matthew still racing up and down the stairs every fifteen minutes and generally raising mayhem.I should be staying home,Corinne thought, the familiar guilt sweeping over her as smoothly as the black dress slid past her hips. But the letter pulled at her, and even though she could have recited it word for word from memory, she picked it up and scoured it yet again, as if the writer's reason for sending it might be hidden between the lines.Villa di CascataSicilyJanuary 6, 2008Signora Mallory:I shall be in Vancouver later this month on a matter of some urgency recently brought to my attention and which I wish to discuss with you in confidence.I have reservations at the Pan Pacific Hotel and would appreciate your joining me there for dinner on Friday, January 28, a date I trust you find convenient. Unless I hear otherwise, I shall send a car for you at seven-thirty.Kindest regards,Raffaello OrsiniBut just as with the first reading, there was nothing. No hint of what she might expect. And if the racket taking place in the kitchen was anything to go by, Matthew was gearing up to give poor Mrs. Lehman another night of grief.\"This had better be good, Mr. Orsini,\" Corinne muttered, tossing the letter aside, and taking a last glance in the mirror before going downstairs to appease a little boy who had no memory of his father, and whose mother seemed to be making a lousy job of doing double duty as a parent.The view, Raffaello decided, was impressive. To the north, snowcapped mountains glimmered in carved splendor against the clear night sky. The lights of a bridge spanning the entrance to the harbor looped like so many diamonds above the Narrows. And closer at hand, almost directly below his suite, a yacht some twenty-five meters long or more rocked gently at its moorage.Not Sicily, by any stretch of the imagination, but arresting nonetheless, as much because it had been Lindsay's home, a setting both wild and sophisticated, beautiful and intriguing, just like her.Two years ago, one year even, and he could not have come here. The pain had been too raw, his grief too filled with anger. But time had a way of healing even the most savage wounds; of gilding the memories that were his wife's legacy, and turning them into a source of comfort. \"I do this for you,amore mio,\"he murmured, raising his eyes to the heavens.Somewhere in the city below, a church bell rang out, eight solemn chimes. The woman, Corinne Mallory, was late. Impatient to get down to the business of the evening and be done with it, he paced to the telephone and buzzed the front desk to remind whoever was in charge that she should be directed to his suite when—if—she showed up. What he had to propose was not something to be aired in public.Another ten minutes dragged past before she arrived, her knock so sudden and peremptory that his hackles rose. Curbing his irritation, he shot his cuffs and tugged his lapels into place.Remember she was Lindsay's best friend. That does not mean she has to be yours, but it will be better for everyone if you can at least establish a sympathetic cordiality,he cautioned himself, striding to the door.He had seen photographs, of course, and thought he knew what to expect of the woman waiting on the other side. But she was more delicate than he'd anticipated. Like fine lace that had been handled too carelessly, so that her skin was almost transparent and stretched too tightly over her fine bones, leaving her face much too small for her very blue eyes.Standing back, he waved her across the threshold. \"Signora Mallory, thank you for agreeing to see me. Please come in.\"She hesitated a moment before complying. \"I'm not aware you gave me much choice, Mr. Orsini,\" she said, her accent so vivid a reminder of Lindsay's that he was momentarily disconcerted. \"Nor did I expect our meeting would take place in your room, and I can't say I'm particularly comfortable with that.\"What did she think? That he'd traveled halfway around the world to seduce her? \"My intentions are entirely honorable,\" he replied, tempted to tell her that if a romp in bed was all he wanted, he could have found it much closer to home.She let him take her coat and shrugged, an elegantly dismissive little gesture that made the pearls nested at her throat slither gently against her skin. \"They'd better be,\" she said.Suppressing a smile, he motioned to the array of bottles set out on the bar. \"Will you join me in a drink before dinner?\"Again, she paused before inclining her head in assent. \"A very weak wine spritzer, please.\"\"So,\" he said, adding a generous dollop of San Pellegrino to an inch of Pinot Grigio, and pouring a shot of whiskey for himself, \"tell me about yourself,signora.I know only that you and my late wife were great friends, and that you are widowed, with a young son.\"\"Which is rather more than I know about you, Mr. Orsini,\" she replied, with a candor he found rather disarming. \"And since I have absolutely no idea what this meeting is all about, I'd just as soon get down to business as waste time regaling you with a life history I'm sure you have no real interest in hearing about.\"Joining her on the other side of the room, he handed her the spritzer and raised his own glass in a wordless toast. \"That's where you're mistaken. Please understand that I have a most compelling and, indeed, legitimate reason for wanting to learn more about you.\"\"Fine. Then until you share that reason with me, please understan...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In Lucy, Bobby Quinn is a shy child who has no friends until he receives a beagle puppy for his eighth birthday. Named after a favorite baby-sitter who has moved away, Lucy becomes the child's best friend. During a long, hot summer, she helps him develop special relationships with an elderly neighbor, a talkative girl at dog obedience school, and a new boy who is also shy. Bobby's fears of new people and situations are skillfully captured, and the story is entertaining and well plotted. Bobby is an endearing character, and he and his dog are an appealing combination. Ghost Horse also deals with making friends, but with a supernatural touch. When Emily's family moves to a small town, she is unhappy about leaving her friends behind. From her new bedroom window, she spies a ghost horse and, with the help of a classmate, learns more about the fate of \"Moonlight\" and his owners. While many readers will identify more with the realistic portrayals in Cooper's work, Stanley's story also results in new friendships and provides readers with a bit of a mystery to solve.

Walter, the brilliant, Twinkie-loving, reluctant scientist hero, succeeds wonderfully as counterpoint and light comic relief throughout the novel.He,as much of humanity, is an endless exasperation for Gabriel. Expletives abound in this Torah-sized tome, and though it relies a bit too heavily upon these lexical choices for eliciting emotion, the book's depth, imaginative revisions and engaging characters will move readers. The pulsing plot spans the globe and solidly incorporates the threat of nuclear annihilation into the broader cosmic struggle between good and evil. It's eschatology on all fronts--metaphysical and political. As with most novels of tremendous breadth, there are some characters who are easily forgotten and some subplots less than germane. However, there is little room for a reader's lamentation after the brutal endgame played by Gabriel and Baal in the novel's denouement, and Walter's final metamorphosis is an ironic image that satisfies in the best, unexpected way. A book for insatiate lovers of heavy, religious, action-packed fiction.  --Kirkus Discoveries Review", "related": ["B00DJY0086"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After high school, he joined the US Navy and spent the next four years serving the country in the fighter training squadron VT-86 out of Pensacola, Florida. In college, he majored in Environmental Science and Geography with a minor in Geology and ended up with a teaching certificate for Secondary Earth Sciences. After one year of teaching fourteen and fifteen-year-olds, his desire to inspire young minds was laid to rest and he took up a position serving the State of Texas in the Correctional Field. In his spare time, he has produced over thirty novels which are currently being published in Kindle format as well as paperback at a much slower pace. His one aim is to entertain the reader with a good tale and hope that they may get something more from his work than just a laugh, a fright or a sigh.", "related": ["B00APKQH7K"], "rank": 1809580, "title": "The Red Cross of Gold XIV", "author": "Brendan Carroll", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Before authorities can even confirm whether the remains belong to toddler Brianna Rodriguez, who vanished during a family barbecue the previous year, grisly displays start sprouting at shrines across the city. About all that Lucy knows is that the culprit can't be the schizophrenic neighbor quickly taken into custody. The hunt for answers takes the sympathetic journalist, whose escalating drinking can't dull her guilt over a woman killed during her previous case, and her sometime antagonist, Det. Sgt. Gilbert Montoya, through a vividly evoked Santa Fe off the tourist trail and, finally, to the surprising and terrible truth.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He believes that the pilot must have nothing on his mind but the flight at hand, that even a small intake of alcohol or drugs can affect a pilot adversely, and that the flier should know both the abilities and the limitations of his plane; above all, pilots should be respectful of the weather, never venturing aloft if the predictions are dire.

I recommend this highly to political scientists, sociologists, historians, and anyone interested in the myriad ways that politics and religion influence one another. (Clyde Wilcox, professor of government, Georgetown University)Praise for the Fifth Edition: Religion and Politics in the United States is among the premier texts on the subject, expanded and improved in this edition. Clear and comprehensive, I can think of no better introduction to the place, promises, and perils of faith in the American political process.... (John C. Green, University of Akron)Long the standard by which other volumes on religion and politics are measured, this new edition continues to provide not only up-to-date coverage but an excellent breadth and depth of such coverage as well. (Corwin E. SmidtCalvin College)Praise for the Fifth Edition: Kenneth D. Wald and Allison Calhoun-Brown have updated and extended one of the leading texts in religion and politics. This timely new volume uncovers one of the most important yet understudied phenomena in American life: how citizens' religious beliefs and institutions both promote and constrain their involvement in politics. As religion emerges at the center of debates in American politics, now more than ever this volume is critical to students as they attempt to unravel the complexity of religion as both a diversionary and liberating force in the body politic...

Jack Liggett is up-front about his plans for Mardale: he has come to inform the villagers that their homes would soon be at the bottom of a massive reservoir. According to Liggett, the dam associated with the project will be a \"wonderful piece of architecture and engineering.\" But the villagers, who view the project as \"so strange and vast that at first it was not taken seriously,\" resist, setting off a losing struggle between the insular community and the modern world. Caught in the middle is Janet Lightburn, the daughter of a local farmer, who begins a tempestuous and tragic romance with Jack. A Booker Prize finalist for her second novel,The Electric Michelangelo, (published in the U.S. in 2005), Hall is a talented writer, and though U.S. readers may have trouble with the phonetically rendered dialogue (\"Twa Pund.

God seemed to comply; his parents  reconciled. The incident clashed with his atheistic upbringing, leaving  Stuart with many questions. Now, as a twenty-year-old college student, he  seeks answers. Best friend Roger Warren travels with him on a spiritual  quest to Turkey where they discover a crater in which descendants of the  original Apostles have guarded the true cross of the crucifixion for 2,000  years.Exhausted from their climb to the crater rim, the young men see the village  long-concealed within. As Roger snaps one photo, an earthquake throws him  back down the rock face they had just scaled. The trembler hurls Stuart  into the interior of the crater; he barely survives. His presence poses a  dilemma for the ancient community; their sole contact with the outside  world has been through the descendants of Simon of Cyrene.Roger and Stuart are missing; the only clue to their whereabouts is the  photograph inside Roger's shattered camera that finds its way back to Los  Angeles. Bryce Brinkman and her scheming assistant Earl Cole, both  satellite-imaging researchers, recover the digital photograph. Father  Rafael Romero, renowned authority on Byzantine churches, studies the  picture of the crater, and finds his diminishing faith challenged by the  golden church at its center. Stuart's Jewish girlfriend, Meredith  Montgomery, conflicted by her attraction to Messianic Judaism, joins  Stuart's parents to form a third search party.Unbeknownst to one another, the three search parties race across Turkey.  While seismologists in Antarctica wrestle with whether to disclose  foreknowledge of an impending earthquake, the monks guarding the cross see  portents of an imminent, earth-shattering spiritual event. The trees  surrounding the cross are bearing fruit for the first time in history, but  is it the fruit of life or death?", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Each novel offers a compelling story and several well-developed\ncharacters that I hope you will enjoy and learn much from. I also hope that you\nwill recognize in my writing some of the best prose you have encountered. I\nstrive during the long and complicated process of writing fiction to eliminate\nanything that is superfluous to the story and its characters, and to write each\nsentence, each paragraph, and each chapter in a way that entices my readers to\nread the next.I write and publish my writing first because of the pleasure\nit brings me, secondly because of the good that it might do others, and lastly\n(a distant lastly) for the financial gain it might bring me. So, if you have\nfound (or find) my work worth reading and would like to encourage others to\nread it also, and, if you think it right that I profit some from my efforts, I\ngratefully ask that you pass the word along to your friends, family, and\nassociates. You may also consider writing a positive review here at amazon.com.I have chosen to publish my titles through my own publishing company because of\nthe freedom it gives me to write the best fiction and poetry I can without the\nrestraints of others' requirements and without surrendering control. I do not\naggressively market my titles. You will not find them on the shelves of many\nbookstores. I limit my marketing efforts to my website (and it is there you\nmust go to purchase hard copies of my titles) and to online venues such as\nAmazon's Kindle bookstore.

Irony is the pitch sustained throughout the book, especially in the discursive poem \"Baseball\" (composed of nine innings of nine stanzas of nine lines each), wherein the narrator, K.C. from Mudville, fancifully explains baseball to the dead Dada collagist Kurt Schwitters. To K.C., poets resemble pitchers with their \"fool 'em tricks,\" and the sport transcends motion: \"Baseball, like sexual intercourse / and art, stops short, for a moment, the / indecent continuous motion/of time forward, implying our death / and imminent decomposition.\" Loosely imitative of Horace's first book of odes, the title poem is a tour de force in which witty, allusive Horsecollar (a minor character in Disney comics) debates with the persona of Mister Zero in \"his prophylactic smirking dog-cynicism.\" Horsecollar discourses on rage, advises carpe diem , and cuts to the marrow of sexual passion and the mortal wounds of destiny: \"Do we determine our lives or suffer them?\" Death closes this volume with musings on the end of the game in \"Extra Innings.\" Hall's voice is more mature and classically spare than ever, offering revelatory glimpses of wisdom.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What many readers may not realize is that I'm also a huge fan of sci-fi erotica. For more than fifteen years, I've been fascinated by the concept of gender from not only a psychological and sociological perspective, but from a scientific perspective as well.As science continues its progression of great technological strides, our understanding of the roles genes and chromosomes play in determining sex seem in constant flux. But are sex and gender one and the same? How many genders exist in this world? How many exist in our future history?Though perhaps overly simplistic, it can be said that while sex is determined by birth, gender is a social possibility. In the societies ofFuture Histories, outlooks on gender are diverse while possibilities for individuals remain narrow. In each of these stories, one everyday visionary signifies the difference between a persecuted transgender character's freedom and a life of physical, psychological, or social imprisonment. Is the same not true for us?Giselle RenardeAugust 2010", "related": ["B0091918B6"], "rank": 1850798, "title": "Future Histories: Transgendered Sci-Fi Erotica", "author": "Giselle Renarde", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So this day I decided it was time I delved deeper into this activity and find out why money laundering was purported to have become the third largest business in the world. The more I read, the more fascinated I became, especially when I learned that it was more than just narcotics dealing going on with these money launderers. Their aim, I learned, was to create wealth for themselves and they didn't give a damn how it was done, whether through narcotics, gun running, or selling components to make nuclear weapons, to name a few of the illegal activities that create what they call dirty money.But the one thing that strikes terror in everyone's hearts today, since September eleven, is the funding of terrorism against Western countries. These people have it all sown up. They can move their money through underground banks in the Middle East and into this country with an ease that is mind boggling. They have a crime organization running through this country that is sophisticated and lethal.Among the many ways this dirty money can be laundered to become legitimate in the US is through stock transactions, and the internet banking, and so was created in my mind a story about a couple who lived on opposite sides of the world, met through internet dating, fell in love, and when they finally met in real life, worked together to find the woman's missing daughter and her stockbroker husband who had become stupidly involved in a money laundering scheme in his work as a stockbroker.\"Breaking Down Barriers\" is the book I wrote about internet romance and money laundering schemes that brought this couple together through the disappearance of her daughter and her daughter's stockbroker husband. It is a mystery/romance novel, which I hope my readers will learn from and enjoy.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Mulling over why sexual reproduction arose, Tudge finds strong evidence for the \"Red Queen hypothesis,\" according to which sex fosters genetic variability, thereby helping creatures defeat parasites and viruses. He neatly demolishes theories linking race to difference in intelligence. The author believes that with the invention of farming, natural selection no longer favored passive hunter-gatherers but promoted exploitative, industrious individuals, whose characteristics dominate modern society. Also included are his prescriptions for increasing the chances for survival of our species.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Morrell surrealistically finds himself on the floor of his kitchen, several days before Matthew dies; he has been in the future and, having read the hospital report on the causes of Matthew's death, wants to give his son antibiotics as a prophylactic against the septic shock that will ultimately kill him. Back in the present, the doctors at the University of Iowa hospital don't understand how the author can predict what will happen. They argue that antibiotics could weaken Matthew; they think Morrell is crazed from the strain of his son's illness. He sneaks into Matthew's hospital room and administers the drugs anyway, but they don't save the boy's life. Morrell (First Blood) tells of his family's fear and hurt; of his misapprehension of God's purpose; and of supernatural experiencesfireflies, that signify souls, appear to Morrell; one of them is Matthew, who speaks to his father; a dove trapped in the mausoleum at Matthew's funeral allows Morrell to set it free. A painful book to read; the son's courageand the father's anguishjump from the emotionally charged pages. But in terms of style, the comparison that comes to mind is not the dense introspection of, say, James Agee's A Death in the Family , but rather the melodramatic treatment of Eric Segal's Love Story . 50,000 first printing; $100,000 ad/promoCopyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B005VT5VOA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tom Gallatin, hero of The Highbinders, continues his adventures as a fast draw. He dislikes killing but does a lot of it in the cause of retribution and revenge. The story consists mostly of a series of fistfights and gunfights interspersed with conflicts between local whites and Chinese, Tom's rescue of a beautiful Chinese slave girl and her rescue of him from being shanghaied, and a thrilling race in a clipper. All ends well as Tom finds his true niche in San Francisco. For readers who favor fast and violent action.

Alex started his career as a hairdresser in a small town just north of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where most of his clientele were involved in the steel industry. This gave him a very rich and colorful view of life through the eyes of the blue-collar working man. After the decline of the steel industry, Alex moved to Evergreen, Colorado, in 1983, which led him to the opposite end of the spectrum, where his clients were mainly high-level executives.    Listening to the views, interests, and opinions of such a variety of people, along with his genuine love of books, has awakened his desire to write, opening yet another chapter of life that Alex hopes to enjoy for years to come.

I spent three decades living 3000 miles away and we stayed in touch, but neither of us talked about work. It was just the way it was and no big deal. Instead, we talked boats, golf, guns, and, politics. Whenever it came time for me to buy a car, I'd make a long distance phone call and ask Ted for advice and that was the extent of my knowledge of the world of car sales.A few years after I retired from government service, I visited Ted at the dealership he was employed by that month (inside joke for car salesmen). He happened to mention one of the better salesmen was suffering from borderline DT's that day. The salesman's girlfriend had given him a month to quit smoking and drinking or she would leave him. That incident was the genesis of Moving Iron.I attempted to write the book alone, but ended up asking Ted hundreds of questions using the phone, emails, and fax, along with sending him page after page of the manuscript to see if I had captured the essence of what it was like to sell cars for a living. More than once, entire pages were returned rewritten. It wasn't all that long before I realized the manuscript had acquired another author.One day Ted and I were trying to dissect a particularly difficult sale he'd recently made and he and I just were not communicating. His world and my world were far too different. Ted suggested I take some time from my consulting work and go sell some cars. I did.I worked undercover at three dealerships in a four month period and had my eyes opened. It was like living in another reality and it was my and Ted's goal to capture that reality on paper. I think we did just that and hope readers feel the same.", "related": ["B003DZ1F4E"], "rank": 3156059, "title": "Moving Iron", "author": "Theodore Nolan", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has in fact brought the pale orphan Kathy, for herself, to cherish and teach, to add a grace note to the dirge of life on their South Australian farm. Rigid Hester wears a special boot on her congenitally twisted foot, and Kathy stirs in her the forbidden feelings roused long ago by her German governess. Now she expresses them in lavish gifts to Kathy, in days of wrenching closeness while the two bake, preserve and sew together. When her father dies, Hester's prodigality forces her to sell her property and rent a cottage in a remote corner of the vast acreage that had once been hers. She agrees reluctantly to take Kathy to a dance, lets her drive home and is panic-stricken when their pickup truck strikes something large and human, which they prod with the truck's fender into the well. Events then take an even more surprisingand grislyturn, and the ending is left deliberately ambiguous. The lump never leaves the reader's throat; suspicion and horror multiply; here is a book that will not let you go.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What a stroke of luck it was when I found Gayle and Iain! \"Of course!\" they said. \"Help yourself! Use any recipes you want!\" So I did, and I have shamelessly plundered their recipes and expertise for my books ever since.There's not much that Gayle doesn't know about Spanish cuisine and she tests and tries every recipe, whether traditional or new. Self-taught, she is an instinctive chef with a talent for the taste and colour of Spanish cooking. Iain is the photographer, and his pictures are enough to make one's mouth water. Their knowledge of Spanish cookware, cured meats and customs is breath-taking and I heartily recommend their website, OrceSerannoHams.com.I've been asked many, many times for a collection of Spanish recipes, and here it is... I hope you enjoy them as much as Joe and I do.¡Salud!Victoria Twead", "related": [], "rank": 1340860, "title": "Mouth-Watering Spanish Recipes", "author": "Gayle Macdonald", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was full of that dreadful longing that torments\nsensitive young men and that often turns to poetry when what he really wants is\nrobust escape sex with a girl nibbling his ear and whispering: \"I love you.\"I imagined I must have been writing badly and spent\nthe next thirty years trying to do it better.I think I've\ngot it sussed now and have begun to feel I have found an original voice that\nexpresses my creative story telling urge.

Spillane quotes Miles Franklin recommending that visitors to Australia who want to understand Australian life must immerse themselves in its atmosphere before coming to hasty conclusions. The same can be said about the Australian management climate. In an effort to determine whether management should be practised by performance or by psychology, the author immerses the reader in a critical examination of a number of topics - Australian literature and the culture of mateship, postmodernist influences, the measurement of intelligence and leadership qualities. The role of occupational stress and conditions like RSI are also considered - these seen as crucial psychological developments....Spillane's credentials also permit him to write with a level of cynicism and authoritative questioning. He is highly sceptical of testing intelligence, as a means of determining managerial potential, stating that 'the field is a mess and a mass of propaganda. He is also critical of the measurement of leadership qualities. 'The search for stable and enduring personal qualities of leaders has failed, and must lfail, because leaders cannot be understood apart from the relationship with their followers.' This book attempts to unravel the relationships between leaders and followers, managers and employees and performance and psychology in the workplace. It does so effectively, with extensive research, meaningful arguments and a healthy dose of scepticism. --Law Society Journal", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Stella makes a trip to the garden centre, and takes a fancy not only to a stone statue of the handsome Mercury but also to the assistant there, Justin. However, Mercury is well out of her price range but Justin sees how struck she is with the statue and so delivers it to her. An act of incredible kindness? Yes, and no. There is an ulterior motive and a bet which involves Greek and Roman gods winning the hearts of mortals. Stella is caught up in this, but not unfavorably. She loves both the men who enter her life, even though one is a garden ornament. Little by little Mercury becomes more than that, and the fun and adventure really begins. Mercury goes missing and it is surprisingly tricky to find a large, lost statue.This is a quirky and very imaginative story. Tessa Stokes has a rather understated style, so the whole story appears simpler than it is. It develops slowly but surely and the reader is pulled into this modern fantasy. We gradually learn more about our sympathetic characters and become very involved in their lives, mortal and immortal. There is plenty of fun at the heart of this story, but there is sadness, seriousness and real tension too at times. It is entertaining, unique and far from predictable, thanks to the author's bright creativity. A highly enjoyable novella that is hard to put down.", "related": ["B00GBFOGIU"], "rank": 2503442, "title": "Stone Kisses", "author": "Tessa Stokes", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Briant joined the BBC in the Sixties, working on many different drama series including several early Hartnell and Troughton Doctor Who stories. In 1969 he cut his directorial teeth on shows such as The Newcomers and Z Cars. On the strength of his direction of the six-part Jon Pertwee Doctor Who adventure Colony in Space, Barry Letts invited Briant back to Who every subsequent season during his tenure as producer. Two of his stand-out stories of this period include The Sea Devils and the much-loved Jo Grant swansong The Green Death. Work on popular dramas Sutherland’s Law and Dixon of Dock Green followed, as well as two more Who stories with Tom Baker as the Doctor, including the highly-regarded Robots of Death. Although Robots turned out to be his last Who, Briant was in at the start of another science fiction drama, Terry Nation’s Blake’s 7. Briant’s love of the sea and sailing was indulged by work on naval drama Warship, classic serial Treasure Island and The Onedin Line. More popular drama followed including Secret Army, episodes of which he considers to be amongst his finest work, and the Emmy award-winning Dickens serial A Tale of Two Cities which he also adapted. After a brief sojourn heading up a video film company, Briant directed popular zoo vet series One By One and sailing drama Howards’ Way. Briant subsequently brought British drama and comedy production techniques to the Netherlands, winning many awards in the process. In the mid-Nineties, Briant decided to fulfil his lifelong sailing ambitions and had many adventures on the high seas during his circumnavigation of the world, making two sailing series en route and writing several books.

Christopher Marlowe Cobb (call him “Kit”) is a newspaper war correspondent in search of action, so naturally he winds up in Vera Cruz just as the American navy is staging a very peculiar mini-invasion. Kit would like to get to the bottom of that, and he would also like to score an interview with Pancho Villa. Then there’s the matter of the Mexican woman who may be a laundress but may also be something very different—and with whom Kit has very definitely fallen in love. And let’s not forget the German entourage: What are they doing in Vera Cruz? Along the way to answering all those questions, Kit gets more directly involved in the fighting than he’d planned. (And so do we: Butler’s multipage, one-sentence description of a gun battle between Villa’s troops and the Federales is a virtuoso feat of breathless, high-energy descriptive prose.) The plot of this multistranded thriller is at times difficult to follow, but the character studies, sense of place, and mood are utterly gripping. The hard-bitten war correspondent is a staple of the thriller genre, of course, but Butler brings new depth and flair to the familiar figure; only Fowler in Graham Greene’s The Quiet American (1956) or perhaps Russell Cruz-Price, Kent Harrington’s dissolute journalist in Red Jungle (2005), comes close to Kit Marlowe for that irresistible mix of been-there-twice-seen-this-shit-before cynicism and its polar opposite, an unquenchable desire to see if the next card turned just might be something special. Reviewers feel that way, too, sometimes, but the card this book turns is definitely something special. --Bill Ott", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My life changed in a big way when I\nmoved to L.A., but in even bigger ways when I started dancing. The catalyst was the Japanese movie \"Shall\nWe Dance?\". I saw it three weekends in a row in 1997 and related very\nstrongly to the protagonist. A local ballroom studio had, very cleverly, left\nbrochures in the theatre lobby. I signed up for lessons, and have been dancing\never since. Ballroom has provided me with many friends, a husband, an athletic\nand competitive challenge, and opportunities to dance in a short film, a\nfeature, and a stage production.In 2012 I pulled all my old writing out of its\nboxes. I'd started writing long-form fiction in graduate school, after writing\nshort stories, poems, and songs earlier in life. I'd never had the urge to try\na novel until I wrote a fictionalized case study for a seminar. I can't\nremember what the seminar topic was, but the case study was concerned with the family\nlife and economics of a Bordeaux winemaker in the 1780s.The resulting historical romance novel,\n\"The Exiles,\" is now available for Kindle and as a paperback here on\nAmazon.  A follow-up novel, \"Discovered\"\nis also now available for Kindle; and a contemporary romance novel, \"Home\nSweet Home,\" is available in both formats. One of the old pieces of writing I had on hand\nwas an unproduced screenplay. I re-wrote the piece as a novella titled\n\"Getting Off.\" During this process, a new set of characters introduced\nthemselves. One thing led to another, and the \"L.A. Stories\" are the\nresult.The L.A. Stories are all novella-length, in a\nmodified teleplay format. This is intentional: I wanted to tell these short\nromantic stories in a quick-to-read way, mostly through dialogue. All are\ninspired by people I have known, met, or just seen during my years in Los\nAngeles.Happy reading ...Alexandra", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Being few in number, they are, however, more police and detectives than soldiers. The abundant action begins with a prologue in which Star Risk is hired to protect the referees at an interplanetary skyball festival, at which the fans have progressed from riotousness to homicide. After being paid, the Sky Risk crew undertakes to prove the innocence of a man condemned for treason, whose case has ramifications that read, probably deliberately, like pastiches of current media features. The element of wish fulfillment in the novel is undeniable; also pleasurable, for who hasn't felt like obliterating a stupid politician or obnoxious mediacrat? Lightweight action sf that sometimes reads like a novelized TV script (no surprise, given Bunch's TV background), this should hold the series' present audience and attract others who want to see the media skewered.Frieda MurrayCopyright © American Library Association.

Suddenly she was sharing space with dead people and experiencing the bizarre world of the unknown and the uncanny. An over-active imagination did not, at first, serve her well for she feared what she did not understand. Learning to read opened her to the world of books and she read everything she could find about supernatural and paranormal phenomena. The more she read, the more she learned and the more she realized how little she knew. This has led to a lifelong search for knowledge, truth and enlightenment. Constantly inspired to write, from the age of eight she began telling the stories streaming like movies through her mind. Although determined to grow up and become a writer, her sense of adventure led to a career in the United States Air Force. Despite a busy and demanding life, Deborah continued writing the stories that came to her in flashes of inspiration and her quest for knowledge continued. Her military career now behind her, she is focused on her lifelong dream of being an author and sharing the stories she’s been so compelled to write.

Later she was transferred to a second orphanage in Preston in England, which was less harsh, and where, due to one special nun, she became acquainted with the magic of storytelling.  In her teenage years she moved to London to study Drama, working as a telephonist at night to pay her rent and attending Drama school in the day: after which she spent some years working full time in theatre and occasionally in television.  Her first attempts at professional writing began after her two children were born, and she became a full-time mother, writing at night when the world and her children were asleep.  She began with two short stories, both of which won prizes.  She then began her first novel,  `Tread Softly On My Dream’s, based on the true story of the young Irish hero, Robert Emmet. Published by Headline and critically acclaimed by the Press, Tread Softly On My Dreams was acquired by the University of Notre Dame in the US, and The Princess Grace Irish Library in the palace of Monaco. This was followed by her second Irish novel, Fire On The Hill and later followed by her first contemporary novel, Ghosts In Sunlight. Gretta’s writing career was interrupted in full flow when her son broke his back in an accident and needed her care for some years. Now fully recovered, her son is a successful young actor and Gretta has returned to her passion for writing.   She has just completed her new Historical novel, By Eastern Windows, based again on a true story, set primarily in Scotland and India, and has already started work on the sequel The Far Horizon, set primarily in early Australia. Gretta is married to a lawyer and lives in London.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.6, "rating_total": 23.0}

For many years, he contributed rock music reviews to a local newspaper. Martin has continued to write fiction, non-fiction, essays, and short stories his entire life. Martin collects music, books and memorabilia from the Classic Rock Era. Consequently, he has  amassed a large collection that continues to grow. Over the years, his passion for the era has taken him to London, Paris, New York and San Francisco for research. Crossing Abbey Road, visiting Jim Morrison’s grave in Paris, and standing on the stage at Monterey where Jimi burned his guitar has given him a better understanding of the artists and places that inspired them and their music.  Today Martin continues to study and write about the music of the era and the counterculture that evolved around it.  Martin posts blogs, shares music and pictures from the Classic Rock Era on Facebook. He also enjoys meeting and making friends at:  www.Facebook/MartinRots.com.

E. Goodwin believes that everyone has God-given talents and abilities. Some develop them early in life, while others remain dormant until later. Goodwin had an early ability to make lines of poetry rhyme in meter and always maintained an active imagination and sense of humor. She has been called a daydreamer more than once. It was much to the chagrin of upper management that whenever she sent e-mails, they would be detailed and descriptive rather than bulleted and pointed. At one point, over ten years ago, she began to think that perhaps she was missing out on using a God-given talent and should turn it in to something positive. This past year, she finished her first project, using her imagination, talent, and sense of humor to create this story, loosely based on some events of her own life in the hopes that she can one day move into a different realm-one free of the mundane. It is her hope that you will enjoy the escapades of Dulcey Patterson as she travels and unravels many mysteries during her career and even finds love. Goodwin has worked in corporate America for over twenty years. She and her husband lived most of their lives in central New York, but moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2005, where she currently resides. She is active in her faith and church, using other talents that God has given her to serve him.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ed., a life-long learner and teacher, writes about topics that transcend the self in order to guide others in what she has learned. She believes that learning and experiencing life is an art form, a gateway to transcend and express abstract dreams into concrete realities, having an opportunity to leave a unique impression on others, changing their lives by seeking answers to the same questions she has had in life--to question things for herself, to find alternative answers, to go back to nature, and encourages her readers to do the same in their lives.Carrie is a bestselling author of several books, including \"The Essay Tutor\", \"Bodymorphosis: A Mind and Body Curriculum\", \"Patience through Perspective\", \"Simplify and Beautify Your Life with Natural Coconut Oil\", and \"The Home Spa Book.\"In addition to writing, Carrie has served as an instructor and tutor of English and writing at Minnesota State Colleges and Universities. She has been featured at organizations such as Edge Life Magazine, Essential Wellness, Smarthinking.com, Educational Testing Service, Writer's Digest, and local community publications.It is important to realize our dreams and do what we love every day by manifesting those dreams into reality through the love from the heart. Health, happiness, and success are major components in life we aim to achieve and maintain. The purpose of Carrie's teachings is to guide others in achieving these goals, with a major component focusing on self-realization. She has spent much of her life studying and applying concepts of alternative healing, metaphysics, and self-realization utilizing her education background, in a calling to realize ways to take better care of the body, mind, and soul.", "related": ["B0072Z3800"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is my favorite book that I have written.I was inspired to writeCry Me a Riverwhen I was researching odd careers. I thought, what kind of trouble could someone get into who worked as a \"remains location specialist?\" I came up with a couple of ideas: plane hijacking in Europe, ecoterrorism in Panama, and a woman kidnapped in Colombia.As I researched these ideas, it became plain to me that Colombia would be the most incredible setting and that the violence and culture there would make for an exciting backdrop. As I developed the characters of Manny, Claire, and their friends, I found that these people were fascinating and were dealing with complicated conflicts in their lives. Redemption, fear of death, grief, family legacies, honor, and faith.The title came to me as an inspiration after I heard Ella Fitzgerald's song, \"Cry Me a River.\" It was so beautiful and haunting. It reminded me of Claire's conflict with her upbringing. She was raised by a father that was so grieved with his wife's passing that he cursed God and maintained a strained relationship with his daughter. The sentiments of the song could be aimed at her father or at her mother that she did not remember and resented for years. The song was also representative of the Rio De Magdalena, the river in the story. To me, it represented the story well.The image of the journal was important to me. Claire receives this gift from her father and she is faced with the truth. A truth that she is not prepared to accept because she had built up this image of her mother. I feel like faith is sometimes like that. We build up these walls of what truth is, what reality is to our perceptions, and then when we are faced with truth, when we discover reality, we have a difficult time processing it. We reject it.I sincerely hope you take the time to readCry Me a River. I feel that each person will take something different from it. I deliberately turn off the DRM feature for my books because I am a big believer in the art of sharing stories. Please share with friends and loved ones.

A native of Tallahassee, Florida, and a graduate of Florida A & M University, Lilka enjoys helping people, and finds joy in dispensing an encouraging word whenever possible, along with pills and ointments. Inspired by Biblical studies, her sharing of insights, and communicating with others about the awesome power of prayer, and what God is capable of doing, has become a calling. Her testimonies include sharing her personal experience with Autism, and how the grace of God more than compensates for personal inadequacies. As an avid gardener, plants and flowers tend to absorb a great portion of free time when she's not pursuing literary interests or engaging in family activities. A long term affair with chocolate fuels a hobby for baking and a zeal for trying new recipes. She has yet to meet a cookie she doesn't like.

The term doesn't connote any specific gender identity or\nmotives, and in the case of my hero, he's a gay man who started cross-dressing\nso as not to be recognized in his city and found he enjoyed dressing and acting\nas a woman from time to time.Cross-dressing is time honored. Hercules is punished by\nOmphale by requiring him to wear women's clothes, while Achilles was dressed as\na girl to hide him from Odysseus who wanted him to join the Trojan War. Athena\noften dresses as a man in mythology, while in the cult of Aphrodite, worshipers\nall cross dressed, women as men and vice versa. Interestingly in the Hindu\nMahabharata, the hero Arjuna dresses as a female dance teacher to keep his\nidentity secret.Many historical figures were cross-dressers -- Joan of Arc;\nCatalina de Erauso, a Spanish woman who escaped from a convent dressed as a man\nand served in the Spanish Army; the Chevalier d'Eon who lived the first half of\nhis life as a man and the second half as a woman; Shi Pri Pu (M. Butterfly) a\nspy for the Chinese government, cross dressed for 20 years.Any reader of Shakespeare knows how the author loved\ncross-dressing his characters. And modern films are no exception.Some Like It Hothas two cross-dressing\nmen, whileVictor Victoriastars a\ncross-dressing woman.Actually, cross-dressing is a cultural construct. Society\ndecides what is masculine and what is feminine. Clothing is in no way innately\ngender specific. Think of our modern world in which a woman in pants or even a\nbusiness suit and tie is considered fashionable, while a man in a dress is\nconsidered a cross-dresser.  I hope you\nenjoy meeting Quentin, aka Queen, fromHearts and Flour.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 18, "rating_average": 4.2778, "rating_total": 77.0}

This is a fascinating book that I would recommend highly to anyone interested in bilingualism.Dev Sharma, Debate 129, December 2009Learning new languages tends to involve emotions, and for many bi-lingual and multi-lingual people the different languages they speak make different emotional connections for them. Though these matters were known about, only recently have deeper understandings have been sought, and found. This fine volume is among the welcome first fruits of research on these issues. It is a timely book that will be welcome to all who are interested in language and its emotional implications. Keith Oatley, University of TorontoThis volume brings together the latest thinking in a relatively new area of research, that of multilingualism and emotions.Rosemary Wilson, Sociolinguistic Studies Vol 2.1 2008The present collection of Chapters covers a wide spectrum of issues in the field of emotions and bilingualism. The volume is highly recommended to those interested in learning about emotions in bilingualism and l 2 learning as well as those interested in undertaking research in this important new area.Ioulia Grichkovtsova, Queen Margaret University College, in Studies in Second Language Acquisition 29:4, December 2007This fascinating collection of papers makes an important contribution to the emerging field of bilingualism and emotions that Pavlenko has spearheaded. They offer rare insights into the relations of language, cognition and affect from various perspectives in cognitive and social psychology.... By stressing the crucial importance of desire and arousal in language, as opposed to the more instrumental concept of motivation, this book should have wide ranging implications for the study of second language acquisition and bilingualism.

I have 3 cats and one little dog named Gizmo. The Chihuahua is definitley outranked by his formidable counterparts. Outranked and out weighed...lol.

At first I thought the fallen whiskers were the result of inhouse rough-housing and I worried the cats were fighting more than normal. So I kept a closer eye on them and realized that nothing unusal was occurring, they were simply dropping whiskers occasionally and because there are three large cats, the whiskers were more noticeable around my house. It was actually the man I live with that came up with the story idea of magic whiskers being made into a magic paintbrush. I did not jump on my computer and bang out the story, I let it percolate in the back of my brain for nearly a year. I liked the idea but wasn't sure it would make a good novel, a person can only stretch a story so far and I didn't think I could make it stretch. When I discovered the Kindle opportunity to self publish short story ebook editions, the whisker light bulb snapped, and I came up with 3 editions of Spencer's Whiskers. Fast, easy reads for people on the move. I priced them ridiculously low hoping to attract the transit travelers and the young people who are growing up with ipads/ipods tucked in their backpacks.  Ebooks are the way to go now and I'm prepared to go right along with them.

Northeast Italy's industrial pollution provides the backdrop for Carlotto (The Goodbye Kiss) and screenwriter Videtta's outstanding fable of greed, corruption and moral abandonment. Filled with echoes of Dante'sInferno, the book centers on the murder of Giovanna Barovier, a young attorney interning on the staff of respected lawyer Antonio Visentin, within days of her marriage to Visentin's son, Francesco. Cheap Chinese imports and Italian industries exiled to former Soviet-bloc countries have led to a national downward spiral into dissolution paralleled and individualized by Francesco's private search for Giovanna's killer. First finding himself accused of a crime of passion, Francesco soon descends through level after level of human depravity, from theft and brutality through fraud to betrayals so heinous they shatter the soul. Truly little hope if any exists for those who enter this vicious journey into the abyss of human evil. (Oct.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Those who bought into the positive view of the gang after the war saw them as resisters against the injustices of Reconstruction. Muehlberger is an attorney and amateur historian who uses an obscure legal proceeding taken against Jesse James to demolish that myth while examining some aspects of their depredations as well as the efforts of state governments and the Pinkerton Agency to thwart them. Jesse James, in particular, is viewed here as a clever self-promoter but also a cold-blooded killer with sociopathic tendencies.

Sam had no idea which way was up as she was constantly being moved into various positions. All that mattered to her was sexual gratification.\"Alexandra wasn't enough for you, hm? It doesn't surprise me, really. She's just a lowly hybrid, afraid of hertruepotential,\" the doctor continued.Sam blinked at the mention of her girlfriend. She gave a bit of resistance, but it was short-lived as the tentacles wrenched yet another orgasm from her tired, oversexed body.\"I really wish I could knock you up, Sammy. Then we'd have so much to show Alex when she tries to rescue you. But, we both know that she'll fail.\" The tentacle-fused doctor walked through the sea of writhing alien flesh, while each tentacle consciously shifted to make room for their leader as she inspected her captive. \"I'll make her submit to me. Her brood will belong to me, and then true peace and unity will spread throughout the world, and then the universe.\"The more that Stephanie spoke of Alex, the more it brought the woman out of her lust-drunken daze. She was only lucky that there was a tentacle sliding down her throat to keep her from speaking, otherwise she would have voiced her opinion. The thick, phallic member easily pressed into her, sliding in and out wildly. Every so often, the tentacle flexed as it shot its creamy load directly into the blonde's stomach.Stephanie sneered while looking over the fun that her tentacles were having with Sam. \"Even if I can't knock you up, that doesn't stop me from trying. I bet you'd enjoy having my cock pushing so deep into your slutty holes.\"Sam's body tensed at the cruel, seductive words of her captor. Just hearing the idea made her climax. Her hips bucked against the tentacles that pumped into her pussy. As one pulled out, the other thrust back in, sending alien cum gushing from her overfilled sex.As the doctor willed it, the tentacles withdrew from Sam's dripping body, allowing for the flow of cum that was already deposited in her pussy to flood out onto the concrete floor of the bunker. The blonde was panting heavily as she glared at the doctor. Even if she couldn't be impregnated by the alien-fused woman, the lust inducing effects of the alien slime were very effective on Sam. It took every ounce of willpower to keep from begging for Stephanie's throbbing, alien cock. And yet Sam couldn't pull her eyes away from it, and the doctor knew.\"My eyes are up here, darling,\" she chuckled as she flexed her member, making it bounce with her arousal. \"You certainly have a one track mind. I guess you want to touch it, hm? You just want to wrap your dirty, little lips around it--just for the taste, I'm sure. You're lucky that I'm not one to disappoint.\"The tentacles started to lean the bound woman forward so that she was at face level with Stephanie's swollen member. Sam's mouth opened just a bit. She needed this--just a sample to get it out of her system. That was all. Her lips wrapped around it and she gently suckled at the head, savoring the taste of her alien captor.\"Go on,\" Stephanie urged, \"I've seen how good you are. You can take more. I know you want it.\"", "related": ["B00D8COQ34"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rowling, Christopher Paolini, Stephen King, Stan Lee, and others make this series stand out. Separated into five chapters, each volume begins with a section about inspiration and ends with information about getting published. Lists of contemporary and classic literature, as well as movies, give readers plenty of models to help them create their pieces. The organizational strategies and writing exercises are user-friendly. The books are narrated in such a way that readers are treated like real writers no matter their age. Sidebars tackle additional topics. Unfortunately, there are no illustrations, only the occasional design element. Resources specific to each genre and places for writers to look into publishing are given. The age-level appropriateness varies by title; Romance and Horror contain disclaimers at the top of their recommended genre reading lists.α(c) Copyright 2011.

His years of ministry throughout the United States and overseas gives him a strong appreciation for the workings of the local church. As he meditated on a problem he saw in the church, \"why are there so many frustrated Christians,\" God spoke to his heart, \"Man's insecurities are the devil's security.\" Living a godly life in an ungodly world is not an easy assignment. Faith in God's Word offers us stability in life's every day journey and its unplanned detours. As we learn the truth in God's Word, the lies of the enemy are exposed and we overcome our insecurities that keep us bound by our enemy, satan. Edwin Louis Cole says in the forward, \"The church's silence is the devil's opportunity to speak. When the church speaks, the devil remains silent. Silence is the devil's weapon in his warfare against the church. In this book,  Bill Tilney tells the truth the way it really is. He exalts the Lord Jesus Christ, elevates our level of understanding and at the same time exposes the devil for who he really is.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The former seemed too intimate; the latter too formal. Neither fit our circumstances. It is a peculiar thing to grow to love someone who has been gone for forty years, but I now know what loving your father feels like. I wish I had learned it sooner; he deserved it. He was funny and intelligent -- a genius, probably.  He had obsessive love for my mother, and unfortunately was never given the opportunity to live up to his potential. Electroshock, Insulin shock, turpentine injections, ice baths, and heat lamps, experimental drugs and all of the other brutal treatments perpetrated on the mentally ill in the 1950's stole everything from him.

I now reside in the Sarasota area of Florida. When I was thirteen years old, I tried my hand at writing short stories and some poetry. I found that I loved to write poetry, the rhyming and cadence came easily to me. I won two scholastic awards for my poetry. Writing stories was a little harder, but I managed to write a few short stories when I was around sixteen years old. The years passed by, Vietnam happened, marriage and children happened, and life got in the way of pursuing my dream to be a writer. As I got older, I didn't think I was good enough to be a published writer, and I had all but given up on my dream. I told this to a friend, Joan Gurgold, and she gave me what is possibly the best advice I ever received. \"Don't write to be published,\" she said. \"Write to get the stories out of your head. Give all those characters roaming around in there a chance to be free.\" I took her advice, and I am glad I did. Now I can finally do what I have always wanted to do since the age of thirteen, write!", "related": ["B00CO81QPO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I always wanted to be a scientist. In fact, my first degree was in aerospace engineering. However, I was born in a country where one did not choose one's job after graduation--the government decided it for you.Fueled by Communist ideology, the Cold War engulfed most of the world in the second half of the last century and spilled over to this one. It also created a very powerful intelligence vortex. By virtue, or vice, of my fate I was drawn into that vortex. I tried to escape it, but could not--until the end of that war. I happened to be close to the center of many critical moments of the intelligence battles of the war, and worked with many of the key participants.I published my first book,Tower of Secrets, in 1993. It described my experience in Communist Russia and the KGB that ended with our family's arrival in the United States in 1980. I was pleasantly surprised by the number and sincerity of the letters from readers. These letters were one of the most gratifying experiences of my life, and I felt somewhat obligated to answer the question raised in most of the letters: what happened afterwards? No less important, I had a unique perspective to offer: during my career in intelligence I got to know the inner workings of the KGB intimately, I had a good experience working with the NSA, and I had numerous encounters with the CIA. Furthermore, while my expertise was in technical security, I also had first-hand experience and understanding of human intelligence. All these factors contributed to my decision to publish this book.Our family was exfiltrated from the Soviet Union by the CIA, and, naturally, we felt deep appreciation for the performance of those who actually carried out the operation, especially the courageous couple who took us through the extremely heavily fortified Soviet border. When we came to the United States we knew very little about this country. Being a dedicated anti-communist, my attitude was simple: the enemy of my enemy was my ally. Upon arrival we faced many challenges, learning English being just one of them. We were extremely impressed and deeply touched by the natural hospitality and friendliness of the American people. People helped us just for the sake of helping. Ironically, all our seriously negative experiences were related to the CIA. We soon concluded that we came from a big bad country with a few good people to a big great country with a few bad people. And we came to love this country.To say that my encounters with the CIA in the United States were surprising would be a gross understatement. I had heard about their obsession with control of defectors and their bad treatment of them. Professionally, I also understood that how people are treated by an intelligence service is highly dependent on their value. Given my background and level of expertise in highly secret areas, I understood that after my arrival my continuing value in United States intelligence was significant. This was confirmed by the CIA's Distinguished Service medal that I was awarded, and my extended work with the NSA. So if I was treated badly, sometimes clearly illegally, I could only imagine how badly defectors were treated who had lost their value.I did not want to fight the CIA, I just wanted to be left alone. So I felt personally disappointed and even angry, particularly at the treatment of my family. But besides being disappointed personally, professionally I could not understand what was going on. Indeed, what the CIA was doing was entirely contrary to the objective interests of the United States. Why? I felt compelled to research the reason for this CIA hostility, not just toward me personally, but as a trend,. The results of that research are presented in this book.In yet another twist of my fate, The FBI appointed Robert Hanssen as my FBI liaison. At the time of our introduction Hanssen was a high level FBI Special Agent with top level security clearances. Our families were on friendly terms, and we frequently socialized together. This gave me a unique vantage point for observing Bob Hanssen outside of his office environment. It was really ironic that amongst thousands of its agents the FBI chose Hanssen, who later would be revealed as a longtime KGB mole who had achieved the most damaging penetration of the FBI ever.  I either participated in, or observed directly, most of the events described in this book. Many of these events are related to intelligence, so some names, places and times have necessarily been altered. In the interest of readability I have tried to avoid bothering reader with overly-detailed particulars. However, these events indeed took place and the descriptions are accurate. I have tried to avoid making explicit judgments except where the judgment is obvious. I would like to urge the reader to draw his own conclusions and I fully understand that they may be different from mine.Overall, this book reflects my personal experience in intelligence from an unusual vantage point. I hope it will help the American general public to understand some not readily apparent processes. I also still harbor a hope that it can help professionals understand and improve American intelligence services, particularly the CIA. Alas, I am not particularly optimistic that the CIA culture will change. Stripped from the elaborate semantics, their perpetual response seems to be: it never happened, but if it did, it was a long time ago and we have already corrected all the shortcomings of the past.", "related": ["B009RBQQV0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Storytelling is her way of reaching out and helping other people— giving them hope to light the dark times. It's a passion she hopes to continue well into her old age.

Both parents believed a good education plus good manners equalled a good future. Joseph taught Patty to read using the newspaper before she entered kindergarten, and her love for words never ceased. For 25+ years, she worked as a legal secretary/paralegal, but never gave up on her dream of becoming a published author. The mother of two sons, both diagnosed with autism and ADHD, Patty would tell them bedtime stories every night. The boys loved the stories so much, they would ask to hear them over and over again. Having to write the stories down because her sons did not want her to deviate from the original version, the author realized she had put together a nice collection of children's storybooks. Corey the Calf is a byproduct of Patty's bedtimes with her children, as well as a dream come true for the author. Patty writes imaginative stories for young children. Each story is entertaining and educational--each teaches a lesson on a moral value, such as honesty, friendship, and sharing. Each book in the series ends with tips for the parents to work with their child. And, half of all proceeds from the books are donated to organizations benefitting children with autism. Patty also writes for The Fellowship Journal, a Christian newsletter, and is the former Editor-in-Chief of the Atlanta Association of Black Journalists. She isn't afraid to admit that she can express herself better in writing than speaking, or that butter pecan ice cream can sweeten even the worst of days.

More confusing, it is not the next morning, but seven years and seven months later: Babe has been in a coma. Meanwhile, in an exclusive new building high atop the Museum of Modern Art, the real-estate agent showing an apartment to a prospective buyer discovers the bound and mutilated body of a handsome young man. Attractive widower Vince Cardozo, the detective investigating the grisly murder, also pays a hospital visit to Babe. Since her ex-husband had admitted attempting to kill her with an insulin overdose, the police have an interest in whether she regains consciousnessor dies. Cardozo is taken by Babe, a charming woman quite unspoiled by her wealth and social position. But more terrible events are in store for her, as the two separate strands of Cardozo's investigations eventually become unpleasantly entangled. What might seem farfetched to some will be familiar territory to readers of New York tabloids. Deftly using notorious scandals and murders, Stewart creates an immensely readable portrait of the privileged lives of his cafe-society cast of characters, most of whom are riddled with greed and corruption. His spellbinding, witty thriller does a first-rate job of showing that truth is stranger than fiction. 150,000 first printing; BOMC main selection.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I highly recommend giving this book a close reading.”—Duane Litfin,President Emeritus, Wheaton College“This book is vintage Bill Pollard—full of intellectual challenge and ideas, affirming a strong faith yet not dogmatic, based on a lifetime of integrating faith and business while practicing servant leadership.

Volkema,Chairman, Herman Miller, Inc.“My first meeting with Bill Pollard made a lasting impression. We discussed taking our Christian perspective in business to locations around the world that might not have an understanding or an acceptance of our faith. Bill shared with me his experiences in leading ServiceMaster as it expanded its business in the Far East. InThe Tides of Life, Bill shares many inspiring lessons through his personal stories that will encourage us to choose to lead well in every circumstance—through joy and sorrow, success and failure. This is a book for those who desire to lead authentically and faithfully in the marketplace and in their personal lives.”—Mary Andringa,President/CEO, Vermeer Corporation“The Tides of Lifeis an excellent prescription for leadership written by a master practitioner of the art.

He has wide ranging interests, including history and philosophy, and especially all that pertains to the Bible. He is the author of How the West was Lost: Coping With Life in a Strange, New Civilization, wherein he presents his theory that the civilization that Christianity created after the fall of ancient Rome (what we call \"the West\") has already ended. He builds the case that we are currently living in a new, as yet unnamed civilization, which is characterized by distinctly different assumptions about life and reality itself - but we haven't recognized it yet. This new civilization can be detected in the many astonishing new, ways of perceiving life, indeed reality itself, that we have quickly come to take for granted. Indeed, no matter how fast they multiply, we tend to feel as if it has always been this way - but people living a hundred years before us would find most things about our era incomprehensible, shocking or despicable. The list of examples is long and lengthening, but just think of any current issue that relates to sex and you will get the picture. It's all around us, but since fish don't know they're wet, we don't notice it. The civilization a person grows up inside of is to that person reality itself; to question its assumptions is like questioning the notion that we should breathe air, or eat food. Yet, in our time, the essential things of Christian, or Western, civilization - the air and food of that lost world - are rejected, and things completely foreign to it are assumed to be essential to social life itself.

Science has always been especially interesting to her. Senior year of high school, she took AP Chemistry and AP Biology, won a scholarship to a DOE camp at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, toured the superconducting supercollider, and karyotyped DNA from the HIV virus. Then she realized if she pursued biomedical engineering, she might never see the outside of a lab again. So she attended Willamette University and earned a Bachelor of Science in English. She began writing her first novel as a senior thesis. After college graduation, she moved back to Alaska, had two children, bought a house, became a Certified Master Gardener, and began the challenge of gardening and farming in the High North. Newly attuned to the land and our food supply, her mind created futuristic scenarios of a world without plants. A world without food. A world where bio-engineering might be the only thing that could save humanity. She drew on her previous grounding in science, plus the things she'd learned about plants and animals while farming to create the Botanicaust world. When she’s not writing, you can find her either outside, weeding the garden, fishing the river for salmon, stalking the woods for moose, or inside canning or cooking while listening to her favorite audio books. She currently lives in Chugiak, Alaska with her husband and two children and a house bunny named Abigail. You can learn more about her by visiting her website at http://www.tamlinsey.com", "related": [], "rank": 1245908, "title": "Doomseeds (Botanicaust Book 2) eBook", "author": "Tam Linsey", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
