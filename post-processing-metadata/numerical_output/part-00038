McKechnie's memories of the original musical's creative genesis serve as the centerpiece, and the other chapters are equally compelling. Her story is one of fierce drive and determination. Leaving Detroit at 16, she ran away from home to dance with a touring troupe, arriving in Manhattan at 17. Following a failed audition with American Ballet Theatre, she performed in Massachusetts musicals, filmed commercials and toured inWest Side Story, leaping from the long-run Broadway hitHow to Succeed in Business Without Really Tryingin 1961 to TV (Hullabaloo;Dark Shadows). By the time Stephen Sondheim'sCompanybrought her back to Broadway in 1970, her career was a cakewalk, but the aftermath of a divorce from choreographer Michael Bennett led to a \"vicious circle of depression.\" McKechnie writes honestly, revealing her innermost thoughts, looking back at family, close friends and intimate relationships, while probing her anxieties, low self-esteem and personal pain between the plaudits, raves and theatrical triumphs. 16-page photo insert not seen byPW.(Sept.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Aidan. Baz. Ryan. A functional, happy foursome that lives, laughs, works, and plays together. So what happens when they find themselves attracted to Nicholas, who would make them five instead of four?They make room, of course.Big Enough for Five is the story of five men, different as different can be, drawn together by their love for each other and the small publishing company that binds them. From Baz's playfulness to Aidan's quiet humor, from Nicholas's love for anything to do with books to Marcus's rigid stubbornness, and then Ryan, who has easy tolerance and patience for them all, these men are not to be forgotten.Willa Okati does a truly amazing job of winding these men and their lives together, showing how they affect and are affected by their partners and the others who work with them. I was truly captivated by the descriptions of their personalities and how they managed to shift from four men to five with barely a ripple in their relationship.Not to say, however, that their road always runs smooth. One of the many reasons I loved this story so much was the way Willa illustrates the difficulties the men have when there are five different voices that need different things, both emotionally and sexually. Their problems are real, their solutions are heartwarming and believable, and by the last page, I was a little in love with all five of them.Electrically charged sex scenes and snappy dialogue made this book a compelling, erotic read and added to my overall enjoyment. Big Enough for Five definitely goes on my recommended reading list and has earned a permanent place on my shelf.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She wasn't what he expected.With a frown, he approached her. \"Miss Watson?\"The woman whirled around in surprise, the hope in her gaze quickly dying. \"Yes?\"\"I'm Jason Welborn, your father's partner. He had an appointment this morning that he couldn't miss. He asked me to meet you and invite you to the ranch. He'll meet us there.\"\"All right. As soon as I register, I'll—\"\"No,\" Jason interrupted. \"Sam wanted you to come to the ranch for the length of your stay.\" She continued to stare at him. \"If you don't mind,\" he added reluctantly.Jason saw the woman pause slightly, as if she wondered whether going with him was a good idea.After taking a deep breath she collected herself, \"Very well, Mr. Welborn.\" Then she turned and thanked the man behind the desk and said to Jason, \"I can follow you to the ranch. I have a rental car.\"Jason didn't think Sam had planned on her hiring a rental car. With a shrug he agreed.He followed her out the door and took the opportunity to take a closer look at the woman he had come to meet and who he already didn't trust. She was good-looking, he'd give her that. Her dark hair was pulled back in a simple ponytail, and her features were perfect, her blue eyes remarkably like her father's. But if she was anything like her mother, from what Sam had said, she was to be avoided at all costs.Once she was in her car, a brand-new sedan, Jason climbed into his SUV and headed down the narrow road that would lead to the ranch he shared with Sam Sanders. He'd met Sam ten years ago, long after Jennifer Watson had been taken away by her mother to live in New York. Sam had been a drunkard, wasting his life and his ranch.Jason frowned as he recalled that night many years ago. Sam had been sure he could drive home from the bar, but Jason had driven him. Jason's own parents had died in an accident with a drunk and the pain still haunted him. Jason had made sure that Sam had gotten home safely, and their close friendship had begun that night.Now this woman was going to hurt Sam. Jason just knew that was going to happen. A NewYork woman, just like her mother. He ground his teeth and fought to control his anger.When he parked by the barn, she pulled up next to him. Jason noticed that she just sat in her car, not moving. What was wrong with her? Was she waiting for him to open her door? She probably had people who did that for her in New York. Well, not here. Jason wanted to walk away, leave her sitting in her car. But Sam had asked him to do the job.Opening her car door, he said, \"We're here Miss Watson, are you going to get out?\"She turned to stare at him. \"Oh! Oh, yes… It hasn't changed that much, has it?\"He stared at her. Then he turned away. She hadn't seen the place when it had been suffering from Sam's neglect. \"Rachel is waiting to see you.\"His words stirred her, much to his surprise. Rachel had been the housekeeper for as long as Jason had known Sam. Was she so important to Jennifer after all these years? Where did that leave Sam?\"Do you think Da—I mean, Sam—is back, too?\"\"Not yet.\"\"Oh, okay. I'll…I'll just get my bag.\"He stood there, fighting the gentlemanly behavior his mother had taught him. After she lifted her bag from the trunk of her rental car, Jason reached out and took it. Without waiting for her, he started toward the house.When he didn't hear her following him, he turned around. \"Aren't you coming, Miss Watson?\"Jason noticed that she simply stood looking up at the house, wringing her hands together as though she was nervous. Eventually she shook herself and looked Jason squarely in the eye. \"Sorry. Yes! Yes, I'm coming.\" She started walking toward the house.Her shoes had a low heel. Acceptable wear. In the hard-packed dirt, she was able to move all right. He couldn't fault her there. But he could fault her on her treatment of her father.Eighteen years of silence and she shows up now to \"get to know him.\" Why hadn't she answered his letters over the years? Why hadn't she ever called? Sam hadn't complained. At least, not to Jason. But he knew how much her absence had hurt him. And now she was back.Just then Rachel came to the back door, watching them approach. Jason didn't know what Rachel thought about Jennifer's reappearance. She was intensely loyal to Sam, always had been, and she had stuck by him when he had hit rock bottom. Maybe she would ignore this smartly dressed young woman. Jason sure hoped so.But his hope for Rachel's support disappeared as soon as she stepped outside the house. The young woman's face lit up and she hurried to meet Rachel. \"Oh, Rachel,\" she said with a sob, wrapping her arms around the housekeeper. \"Jenny,\" Rachel said, an uncertain smile on her face and tears in her eyes as she stepped back from the younger woman's hug to look at her. \"You have certainly grown up.\"\"I should hope so,\" Jennifer said, her voice shaking. \"I'm twenty-six now.\"\"I know, it's been so long. Come on in. I'm glad you've come.\"Jenny paused before asking, \"Is…is he here?\"Rachel shot Jason a quick knowing look. Then she said, \"No, he's not here yet.\"\"I'm…I'm anxious to see him. Is he doing all right?\"\"He's fine,\" Jason said, then added, \"At least he was until he got your letter.\"Both women turned to stare at him, but he didn't back down. He'd seen the anguish Sam had suffered when he'd read the letter that had arrived just a couple of weeks ago. Jason had feared he would reach for the nearest bottle again. But he hadn't.Rachel led Jennifer into the kitchen and Jason followed.\"I'll take your bag up to your room,\" he growled.\"No!\" She looked him in the eye. \"I'll wait until he comes. He may prefer that I…I leave.\"\"No, he won't, honey,\" Rachel assured Jennifer.She smiled at Rachel, a small smile full of long history. \"I think I should wait, anyway. He may r-regret his offer of hospitality.\"An uncomfortable silence fell between the group. \"How about a glass of iced tea?\" Rachel said, trying to lighten the mood.\"I'd love one.\"Jason set her bag against the wall. \"I'll take a glass, too, Rachel, if you don't mind.\"\"Of course, Jason. I even made some cookies. You used to love them, Jenny.\"\"Your oatmeal-raisin-pecan cookies? They are so good! I've never found any like them anywhere else.\"\"I'm glad you remember them,\" Rachel said with a smile.Jennifer looked at her. \"I remember a lot.\"They all heard the automobile coming down the driveway. Jason thought Jennifer would be pleased, but she seemed to freeze, staring at the back door but not moving.Rachel walked to the window over the sink. \"That's your daddy,\" she said to Jennifer.As if facing a firing squad, Jennifer slowly stood, continuing to stare at the back door.Jennifer's stomach had butterflies that were doing flips. Many years ago she'd almost made herself sick with missing her father and her home. She'd pleaded with her mother to take her back to her father's ranch. But her mother had been adamant that her father didn't want her. He would have preferred to have had a son.Over the years Jennifer had hung on to the hope that her father would come back for her, but he never had. Maybe her mother had been right after all. The young man who claimed to be his partner was only a few years older than her. Had her father transferred his affection for Jennifer to JasonWelborn?Was that why he'd never answered her letters? She'd worked so hard on them, pouring out her love and hope for a reunion. She'd hurried home from school each day, looking for a letter from her daddy.Nothing.Now, at twenty-six, she needed to know just what had happened all those years ago. So she had written to her father one final time, asking to meet him. She hadn't been sure he'd respond or if he'd even want to meet her. But she'd come anyway, hoping for a miracle.The back door opened and the man she remembered, with a few more lines around his eyes and a few more gray hairs, stood in front of her. At least, she thought she remembered him. There'd been no pictures of him.Her heart was in her mouth. Words couldn't get past that lump. She stared at him, wanting so badly to close the gap between them by rushing into his arms. But he did nothing to encourage her, and her feet remained glued to the floor.Rachel seemed to realize her predicament. \"Look, Sam, Jenny's come home.\"\"It hasn't been her home for eighteen years, Rachel,\" Sam said harshly.Jennifer felt the blood leave her face, and she wavered, fearing she would faint. Such rejection in the face of her hopes. \"Hello…Sam.\" She didn't dare call him Dad. He'd made his feelings clear.\"Hello.\"Jennifer slowly sat down. \"I appreciate the offer to stay here. It was more than generous.\" Her voice didn't sound right, but it was the best she could do.He nodded and looked away.If he wasn't even going to look at her, then she had no reason to stay. She stood again and started for her bag. \"I think I'll go back to the hotel.\"\"No! No, you'll stay here. I won't have the town talking about us!\"Jennifer sat back down. She couldn't stand up to receive the indictment that she felt was coming. She hadn't wanted to believe all her mother's rantings about her father, but maybe now she should.\"Do you want some iced tea, Sam?\" Rachel asked.\"Yeah, that would be good.\" Sam moved to the table but took the seat farthest from Jennifer.As if she carried a disease.Jason took the seat next to Sam as though he was showing what side he was on. Was he trying to prove to Jennifer how much more her father favored him over her?Jennifer bent her head, hoping to hide the tears she felt forming in her eyes. She was beginning to think it had been a mistake to come here. How could she stay here? How could she accept her father's rejection for a second time?\"How are you, Jennifer?\" Sam asked after a minute.She blinked several times before she raised her head. \"I'm fine.

His right knee was bent and his foot was flat against the wall. His dark, slightly curly hair looked as if he'd been running his fingers through it. And with that white shirt and dark suit trousers—no tie, no jacket, and the top button of his shirt undone—he looked tall, dark, handsome…and dangerous.Exactly what Jane was looking for.So why was she hanging back? Why wasn't she marching up to him and…?'Because you're a wimp,' she told herself ruefully.Charlie, her housemate, would've done it. Kissed him, then smiled and wished him a nice day before sauntering off. Then again, Charlie hadpanache. She could have got away with it. Jane knew she couldn't.It was a daft idea anyway. Whoever walked up to a tall, dark, handsome man—a complete stranger—and kissed him?All the same, hewasgorgeous.On impulse, she took her mobile phone from her bag; OK, so she wasn't brave enough to kiss him, but she'd take a photo.Show her housemates the man who really fitted her fantasy— the one she wished she'd been brave enough to kiss. The camera zoom wasn't quite good enough, so she casually strolled closer. Close enough to get him right in the frame.And just as she pressed the button to take the picture he glanced her way and saw what she was doing.'Hey!'Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.She backed away, but not fast enough, and the fingers of his right hand whipped down to encircle her wrist, hard as steel, trapping her where she stood. 'What's all this about?''Nothing.''You just took my photograph!'This was so embarrassing. It would be good if the earth could open up and swallow her.Preferably if time rewound first and she was swallowed up the very second before she'd taken that first step towards him. But, given that time travel wasn't possible, now would do very nicely.He stared at her. He had the most beautiful greeny-grey eyes she'd ever seen, but right at that moment there wasn't a hint of softness or sweetness in them. 'Well?' he asked.She shook her head. 'Look, I apologise.'This was sonothow it was meant to have happened.'Would you mind letting me go, now?' She twisted her wrist in his grasp.'Go…?' Then his gaze dropped to her wrist. 'You still haven't explained what that was all about.''I'm sorry. It was an impulse. A stupid impulse.' She switched the phone off and stuffed it back into her handbag. 'And right now I would very much like to go and hide behind that huge potted palm over there before anyone else stares at me,' she added, the last words uttered through gritted teeth.To her surprise, he actually smiled.It transformed his whole face. Turned him from the Heathcliff type into someone much more accessible. She was glad he was still holding onto her wrist, because she didn't think her legs were going to hold her up for much longer. The tall, dark, handsome and brooding stranger had morphed into someone who was knee-bucklingly beautiful.Not to mention way, way out of her league.'I have a better idea,' he said. 'Coffee.''Coffee?' she repeated, nonplussed. Had she just missed something?'I have a feeling that this is going to be a long story. And it'd be much more civilised to hear it over coffee.''But—' she frowned, puzzled '—weren't you taking a break from a meeting or something? At least, that's what it looked like.''It was an excruciatingly boring meeting.' He lifted one shoulder in the most elegant shrug she'd ever seen. 'My agent can deal with it for me.'Agent? Was he famous, then? Or very important?Of all the men outside all the buildings in all the world, she had to pickthisone to photograph.'Um—don't you need your jacket?''I wasn't wearing one in the first place.'He strode off, giving her no choice but to match her pace to his. 'But if it makes you feel better, I'll call Harry.''Harry?''My agent. Actually, you're right. It's only polite to let them know I'm not going back. Excuse me a moment.' He took a small, slim mobile phone from his pocket with his free hand and speed-dialled a number. 'Harry?Yes. No. Sorry.' He did at least sound genuinely contrite. 'Call you later, OK? Yes. Thanks.'And by the time he'd slid the phone back into his pocket, they were in a café. Standing by the counter, ready to order.'Espresso? Cappuccino?' he asked her.'Skinny latte, please.''Make that two, please,' he said to the barista with a smile.She coughed and looked pointedly at his fingers.He inclined his head slightly and freed her wrist, paid for the coffees before she even had a chance to offer to buy them or at least pay her share, and then shepherded her over to a table overlooking the river.'So. First things first. Your name?' he asked.'Jane.''Jane what?''Redmond.'He inclined his head in acknowledgement, but didn't extend his hand. 'Mitch Holland.'Mitch. Short for Mitchell, perhaps? Though that wasn't a particularly English name, and his accent was most definitely English. Slightly on the posh side.He took a sip of coffee and leaned back in his chair. 'So what was that all about?''I'm sorry. It was just…' She sighed. 'Thank you for the latte, Mr Holland.''Mitch,' he corrected. Then looked at her. Waiting for her answer.Clearly he wasn't going to let her off. She'd have to explain. 'All right.'She turned the mug of coffee round and round in her hands. 'This is going to sound…' she blew out a breath '…ridiculous. Childish.Stupid.''Tell me anyway.''I'm twenty-five today.''Happy birthday. And?'God, he was relentless. The type who'd never let anything go.'I…' She squirmed. Even saying it made her feel whiny. Which just wasn't her. So she let the words go out in a rush. 'Nobody remembered. My parents, my brother, my house-mates—even my colleagues at work.' Then she lifted her chin and stared him straight in the eye. Just so he knew she wasn't whinging. 'I'd already booked today as a holiday. Which left me with two choices: have a pity party and mope around the house, feeling sorry for myself, or spend the day doing things I've always wanted to do and never got round to doing. So I chose to enjoy my day.''Doing things you've always wanted to do.'She could feel her skin heating. 'Things most women have done by the age of twenty-five.' And since she could guess what he was thinking, she threw the words at him. 'If you must know, top of the list was kissing a tall, dark, handsome stranger. But I was too chicken and took your photo instead.'The corner of his mouth quirked. 'You were going to kiss me?'She glared at him. Talk about maximum humiliation.'Interesting.'Before she realised his intentions, he'd pulled her onto his lap, slid one hand across the nape of her neck, and then his mouth was moving against hers. Teasing her. Tasting her. Tiny, nibbling kisses along her lower lip that incited her to open her mouth and let him deepen the kiss.When she did, the tip of his tongue slid against hers. Probing softly, skilfully. Telling her he wanted her. Showing her how much she wanted him.London faded. The noise in the café—people chattering, the clatter of cups against saucers, the thudding bass from someone's earphones—just vanished. No sound. No light, because her eyes were firmly closed. And her remaining senses were focused entirely on Mitch: the feel of his mouth against hers. The light, citrussy scent of whatever shower gel he'd used that morning. The taste of his mouth, coffee mingled with pure male.It wasn't until the kiss ended that she realised his other hand was flat against her back, holding her close, and her own hands were tangled in his hair. Soft, sexy, rumpled hair.Oh, hell.She didn'tdothings like this.She'd never, ever been kissed so thoroughly that she'd actually forgotten where she was.And by a complete stranger, to boot.'Happy birthday,' he said again, this time his tone much sweeter.'Thank you. I think.' She levered herself off his lap and reclaimed her chair. And her dignity. Though she had a nasty feeling that her T-shirt was doing nothing to hide the erect state of her nipples.'So that's what you're going to do today? Go around kissing strangers?'There was definite amusement on his face now. Even though she knew he'd seen and it was too late, she folded her arms to hide her body's arousal. 'No. It was just one little thing on a list.' Empty bravado, and she'd just bet he knew it. After all, she'd already been stupid enough to tell him it was top of her list.'So what else is on your list?'She shrugged. 'A few things.' Things a man like Mitch Holland wouldn't be interested in.Ten minutes ago, Mitch had had no idea that Jane Redmond even existed.And now he'd kissed her. Properly. In public. Enough to be aroused.Mad.Really, he should just shut up. Drink his coffee, to be polite, and then say he needed to get back to his meeting.Ha. Who was he trying to kid? He'd bought the coffee. He didn't have to be polite. He could walk out any time he chose.The fact he didn't want to do that worried him.The fact he wanted to know more about Jane Redmond worried him even more.Relationships weren't even under the 'any other business' section of his agenda, let alone anywhere higher up. So why wasn't his mouth working on the same plans as the rest of his head? Why was it asking her, 'Such as?'She frowned. 'Why do you want to know?'His mouth wasreallyon a roll. 'Seeing as I was involved with the first item.' A kiss. A kiss, he realised with shock, that he wanted to repeat. 'And things are often more fun when you do them with someone else.''Are you inviting yourself along?'Absolutely not. No, no, and thrice no.'Yes.'She looked at him. 'No way would you do the things I want to do.'This was his get-out.

Grade 7 Up—Stable and stoic Elena is a high school freshman when her beloved older sister, Dora, is hospitalized for depression.

In the end, Elena, with the help of her friend Jimmy Zenk, comes to realize that she alone can't make her better and that Dora has to help herself.

Their third is not open to sharing and finds great difficulty in accepting that he is a part of an already established union.     Stormy Glenn has given us a plot, which will have readers putting The Tri-Omega series in their diaries for future release.

Keenan, S. J. shows how acquiring the virtues as habits of being creates our intended identity as Christians. Today's ethical challenge is to uncover our real redeemed nature in the practice of human communal virtue. Keenan regroups the \"cardinal\" virtues, identifies some new ones, and expands the list of \"most desirable\" virtues. With pastoral insight the moral theologian explores the shift from consensus to conscientious virtue, poses questions about forming and following conscience, and explains the difference between conscience and superego. Highly readable essays treat friendship as a moral issue, persuasion as part of justice, and hospitality as Eden-like. Anchor virtues and ordinary ones take shape in narrative examples. Ethicists, pastoral ministers, and spiritually-aware individuals discover new modeling for moral living in this treatment of virtue. Virtues For Ordinary Christians is an impressive use of the essay to convey thoughtful and thought-provoking observations about the nature of virtue, the nature of being Christian, and the need for us all to reexamine our unreflective assumptions about the nature and purpose of virtue.  --Midwest Book Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The subjects, whose thoughts and advice she here shares, are frank and do not sugarcoat the difficulties that can arise in these relationships.'- Library Journal'The great joy of this book is that it is based almost entirely on the contributions of people with AS and their partners... I consider this book to be both accessible and hugely inspiring.'- GAP'There is a long history of specialty self-help books regarding love and relationships for adults; however, few books target adults with Asperger Syndrome as the intended audience. Sarah Hendrickx's book, Love, Sex & Long-Term Relationships: What People with Asperger Syndrome Really Really Want, is a welcome addition to this collection of literature. Written primarily as an instructional guide for adults with Asperger Syndrome (AS) and their partners, this book offers a direct and focused discussion about dating, relationships, love and intimacy, and sexual behaviors... this book is recommended for adults with AS and their partners. It provides a concise yet fairly comprehensive set of topics regarding relationships, love and sex and offers a common language for individuals to begin thinking and communicating about with their partners... this book offers clear strategies for overcoming potential barriers to successful relationships that can be utilized by motivated individuals with AS and their partners.'- Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders'Many People on the autism spectrum have limited knowledge of how to establish or conduct sexual relationships: drawing on extensive research with people on the autism spectrum, the book openly explores such questions. For the first time people with AS discuss their desires, needs and preferences in their own words. AS attitudes to issues such as gender, sexual identity and infidelity are included, as well as positive advice for developing relationships and exploring options and choices for sexual pleasure. This accessible book is an invaluable source of information and support for those with Asperger Syndrome and couples in which one or both partners has Asperger Syndrome, as well as counsellors and health and social care professionals.'- Autism US'A really good read. As a mother of an eighteen year old youth with Asperger syndrome, I was totally able to see where the author was coming from. Very informative and a useful guide for any Aspie Adolescent.'- Asperger East Anglia'Sex is not often openly talked about, even less so when in relation to autistic spectrum disorder. This book is accessible, informative for psychologists and serves as a self-help guide for people on the autistic spectrum and their partners. The text addresses the issues often faced while in, or searching for, a committed sexual relationship. It gives clear and tangible advice about ways to improve communication in this context...The frankness of this book is refreshing. Self-help books examining neuro-typical sex would benefit from taking such a straightforward, uninhibited approach.'- The Psychologist", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It includes courageous personal accounts which offer insight into the often taboo subject of forming new intimate relationships following bereavement, and will be of great comfort.' - Jackie Spreckley, Cruse Bereavement Care counsellor 'I feel this book fills an important gap in the literature of bereavement. Looking bravely at the often taboo topic of intimacy after bereavement, the authors capture the confusion of enjoying a new relationship while still feeling grief and even guilt.

Her writing is an absolute delight -- no nonsense, clear, funny, and sometimes alarming, as she threads her way through the ins and outs of Yemeni life. Steil has achieved far more than a simple description of a stint working at a newspaper in Sana'a. Rather, her book shines a vibrant light on the region, showing it how it is, with astonishing clarity from the inside out.\"--Tahir Shah, author ofThe Caliph's HouseandIn Arabian Nights\"Steil puts humanity and color into her description of a country most Americans know only as a desert haven for terrorists. Her affection for Yemen and its people will make readers want to see it for themselves. A lovely book that offers a large measure of cultural understanding in a region that is too easily misunderstood and caricatured.\"--Nina Burleigh, author ofUnholy Business\"The Woman Who Fell From the Skyis that rare animal: a memoir which reads like a novel. From the exquisite detail to the passionate, poignant, and often hilarious story of one powerful woman immersed in centuries of patriarchal tradition, Steil takes us on a journey that left me exhausted and exhilarated. Hugely entertaining and vitally important to our times, the book tucks us under a veil and allows us a unique glimpse into a culture as old as Noah. Not only did I remember what it feels and smells like to live imbedded in the Arab world, I also relearned my craft of journalism along with Steil's students in her dusty classroom halfway around the world.

Lindy’s charismatic Momma has watched her own dreams of stardom turn to dust and struggles to adjust to a life of menial work and frugality. Then tragedy strikes and Momma and the girls are forced to re-examine their lives.From Texas Columnist Glenn DromgooleThis debut novel revolves around 12-year-old, soon to be 13, Lindy Logan who desperately seeks her mother's approval and love but never can quite figure out how to get it. A big part of the problem has to do with her 8-year-old sister, Jo, who is obviously Momma's favorite, even if Jo is so weird that she talks to her Fruit Loop People. McPhaul has penned a novel with characters who come to life on the page. I wouldn't be surprised some day to see Raggedy Ann Heart as a movie. It's that good, with a powerful storyline and plenty of drama and humor.From TCM ReviewsA heartwarming novel by Heather McPhaul. It is the story of two sisters who do not get along but in the end they want the same thing, their mother’s love. Both 12-year-old Lindy and her little sister Jo’s worlds change the day their mother gets sick. To cope, the girls find hope and escapism in the classic movies which their mother loves.Raggedy Ann Heart qualified as a finalist in Young Adult Fiction for the 2009 Next Generation Indie Book Awards and Indie Excellence Awards.", "related": ["B00727XSYY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 3.2, "rating_total": 16.0}

By that time, his working-class-flavored short stories and essays had appeared in many Midwestern and international magazines and newspapers. Pancoast’s novel Crashing had been published in 1983. In 1986, his United Auto Worker’s union history was published. Pancoast would spend the next twenty years as the editor of a monthly union newspaper—the Union Forum—while continuing to publish his fiction, essays, and editorials not only in the Union Forum but also in Solidarity magazine, the 1.2 million circulation United Auto Workers International publication. The term “blue collar writer” suits Pancoast just fine. As he said in the WSJ interview, “The reason I write about work is that that’s just about damn near all I’ve ever done.” The dust jacket of Crashing notes, “He has worked as a construction laborer, gas station attendant, railroad section hand and brakeman, factory laborer, commercial laundry foreman, and machinist. He has been an English teacher and is a journeyman die maker.” Pancoast supplements his blue collar writing credentials with a B.A. in English from the Ohio State University. William Trent Pancoast is now retired from the auto industry after 30 years as a die maker and union newspaper editor. Born in Galion, Ohio, in 1949, Pancoast now lives in Ontario, Ohio.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Thirteen-year-old Mai is frightened and distraught to learn that her parents have planned to leave their home and secure passage to Hong Kong. But with hopes of freedom and prosperity to spur them on, Mai and her relatives cram themselves onto a barely seaworthy boat captained by a crusty, greedy man. The voyage is difficult at best: food and water are scarce; illness, lice, rats and blazing sun plague the debilitated passengers. When they finally reach Hong Kong, the challenges of a police inspection and a camp filled with thousands of other refugees await them. Although it chronicles many brutal realities, Whelan's story maintains an air of cool composure. Mai is the perfect narrator through whom to introduce a large cast of unusual, sympathetic characters; her emotional control and keen observations prove to be a source of calm in the storm that swirls around her. Readers will be introduced to elements of a new culture and made painfully aware of social conditions in other parts of the world.

One key answer is the lack of an integrated cost and value management framework.Cost and Value Management in Projects provides practicing managers with a thorough understanding of the various dimensions of cost and value in projects, along with the factors that impact them, and the managerial approaches that would be most effective for achieving cost efficiency and value optimization. Addressing cost from a strategic—rather than just a tactical—perspective, this book:Covers the various elements of value management from a project perspective, including planning, engineering, and analysisExamines project management decision areas that have the potential to enhance value, along with relevant managerial approaches that can be used to optimize that valueOutlines an integrated framework for managing cost and value that can be useful to practicing project managersProvides prescriptive advice on how to avoid common pitfalls in managing cost and value in projectsProjects have become one of the key means by which organizations add to theirbottom lines. Mastering the project-based skills, including cost and value management, contained in this book will confer an important advantage on every organization in the relentless competition for profits, market share, and technical innovations.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Editors Larry Smith and Ray McNiece include a selection of four or five poems by each contributor, a biographical sketch and a personal statement from the author about his or her relationship to Zen Practice. The poems, with tiles like \"on the galloping cusp of the new now\" and \"Old Monks Drinking\" are evocative and witty, often filled with a sense of the poignancy and sensuality of the present moment. The introduction provides a brief overview of Zen Buddhism in America and describes the American Zen poetry as a movement  of poets--beginning with the Beats--who experimented with a Japanese aesthetic and were inspired by Buddhist truths.- Holly Gayley, in BUDDHADHARMA (winter 2004).\"A beautiful book, from beginning to end. I especially love the cover.\" -Bree  //  \"The book is terrific!    I'm savoring it, rereading some of the poems that I love.   I like the format, the pictures, the bios, and the Zen statements, and the overview at the beginning.

Very glad to be part of this book.  While neighbors rake lawns and cars honk their horns, this book will hold us.\"-William Heyen /\"What a wonderful addition to the literature of Zen and American poetry. I am proud to be in the book.\" -Mary Sue Koepple /\"Great book Larry.  This is the first poetry book I sat down and read cover-to-cover in a long time.

He struggled through school academically. Diagnosed with dyslexia meant being removed from class to attend ‘remedial” lessons. As a child, Ben did not enjoy reading and writing, and left school early to work with his father as a builder. It wasn’t until his mid-twenties that Ben persisted in teaching himself to read — and finally read his first novel. Ben emigrated to Perth, Western Australia in 1990, where he now lives with his wife Michelle and two adult children, Chelsea and Zac. To pass the hours working as a bricklayer, he would think about writing a novel. However, it took many years for him to pluck up the courage to turn his dreams into words.  His dyslexia, and informal knowledge of the English language and grammar, made his first book a real challenge. Luckily, he had plenty of people around him to help him on his journey. His love of scientific facts, futuristic possibilities, and fast-paced action infects his plots and writing style. He thoroughly enjoys pushing himself creatively, which means venturing into many types of storytelling. As a consequence, his catalogue is a mixture of sci-fi, speculative and horror fiction. Ben now has a growing number of novels to his name, and he fully intends to expand on that number.", "related": ["B00CBJXM1M"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.2857, "rating_total": 30.0}

The story revolves around archeologist Stephen Kaine, whose discovery and excavation of the ancient Persian city of Kasmin-Yar has been cut short by the Turkish government. When the Calais-to-Dover ferry carrying Kaine's daughter Angela is deliberately scuttled by a Turk, the archeologist and his ex-wife Danielle become enmeshed in a far-reaching international conspiracy that seems to involve everybody from Scotland Yard to the American embassy. Intricate plot twists and believable characters send Kaine from England back to Turkey to discover the secrets behind Kasmin-Yar, gradually isolating him and revealing a world in which no one can be trusted and everyone knows more than he about what's really going on. For all his amateur blundering, Kaine manages to hold his own with little help from friends like the enigmatic and alluring Jaymin Bartel. Combining Ludlum's complexity (without the exclamation points) and Higgins's drive (without the occasionally thin narration), Graham has cooked up a robust thriller: fast-moving, well-written and crisply told, a real attention-grabber. 35,000 first printing; major ad/promo.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 2747181, "title": "The Fire Theft", "author": "Mark Graham", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Now she knew what she wanted.The engine started right up but she fumbled with the wheel, her hands shaking with excitement. Speeding out into the suburban street, snow crunching under the tires, Jess wiggled against the seat and reminded herself she didn't care if he fell over himself with lust or not. She wasn't his student, she wasn't in love with him, she wasn't a minor--she had nothing to lose.But one major fantasy could come true. It was worth a little embarrassment. What's the worst he could he do? Make her take another quiz?She smiled and ran a yellow light. College had been very educational. Way more than high school. What better time than Christmas to share all that knowledge?

My father was a pilot, flying Lancaster Bombers in World War Two, then VC10s for BOAC. When he retired we moved to New Zealand and settled on a small farm in Northland. I was eight years old at that time. It was a very beautiful place, close to the ocean and next to a tidal estuary. I spent many days swimming, surfing, fishing and horse riding with my siblings.  I had a love for writing and began writing short stories when I was twelve. English was always my favourite subject. When I finished high school, I studied law at Otago University. After I graduated, I spent almost ten years as a barrister, or court lawyer, practising in the areas of criminal defence, family and employment law. During that time I continued to write and sold some short stories and started my first novella, The Control Sickness. In 1998, I left New Zealand and traveled. I spent about nine years in China and wrote, The Fake Celebrity in China and also Bali Fungus.   My interests and hobbies include writing, surfing, blackjack gambling, chess, movies, running and I also like watching sports on TV, especially rugby, UFC, boxing, tennis and cricket. I have just completed Mangawhai and Cusala (an occult piece) and I am currently writing a sequel to The Fake Celebrity in China. https://twitter.com/FakeCelebChina", "related": ["B007028IXM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her vivid imagination has you being sympathetic with the outlaw children of this story.  A futuristic world is hard to write about because it has to have a believable plot which Ms. Thompson has achieved.  Her plot is greatly detailed and can be followed however technical it may be.  The characters are well defined and you can find empathy and dismay about them all.  I enjoyed this novel from the Prologue and the very first chapter and find that anyone interested in futuristic science fiction about our world will be hooked instantaneously from the first chapter on.  Your empathetic and sympathetic heart strings will be twanged by the outlaw children.Anastasia Cassella-Young - Author and Reviewer", "related": ["B00I9E5G3U"], "rank": 3708387, "title": "Outlaw Children Sacrifice and Redemption eBook", "author": "Marilyn Thompson", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I really like Cara and Gray there is nothing better than two people who have always been into each other finally finding out and then getting what they've always wanted.\"Perfectly Satisfied\" is a sassy romance offering tons of laughs and heat. Reggie and Sam have the chemistry and it shines bright in this novella. I love how in the dark Sam is in the beginning about not only Reggie's feelings but how perfect she is for him. Their history together as friends is sweet and adds to this fun story.\"Finally Satisfied\" is a highly emotional romance. I felt like my heart was being battered as I read about Angel's story. I could feel her pain and understand why she has had such a hard time moving on. But I wanted to stand up and cheer for Mitch because he takes some emotional punches of his own and keeps trying to win over the woman he loves. Mitch is such a wonderful guy. I couldn't wait for both of these characters to get their happy ending!The Satisfaction Collection is satisfying indeed! This story of friends and family finding love will leave you feeling happy and smiling like a loon. All of these couples have unique and passionate stories; each highly enjoyable on their own but together simply magical. Tori Scott makes her mark with the fantastic romances of The Satisfaction Collection!", "related": ["B0085FFWE6"], "rank": 1004122, "title": "Satisfaction: The Collection", "author": "Tori Scott", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 22.0}

Until you can tell a story really well on paper, save your money. Film will wait.” Taking that to the extreme, Lyle has since written for multiple Emmy-winning primetime television series as well as both live action and animated children’s series. But it's the silver screen which continues to inspire Lyle’s deepest dreams. While several of his screenplays have been optioned and he’s been hired to rewrite others, he still looks forward to seeing one of his own films in a movie theater. He’s excited to join the talented crew at Aisle Seat Books and welcomes the opportunity to share his stories with avid readers before film audiences have the chance.

However,\nher life is turned upside down when she rescues a mutt from the heavily\npolluted stream behind her house. As she finds out, it is not a dog at all, but\nan alien ambassador named Ki, trying to find the cause of a terrible sickness\nthat is plaguing his world. Maddy and Ki become environmental detectives,\nfinding that the pollutants that have destroyed the stream are leaching across\na temporal-spatial barrier and killing Ki's home ... Maddy can't tell anyone\nabout Ki's true nature, but needs the help of her friends, especially the cute\nscience geek Alex; her developing feelings for Alex take a back seat as she\naccepts her role as underground environmentalist warrior.This cute story about our responsibility to the environment was\nengaging, and not too heavy-handed or moralizing. For younger tweens the\nmystery of the polluting source has just the right amount of foreshadowing, and\nthey will enjoy the descriptions of the alien creatures and how the\nprotagonists outwit the evil corporate villain. I enjoyed the balanced approach\nthat recognized the needs of the town workers as well as those of the alien\nplanet. ... Maddy is a smart, witty, problem-solving heroine; she is able to\novercome her teenage insecurities as she finds her passion working for a\ngreater cause. This book is a fun read with a good message and tween readers\nwill enjoy this light introduction to the environmentalist cause.--May 2013 issue of San Francisco Book Review. 1776 Productions LLC", "related": [], "rank": 2710513, "title": "Maddy Wylde", "author": "Josephine McLachlan", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her 40+ years of study and practice include two years’ study of Native Ameri-can medicine in Flagstaff, Arizona, and two years studying with a Chinese apothecary (pharmacist) in Oakland, California.  Fain's first encounters with natural healing came during her early years at her grandparent's home, where she gathered garden herbs and vegetables for the “anti-gas” tea offered after large holiday meals. There were plenty of fresh vegetable soups, and healing teas whenever the children fell ill. Grandmother made what she called gravy, made from a blend of veggies thinned with either some pan juice or tomato juice. Fain's brothers suffered from severe allergies and ear problems, and her father suffered with indigestion. The three were milk drinkers while symptom-free family members were not. One early childhood memory is of her grand-mother's cure for a cold: fresh garlic, sliced onions, sage leaves, and rosemary, all wrapped in a dishtowel laid across the afflicted chest, topped with a heating pad. Fain's massage practice got an early start when as a child she walked on her father's back (as a firefighter he carried people from burning buildings). She later graduated to using elbows, fists, and thumbs to loosen cranky muscles and in her teens practiced massage within her mother's hair salon (a person could do that back then).  She employed natural healing techniques with her own children and has not consulted a medical doctor since her youngest child's birth in 1981. Now in her late 50s, Fain takes no prescription or OTC drugs. Though she indulges occasionally in fast food (no cheese!) and rich desserts (even for breakfast), she is also known to carry small packs of sea salt, fresh rosemary, thyme, cinnamon, and/or B-grade maple syrup when eating out. About nutrition she is quick to explain, “It's not about perfection, it's about finding a balance” through countering negative health habits with positive choices. Her personal goal – REgeneration instead of DE-generation. Her mantra is: It's your body. If you don't take care of it, no one else will. Your brain wants information and your body wants good nutrition. The Little Book of Self-Health provides the perfect resource for getting started.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Its position among other clinical disciplines is peculiar; it belongs into haematology as much as into obstetrics; into surgery, or intensive care medicine, as much as into immunology; it has an important role in organ transplantation just as it does in acute trauma management. The physician specializing in transfusion medicine needs to understand the human body in its integrity, in health and in disease. Transfusion medicine is a holistic specialty par excellence. It also bridges the gap between the laboratory bench, where arcane serological problems can now be explained by means of molecular methods, and direct therapeutic application, such as in apheresis techniques.This book is recommended this book as a valuable resource to raise interest in the subject of transfusion medicine and, more importantly, improve the quality of care provided to patients.", "related": ["B003F778K0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All of this is true, of course, but it's also true that Iran is a modern, developed country, and in Ava Homa's first collection of stories, Echoes From The Other Land, we're faced with a jarring combination of realities that co-exist side by side in her homeland. In these seven stories, veiled women use cell phones, buy CDs, are good with computers, and, along with their husbands and boyfriends, party on into the night in stylish western dress, reminding me of the hidden world of our Nineteen-Twenties speakeasies during Prohibition. The friction between strict laws and customs and the realities of modern life makes the sparks fly in these stories.  In \"Fountain,\" the dissonance is surreal as a young woman, Anis, gets bullied and bossed around by Ali, her unemployed husband, who's asserting his traditional authority over her while she's trying to write a computer program. Just as potent in these stories is a kind of resonance that's set up between parallel situations  -  different types of oppression, for example  -  in which one form of imprisonment amplifies the other, allowing the entire story to hum along on a single clear note of perception. For example, in \"A River of Milk and Honey,\" the narrator, Sharmin, a girl set apart by a facial deformity, observes the equally restricted world of her mother, her aunt, and a beautiful young woman who's chased by men and whose parents find her the wrong husband. This same resonant effect is equally powerful in the story \"I am One of Them.\" Two voices pound away at young Sana who's locked herself in her room: her mother, angry that she's broken up with her fianc Zanyar, and her friend Susan on the phone who's also upset with her. The back-and-forth of these voices is intense and claustrophobic.  In \"Glass Slippers,\" the story is told in the second person, as the narrator addresses herself. She and a friend, Sara, are hiding in a basement, trying to get a glimpse of her husband's lover. What the wife discovers about her husband may be far more devastating than adultery, and the effect is amplified by the intimacy of the woman conversing with her turbulent inner self. And in the final story, \"Just Like Googoosh,\" we learn that headscarves  -  not usually worn around the house  -  may serve to hide something painful  -  in this case the loss of Fermisk's hair, quite possibly because of chemotherapy. What makes these stories work is the simplicity and directness of their telling. Homa suggests much and states little outright. Maybe this approach is, in fact, the true \"echo from the other land\"  -  Iran  -  in which much is unspoken and cannot be said, in which there's no doubt a vocabulary of signs and signals and coded words with layers of meanings and suggestiveness. This elusive approach to storytelling is subtle and powerful, haunting the reader with the silence between the words. I'd only add that these characters are all quite youthful, and in future stories, it would be interesting to see what Ava Homa might do with a greater variety of characters at different stages of life.  That said, take your imagination to Iran with this story collection, and you'll be rewarded with much insight and fine storytelling. Ava Homa's Echoes From The Other Land is published by Tsar Books in Toronto. Ranging across regions, ethnicities, genders, sexualities and political dispositions, Homa's characters give us a prismatic portrait of Iran that resists both internal tyrannies and Western demonization. Her style is elegantly spare, gem-solid. This is a voice we all need to hear. - SUSAN HOLBROOK, author of Joy Is So Exhausting Ava Homa is Canada's exquisite answer to Raymond Carver. Homa announces new beginnings - less irony, more hope - and from a breathtakingly multicultural and international perspective. Readers will experience awe and beauty at the force of Homa's art to convey female Iranian protagonists  wholeheartedly grasping their lives. A taut and subtle plain-spokenness enlivens her writing, belying rich dramatic tensions that build just beneath the surface - which will surprise readers and then captivate them. - LOUIS CABRI, author of The Mood Embosser Echoes From the Other Land reviewed on The Thoughtful Blogger http://carolesbooktalk.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/echoes-from-the-other-land-stories-from-iran/ When most of us think of Iran, what comes to mind is the image of women covered in black chadors who move like shadows through a strict, puritanical society.

His first job was with Reuters news agency, followed by a brief spell as a stockbroker. On the outbreak of the Second World War he was appointed assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence, Admiral Godfrey, where he played a key part in British and Allied espionage operations.\n\nAfter the war he joined Kemsley Newspapers as Foreign Manager of the Sunday Times, running a network of correspondents who were intimately involved in the Cold War. His first novel, Casino Royale, was published in 1953 and introduced James Bond, Special Agent 007, to the world. The first print run sold out within a month. Following this initial success, he published a Bond title every year until his death. His own travels, interests and wartime experience gave authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler hailed him as ‘the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.’ The fifth title, From Russia with Love, was particularly well received and sales soared when President Kennedy named it as one of his favourite books. The Bond novels have sold more than sixty million copies and inspired a hugely successful film franchise which began in 1962 with the release of Dr No starring Sean Connery as 007.\n\nThe Bond books were written in Jamaica, a country Fleming fell in love with during the war and where he built a house, ‘Goldeneye’. He married Anne Rothermere in 1952. His story about a magical car, written in 1961 for their only child Caspar, went on to become the well-loved novel and film, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Fleming died of heart failure on 12 August 1964, aged fifty-six.\n\nwww.ianfleming.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Later she was transferred to a second orphanage in Preston in England, which was less harsh, and where, due to one special nun, she became acquainted with the magic of storytelling.   In her teenage years she moved to London to study Drama, working as a telephonist at night to pay her rent and attending Drama school in the day: after which she spent some years working full time in theatre and occasionally in television.   Her first attempts at professional writing began after her two children were born, and she became a full-time mother, writing at night when the world and her children were asleep.  She began with two short stories, both of which won prizes.   She then began her first novel,  `Tread Softly On My Dream’s, based on the true story of the young Irish hero, Robert Emmet. Published by Headline and critically acclaimed by the Press, Tread Softly On My Dreams was acquired by the University of Notre Dame in the US, and The Princess Grace Irish Library in the palace of Monaco. This was followed by her second Irish novel, Fire On The Hill and later followed by her first contemporary novel, Ghosts In Sunlight.  Gretta’s writing career was interrupted in full flow when her son broke his back in an accident and needed her care for some years. Now fully recovered, her son is a successful young actor and Gretta has returned to her passion for writing.     She has just completed her new Historical novel, By Eastern Windows, based again on a true story, set primarily in Scotland and India, and has already started work on the sequel The Far Horizon, set primarily in early Australia.  Gretta is married to a lawyer and lives in London.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

During infancy and childhood he had many conscious astral projections as well as sleep paralysis bouts which lasted for the most about 2 minutes. He assumed that this was a natural state and that each person overcomes this in the process of time just as infants have an imbalance when learning to walk but master it nevertheless even if they lack confidence. During the early teen years, Michael tried to study sleep paralysis on his own without mentioning anything to senior relatives. In 1965, while living in Trinidad, he instinctively began doing yoga postures and tried to make sense of the supernatural side of life. Later in 1970, in the Philippines, he approached a Martial Arts Master named Mr. Arthur Beverford. He explained to the teacher that he was seeking a yoga instructor. Mr. Beverford identified himself as an advanced disciple of Rishi Singh Gherwal, an ashtanga yoga master. Beverford taught the traditional Ashtanga Yoga with stress on postures, attentive breathing and brow chakra centering meditation.  In 1972, Michael entered the Denver Colorado Ashram of kundalini yoga Master Harbhajan Singh. There he took instruction in bhastrika pranayama and its application to yoga postures. He was supervised mostly by Yogi Bhajan’s disciple named Prem Kaur. After learning kundalini yoga, Michael realized that sleep paralysis was caused by the kundalini life force’s inability to synchronize the subtle and gross bodies. He investigated the cause of this and discovered that if the kundalini was kept in a super charged state sleep paralysis would not occur.", "related": ["B00CICSW44"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Readers are always connected to the sky through a great range of blues, indigos, and sunset colors.

He was responsible for coordination of all security aspects of Russian cipher communications with its outposts abroad when he was exfiltrated with his wife and daughter by the CIA in 1980. He worked for the National Security Agency for a number of years and is a recipient of several prestigious awards in intelligence and security. Victor Sheymov is also the author of TOWER OF SECRETS: A Real Life Spy Thriller. This memoir describes how  Sheymov, ace troubleshooter for the KGB super-secret Eighth Chief Directorate, operating out of the infamous Lubyanka Moscow Center, was head of security for cipher communications worldwide, and thus had a rare knowledge of the entire KGB system. A star player, headed for the top, his contacts ranged from party elite to the dissident community and the Moscow underworld.  Victor Sheymov is also the author of CYBERSPACE and SECURITY: A Fundamentally New Approach. This book establishes that our legacy computer security systems are failing for a simple reason: we tried to adopt security methods developed in our physical space for protecting cyberspace objects. These two spaces are so different that methods effective in one do not necessarily work in the other. Our physical space security methods are generally static. In order to adapt to the highly dynamic environment of cyberspace, we need to base our security on dynamics and secure virtualization. Victor Sheymov also authored articles in The Washington Post, Barron's, World Monitor, National Review and other national publications. He appeared at many national news programs including Larry King Live, 48 Hours, Dateline, McNeil-Lehrer, Charlie Rose and the McLaughlin Report.", "related": ["B009RBQQV0"], "rank": 1758889, "title": "Party Gold (1)", "author": "Victor Sheymov", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He taught for many years in Japan, authored best-selling books, and counted among his students a large number of Japan's top executives, politicians, fine artists, athletes, martial artists, and people from every walk of life.

Jacob also did academic work in philology, related to how the sounds in words shift over time (Grimm's law); he was also a lawyer whose legal work, German Legal Antiquities (Deutsche Rechtsaltertümer) in 1828, made him a valuable source of testimony about the origin and meaning of much legal historical idiom usage and symbolism.They can be counted along with Karl Lachmann and Georg Friedrich Benecke as founding fathers of Germanic philology and German studies. Late in life they undertook the compilation of the first German dictionary: Wilhelm died in December 1859, having completed the letter D; Jacob survived his brother by nearly four years, completing the letters A, B, C and E, and was working on Frucht (fruit) when he collapsed at his desk. The first collection of fairy tales Children's and Household Tales was published in 1812 and it contained more than 200 fairy tales. Some collections of the stories had already been written by Charles Perrault in the late 1600s, with somewhat unexpected versions.

Once I picked it up, I found it impossible to put it down.\" --Tom L. Beauchamp, Professor of Philosophy and Senior Research Scholar, Kennedy Institute of Ethics, Georgetown University\"A letter of invitation to the Hastings Center from Daniel Callahan in 1971 opened wide my life. This special book, like having the true pleasure of talking with Dan, will show you why. The trip through the life of someone who (with Will Gaylin) invented bioethics, who is specially, humanly smart, interested in almost everything, well-read, and educated (in the best sense), is more than interesting. His ideas are always accessible, and while you may not agree with everything, you will be happier to have shared his thoughts.\" --Eric Cassell, Emeritus Professor of Public Health, Weill Medical College of Cornell University\"Dan Callahan was the right moral philosopher to be present at the creation of bioethics. He tests the progress of medical science against the classical moral questions, how to live humanely and justly. At the same time, he forms his reflections into realistic, rational policies and practices. Good counsel for current and future bioethics!\" --Albert R. Jonsen, author ofThe Birth of Bioethics\"How refreshing to read a first-hand account from a person who was there at (or close to) the moment of creation of a new field. As befits his status as a respected founding father, Dan Callahan's bookIn Search of the Goodis equal parts personal memoir, historical review, and critical analysis of U.S. bioethics -- a field he and the Hastings Center helped to create. The book, filled with charm, wit, and occasional pointed barbs, traces Callahan's life in bioethics and we are all the wiser for it.\" --Eric M.

Starting at George Washington’s Farewell Address and ending with George W. Bush’s Axis of Evil State of the Union speech, Vilade reveals the varied and often conflicting points of view that shaped the final famous words.Color facsimiles show actual edits, deletions, additions, and handwritten notes to illustrate how remarkable and forceful language was crafted, sometimes at the last minute, into enduring words made famous by their timing, context, delivery, and power, from the 1823 Monroe Doctrine to Ronald Reagan’s “tear down that wall, Mr. Gorbachev” speech at Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, revealing political and social currents that frame these words for modern times.", "related": ["B004UJCES8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When I finished my book, Red Maslem and the Pilots of Anzo, I thought, why not start another. I had seventy or so short stories I had written, so I decided to put them into a collection.As I got into it, I found I had enough for at least three books in this collection. I took one of my favorites, Anthem, as my key character and build the three volumes around it.When I finished the first one, I decided to publish it on Kindle as an experiment. I will continue with the other two books. The second one went online yesterday.I have two other books, as yet unpublished. They are, The Viney Woods, a story about a young man who is the expected savior of a planetary system, and the one mentioned above, Red Maslem ... which is about an asteroid miner who finds himself among the remnant survivors of Earth II. He and his crew search for a home  and eventually revenge themselves on the invaders.I found writing a collection of short stories stimulating. Each chapter is a change of pace for me. The result, a book that features my thinking in various genres.My next endeavor, after editing the books mentioned above, will be to write a series of books on finding a new planet for the survivors of earth. It will be different from Red Maslem in that the earth is not invaded, at least not yet, it is dying from overpopulation. Ships are sent out to find a new planet for humans.One of the ships has a boy named, Christopher, on board. The series will include chapters on Christopher as the key character and other short stories to accompany the Christopher series.", "related": [], "rank": 3921865, "title": "Anthem And Other Short Stories (Anthem I, II and III Book 1) eBook", "author": "Roger W.

He expertly describes the methods used for mining coal. He provides insight into the dog-eat-dog career competition among university professors.

One is personal: he's being blackmailed by someone who knows about his nearly disastrous undercover role in a recent case. But things aren't much better professionally. His latest case involves a body discovered in a shallow grave at a local convent, and for lapsed Catholic Joe, just the wordconventsparks ugly memories. He spent his childhood being chastised by his pious mother, berated by strict nuns, and harshly disciplined by stern-faced priests. But as he investigates what is clearly a brutal murder, Rafferty finds himself drawn to the calm of the cloistered sisters. Tempted to share his reawakening faith with his partner, DS Dafyd Llewellyn, Rafferty stops himself when he begins to suspect that one of those peaceful nuns just might be the killer. Clever plotting and polished prose make for a cracking good British police procedural. A good choice for Sally Spencer readers.Emily MeltonCopyright © American Library Association.

Transgender Fiction is full of stories that I call \"any reason to get a boy in a dress.\" Usually these story are contrived and the character's motivation for dressing as the opposite gender has no basis in the reality for that character. Here, we see the decision making process for deciding to do something outside the norm and the underlying factors for the decision. Nothing ever happens in a bubble, so why do stories want us to believe that they do.This is a sweet story, filled with a character searching their innermost to come to a conclusion. There is also a great set of accepting parents in this book as well and their motivation for why they allow the child to even have certain choices made available to him.This is a nice, quick read. Perfect for when you have a few hours to devote to a book and want to get a complete story in, but it is one you can keep going back to.

Do you tell it in first person? Do you tell it in third person? Do you tell it in present tense? Do you tell it in past tense? And do you split the point of view between more than one characters? Will it all work out in the end? The mind boggles.It can be a daunting thought, especially when the end can seem so far away, on the last page of a notebook needing filled. This takes me on to one of the perks to writing short stories - the end never feels too far away. And, if you want to see how the story works written in a different tense, then it's a much more manageable task to handle.This small decision can make you feel completely differently towards a story. It's a decision that needs to be right. The lovely thing about a short story book is that you can get examples of all these different types of writing under one cover. It will, in return, definitely give YOU the reader something you love.I can't believe this is the third short story book to be released by the same group of authors.Some of the authors have changed since OUT OF DARKNESS hit Amazon in October; more writers introduced their work, not only to you, but to us, for A FESTIVE FEAST. And now, more still, for LOVE IS IN THE AIR.All of the authors involved have been a great, supportive bunch of people. I've met some good friends along the way. I'm glad and proud to be here for the journey. I'd like to say a big thanks to Vanessa, for getting the ball rolling those months ago, but also, to the writers, for keeping it rolling. Let's see how many more writers we can pick up along the way.So, may you enjoy our new romantic collection of short stories. May you laugh, cry, gasp and sigh your way from cover to cover. And may we continue to raise money for some wonderful charities at the same time.This particular book is raising money forDiabetes UK. This charity not only cares and unites people affected by diabetes, but its active research is always pushing forward to help in prevention,improving care and treatment, and working towards finding a cure.My son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes three years ago at the age of 6. Type 1 Diabetesdevelops when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. He needs two injections every day to keep his insulin levels up and his blood sugar levels down. I see, every day, how this can affect a young person's life, and I hope one day, like many others, that it will be a thing of the past.This charity is very close to my heart, so I thank you for your support. We couldn't do it without you.Kind Regards,Angela Kelman", "related": ["B00IBHSZ4M"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But until now we have somehow failed to grasp the importance of the great lyric tradition that is Swedish poetry.Why is it so important? Because Swedes, more than any other twentieth-century poetic tradition, were able to find a lyric and transcendent moment that gives their poems grace without large proclamations, without yelling on rooftops, without super-ego movements. Swedes prove to us over and over that even in the midst of this most barbarous century, it was still possible to find moments of wonder.And while many of us already suspected that there’s no poet currently alive on this planet who can write better than Tomas Transtromer (and Malena Morling, without doubt, is his best translator into English—read Grief Gandola # 2 in this book, and you will fall in love with that spell-binding voice), we also need to recognize and embrace the fact that Transtromer is only a part of a very large and varied poetic tradition.

Oijer and Marie Lundquist, make us stop and look at the rooftops of our own streets, at park-benches and balconies and see—well, they give us permission to see—wonder instead of destruction, grace instead of despair, a wooing whisper instead of mere ironic talking, clarity instead of vague and sardonic assumptions that are so common in contemporary American poetry.This book won’t just tell us something about Swedish poetry, it will help us to see ourselves in a new way.\"—Ilya Kaminsky, author ofDancing in Odessaand editor ofThe Ecco Anthology of International Poetry\"This is a selection splendidly edited to highlight the history of what is Swedish about Swedish poetry, without avoiding the obvious fact that the younger poets are influenced by many other poetries, mostly American. The stark delight of luminous starlit nights and emotional landscapes makes this a compelling journey.”—Andrei Codrescu, author ofSo Recently Rent a World", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Taking a Walt Whitman poem's metaphor for a phallus as his title, Hartwell explores the power of masculine sexuality in the interactions of a number of intriguing characters. Strangely, the most engaging character in the novel other than the protagonist is the only character portrayed as straight, the handsome boy Taylor who grows up to be a national sports superstar. The fact that the narrator is in love with Taylor for most of Taylor's life and Taylor doesn't mind, and the fact that Hartwell doesn't explore, explain, or even mention their relationship until late in the novel, gives the book a power that surprised me. - Marcus Parr,Go ReviewsImpressive third novel from Hartwell. The Hemingway-like style of staying out of the way and having characters reveal themselves through dialogue works to perfection here. The realization that our narrator is the sexiest and most humane character in the novel comes from seeing how others interact with him. Among the supporting cast, Case and his son Taylor are especially beautifully-drawn. Once again Hartwell uses sex as the vehicle for character study, and once again the result is a wonderful read. The novel will not appeal to everyone, but many readers will find it both sensuous and oddly charming. - Colby Rasmussen,Colby Universe", "related": ["B00IZR0FI2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I was in the third grade and my teacher, Miss Steere, asked us each to write a story about something in history. I chose to write about the Donner party and the tragedies that befell them as they tried to make it to the wild west. I went on and on.  I was having so much fun and making up stories about the people and conversations between them.  It was like a game to me.  It didn't occur to me that I wanted to be a writer when I grew up.  I wasn't even old enough to understand what it meant to be grown up. Throughout school, whenever I had to write something, I always had a lot of fun with assignments.  I remember writing about the Salem Witches when I was in high school and how exciting it was to make \"real\" people who lived then and, unfortunately, also died. So what did I do when I was finally an adult?  I worked as an accountant, secretary, draftsman of pre-fab metal buildings, I studied Criminal Justice and worked at the Sheriff's Department for a time, and I ended up with a career as a paralegal. Well, that wasn't too bad.  It encompassed a lot of research and writing and, in the meantime, I had actually written short stories, poetry, and two unpublished novels.  I did have one non-fiction piece published in a magazine in the 80s.  Yippee! Finally, I said \"enough\", quit everything, took early retirement, and moved to Morocco.   Now, I am a writer.  I love my life and I hope you enjoy my books as much as I enjoy writing them.  I have a lot of fun with my characters and stories.  To me, they are real people and my joy is sharing them with the you and the rest of the world.", "related": ["B0097HAPDY"], "rank": 1878017, "title": "Damage Control (Det.

Proclaimed by the Lexington Herald-Leader as \"quite likely the most influential popular chronicler of Kentucky in recent years\" Powell's newest book Historic Kentucky Bluegrass, is \"like a pocket portfolio\" depicting a series of some 100 landmarks in the 17 Bluegrass counties of central Kentucky that have impacted our American heritage. It contains illustrations by Powell in his unique pen-ink style that shows why his work is so popular.", "related": ["B00GK8S9O0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I worked for many years in a local nursing home and helped my mother care for my father which gave me insight about what caregivers deal with. Switching genres, when an idea comes to me, gives me flexibility as a writer.  I write in 12 font to make reading my books user friendly.

I love the new and the modern and even write speeches\nand video scripts for scientists and engineers that explain their cutting edge\nprojects to the public.So when I headed to Berlin to research my thriller, my tech scene checklist\nwas filled... Sparkling highrises on Potsdamer Platz, Norman Foster's light-flooded,\ntransparent iteration of the Reichtag... newly rebuilt and reopened subway and\nrail stations... a café near Wooga to bask in the geek speak of young game\ndesigners and code writers... In short, I wanted to soak in theZeitgeistof today's Berlin and not the\ntired old clichés.And what happened?History happened... old family stories still haunted... my grandmother sending\nme off to visit the giraffes, theirs was the only zoo enclosure to survive the\nbombings... my dad's tales of jumping off the bridge in front of the Pergamon\nMuseum to swim in the Spree, and of playing subway tag through underground\nBerlin with his friends ... the selfie every family member takes at the corner of\nCharlottenstraße and Zimmerstraße to remind us that this was where\ngreat-grandfather Albert, the Berlin correspondent for Reuters had a job with\nthe Wolff'sches Telegraphisches Bureau until, as our family saga tells it, the\nWeimar Republic, and later, the Nazi \"Banausen\"\nmade life too difficult for journalists who insisted on writing the truth.And then along came a spy called Ed Snowden proving, if I ever doubted, that\nmy protagonist was smart to hide out in Berlin after she was fired in disgrace\nfrom the NSA. Fritzi Jordan was a just a hacker. She thought she was a white\nhat hacker, keeping the world safe and never wanted to become a whistleblowing\nhero until life and history took away her choices.In summary... the bag of tricks making upThe\nProfessional Friendincludes a bit of history, a fair amount of high tech,\nboth real and invented, a bit of luck with the timing, and lots of fun.I hope you enjoy the ride.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought Quincy fucked with dudes. He had too many females on his dick all the time. And never would I have thought that I'd see him naked. The only thing more appealing than the long, uncut piece of meat between his legs was the smooth, round ass I saw as he walked back to the bed.I watched Quincy slip back into the bed and lay on his back. He was more beautiful than I had imagined. Before I saw Damien on the basketball court a few months ago, I had the hugest crush on Quincy. He was my brother's best friend. The two of them went everywhere. They even fucked girls together. I listened in on them on more than one occasion. And now, the boy was laying on a bed, naked, on his back, stroking his dick.\"Go ahead,\" Diablo urged. He slipped his middle finger in my ass and put pressure on my prostate. I gasped at the sudden invasion. \"Fuck his mouth like it was some ass.\"I looked over my shoulder at Diablo. His dick was hard as Hell. The lusty grin on his face answered my question before I asked it. \"Are you serious?\"He slid his hand from my ass and pushed me at the small of my back towards the bed. I didn't even look back. I took my dick in my hand and stroked as I approached Quincy and his wide open mouth. My nuts pulled close to my body in anticipation of orgasmic release.\"What the fuck are you doing here, Q?\"\"Stop talking and put that dick in my mouth. I know you been wanting to freak with me from the moment you saw me. Don't fuck it up.\"I didn't need any further encouragement. Quincy's head hung over the edge of the bed. I placed the tip of my dick on his lips and slowly stepped forward. I anticipated hitting the back of his throat but inch after inch of my dick slid down his throat until my nuts snuggled up with his nostrils. I was balls deep down his throat.Quincy reached up with one hand and gripped my ass. He urged me deeper into his throat. I thought I'd reach his gut, how hard he pulled me in. Then he pulled me back. I got the message. Slowly, I rocked my hips back and forth until I hit a steady rhythm and fucked his mouth and throat.\"Oh my fucking, God,\" I moaned as I stroked. I clenched my eyes shut and concentrated on not cumming too quickly. \"Damn, this shit feels so fucking good.\"", "related": ["B00DQ2B48Q"], "rank": 606474, "title": "Hoop Dreams 2: Ballers & Bangers", "author": "BEAST", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She wrote her first book at the age of 21 and it was called Jigsaw.   It became an immediate bestseller and sold 100,000 copies in hardback in England and all over Europe in translation. Between the ages of 77 and 97 she increased her output and wrote an incredible 400 romances as the demand for her romances was so strong all over the world.She wrote her last book at the age of 97 and it was entitled perhaps prophetically The Way to Heaven.  Her books have always been immensely popular in the United States where in 1976 her current books were at numbers 1 & 2 in the B. Dalton bestsellers list, a feat never achieved before or since by any author. Barbara Cartland became a legend in her own lifetime and will be best remembered for her wonderful romantic novels so loved by her millions of readers throughout the world, who have always collected her books to read again and again, especially when they feel miserable or depressed. Her books will always be treasured for their moral message, her pure and innocent heroines, her handsome and dashing heroes, her blissful happy endings and above all for her belief that the power of love is more important than anything else in everyone’s life.", "related": ["B00JDNI4QC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
