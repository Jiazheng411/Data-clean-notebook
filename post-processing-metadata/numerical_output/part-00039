Long presumed dead, Stump has crawled out of his hole with a new identity and a sinister plan to eliminate Mary. His bait: Mary's three-month-old goddaughter, Lily, daughter of Mary's ex-lover Jonathan Walkingstick and his new bride, Ruth. Mary has just finished her closing arguments for a kiddie porn conviction when she learns that Lily has been kidnapped. As Mary follows the kidnapper's trail, it becomes apparent that the kidnapper is far more interested in Mary than Lily. Bissell slips plenty of information from her earlier books into the story to keep readers up to speed, and some will be pleased to note that this book contains significantly fewer gruesome elements than her previous shockers. Though details of child endangerment and child pornography are still stomach-churning, Bissell's strong writing and clever, didn't-see-that-coming denouement will keep readers enthralled. If Bissell can better flesh out her characters' motivations, she may soon be keeping company with the likes of Tami Hoag and Sandra Brown.Copyright Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His brother would be angry if he woke up Abby. Though they had a couple months to go before being born, the twins in her belly were already not letting her sleep.Because he was speeding by, Brad almost missed the flicker in the pasture to the left, a bit of land the Logans rented from the government. Braking to a stop, he backed up to see if it could be true. He thought everyone knew not to have a campfire on government land.There it was, almost hidden behind a small hill. He had to snuff it out.His headlights picked up tire tracks leading off the macadam. Following the tracks, he came upon a darkened old car and the offending campfire right beside it.Only after parking his truck and walking up to the fire did he notice the young woman who sat beside it, obviously in deep thought.\"Ma'am?\"Startled, she jumped, losing her balance on the rock on which she sat. Getting up, she dusted off her rear, sputtering, \"Wh-who are you?\"\"The name's Brad Logan. My family rents this land from the government. You're not allowed to camp here. And you're definitely not allowed to have a campfire.\"\"We're not doing any harm.\"\"Lady, it's been a dry year. We can't take any risks of a forest fire. I'm sorry, but the fire has to go.\" He kicked dirt onto the fire, but the woman stopped him.\"If you knew how long it took me to get that fire started, you wouldn't so cavalierly destroy it!\"He shook off her hand. \"Look, you don't even have any business being out here. We've had bears down this low. What would you do if a bear attacked you? You need to go back to Pinedale and get a motel room.\"\"No! No, I can't!\" The woman appeared distraught.\"Why not?\"\"I don'tâ Money is tight!\"\"There's a campground at Yellowstone. I doubt they're crowded on an October night.\"\"Uh, yes, thank you.\"Something in her face told him she wouldn't be going to Yellowstone, despite her verbal acceptance. Wherever she went, he couldn't leave her here.\"Do you have any water?\"\"Yes.\" She turned toward her darkened car.\"I need it to be sure the fire is completely out.\"Disbelief shone on her face when she spun on her heel. \"You're going to pour it on the fire? I don't have much and the kids will need it in the morning.\"His eyes darted around the car. \"You've got kids here?\"She gave a brief nod, backing away from him. \"Look, we'll go, but I need what water I have.\"\"Where are the kids?\"\"They're sleeping.\"\"Lady, you need to do a better job raising your kids!\"\"And you need to mind your own business!\"Not knowing what else to do, Brad took out his cell phone and called the sheriff. After filling him in, he asked, \"Shall I bring her in?\"He was watching the woman as he spoke and when he mentioned taking her in, her eyes opened wide and she immediately began gathering the few things she had out. \"We'll be on our way!\"Before she could reach her car, such as it was, Brad caught her arm. \"The sheriff said for me to bring you in.\"\"But we haven't done anything!\"\"Then you won't mind talking to the sheriff, will you?\"\"Yes, I do mind. I don't want to leave the kids.\"\"Of course not. We'll take them with usâ¦in my truck.\"\"No! I can't leave my car here!\"\"If the sheriff says it's okay, I'll bring you back in the morning.\"He walked over to the old car and looked through the window to see two kids sleeping in the two seats.\"Where were you going to sleep?\" he asked the woman.\"That's none of your business!\"He opened the car door, waking the children. \"Hi, kids. Your mom has agreed to come to our ranch for the night. Is that okay with you?\"A small girl, maybe eight or nine, and a little boy who looked to be about five, the same age as his nephew Robbie, stared at him.The children looked out for their mother, and he realized he'd never introduced himself. \"Sorry, I forgot to tell you who I am. My name's Brad. We'll take my truck to the ranch. Okay?\"\"Is that your truck?\" the little boy asked, getting on his knees and looking out the window.\"Yeah. Do you like trucks?\"He nodded. \"I can ride in yours?\"\"Sure. Ask your mom.\"\"But she's not here.\"Brad turned to look at the young woman. \"She's not your mother?\"\"No,\" the little boy said sadly.Just what the hell was happening here? Brad wondered. Not wanting to upset the boy, he said calmly, \"Well, buddy, why don't you come ride with me? She'll follow us.\"\"Will you come, Sarah?\"\"Yes, Davy, I'll follow you. I'm not leaving you behind.\"The little girl got out of the car and moved to Sarah's side. \"Sarah, I don't think you should let Davy go with him. We don't know him.\"She put her arm around the girl and smiled. \"It's all right, Anna. We're going to follow right behind.\"Then the woman moved closer to Brad and whispered, \"Don't even think of trying to take Davy from me.\"\"I won't, as long as you follow me.\"She moved away from him and hugged the boy. Then she and the girl got in the old car and started the engine.Brad helped the little boy into his truck and fastened the seat belt for him. \"Davy, I'm glad you're going to ride with me. I don't like riding alone.\"\"Me, neither.\"\"Okay, we'll be home in twenty minutes.\"But after five minutes, he noticed the womanâ Sarahâwasn't behind him. He made a U-turn and found her car dead on the side of the road. \"Davy, I need to see if I can help her. Sit here.\"When he got to the car, Sarah had tears running down her cheeks.\"Are you okay?\" he asked.Quickly she wiped her tears away. \"I'm fine.\"\"Do you know what's wrong with your car?\"\"No.\"\"Okay, why don't you and Anna come get in my truck with Davy. We'll see what we can do about your car tomorrow.\"\"Weâwe need our suitcases.\"\"Where are they?\"\"In the trunk. I'll get them.\"Despite her independence, Brad retrieved the two suitcases from the trunk and put them in his truck.\"Here, Anna, let me help you up,\" Brad said to the little girl. Then he turned to the young woman, but Sarah had already climbed up into the backseat.\"Put your seat belts on,\" he directed as he got behind the wheel. \"We'll be at the ranch in a few minutes.\" He pulled out onto the highway.None of his three passengers responded. The children looked like they'd gone to sleep, but he could see Sarah watching his reflection in the rearview. When his eyes met hers on the mirror, she diverted her gaze.She looked to be in her early twenties, with light brown hair that framed her face and fell to her shoulders. Her eyes were big, though in the dark he couldn't detect a color. Under ordinary circumstances, Brad suspected it would be a beautiful face, but right now worry and tension had painted dark circles under her eyes and tightened her mouth.He wanted to ask Sarah who the children were to her, and why they were in her care, but he gave her her way and was silent for the rest of the ride.When he got to the house, he turned to her with an arm across the seat and said, \"My sister-in-law is seven months pregnant with twins. She has trouble getting back to sleep if she wakes up, so I'd appreciate it if you're quiet.\"Sarah got out of the truck and helped Anna down. Then she opened Davy's door and helped the little boy.\"What are we doing here?\" the woman asked. \"I thought you were taking me to talk to the sheriff.\"He'd taken her to the Logan ranch, his home. The sheriff, who happened to be his mother's second husband, had agreed to meet him there.\"This is my family's ranch. The sheriff's meeting us here. That's his car.\"At the mention of the sheriff, her face seemed to blanch. \"Are you all right?\"Her eyes, when she looked at him, were dark brown. \"We didn't do anything wrong.\"For some reason he felt compelled to reassure her. Maybe it was the way she obviously cared for the children, or because he'd discovered a soft spot for damsels in distress. Either way, he motioned with his hand for her to follow him.He opened the door to the kitchen and allowed Sarah and the children to enter. The sheriff was sitting at the big oak table. \"Mike, this is Sarah, Anna and Davy.\"Mike stood. In his early fifties and with gray hair, he still cut a formidable figure. \"Hello. I'm Mike Dunleavy, the County Sheriff. Have a seat. Would you like some coffee?\" He nodded toward the counter, where he'd obviously put on a fresh pot as soon as Brad had called.\"No, thanks. But c-could the kids have some milk?\" Sarah asked, as if asking a big favor.Brad spoke up. \"Of course. I'll get it.\"After he had delivered the two glasses to the children, Mike began his questioning. He started with her name.\"Sarah Brownly.\"\"Are you on vacation?\" he asked Sarah.She pressed her lips together. Then she said, \"Sort of. I lost my job andâand we decided to move.\"\"And those are your only bags? Your only belongings?\"She kept her gaze lowered. \"Yes.\"\"Are these your children?\"Again she hesitated. Only this time it seemed minutes had passed before she finally shook her head.\"Where are their parents?\"\"Anna and Davy are my half siblings. Our mother died recently.\"Mike raised his brows. \"I'm sorry,\" he said in a gentler tone. \"It must be hard for you. For all of you.\"Sitting across from her, Brad saw the tears form in her eyes. If she was lying, she was a damn good actress.The little boy, who'd been quietly sitting, drinking his milk, slid from his chair and tugged on her sleeve. \"I'm sleepy, Sarah.\"She took Davy into her lap. Anna scooted her chair close to Sarah and leaned against her, too.Again Brad was struck by the tenderness that Sarah displayed toward the children. He couldn't help but feel sorry for the kids. \"Davy, my nephew is about your age. He has an extra bed in his room upstairs. Would you like to sleep in it?\"Davy looked up at Sarah for permission. When she nodded, he asked Brad, \"Won't he mind?\"\"I doubt he'll wake up before morning. Come on.

This is a deeply emotional story that kept me on the edge of my seat. I stayed up all night reading it because I could not go to sleep until I read the last page and found out what happened to these two. The characters are very well developed, and the scenarios are completely realistic. I know of very few authors who could have successfully pulled off what Ms. Glenn does in this latest book. The sexual tension just keeps ratcheting higher and higher the farther into the book you get, and when it finally explodes, boy does it explode! Hot cannot even begin to describe it. But as with all her books, the sex is intermingled with emotions, and that is one of the reasons I, as a reader, keep coming back for more.

The bulk of the book is devoted to his major league career with the Cubs and, later, the Atlanta Braves. Although Christopher does engage in some blatant hero worship, he balances his regard with reports of young Maddux's immature acts, which included everything from screaming obscenities to arguing with umpires. Overall, this is a well-written biography, with plenty of exciting play-by-play to satisfy baseball fans.

Great ideas in a simple way is what this book is about - both regarding the message and the way it's presented. Everyone should learn more about developing their intuition.\" --Fredrik Haren, Sweden, Author of the Best-Selling \"Idea Book\"Rated 4 Stars - Highest RatingIt's often the case that great thinking comes in small (79 pages!) packages when it comes to books about organizations and management. \"Ting!\" is a prime example of taking intangible concepts (such as innovation and creativity) and composing a nice little story about how they can be of value in our daily lives. It's the type of book to be read by people who have talent and work for good companies but are not excited about what they do. And, like a lot of good business and people these days, it comes from India.There are encouraging messages presented that act as chapter summaries. They are the Rules of \"Ting!\" and examples are \"say Yes! to your intuition,\" and \"do nothing for 5 minutes a day.\" While I confess to doing nothing or nearly so for a lot more than 5 minutes (try 2 to 3 hours) a day, I understand that what is meant here is to try to \"become more aware of what is really happening day to day and being more engaged in what you do, who you are, and what you're communicating.\" If you're not sure what \"engagement\" is, go to Gallup's Website and read some of the articles on employee engagement. You'll get it.People are disposable items these days, being \"at will\" minions. It's no wonder they aren't \"listening to their intuition and practicing awareness for 10 minutes every day.\" This book offers some key ingredients for a healthy organization. --Training Magazine, U.S.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

You may also want to fill a squirt bottle with water and brown food coloring to simulate Rod's hair dye-infused sweat.Ah yes, the hair! Blago's moptop is so ridiculous that no wig could ever do it justice. I recommend finding a large black cat that has recently passed away.

She's joined by her occasional lover Olaf Reykjavik; Vagina Gina Dentata, a modified pseudo-ape; Precious Bin, a male Atch; and several artificial intelligences (one of which resides in her head). Lydia discovers warlike female Atch descendants who have killed off the males and now reproduce by cloning, but when she and her team try to leave, they're trapped by a slightly barmy AI intent on keeping the violent Atch from traveling in space.

While it seems that fate is conspiring against him, taking him further from his home than any squirrel has traveled, his journey is a necessary step to saving all of Central Kingdom from the evil trying to consume it....`This book reads like a fantasy novel, even though it is set in New York City. The horrors that Patch encounters at times seemed so unreal to me, despite knowing where they were. Seeing them from another pair of eyes gave some things a new air of terror and others one of wonder.`This is not a light novel. It is very dark, and at times absolutely horrifying, but I connected so much to Patch as a hero that, in the end, I was left with tears of relief and happiness in my eyes.'(KateGoodReads)`More than anything else, Evans's book is about communication, physical, verbal, and instinctual; about gossip, eavesdropping, and a series of messages sent, received, misinterpreted, and mistimed. How his various creatures find their ``voices'' in their moments of need and manage to be understood by each other and their enemies is artfully imagined and constructed.`Through the eyes and hearts of Evans's furry characters,Beasts of New Yorkgets at a lot of complex stuff: issues of identity, specifically nature versus nurture, are explored without being heavy-handed, and the real-life distances between bravery and cowardice, loyalty and disloyalty, hope and despair are often revealed to be just a hair's breadth apart.'(Julie EakinForeWord Magazine)The best part about this book, though, is what saves Patch over and over from being preyed upon by bigger animals: his ability to communicate across the species barrier. Patch is able to speak bird, which earns him respect and memorability from the birds he encounters. It is because Patch is such an efficient communicator that allows him to make friends with the other animals he meets, who turn out to be helpful acquaintances in the long run.Early on in the book, Evans speaks of animal communication, in that it is not made up of words or sounds, the way human language is. Instead, animals communicate with each other using a system of sounds, movements and body languages. As a human reader interpreting Patch's discussions with other animals, I always got a kick out of what they would say to each other. When Patch meets a dog in the street, the dog strains to the end of his leash, shouting \"Kill you and eat you! Kill you and eat you!\" at Patch over and over. This made me giggle, as it's pretty much exactly what I would imagine a dog would say to a squirrel in such a state!Since reading Patch's amazing adventure story, I have noticed that I now look at animals in a whole new way.(Dana DeatheDana the Book Lady)My initial reaction when I received Jon Evans'Beasts of New Yorkin the mail was, what a beautiful book! With the rise of e-reading, I've long believed that the future of print publishing is in books that are practically works of art. [...]So, when I saw the absolutely beautiful way Porcupine's Quill printedBeasts of New York, I fell in love with the textured, cream-coloured pages and the ornate letters that opened each section. I also love the wood engravings by Jim Westergard. I was totally grossed out by the one of the rats, but overall, they're beautiful. I love how realistic the fur looks, and am amazed whenever I remember that these images were originally created on wood. This book is a work of art, an example of the kind of reading experience e-books can't offer (an image of a wood engraving on a screen will also be beautiful, but not quite as beautiful as on this type of paper, I think).[...]I was afraid the book would end up being like a nature documentary. Luckily, however, the story becomes much more involved than that. I quickly became intrigued by Patch's adventures, and loved seeing New York City through his eyes. Cars become \"death machines\" and apartment buildings are \"mountains.\" In the hands of a lesser writer, I can imagine such descriptions being cutesy, but Evans pulls it off. At times, even I felt like I was traveling in a hostile, utterly alien environment, and I grew up in a city![...]Beasts of New Yorkis a contemporary urban fable, geared for adults, but also a story that I think mature kids will appreciate. There aren't a lot of adult books starring animals, and Evans' animals seem less anthropomorphized than the books and movies I remember.Beastsis an exciting tale overall, and a beautiful, beautiful book.(JaclynLiterary Treats)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The ruthless ruler destroys statues of the god and particularly despises the Rain Queen, goddess of water and of the dead, including Hermia, whom Argelin has unintentionally killed and intends to reclaim from the underworld. Fisher's fantasy world, introduced in the first two books in the series, is a fully realized creation, mingling characteristics of ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and even the later Byzantine Empire when the Vikings had become a threat. The headlong rush of Fisher's writing is perfectly suited to teens raised on blockbuster movies and video games. Full of dialogue and action, the brief scenes force readers to concentrate on what is happening and to whom, allowing the accumulation of detail and circumstance to supply the explanations. Readers who have not first read the earlier titles will find themselves puzzling over background material, though much is cleared up by dialogue as the story progresses. The book is so full of incident and character, and the scenes shift so rapidly, that it can be difficult to keep the various plot threads separate. Likewise, the constant breathless pace may lessen the impact of the climax for some readers. Most, however, are likely to be swept along in this entertaining and evocative adventure, eager to keep turning the pages.âCoop Renner, Hillside Elementary, El Paso, TXCopyright Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Whether you are absorbed in the convoluted mental struggles of Lawrence Mason (Inferno Inside), the unworldly twists and turns of the Sentinels (Council of the Pure),the ethereal adventures of the nymphs and sprites (Gypsy Leeâs Fairy Tales, Fables & Yarns), the folksy and practical solutions for minimalist living (The Last Drop of Living) or the heart and tragedy of true life anecdotes about murderers and rapists(Wild Animals People I Have Known), you will bond intimately with each of Leeâs characters.  Fiction or non-fiction, Robert Lee presents brings you immense and unique reading experiences that will compel you to call for more of his works.", "related": [], "rank": 4574851, "title": "Wild People I Have Known eBook", "author": "Robert Lee", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

World leaders in psychiatry and oncology summarize the latest evidence on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, screening and recognition, impact on treatment adherence and survival, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, clinical management, and cultural and public health implications of depression in persons with cancer.Its practical approach makes this book ideal for all those involved with the management of these patients: psychiatrists, psychologists, oncologists, general practitioners, and cancer and mental health nurses.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What made this dream special was the fact it had a beginning, middle,\nand end and played out like a movie in my head. While I normally have vivid\ndreams, this was the first \"fantasy\" type. When I woke, I knew I had to write\nit down. First I relayed the dream to my husband, who listened or at least\npretended to listen. Then I began the process of writing. I had already\ncompleted two other books from a completely different genre, so writing wasn't\nforeign. After four intense days seated in front of my computer, I had the gist\nof the story saved. Another two years would pass before anyone other than my\nfamily and friends would read the story.I tried the traditional route of seeking an agent\nand/or publisher to take on my work, but like so many other authors, I found no\nsuccess. I'd located a few online sites that offered free reads, so in February\n2011, I decided I'd upload my book in an effort to get third party, unbiased\nfeedback on my writing. Initially the book was well received. I felt it was\ntime to move up to bigger platforms, all along thinking if the book received\nenough positive ratings, maybe an agent would be interested in representing me.In May 2011, I uploaded to a different book site that\nallowed me to price my book as free.I uploadedA\nDiamond in My Pocketto Amazon in August 2011 as a $0.99 book because\nAmazon didn't allow free listings. What I didn't know was Amazon would\nprice-match the competitors' prices. This caused my new listing to be dropped\nto free, which in turn caused my book to be listed on many \"free\" lists across\nthe Internet.Pocket'srank improved\ndramatically and reviews started coming in--reviews pointing out the flaws of\nthe manuscript. Finally I had my third party, unbiased feedback. Unfortunately\nthose reviews are still among the reviews on this book. When the price of the\nbook went back to ninety-nine cents, the downloads were still coming in.A Diamond in My Pocketsoared up the\ncharts, hitting the Movers&Shakers; list.Even though I'd received some bad reviews, most of\nthe reviews were positive and motivating. I continued to write on the series,\nreleasing book two,A Diamond in My Heart,in January 2012. Book three,The Diamond\nof Freedom,released in April 2013, and book four,The Diamond Bearers' Destiny,released December 2013. The books\nhave been edited many times over in an effort to give you the reader the best\npossible experience.Even without professional editing,A Diamond in My Pockethit the B&N;\nTeen Bestseller list in May 2012, was named Breakout Book by Apple's iBookstore\nin Feb 2013.A Diamond in My Heartbecame a #1 Amazon Bestseller in February 2014. All four books of The Unaltered\nSeries are nowInternational Bestsellersin the United States, U.K., and India.I will be writing more books in The Unaltered\nSeries, even though I'd stated earlier book four was the final installment. I'm\ncurrently working on getting the series into print form. I'm immensely grateful\nfor my readers who have been able to enjoy the story within my words. Even more\nso, I'm grateful to the readers who have shared my books with their friends,\nteachers, and through social media. However, without platforms like Amazon, allowing Indie authors like me the opportunity to succeed as writers, my books\nwould still be camped out on my computer, waiting for an agent to request a\npartial or full manuscript.Thanks for your interest in my \"author's story.\" I\nhope you enjoyA Diamond in My Pocketand the rest of The Unaltered Series.\nPlease visit my website lorenaangell.com and use the Contact Me form to let me\nknow what you think of my book.Â ~Lorena\nAngell", "related": ["B00LBQ34SC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 78, "rating_average": 4.4103, "rating_total": 344.0}

After developers turn part of the sleepy town into a tony suburb, the town council persuades him to become the chief of police. It has been a relatively uneventful tenure, but the growing town has seen an influx of Latinos, many of whom are illegal. When the body of a young Mexican girl turns up along the bank of Six Mile Creek, which divides the rich newcomers from the poorer longtime residents, Judd has his first murder case. The investigation will pit him against his childhood friend, now a developer, and bring the townâs racial and class tensions to the surface. They will also stir up horrible memories from Juddâs past that affect his ability to handle the case. Helms, a Shamus Award nominee and a two-time Derringer Award winner, has created an engrossing and timely story that will appeal to a wide range of readers. --Barbara Bibel", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

ButÂ after Kate completely disappears, Mini must confront her parents about their familyâs unhappy secret.

That's the question readers might ask themselves after finishing Paul Alexander's true-crime Kindle Single,Homicidal. This striking investigative narrative regards the serial killer, dubbed the Grim Sleeper, who killed women in South Los Angeles from 1985 to 2007. (He earned his moniker by taking a 14-year break from killing.) The suspected-killer lived among unsuspecting neighbors, friends, and family for more than two decades before detectives pieced together his identity. Alexander shows the case from the perspective of the suspect's neighbors, the media, and the detectives on the 20-year investigation. The account offers a window on the interactions the suspect had with his friends and neighbors. In one instance, he was conversing with a neighbor, and suddenly pointed toward a long-standing billboard that depicted him as the wanted serial killer; he began complaining that the drawing was not distinct enough, and that the face could be anyone. If that's not creepy enough, the article also explores the deeply unsettling history of L.A.-area serial killers, many of whom, like the Grim Sleeper, lured victims into their cars. Alexander, as usual, presents a gripping play-by-play account of the case. Readers of this Kindle Single will have a new reason to lock their doors and turn down any offer of a car ride from a stranger. --Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00J8HJW8C"], "rank": 669387, "title": "Homicidal (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Paul Alexander", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.1667, "rating_total": 25.0}

Instead, I wanted a fun romp with just the right amount of naughtiness and characters that weren't afraid to be politically incorrect.As in all my stories, my characters are real. They are not perfect, they don't rely on five dollar words when a well placed curse word gets the point across and they have lessons to learn. As in real life, some of them learn their lessons, and some of them don't. The action is fast-paced with plenty of twists I hope the reader doesn't see coming. There is a sequel in the works.My goal forCity Vamps 2: Taking Back the Night,is toÂ push these characters into a darker, edgierÂ story as they explore their immortal sides and come to terms with their identities as immortals living in a predominantly human world.

Â This experience altered my consciousness in a permanent and positive way. Â Never again would I feel safe. Â The world is not a safe place for any form of life. Â The universe is hostile, constantly changing, assaulting us with new challenges; we must be resilient, we must adapt, or we will be destroyed. Â It made me stronger and better than I ever thought I could be. Â It gave me a deep, healthy respect for individuals who have survived a morbid, traumatic event. Â It liberated me from the futile quest for security--it made me understandCarpe Diem!Â Â When my water broke at 24 weeks and Dr. Trudy Skiles told me that my baby was hanging on by a pocket of fluid over his face, I told her, \"If he dies, I die.\" Â It was unthinkable to me that I could get over this loss. Â I had already lost too much, too often. Â A year after my son was born, a family counselor asked if I had ever attempted suicide. Â Honestly, no. Â I had contemplated it for like a minute once a long time ago--after I gave my daughter up for adoption. Â She said she had been counseling families for thirty years and had known a lot of clients who had attempted suicide over less than what I had been through. Â \"You haven't even heard the half of it!\" I laughed. Â Yet, of all the terrible things that have happened to me since Earl Dillon became my biological father, this single event--the tug-of-war I had with Nature to hold onto him, and the people who were on my team--stands as the most transformative. Â I wrote this article originally for a newsletter put out by a group of parents who organized themselves into a support group for new NICU parents, as well as graduates--they called us 'graduates'--we had earned an honorable diploma from the University of Hard Knocks. Â Nobody outside our circle understood what we had lived through and what we continued to live with--the rug had been ripped out from under us and there was no floor. Â People saidthe stupidest and rudest things to us!Â  I will never forget the mom who told me that someone asked her, upon seeing her in public with her tiny baby on oxygen, \"What's wrong with your baby?\" Â REALLY?! Â \"Wrong?\" Â You are so dimwitted that you cannot come up with a better way of starting this conversation with a complete stranger, about the most sensitive topic in the world--her baby--who has obviously been through an ordeal... \"Wrong?!\" you ask? Â Here is my question for you, you freak of nature you... \"Why is morbid curiosity the only thing that has an unfiltered line directly connected to your mouth?\"", "related": [], "rank": 2255282, "title": "10 Most Annoying Things People Say to NICU Parents (...when they're only trying to help!)", "author": "Carma Chan", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Certainly, Marti's work raises questions that should stimulate other research.\" --Review of Religious Research\"Marti provides an ethnographically rich study that is quite timely, especially given that race and reconciliation are such vital topics in todayÂ¹s academic theology and popular church writing.\" --Theology\"This is a brave book that dares to challenge conventional wisdom regarding the intersections of race, worship and music. It is a model of engaged scholarship and will be essential reading for pastors, worship leaders, and students of congregations. Gerardo Marti is emerging as one of the leading sociologists of religion in the United States with a distinctive methodological approach in the field of Congregational Studies.\"---William McKinney, President Emeritus, Pacific School of Religion\"Dr. Marti makes a unique and important contribution to our understanding of multi-racial churches as worshiping communities. His central focus on the worship ritual helps us to understand the meaning and lived experience of multiculturalism for participants. For social scientists and other scholars, he helps us to understand the social processes which forge commitment and identification across the most divisive of social barriers. A smart, interesting, and humane book.\"---Penny Edgell, author ofCongregations in Conflict: Cultural Models of Local Religious Life\"Marti is a master at unpacking the culture of a congregation. Music, he shows us, is never just about sound. It's about who and how, feelings and bodies and ethnic identities. What he tells us about how music works is far more interesting and complicated than the how-to books would have us think.\"---Nancy Ammerman, author ofPillars of Faith: American Congregations and Their Partners\"Gerardo Marti adds another valuable volume to his works as an accomplished researcher and sociologist about multiethnic churches in America. What is most valuable about the book is the large collection of quotes sprinkled throughout from a plurality of voices that illustrates the diversity, complexity, and richness of worship in multiracial congregations.\"--DJ Chuang,Worship Leader Magazine\"A thoughtful and provocative read...Gerardo Marti has produced an interesting book focused on music as a key variable in the life of multiracial churches, and how music may help promote particular religious and social outcomes. For this, he is to be commended, and I believe others should follow his example and pay more serious attention to the role of music in the life of multiethnic, or other, religious congregations.\"--Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion\"This book is a paradigm shifter. To me, it represents an advance to the next stage of multiracial/ethnic/cultural ministry. Focus on people as people, bonding them together, helping to create the unity Christ prayed we'd have. Go ahead and seek musical forms that speak to many people simultaneously, and feel free to play different types of music. But you need not be in bondage to either. And the truth shall set you free.\"--Michael O. Emerson,Christianity Today\"What actually brings diversity is what Marti calls \"racialized ritual inclusion,\" a strategy with problematic moral implications...Marti shows that these are fluid cultural constructs that \"racialize\" differences.\"--Church Times\"One cannot underestimate the importance of this topic and Marti's study...this is a watershed work that should be read by anyone interested in works about race, identity, and music.\"--Religion\"This book is more scientifically grounded in research and study than the title suggests...A scholarly, thought-provoking examination of this topic. Highly recommended.\"--CHOICE\"A valuable contribution to the literature...I find Gerardo Marti's sociological analysis to be most helpful and complementary to the theological and liturgical analysis explored by others.\"--Worship\"I have been teaching the foundational course in Christian worship at my school, North Park Theological Seminary, for the last two years.  Since this is a new course for me I have been doing a good deal of reading, observing and reflecting on this most important aspect of Christian faith.

When Gail is required to put down a horse injured during a roping event, she renews her acquaintance with old high-school chum Lisa Bennett and her family. Lisa asks Gail to help find the person who's been plaguing her family with such dirty tricks as digging and disguising a hole in the middle of the roping arena where the horse fell, poisoning a colt and nearly running down her father, Glen, with a tractor. Gail's investigation turns up a list of likely suspects with grudges against Glen: his son Tim, who has been given too little responsibility on the ranch; Lisa's vengeful former husband; a spiteful rancher whose wife is rumored to be having an affair with Glen; and Glen's petulant second wife. In between her moments of sleuthing, Gail contends with her stressful veterinarian practice and her uneven romance with an older, married cowboy. Serving only to advance Gail's private life, this series entry will disappoint all but die-hard fans.Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Even though I used walking successfully for many years with most of my one-to-one clients, it wasn't until I incorporated some of the things I learned throughout the course of my studies that I really hit the 'sweet spot.'You see the only really effective way to use walking to lose weight is to treat it like you would any other weight loss method. Hit it from a few angles, be consistent and keep it changing so your body doesn't get good at holding on to its fat stores.You'll see from the pictures and instructions in the book that I use power walking techniques and some of the theories from my running programs to boost the power of walking in to a fat burning exercise you can use at will.As any weight loss method should do, I've included some eating guidelines and diet tips to help speed things along still further.I hope you decide to give my program a try and actually follow my advice... I know this works. I use it repeatedly with my clients with almost 100% success.One thing I would like to add is thatI believe in quality and getting what you pay for, so if for ANY reason you don't feel that this program has been worth the money you paid for it, then please ask Amazon for a full refund.But if you like what you read and feel it is of good value and would be helpful to others,then please leave me some positive feedback.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

S. Cavalry. His style was naturalistic, sometimes impressionistic, and usually veered away from the ethnographic realism of earlier Western artists. His focus was firmly on the people and animals of the West, with landscape usually of secondary importance. His collaboration with Owen Wister on The Evolution of the Cowpuncher, published by Harper's Monthly in September 1893, was the first statement of the mythical cowboy in American literature, spawning the entire genre of Western fiction, films, and theater that followed. He was one of the first American artists to illustrate the true gait of the horse in motion. The galloping horse became Remington's signature subject, copied and interpreted by many Western artists who followed him, adopting the correct anatomical motion.

Eventually the aliens realised how pointless this was and, as a failed student, he was returned to Earth and left with a family who brought him up as a human bean. But, the persistent memories of new worlds, dragons and other creatures, continued to knock at his frontal lobe, desperately trying to break out. To avoid making a mess and calm his imagination, Tim began writing as a way to communicate with Earthlings. Fuelled by Chilli and Nachos and a bottle of wine, Tim manages to balance a love of loud rock music and fast cars (preferably red!) with emotional chic flicks, smart leather shoes and a well tailored suit. He has successfully infiltrated the humans and hides behind the faÃ§ade known as a family. He learns from his children, but is regularly told to stop acting like a child by his wife. Naturally shy and unsociable by nature, he is selective of the human company he keeps, preferring to be around old books, bonsai and art. He cries at 'Itâs a wonderful life' but sulks if fed evil vegetables disguised as Parsnips or Peas. He is bored by mundane conversation, excited by architecture and castles and fuelled by Caramel Latte Macchiato's. Occasionally, he likes to catch up with old acquaintances on Tatooine, Westeros, and Middle Earth, and stare at fantasy and concept art as if it is a window to his childhood adventures. He is always trying to learn lessons from the masters; Mr Charles Darwin and Mr Lionel Ritchie, about life and love. Tim's galactic mission is to translate his brain activity into a language that inspires and entertains you, transports you to different worlds and grants you an audience with the characters you have dreamt about, but never dared to remember. All of this in an attempt to redeem himself with his childhood alien abductors and travel the stars once more.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science & Math", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 3.9375, "rating_total": 63.0}

There are some interesting insights into what the rabbis thought about family, the tension between a married couple and their extended network of relatives, and the different interests and intrigues that can complicate that situation.\"âJewish Book World\"[Weisberg's] book is accessible for general religion scholars and for scholars of anthropology. This book would be a good addition to a cross-cultural course on marriage, ancient to modern. . . . In combining an anthropological with a chronological approach, Weisberg's book cautions us that when we examine how rabbinic interpretation transforms scriptural practice, we need to give attention to the ways in which a far-reaching comparative lens helps us to make sense of the cultural significance of those transformations.\" âH-Net Reviews\"Weisberg put a great deal of labour and love into this work. The argument is  nuanced, clear, and compelling. The prose is flowing, and the research is thorough.

Body Wave didn't win, but it was a finalist. Three of the contest readers wrote me to share how much they enjoyed it. Body Wave was a great confidence booster and launched R.V. Doon.I've always regretted not trying my hand as a nurse businesswoman. So, I made Reece Carson, an historical column writer for the local paper and start-up nurse entrepreneur. To complicate the poor girl's life even more, I made her anamateur sleuth with a catand unlucky in love. Sheba, the cat, awakens emotions dampened by nurse burnout as the two bond. Sheba softens Reece's character and is protective of Reece by the end of the book. I had cats in childhood, but my husband is allergic to them. I love Sheba!I decided to add aromantic twistinto the story by giving Reece two men to deal with, while solving crime in acozy mystery series.Through Reece, I'm able to explore the ups and downs of a nurse businesswoman, but I also get to pepper in local past history for readers who like a dash of history in their books.

I had the typical difficulties in high school. Then I spent some time in the navy. I had some training and worked in the electric shop. However, while serving on a ship, with the situation I found myself in, I developed paranoid schizophrenia. My life has been a battle to stay on track. I had always dreamed about going to college, but this could not happen for over twenty-five years. I have lived in a few different locations. These were very lonely and difficult times. I did, while still young, move back in with my parents, so far for the duration. In the 1980s, when this book was written, I never really talked to anyone. Many people were cruel to me. I felt this book was my way of talking. These words mean a lot to me. Though schizophrenia has stolen my life, I have always tried to contribute to my country, even though there is little an individual can do. I do have my pride, though. Maybe my mind is different, but I like to look at myself as being creative. I might think differently than others, but we are all unique.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Salvation is free! Why should I be holy? Salvation is by grace! Then this book is for you! If you believe that salvation can be lost, you owe it to yourself to know what the dividing line is between being one sin short of hell and one sin long of heaven.This book reveals how the idea of losing salvation is inconsistent with the teachings of the Bible and shows how some Biblical passages that refer to Christian rewards and punishment are often misinterpreted as referring to salvation and damnation. It also shows that even if you refuse to believe the position that salvation cannot be lost you will have to admit that to be consistent with your interpretation it would be almost impossible to both be saved and retain your salvation.If you believe that salvation cannot be lost then you must be able to answer these questions: Why should I be good? Isn't salvation free? Isn't salvation by grace? Bad or carnal Christians get to heaven just as those who have sacrificed a life of pleasure don't they? Why should I try so hard? The purpose of this book is by no means to promote laxity in the Christian life but to reveal added motivation to make something out of your life with Christ! After all, God is so good! He is so faithful! Christian service and good works are not a means to salvation!Many Christians have the mistaken idea that their behavior, their goodness or holiness or consecration is somehow tied to their salvation. There is a need for Christians to be good, to be holy and to be blameless! However, the motive should not be salvation or preserving salvation! Salvation is free! Salvation is received by grace through faith and not by good works. I believe that every true Christian desires to be good, holy and just. The problem is that most just don't know how to get there and some are doubtful that it is possible, while others wonder what difference it makes.", "related": [], "rank": 557392, "title": "Why should I be good?

Then he leaned in, mouth wide open and eyes closed. I stiffed armed him in the chest and stopped him in his tracks.\"Dick.\" I said simply, raising my eyebrow.My hand slid up to his shoulder and pressed down. He got the message. Samson went to his knees and fumbled with my belt buckle. I slapped his hands away and unfastened my jeans. My hard dick pressed against the fabric of my underwear. Even in the dimly lit back alley I could see the wet spot spreading where the head of my dick was.I looked down in disbelief. There was no way Samson had me that horny. My heightened libido had to be from Moore jumping on me just an hour ago. I kicked myself mentally for not letting the cop go further.My dick was sliding down Samson's throat before I could give anymore thought to Moore ravishing my body. Before I even approached Samson, I had the whole scenario planned out. What I hadn't planned on was Samson giving amazing head.He gripped my hips and pulled me in down his throat, bopping up and down on my swollen meat like a pro. My knees buckled. I gripped at the brick wall behind me to steady myself. I looked down and watched Samson work.He was a sloppy dick sucker. Sucking and popping sounds filled the otherwise quiet air. Anyone within ear shot would be able to hear Samson on my dick. For a moment I didn't care. His mouth felt good on my pole. I could feel his saliva dripping down on my balls. I was getting close.I clenched my teeth and fought the coming climax. I reached into my jacket and opened my eyes. I saw a shadow and looked up. My heart skipped a beat. Moore stood a few yards away, watching me, shaking his head. He stood there for a moment, waiting for my response to his presence.If I stopped and did what I'd come outside to do, he'd be right there, listening to everything. I wasn't ready for him to know everything, not yet. And if I kept going, what little affection, attraction or whatever there was between Moore and I was dead.I grabbed the back of Samson's head and drove my dick in his mouth, balls deep, over and over again. I watched Moore the whole time. His face twisted in disgust as he walked off. I hated myself at that moment. I wanted to punch something. Instead, I face fucked Samson and busted my load down his throat.Samson swallowed shot after shot. He kept my softening meat in his mouth, sucking out the last drops of nutt. I reached back in my jacket and pulled out my new switch blade. My grip tightened around his dreads and I yanked his head back, hard. I snapped the blade free and pressed the edge firmly against his neck.The look in his eyes was pure fear. A deep wave of uneasiness washed over me. That I had made him so afraid actually scared me. But I pushed those thought to the back of my mind. I didn't have the luxury of considering what a monster I was turning into.

After his early death in war, Shimoni became a touchstone, symbolizing the strengths and failings of Israel itself. Nadav, the second son, maimed in battle himself, becomes obsessed with Shimoni's lover, Miriam Sagrossa, working out through her and her strange daughter his relationship to his family and country. Rafi, the homosexual third son who marries an American woman on his kibbutz and dreams of driving a cab in New York City, finds hope and acceptance in the memory of his brother's wisdom. For the fourth son Michael, struggling to fill Shimoni's soldier boots, the future is less clear. Actually much is unclear in the plot of this rambling novel set in postwar Israel; however, Levin, author of Water Dancer and Snow, creates a sharp and vivid picture of the effect on her characters of daily kibbutzim life: the grinding work schedule, lack of privacy and occasional soaring moments of comaraderie, shared hopes and common purpose.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has experienced the loss of his own father and the acquisition of an emotionally distant and severe stepfather. Nothing of relevance to his life is ever explained to him by the adult world. Nevertheless, he is able to form close and non-judgmental relationships, especially with Elliot, the Zulu household worker, which are sincere and very touching.The author brings to life the confusion of principles within the child's mind with compassion and understanding. This delicate book illustrates the vital need to reach out to children and empathise with their world of innocence.In an understated way, it will make you think and wonder about the interactions of ordinary people and perhaps encourage you to take another look at yourself. This clearly is the value of this excellent work, which opens many insights into seemingly small kindnesses, and shows how these impact on our lives.Highly recommended for teachers, parents and for all those who care.- Dr Harold Serebro, author and historian.Author of:The Devil & His ServantandBeyond Redemption?", "related": [], "rank": 1229840, "title": "The Last Summer in Little England", "author": "Earl Moorhouse", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Later he was shown there the picture Â«The One and OnlyÂ» which he described in his second book before the picture was revealed to the world.Vladimir started an independent life early and left the parents' house at the age of 16. Since 1974 he lived in Novosibirsk and worked as a photographer with Novosibirskoblfoto, a service company.At the beginning of Perestroika (reforms of the late 1980s) he was the president of the Inter-Regional Association of Siberian Entrepreneurs. In 1994-5 he organized two large-scale trade expeditions with a fleet of river steamers along the River Ob along the route Novosibirsk -- Salekhard -- Novosibirsk at his own expense. On this trip, an encounter with Anastasia in the Siberian taiga changed his entire life.It had been a secret for a long time for relatives and friends what made him, an entrepreneur with ten years experience, to pledge his property and spend his savings on unprofitable trading trips. The mystery was revealed in his books with Anastasia as the main character. Vladimir Megre brought something really invaluable from the trips.Throughout 1996-2006 nine books were written by Vladimir Megre (The Ringing Cedars of Russia Series: Anastasia, The Ringing Cedars of Russia, The Space of Love, Co-Creation, Who Are We?, Book of Kin, The Energy of Life, The New Civilization, Rites of Love).In 2011 the author became Laureate of Gusi Peace Prize.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For almost a decade the Keegan novels were published by GMP (the Gay Men's Press, London), but after their merger with Prowler and later, Millivres, GMP became more or less 'dormant,' selling only old titles, and apparently publishing only those novels which had been in pre-press at the time of the merger. Eventually, Millivres discontinued its paperback division, and Mel turned to a local South Australian studio, DreamCraft, to manage his intellectual properties. A self-confessed science fiction and fantasy devotee, Keegan is known for novels across a wide range of subjects, from the historical to the future action-adventure. Mel lives in South Australia with an eccentric family and a variety of pets, and is closely associated with DreamCraft, where he's been known to work as a part-time, standby editor.", "related": ["B00IZR0FI2"], "rank": 792084, "title": "Home From The Sea", "author": "Mel Keegan", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The kind I like to read. Meaning not heavy and boring with technical details on science that does not exist yet, but rather heavy on action and adventure. The novel is set at an almost breakneck pace throughout and is made to grab the readers attention and not bore them. It's a fun read full of suspense and mystery as well as action, action and more action! If you are a fan of movies and the subsequent books based on Star Wars or Star Trek, you're going to like the Cagliostro Chronicles. Its a fun roller coaster ride with the fate of humanity at stake, and the hint of the unknown that threatens everyone on earth.", "related": ["B00LDCER4E"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.3333, "rating_total": 26.0}

He plumbs the slick, powerful organization underlying the gang's scruffy, beer-guzzling exterior and learns how it eludes the police, noting piously that \"if every member of law enforcement was honest there would be no more crime.\" The longer he's with the members of this sleazy crew, the more he takes to them, concluding that hatred of these bikers rests on envy of their freedom from social constraints and fear of what is alien. Violent episodes seem to appear as much for their own sake as to advance the plot, as with a fight between the Philadelphia Henchmen and the Mafia in which Walsh has no part. The theme of police corruption and penny-ante philosophy notwithstanding, Bungert's debut highlights savages having a good time at what they do.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00J1QC2KK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Due to the pursuit of becoming a physician assistant and the extra schooling that required, Kalyn put the novel on the back burner.

The story takes us through many hilarious moments in Kevin and Buzz's lives. The two men basically lead a lazy and easy-going existence with a lot of women and frivolous relationships.  That lazy characteristic makes them hang around women who are rich and can help them with money. Buzz plays the guitar and considers himself to be a musician while Kevin flits from one meaningless job to another. The story takes us from youth to their old age.Both men have no real interest in working and earning their own money and they try to live off Buzz's girlfriend, April Chen, who has an apartment and a car. Kevin and Buzz have many comic adventures. Mr. Barton's writing class is another scene which will make readers smile at the incidents happening in that class. There is never a dull moment in the book. The portrayal of Buzz and Kevin are apt and the descriptions remind you of the type of men you run into in your life, in university, and at work.Reviewed by Faridah Nassozi for Readers' FavoriteBuzz Manning by Brett Hopson is a work of fiction that combines drama, adventure, and a touch of humor. Brett Hopson gives an entertaining description of the lives of two friends who are so different and yet so alike. Buzz Manning is the type of easy read that you take with you to the beach and keep turning the pages as the sun goes down.The style of writing is fluent and effortless. The story flows smoothly.
