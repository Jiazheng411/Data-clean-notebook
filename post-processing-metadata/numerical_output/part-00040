Fenn is one of the most creative minds in the sociology of religion and moves with consummate ease over the disputed territory between sociology and theology.  In this book he sets out a critique of idols, which undoes sociological concepts like 'Civil Religion' as well as the  pseudo-sacred at large.  The message is severe and has few comfortable words, the expression is eloquent, and the effect is to make us rethink what we take for granted. --David Martin, London School of Economics and Political ScienceTaking as his departure point the assumption that secularization is the outcome of the Christianization of western societies, Richard Fenn cuts through the Gordian knot of the secularization debate in sociology to articulate a more encompassing vision of the significance - for religion as well  as for society - of the secularization process. Fenn challenges the parameters of contemporary discussion, mounting a powerful and persuasive case in eloquent prose for the benefits, even for religion, of a secular society.  No one who is concerned about the problems of social cohesion or the  current dilemmas of Christianity can afford to ignore Fenn's penetrating analysis. --Bryan Wilson, All Souls College, Oxford\"Richard Fenn is one of the most original and dulcet voices in the study of religion.\"--Nicholas Jay Demerath, III, University of Massachusetts at Amherst", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "Beyond Idols: The Shape of a Secular Society", "author": "Richard K.

Characters are interesting and well developed although the mystery loses its momentum before the end.

After Carolina is orphaned, Auntie Shen takes her in, knowing full well that things are changing even in their remote piece of the world. Meddling do-gooders and social services overpower informal, off-the-grid arrangements like theirs with increasing ardor. But Auntie Shen and Carolina manage just fine—until Auntie Shen suffers a stroke. The situation is quickly declared unacceptable, and Carolina is forced away from her home. Desperate with worry for Auntie Shen, and indignant at being handed around against her will, the child flees two foster situations. She seeks refuge anywhere she can before finally stumbling onto Harmony Farm. There, Miss Latah, Mr. Ray, and Lucas gently help Carolina rebuild her trust. She isn't sure why or even whether the Harmony family wants her. But in the end, her happiness—and her beloved makeshift family—are finally made whole. McDowell's prose reads easily and creates a wonderful sense of place. The author occasionally jolts readers awake with jarring reminders that Carolina lives in a particular time, as well. Odd references to the civil rights struggle and the war in Vietnam are strangely, startlingly incongruous with the rest of Carolina's surroundings. Or perhaps they're a fitting complement to the startling strangeness of the child's entire world.—Catherine Threadgill, formerly at Charleston County Public Library, SCCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In his examinations of Horrible Histories, pseudo-‘medieval faires’, and Second World War ‘shoot ’em up’computer games, de Groot serves up a truly varied table of food for thought ... Consuming Historyis both a useful analysis of the contemporary consumption of history, and a provocative argument about the need forprofessional historians to better engage with public history. De Groot’s mastery of the former is clear.'– Twentieth Century British History'The book's breadth of reference is impressive ...One can object that de Groot is apt to load any activity with historical meaning ... But his approach is consciously provocative, both in its populist content and uses of cultural theory… De Groot notes how TV not only normalises but also reveals the otherness of even the everyday and recent past ... how ideas of post-nostalgia are shifting away from conservative romanticising of the past to something more disorderly; and how consuming history is simultaneously making history.’– Times Educational Supplement‘Consuming Historyis a timely and important book. Taken as a whole, it adds substantially to our understanding of non-academic forms of historical engagement and contemporary culture’s ongoing fascination with the past. For this reason it ought to be compulsory reading for anyone interested in the boundaries between non-academic and academic history, and the relationship of culture to its past.’ –Reviews in History", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

(If it is used with the 1911, the 1911 can jam because of the design of the 1911's slide stop.) And as the 1911 was the standard side arm of the US military for over 70 years, the caution against its use became shooting dogma.As such, the method and the author has been greeted with loud and angry criticism by \"the powers that be\" in the world of the gun.It is as though you are in OZ and come upon the Wizard who shouts: \"How dare you question the great OZ.\" In the days of old, one would be a likely candidate for being burned at the stake.But the fact of the matter is that Sight Shooting, which is the shooting method that is proscribed by and continues to be taught in accordance with traditional dogma, can not be used or fails to be used in close quarters life threat situations. And it is in those situations where one stands the greatest chance of being shot and/or killed.So knowing about and how to use a very simple, fast, instinctive, accurate, and deadly effective shooting method, makes life over death sense.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

You won’t be sorry you did.” ~ Literary Nymphs•  “Seeking Kokopelli” by Shelley Munro is an enjoyable paranormal story. The writing is strong, the characters are fun, and the sex is hot.” ~ Rainbow Reviews•  “Seeking Kokopelli is a romantic, heartfelt and emotional story about two men healing the pain from their pasts in order to embrace the promise of love in their futures. They are both strong and compliment each other’s personalities. It’s a wonderful book with believable dialogue and secondary characters that make the tale come alive. When Adam and Nate finally come together, the man love is sensual, satisfying and totally hot. It has meaning when they express their physical affections and that really does it for me. Ms. Munro consistently finds the perfect balance and gives readers a story they can connect with. If a reader is looking for quality content, and a satisfying happily ever after then I highly recommend this book.” ~ Whipped Cream Reviews", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

B. Story is a writer living in the southwestern United States. While that territory can cover anywhere from New Mexico to Hawaii he declines to be more specific at this time. His use of the time-honored artifice of writing under a pseudonym comes from the necessity to still maintain a day job and the habit of employers to Google new applicants to discover what stupid things said applicant is willing to foolishly do, and then doubly foolishly post for the world to see afterwards. Such invasions of one?s personal life become an unnecessary distraction. D. B. Story has long had interests in both Science Fiction (since first discovering his mother?s secret cache of Ace Doublebooks stashed under her bed) and writing. In fact, anything he has enjoyed participating in he eventually has a desire to create as well. He seriously began writing (although not selling) stories ten years ago due to a dissatisfaction with what he was reading at the time and the belief that he could do it better. He started out with the interaction between humans and the sexy robots they would inevitably create and later branched out to other erotic Fantasy and SF genres. During that time he has written everything from flash fiction to a 402,000 word novel and a screenplay based on his other writings, as yet unsold. Whether his writing is actually ?better? he admits he must leave to his readers to decide, but he likes his stuff a lot. He has often said that, ?Writing time is always good time.? He also says that with the advent of cheap computers, word processors, eBooks, and the Internet that times have never been better for a diversity of writers to be heard.", "related": ["B00AKZ49VG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fateswith the best & worst of human and mythological creatures await.   Apocalypse Near is a revolutionary book that creates a new genre; fusing autobiography, metaphysics, sci-fi, social activism & paranormalromance with dynamic media. This is an interactive tome that links to theauthor's websites where supplementary media amplifies the adventure. An electronic edition is free with purchase of this book. The electronic version expands the book to hundreds of pages & includes bonus music, information, art, film clips & animation. The additional media augments the narrative & seeks to involve the reader with the author's social mission. The author calls his genre 'Hyper-Reality' because it seamlessly blends media to not merely inform & entertain but to affect reality. Hyper-Reality is to \"reality\" what metaphysics is to physics.Join the transmedia \"EnvironMENTAL REVELution\"!   The author's clinical death experience spawned this warning of earth's looming ecological collapse & how to stop it. Truth & quantum sci-fi collide to return drama to its original purpose: enlightenment via epic conflict and the eternal showdown between mythical heroes, scary monsters & killer clowns from inner-space. ;-) If a house divided against itself cannot stand; can a man divided within himself make a stand?   The secret behind earth's environmental collapse is that humans are being invaded by an inter-dimensional legion of creatures composed of dark matter, powered by dark energy and running a superior operating system. One man is uploaded with the data to abort their human deletion program & stop earth's environment from crashing. Quantum physics has never been revealed in such a terrifying light. The love between a man & woman has never had such an imperative destiny.   FACT:Astrophysicists presently calculate that over 90% of the universe is composed of dark matter & dark energy. In this story100% of planet earth will soon be inhabited by dark energy.. Are you ready to be scared of your own shadow?   In a universe built on binary code; the \"zeros\" make war on the \"ones\" in a quest to crash the entire system. This is a story of a fight to the DELETE! However, beautiful things can happen in the place where Hell freezes and pigs fly.Come to the dark side, we have cookies!Your obituary is already coded; your death is in the queue.Be ready; it's not just coming, It's near...

James Lieberman,PsycCRITIQUES, 53 (5), 2008\"Doing PsychiatryWrong powerfully challenges the current paradigm of mental illness. In his writing, Muller is not afraid to go against the grain of current societal beliefs, and the radical approach that he adopts gives his stories universal appeal. This is a passionate argument against current psychiatric methods of diagnosis and treatment. Regardless of the theoretical orientation of the reader, Muller forces mental health professionals to examine and possibly question their own approach to intervention.\"- Abby L. Marquart, Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy, 2008\"Rene J. Muller, a clinician with a background in emergency room evaluations and in writing accounts of these encounters for the monthly publication Psychiatric Times, has produced a book severely critiquing the current reliance of the psychiatric profession on biological psychiatry. A phenomenologically-based critique of the DSM system is warranted. Muller's basic points remain important and argued with conviction. For too many of its practicioners psychiatry has lost the mind. The emphasis on biological psychiatry has gone to an extreme.

He synthesizes,with ease, the complex elements that gave way for the emergence of one of this generation's most well known yogic schools of thought. The Kripalu story comes alive as Abro explains the history and timeline of Amrit Desai's emergence from a remote, tiny village in India to renowned American yogi. He interweaves with ease and poignancy the story of Amrit Desai's guru, Swami Kripalvanandaji (Bapuji), and his dramatic evolution from probable suicide to sainthood. Abro's knowledge and comprehension of intricate yogic principles andhis ability to transmit concisely and simply Kripalu's intriguing Shaivic lineageallows the reader to feel as if they have journeyed to ancient India and been let-in on ancient yogic secrets. Amrit Desai, like many American gurus had a 'fall from grace' wherein many people were inadvertently impacted. Abro does a fine job sharing with the reader his understanding of the facts of this 'fall.'The book is not meant to be, nor is it, an exposé on Amrit Desai's wrongdoings but rather it is a vital historical reflection on how and why,in America, Kripalucame to be one of the mostwidespread practiced forms of yoga, one of the largest yoga ashrams, and one of theleading yogic educational centers of our time.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sein Vater stammte aus einer aristokratischen irischen Familie.  Doyle studierte Medizin an der Universität Edinburgh und erhielt 1885 seinen Doktortitel. Mit dem Schreiben begann er 1879, um sein Studium bezahlen zu können. Seine Praxis in Southsea/Portsmouth brachte ihm nicht genügend Patienten und ließ ihm Zeit zur Fortsetzung seiner schriftstellerischen Tätigkeit. Seine erste Sherlock Homes Geschichte \"A Study in Scarlet\" wurde 1887 veröffentlicht.  1902 wurde Doyle geadelt, weil er ein patriotisches Pamphlet auf eigene Kosten veröffentlichte. Er war sehr an sportlicher Tätigkeit interessiert und soll angeblich das Skifahren in der Schweiz eingeführt haben. Er war zweimal verheiratet und hatte 5 Kinder. Doyle starb am 7.7.1930 in Crowborough/Sussex.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Gil began writing at the age of nine in Upstate New York, where she was born and raised. She wrote stories throughout her youth, often on a manual typewriter. In college, she abandoned creative writing for expository writing and literature, and she earned degrees in these two subjects. Later on, she opted for an advanced degree in TESOL. Working with ESL students off and on for fifteen years eventually reignited her love of creative writing and inspired her to write Fragile Creatures, Destined for Greatness and Other Stories, Evening Prayer and Invertebrates.    L.M. Gil uses a cast of characters who represent people she has known throughout her life. They have been her family members, friends, acquaintances, former co-workers and students. They have also been the addicts and the self-indulgent, the cross-dressers and the religious, the deluded and the misinformed, the risk-takers and the hesitant in her life.  Those with bizarre appearances, oddball behavior or ironic twists to their stories interest her in particular. These qualities only hint at inner turmoil or conflicts that L.M. Gil employs to get her point across. Whether quirky or fearful or willful or just plain obnoxious, L.M. Gil’s characters illustrate human frailty in their actions and choices. But it’s that same humanity that can also prove to be its own saving grace.    Currently L.M. Gil has her first novel, Fragile Creatures, and Destined for Greatness and Other Stories, her book of short stories, available on the Kindle and Nook. Her second novel, Evening Prayer, is available on the Kindle and will be available on the Nook in April 2012. All three books will be available in paperback this spring, and her newest novel, Invertebrates, will be available early Summer 2012.", "related": ["B00FY4FYGC"], "rank": 3312779, "title": "Fragile Creatures", "author": "L.

He's also an engineer and logic designer, one who's designed computers and computer systems; one of which—during the bad old days of the cold war—flew in the plane designated as the American President's Airborne Command Post: The Doomsday Jet.      He spent seven years as the chief-engineer of a company that built bar-code readers.      He's been involved in scouting activities for thirty-five years, with thirteen of those years spent as a scoutmaster.      He joined the Air Force to learn jet engine mechanics, but ended up working in broadcast and closed circuit television, serving in such unlikely locations as the War Room of the Strategic Air Command, and a television station on the island of Okinawa.      He has been involved in sports car racing, scuba diving, sailing, and anything else that sounded like fun. He can fix most things that break, tile a floor, build a stair rail, fix the family car, sew a fairly neat seam, and has raised three pretty nice kids.      But all of that is just background and source material for one central fact: He is, and always has been, a storyteller.", "related": ["B00G1ABMPA"], "rank": 3630679, "title": "Foreign Embassy eBook", "author": "Jay Greenstein", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When Nate shows up at the ranch to help the vet check the horses, the embers of heat that have been smoking for fourteen years soon turn to flames and the teasing begins.  ... Good horses, fast cars, and a green machine called Kermit were nothing compared to the \"real men\" Nate, Brett, and Matt had become, or the lengths they would go to, to show Jade just how deep their love for her went. The sexual heat in this story is enough to burn the motor up in a fan. However, what really made the book was the differences in the three brothers' personalities and how they brought a different style to the sex scenes and the interaction between themselves and Jade. This book was a hoot and full of laughter. I just love the play on words and the banter between the characters throughout the story. It was so good that just as soon as I got to the end I had to turn around and read it again. The characters' personalities and feelings added fire to the heat between the heroine and the heroes.

Jennifer Sage is a masterful \"world-building\" expert and the world is just as much a character as her breathing ones. This untraditional style has separated her from other authors of her genre.Keltor, her first book in \"The Guardian Archives\" series, was published on Mothers Day 2012, and is categorized as Paranormal/ Suspense/ Romance. In this series as well, the world is epic, urban and is filled with Angels, Demons and everything in-between. Ending at 125,000 words, it too defies industry standards with it's size in her genre.

The rediscovery of Casaubon as a dedicated student of Jewish learning will revolutionize the history of Christian Hebraism. (Peter Schäfer, Princeton University)I Have Always Loved the Holy Tongueis a wonderful work of scholarship and a sheer delight to read. The book is significant beyond the authors' brilliant reconstruction of Isaac Casaubon's Hebraic passions. It provides a model on how to study Hebrew and Aramaic texts alongside Greek and Latin ones to the mutual benefit of both disciplines. It illustrates what exciting rewards exist for the industrious scholar willing to peruse hand-written journals and scribbled annotations on the pages of printed books. Both Grafton and Weinberg acknowledge their debts to their late teacher Arnaldo Momigliano, the great classical scholar. He especially would have appreciated their remarkable collaborative achievement. (David B. Ruderman, University of Pennsylvania)In the new story told by these two eminent authorities, Casaubon remains the great Hellenist known to Pattison, but he becomes much more.  He is now a pioneering student of Hebrew texts and a Christian ascetic who turned Hellenic and Hebrew philology into Protestant piety...The book underlines the importance of late antiquity and early Christianity, which until recently, were not very visible in Anglophone scholarship: Grafton and Weinberg go far to reveal the roots of this exciting field. (Brian Copenhaver, University of California, Los Angeles)Grafton and Weinberg's thoroughly researched account of Casaubon--not only his study of Hebrew texts but also his complicated relationship with Jewish friends, suggesting that \"his openness to Judaism as a larger world had certain limits\"--succeeds through clear syntheses and thoughtful dissections of the many primary sources involved, rendering this academic text refreshingly accessible. (Publishers Weekly2010-11-22)Magnificent...Grafton and Weinberg have pieced together and made coherent sense of the scholar's abundant if often barely legible marginal notes to the works of Hebraica and Judaica that he aggressively acquired and industriously studied. Their decipherment of these rich marginalia, together with the evidence of Casaubon's massive diaries and almost 3,000 letters, yields an eye-opening portrait of an enigmatic 16th-century classicist. It also exposes some of the earliest and deepest roots of the lasting Huguenot sympathy for the Jewish people. (Allan NadlerJewish Ideas Daily2011-01-03)Valuable studies of Renaissance Hebraism have proliferated...But in their splendid new book, Anthony Grafton and Joanna Weinberg direct our attention to a figure whose name is virtually absent from all of the earlier accounts: Isaac Casaubon, the great Huguenot scholar, who lived from 1559 to 1614...Grafton and Weinberg sparkle as they recreate for us a world in which great scholars formed passionate lifelong attachments to colleagues they would never meet...Grafton and Weinberg amply demonstrate that Casaubon's Hebrew studies should be given pride of place in his intellectual biography--and that this fact reveals something important not only about Casaubon himself, but also about the phenomenon of Christian Hebraism more broadly...[An] extraordinary book...These two superb scholars have pooled their considerable talents to conjure for us a world of such immense and varied learning that it is bound, in Montesquieu's words, to \"astonish our small souls.\" (Eric NelsonNew Republic2011-03-03)Fascinating...It is precisely because Casaubon was a second-tier Hebraist that Grafton and Weinberg's recovery of his study of Hebraica, and its role in his larger intellectual project, is so important. If the last several decades have left little doubt that Christian Hebraism was a central feature of Renaissance thought, Grafton and Weinberg have now begun to show how this helps to illuminate and enlarge our appreciation of scholars and divines beyond the core group of specialists. It is certainly not the key to all mythologies, but Casaubon's interest in Hebraic studies becomes, in the expert hands of Grafton and Weinberg, a means for appreciating how Hebraism shaped the philological, theological, and historiographical endeavors for which Casaubon was celebrated.\"I Have Always Loved the Holy Tongue\"--the title taken from one of Casaubon's letters to [Johann] Buxtorf in 1610--is a gorgeously produced volume; more importantly, it is accessibly written. I confess a combination of admiration and envy for the astonishing textual detective work on display. (Jeffrey ShoulsonJewish Review of Books2011-01-01)Grafton and Weinberg patiently sift through Casaubon's literary remains, devoting to them the same kind of sensitive, humane, and yet analytical philological care that Casaubon devoted to his Greek texts. (Alan JacobsBooks & Culture2011-05-01)Casaubon never published any book on Hebrew or Jewish topics. But Anthony Grafton and Joanna Weinberg, two eminent historians of Renaissance scholarship, convincingly make the case in their fascinating and gorgeously produced bookI Have Always Loved the Holy Tonguethat he was nonetheless an industrious Hebraist whose study of and familiarity with Hebrew should be added to his outstanding achievements in Greek and Latin scholarship...One gets a sense of Casaubon's sheer delight in reading Hebrew texts, deciphering roots of words, and, above all, catching colleagues' mistakes (not much has changed in the Republic of Letters). In their love for both the subject matter and the protagonist of their book, and their pleasure in the detective work, Grafton and Weinberg bring Casaubon's own joy to life. (Moshe SluhovskyJerusalem Post2011-07-21)So thorough a reassessment of Casaubon that it also serves as an introduction to him and his world...[It] is full of wonderful details that help carry the reader along...\"I have always loved the Holy Tongue\" reveals Casaubon's character, his relationship to his time and to his work on the past, his search for truth and his search for God, with more nuance, depth and coherence than his biography does, in half as many pages. It also restores his personal agency by revealing his sense of purpose and the rewards of his lifelong quest. (Sam StarkThe Nation2011-07-27)['I have always loved the Holy Tongue'] combines great learning with enviable accessibility and can be enjoyed at various levels, first of all as an informed look at the enterprise of historical-linguistic scholarship in Europe during the decades surrounding 1600. The volume also furnishes an appealing portrait of the individual scholarly pains (and they were literally that) taken by Casaubon in tracking down the customs of early Christianity; one watches over the Huguenot's shoulder as he scratches endless notes (in Latin mostly) on texts he is working through (\"rubbish, rubbish, rubbish\" is a memorable example). Particularly notable are two case studies of Casaubon's dealings with contemporary Jews--factual tales rendered with a narrative flair evoking Nabokov or Ozick, rather than supposedly dry-as-dust intellectual history. (E. D. HillChoice2011-09-01)Anthony Grafton and Joanna Weinberg introduce us to this strong, determined scholar by considering a particularly illuminating and unusual aspect of his scholarly life: his efforts to study Hebrew in depth. To do so, in Casaubon's circumstances, was not a simple task. If Christians were at one another's throats during the Reformation, the prospects were still more dire for Jews...In their account of Casaubon's Hebrew studies, Grafton and Weinberg have illuminated far more than the scholar; they have done much to reveal the multiple sides of a deeply sympathetic figure who must have been, in many respects, a thoroughly modern man. (Ingrid D. RowlandNew York Review of Books2011-10-27)A book that floored me in 2011 was\"I Have Always Loved the Holy Tongue\", by Anthony Grafton and Joanna Weinberg. The subtitle gets at the subject field--Isaac Casaubon, the Jews, and a Forgotten Chapter in Renaissance Scholarship--but does less to suggest the book's drama and style. Princeton professor Grafton is as gifted a writer as he is a historian--something you know if you've read his illuminating book about footnotes--and Weinberg is a preeminent Hebraist at Oxford. Each contributed his or her expertise, and together they've done nothing less than reconstruct a lost chamber in one of the major Renaissance minds. Isaac Casaubon is only quasi-remembered today for having bequeathed his name to the dry old scholar character in George Eliot'sMiddlemarch, but Casaubon the man was deeply passionate in both learning and life (he vigorously wooed a printer's daughter and is said to have fathered 18 children by her). Born of French-Swiss Huguenot refugee stock (like Rousseau), he eventually settled in England, and did as much as anyone in the 16th and early 17th centuries to establish the model of intellectual rigor that we continue to associate with \"serious scholarship.\" He was a classicist primarily, and as such both a linguist and a historian, who made earth-clearing strides in those disciplines, and specifically in bringing them together. What's less known, and indeed was virtually unknown before now, is the depth of Casaubon's interest in Hebrew texts and historical Jewish culture. To excavate this by-no-means-insignificant aspect of his thought, Grafton and Weinberg summon a dauntlessness of research that would earn a nod of respect from the master himself. Many of their extensive primary sources are tiny, deciphered marginal notes from Casaubon's books and copybooks (which they tracked down in libraries all over Europe), as well as obscure Latin correspondence with his academic friends and foes. They find a thinker fascinated with Jewish language and history at a time of near-ubiquitous anti-Semitism, when Jews themselves were forbidden from living in England, and when any Christian writing on ancient Judaism had to follow a distorted, villainizing narrative, no matter what the facts said. In this book, we find Casaubon struggling to subvert those obstacles, but also hobbled by them, in that his own ideas about Jews could lead him into error.

Now a private investigator, Nick is brought back to the case at the request of local graduate students from the Center against Injustice (shades of Northwestern University’s headline-making Center on Wrongful Convictions), who are determined to clear Mansfield’s name. Initially resistant, Nick realizes that the students may be on to something and decides to help out. His efforts are sidetracked by the appearance of his shifty buddy Andy, and by the fact that someone wants Nick off the case. Gritty and suspenseful, this novel is packed with Chicago detail and will appeal to those who like character-driven PI novels. --Rebecca Vnuk", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At last, she began to realize that she owned a desk full of ideas, problems, and children who lived only in her imagination.Finally, Lynda decided that books without readers were a waste of her joy and inspiration!She has now published eight of her stories as eBooks for Kindle and other electronic devices.

Born  1890 A.D (1308 A.H) Died  1964 A.D (1384 A.H) Known for  Interpretation of the Qur'an. M. A. Sheikho and Cupping The name of Mohammad Amin Sheikho is always referred to whenever ‘cupping’ is mentioned, for it is he who disclosed its correct rules. Following the  death of the eminent scholar his pupil, Prof. A. K. al-Dayrani undertook  scientific research about this operation with the participation of a large medical team composed of many professors and doctors specialised in various medical ailments. When the results of the analysis of the blood extracted by the cupping operation were declared and many patients were healed completely after being cupped, the procedure soon spread widely and had a wide following in many societies. The results were published in many magazines and journals, and as a result, many medical people began to apply the procedure according to the exact and correct conditions that had been laid down. Publications Scholar Sheikho dictated to his pupils many books about Islam in the Arabic language, some of which have been translated into English and French. The following are just some of these: - Interpretation of the Great Qur’an. - The Second Coming of Christ. - Impeccability of Prophets. - Visiting the Prophet. - Islam ! What are the Veil, Divorce, and Polygamy for? - \"Al'lah is Greater\" Be Kind to Animal - The Sources of Spring Water in the World. - The Reality of Our Master Mohammad. - High Grades of Al-Taqwa (Seeing by Al’lah’s Light). Pupils Professor Abdul-Kadir John, alias al-Dayrani is the best known  and most distinguished among the pupils of Scholar Sheikho. He received a certificate of General Education (a Syrian certificate which included the study of  nine different sciences). Prof. al-Dayrani collected and verified more than fifty books which were dictated by Scholar Sheikho and written on his behalf. Therefore his name is always mentioned in association with the name of Mohammad Amin Sheikho.

However, despite all these hospital stays, I have managed to achieve 10 A-C GCSEs, a BTEC National Diploma in Performing Arts, French Level 1 and British Sign Language Level 1 and Intermediate level. I am determined and a survivor as I have come from the brink of 4 stone 13 lbs (69lbs) up to a healthy weight for my height. I could have died from my illnesses but I am still here for a purpose and I believe that I might be able to help others out there feel less alone in their different mental health conditions. I am by no means recovered, but I have made a lot of progress towards getting better. I live in Essex with my fiancé and my 11 pet gerbils.

For this reason, Sherry Ann chooses to write miracles into her novels. She is a firm believer that nothing is too difficult for the Lord. While many people dismiss miracles as science or fantasy, Sherry Ann believes otherwise. A rosebud opening its petals for the first time is recognized for its intricate design. So, too, is the human heart, which beats without any conscious effort. Both are miracles, yet scientists do not classify them as such. To Sherry Ann's eyes, everything is a miracle. This attitude leads her to accept God's love and the beauty of His world more fully.Sherry Ann believes God is always there to take our hand and lead us to success. She is not alone in receiving some of the Lord's bigger challenges. It is at those times of greatest opposition that God works some of His most remarkable miracles.

He bravely wears his assumptions-- for example, the neutrality of technology-- on his sleeve, and his lesson for techno-dreamers is straightforward.

I believe my love of medieval knights came about when my father built a wooden shield and sword for me to use in elementary school for some event. Through my school years I read hundreds (or thousands? - it's hard to recall at this point) of fantasy and science fiction novels.  Comic books and super heroes came a bit later, although I recall seeing the Christopher Reeve Superman movies at a very young age (and loving them).  Since my later teens I believe I've watched nearly every major fantasy, science fiction, and super-hero movie that has come out. I still love reading fantasy and science fiction, although I wish there were more novels based on superheroes.  This is something that drove me to create my own supers universe and heroes in written form.  I love supers, but I've always wanted more character depth than a comic book can provide.  (Not to mention the immense length of time it takes for a comic series to do a story is just plain too long to me.) Writing is a hobby for me, I'm a full-time computer programmer and systems administrator for a small company.  Fortunately the skills I've learned allow me to work with 3D programs to render the characters (and covers) for my books.  My hope is to put out a novel or two a year, time allowing.  At this point I'd like to grow the H.E.R.O.

When she finds a set of erotic scrolls left behind by her friend, she decides to begin with learning what those scrolls depict. Serving as First Boy in an English household has also proved to Ken Jin that he needs more from life, but when he learns that Miss Charlotte had found sacred Tigress scrolls, his first mission is to wrest them from her possession and return them to their rightful place. Stubborn as ever, Miss Charlotte refuses, unless he agrees to teach her what the scrolls truly mean. The latest in Lee's Tigress series, followingHungry TigressandDesperate Tigress(both 2005), offers a more humorous tone, but have no fear: Lee's deft eroticism hasn't lost any of its power. With her latest variant on the Tigress practice, Lee's star continues to burn bright.Nina DavisCopyright © American Library Association.

His gaze zipped from the photo to the black metal numbers marking the address, and then to the lettering on the window that spelled out Celebrations, Inc., Catering Company.Yep, this was the place.His gaze zagged back to the photograph for one last look at the woman's enticing smile. At least the first person he'd met in Celebration, Texas, had a pretty face. He'd always been a sucker for a pretty face. The photograph had been the tipping point that had convinced him to make this personal delivery of chocolate and snapshots to a civilian.He wasn't in the habit of playing delivery boy for strangers. However, when he'd visited Maya's Chocolate Shop as he'd passed through St. Michel on his way back to the United States from the Middle East, he'd struck up a conversation with Maya, the shop's proprietor. When she'd learned the next stop on his tour was Celebration, Texas, she'd nearly leaped over the counter in excitement.Maya had a good friend who'd just opened a catering business in Celebration. Her name was AJ Sherwood-Antonelli—a mouthful of a name if he'd ever heard one. Maya thought it would be fun to surprise AJ with a special delivery of \"celebratory chocolates,\" as she put it. She'd said something about a \"chocolate-gram from a nice-looking soldier\"—or something like that. Her words might've embarrassed him, if he'd been prone to such a weakness. But he wasn't. In the end—after several samples of Maya's sweets—it was her bribe of a box of hand-dipped truffles as payment that convinced him to bring a box to her friend.Actually, if the truth be told, it was the photograph of the beautiful woman that persuaded him. He studied the picture again. Something about AJ's smile captured him; or maybe it was something in the way her eyes shone as she looked through the camera.Whatever it was, that indefinable \"something\" made him want to know her better. Or at least meet her. He wasn't looking for anything long-term. Actually, he wasn't looking for anything. Period.For the next six weeks, he was stationed at Fort Hood. He'd be spending most of his days in Celebration on an undesirable assignment scouting sites for an off-base MOUT school (Military Operations Urban Terrain). The assignment, known in the army as \"Realtor duty,\" was the hell most soldiers dreaded. Once he'd secured the venue, he'd help set up the school training facility.Six weeks of drudgery. He couldn't think of many other things he'd rathernotdo.Centering the stack of photographs on the box of chocolates, Shane gave himself a mental shake, preempting a downward mood spiral. The assignment wasonlysix weeks. Then he'd head off on a plum European assignment he'd coveted for eighteen years. In the meantime, he needed to just suck it up.So what was another six-week tour?It was a trade off. That's what it was. And even though getting stuck in suburban hell made him feel like doing anything but \"celebrating,\" maybe the diversion of female company would help pass the time.The door chime beckoned AJ from the backroom kitchen where she'd been perfecting a selection of sliders to serve at A Taste of Celebration, a food festival sponsored by the Celebration, Texas, Chamber of Commerce. The event was next weekend, and it would be the first big community-wide showcase for her new catering company. She'd done a steady stream of business over the past year and a half out of her home kitchen, but A Taste of Celebration was the first time Celebrations, Inc. would make its debut to the public as an official business with its own commercial kitchen and office space.It was September, and even though the holidays were a couple of months away, it wasn't too early to start getting the word out about the catering company's new digs. People would start thinking about the holidays soon, and in the meantime, there would be tailgating parties and fall festivals—all sorts of catering opportunities. A Taste of Celebration had the potential to earn her some bookings.She wiped off her hands and made her way into the reception area. Since she was the only one in the office, she kept the door locked. Not that she felt unsafe in this town where everyone knew everyone… Okay, so maybe she did have a few issues about safety. Even so, she kept the door locked because she didn't want to be surprised by someone happening in unannounced.But surprised she was—and a little wary—when she saw the tall, good-looking stranger peering in through the glass and clutching a sack of photographs and a small box.She was five-three, and he had a good foot on her in height. He also had close-cropped blond hair, broad shoulders and muscular arms. Quite a nice sight to behold, but the frivolity of his Adonis-like assets faded when he rapped on the glass door again and held up one of the photos.She squinted at it, and her curiosity blossomed when she realized it was a picture of her and her friend Maya LeBlanc.It had been taken last fall when she and her friends had gone over to St. Michel with their boarding-school buddy Margeaux Broussard to support her as she mended relations with her terminally ill father.Hoping she didn't have flour on her face, she wiped her hands on her apron and gave a quick swipe across her cheeks before she turned the lock and opened the door. After all, a stranger in possession of a photo of her with her friend Maya surely wasn't there to cause trouble.She opened the door a crack. \"May I help you?\"\"AJ Sherwood-Antonelli?\"\"Yes? I'm AJ…\"\"Special delivery, all the way from St. Michel.\" He slid the photo through the small opening in the door. She accepted it.\"Where did you get this?\"\"From Maya. This is for you, too.\" He held out the pink and black box, which AJ immediately recognized as Maya's signature package. Her mouth watered at the thought of the confections inside.\"She said to tell you congratulations on your new business. I think there's a note in the box.\"She opened the door wider and took the chocolates. \"Won't you please come in?\"He stepped inside, glancing around the unfinished lobby area—all plain, plastered drywall, no furniture. Not even a desk. A self-conscious wave washed over AJ.She'd moved in three months ago. Essentially, Celebrations, Inc. was a one-woman show financed by her own seed money, which was supplemented by monetary and in-kind investments from her friends Caroline, Pepper and Sydney. They helped her in various capacities such as prepping desserts, marketing, booking and serving. However, AJ had been so busy with the food end of the business, she hadn't had time to fix up the front of the house.In the little bit of free time AJ had, she'd concentrated on testing new recipes and refining the company's menu. The kitchen had been the sole focus of her efforts. There hadn't been much time left for decorating the public area of the small space she was leasing.Pepper had been after her about it. AJ was so embarrassed by the sudden realization of how stark and unfinished this first impression must be, that she made a mental note to give Pepper the green light to have her way with it.She could already hear her friend's I-told-you-so's. And they'd be well deserved.Standing here with this attractive man, AJ was acutely aware that if business kept growing at the current rate, having Pepper do something about the reception area would alleviate this woefully self-conscious feeling she currently had standing here with—with—\"Andwhoare you?\" she asked. \"Shane Harrison.\" He offered his hand and she accepted, giving it a quick shake.\"Nice to meet you, Shane. How do you know Maya?\"He smiled and the appeal of his crooked grin dazzled her for a moment. \"I don't, really,\" he said. \"I happened into her shop last week while I was in St. Michel, and when she learned I was coming to Celebration, Texas, well, basically she bribed me with chocolate to bring you this care package. Oh—here are the rest of the photos.\"AJ accepted them. As she flipped through them one at a time, smiling at the memory of the trip to St. Michel she, Pepper and Caroline had taken a few months ago, her mind raced as she remembered Maya talking about how she fancied herself a matchmaker.But that's not what this special delivery is about,she told herself.AJ stole a quick, assessing glance at Shane, then returned her gaze to the photos. He was a good-looking guy, tall and tanned and solidly built with sturdy, mile-wide shoulders.Not at all my type.Even so, the thought sparked a heat that started in her cleavage and crawled uncontrollably up her neck, until it burned on her cheeks.It was ridiculous. No, not only ridiculous, just plain absurd. When was the last time a great set of shoulders caused her to blush like a high school girl with a crush?It had been a very long time.She hated being out of control.As she flipped through the photos one more time, she bit the insides of her cheeks hard until finally she felt her face cooling.\"Well, Mr. Harrison—\" she began.\"Actually, it's Sergeant Harrison. I'm stationed over at Fort Hood for the next six weeks or so. But actually, I'm living in town for closer proximity to a project I'm heading up.\"A military man.Even though he wasn't in uniform, she could see that he fit the bill. Physically fit with shoulders so wide he could probably carry the weight of a nation.Inwardly, she rolled her eyes at the cheesy sentiment, bringing herself back down to earth by reminding herself that shouldering the weight of a nation went hand in hand ...", "related": ["B00FTQ1IPQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I'd been writing often about the Upper Gulf Coast for different\nmagazines, and Bill invited me to come to Mississippi's Gulf Coast and fish\nwith him. I was blown-away at how good the fishing was inshore, offshore and\nevery month of the year. Bill was also one of the first PR people I'd ever met\nin the fishing industry who was willing to work with me from before daylight to\nwell-after dark. Bill helped me find contacts to interview, posed for pictures\nand held the rope to my float tube when we were 100-miles offshore, and I was\nphotographing fish being landed by the anglers on the boat. Bill and I did a number\nof stories together. Then when Bill retired, Mike Jones took his place I found\nthat Mike was cut out of the same cloth as Bill. I could go to the Mississippi\nGulf Coast, stay 2 days and get 4-6 stories and the photography I needed to go\nwith them. But more importantly, I met warm, friendly people whose company I\nenjoyed, and I met captains who always said, \"Come on back any time we can help\nyou.\" I was also amazed at the size and the number of fish we\ncould catch. A classic example was when I told Captain Sonny Schindler, \"I need\nto go out and catch speckled trout, redfish and tripletails to photograph.\" In\na half a day, we had limits of all three and time to spare. I also learned that\nMississippi's Gulf Coast, because of its location, provided outstanding fishing\nall year long, not just in the spring, summer and fall.", "related": ["B00BGIKBPY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rowling's bestselling seriesHarry Potter. Can you elaborate?Brian Kittrell:Certainly, and first, let me thank you for the opportunity to talk about the series. The books were a pleasure to write, and I'm happy that they're finding their way into readers' hands. Similarly to theHarry Potterseries by Rowling, I began the books from the perspective of a young mage who was to begin his training in magic, and the similarities end there. Laedron is quickly thrust into the action after a sneak attack the the mage's enclave by the Heraldan church. He's forced to find his own way in magic, and he must make the decision of whether he will fight in the war--and ultimately get justice for the wrongs committed by the church--or hide from the enemies trying to destroy his kind.Interviewer:Does the series draw any comparisons to real-world events or things we can relate to in real life?Brian Kittrell:Yes, very much so. The war between the mages and the church parallels many of the modern struggles we see today. In the books, we see two groups of people who are largely the same, but they have their own customs. Mages use magic and spells, and priests see it as using divine power and miracles. And Ismerelda--one of the central characters in the first book--explains it best when she says that mages and priests are basically the same, using the same abilities taught by the powerful sorceress Azura in ancient times, but they have grown apart on their ideologies and how they think magic should be used. We see the same pattern in many of the social issues in our own world, and sometimes the biggest part of the problem is a failure for people to see past their own ingrained beliefs.Interviewer:J.R.R. Tolkien'sThe Lord of the RingsandThe Hobbitmake use of a number of fantasy creatures. Does your series do the same?Brian Kittrell:In writing theMages of Bloodmyr, I wanted to focus more on the human happenings, but a new fantasy race is born at the end ofThe Immortals of Myrdwyer. I won't go into that so as not to spoil it, but that race will see a place in the future ofBloodmyr, granted that I am given the time and energy to complete all of the stories I have.Interviewer:Do you have plans to extend this series past three books?Brian Kittrell:This series, no. However, I will write in the same world with the same characters, and some themes may translate between different series. I don't like the concept of never-ending series that we have seen come about, though, so each series will be complete in its own right, and some ideas from those series may create their own standalone books or series, each written tight enough not to require reading everything else to understand what is going on. Readers of all of the books will probably get the greatest reward, but it won't be required.Interviewer:Thank you for coming by and giving us a little insight to your work. I hope we will chat again soon once you release more books.Brian Kittrell:It will be my pleasure.", "related": ["B006UY82K0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Partito per gli States, si è laureato in relazioni\ninternazionali alla Georgetown University. Ha poi conseguito un Ph.D. in\n studi strategici al M.I.T. proprio nel 1989, quando la fine della\nguerra fredda l'ha costretto a ricominciare tutto da capo. Ha pubblicato\n molti saggi di politica internazionale e contribuito all'Enciclopedia\nTreccani. Ha imparato a fotografare con obiettivi con messa a fuoco\nmanuale e pellicole Kodachrome. Col tempo è diventato pilota di alianti e\n un bel giorno ha deciso di portarsi sott'acqua la sua macchina\nfotografica. Crescendo ha iniziato ad apprezzare i buoni vini (il 1959 è\n stata una grande annata!), a divertirsi in cucina e ad ascoltare Bach,\nBeethoven ed il jazz dei primi anni sessanta. Trasferitosi a Bruxelles,\nha lavorato per molti anni alla NATO. Quindi si è rimesso a viaggiare a\ntempo quasi pieno, cercando di apprendere quanto c'è di buono in giro\nper il mondo. Predilige l'Asia e l'oceano Pacifico oltre, ovviamente,\nalle Maldive. Questo è il suo primo libro di viaggio.

MacKinnon shows us afresh the world we thought we knew through a kaleidoscopic lens of startling facts, illuminating insight and flat-out-wonderful writing.”—John Vaillant, author ofThe Golden SpruceandThe Tiger“A lean, elegant and powerful essay on what we have done to the world—and what we might do to set things right. J.B. MacKinnon has made me think in new ways about our self-destructive trashing of the ‘luckless garden’ into which we were so lucky to be born.”—Ronald Wright, author ofA Short History of Progress “MacKinnon is an eloquent guide through landscapes wild and tame. He takes the reader backwards through evolutionary time and forward into a delicate and unknown future. I devoured this book in a day and closed its covers marveling at our planet’s incredible abundance. Natural history at its best.”—Charlotte Gill, author ofEating Dirt “A re-enchantment with the natural world may be a necessary prerequisite to the changes we must make to keep that natural world more or less intact. This is deep and lovely thinking and writing.”—Bill McKibben, author ofOil and Honey: The Education of an Unlikely Activist “Henry David Thoreau warned us, in 1862, that not inwildernessbut inwildnessis the preservation of the world. There’s a difference. InThe Once and Future World, J.B. MacKinnon brings this distinction up to date. Wilderness may be gone forever, but wildness can be recovered, and it is time to get to work.”—George Dyson “This book should make your blood run cold; or boil with furious rage against the despoilers of our planet. But perhaps all is not yet lost. MacKinnon tells us that the crisis in the natural world is not yet fatal…but it’s waiting. And then he tells us most convincingly what we can and must do to stop the rot. This is a handbook for those who hope to see the earth, and man, remain alive together.”—Farley Mowat “A gripping and convincing look at the nature that humans lost and the perspective that we gained. MacKinnon leaves us wanting to be wilder.”—Jennifer Jacquet, author of theGuilty Planetblog atScientific American, assistant professor of environmental studies at NYU “The 100-Mile Dietforever changed the way I see a plate of food and it is still with me today.The Once and Future Worldchanged the way I seeeverything. One can only hope it spawns a movement likeThe 100-Mile Dietdid—a moment of re-imagining, re-wilding and coming home.”—Leanne Allison, filmmaker (Being Caribou,Finding Farley,Bear 71) “Like Peter Matthiessen, Barry Lopez and Tim Flannery, J.B. MacKinnon is an exceptional writer with an intense passion for the natural world. InThe Once and Future World, MacKinnon combines eloquent storytelling with painstaking research to provide a persuasive argument for the need to not only protect the wildness we have today, but to restore at least some of the abundance we have lost. It may be too late to bring back the Tasmanian tiger, but, as MacKinnon writes, there’s still time to create a planet that is far richer in natural wonders.”—James Little, former editor ofExploremagazine “J.B. MacKinnon is one of the finest essayists of the natural world writing today.”—Andrew D.

They take the bodies to the nearest town and soon enough find themselves on some mighty slippery ground. A local rancher's daughter sets her demure sights on Josh, who briefly considers fleeing town and the uneasy promise of romantic intrigue but instead agrees to help the sheriff corral the troublesome gang of rustlers. If that weren't headache enough, figure in a Confederate strongbox brimming with $60,000 in gold, a couple of Union spies deeply ensconced in the town, and a shifty saloon owner looking to score big from the coming railroad. Conwell's characters are mostly cardboard cutouts recognizable from any other western, but he tells the story with enough good-natured verve to make the overly convenient plotting--a little too much right place, right time--palatable. This won't win anyone over to the genre, but for those already hooked, it's a likable enough lark.Ian ChipmanCopyright © American Library Association.

I write mainly science fiction, but I also try my hand at fantasy. In my writing I try to combine my interests in science and politics with psychology (which I incidentally have a Master's degree in - never thought I'd use it in this way!). I think my diverse interests and background gives me a few valuable perspectives that enhance my writing, and although my main literary interest lies in the scifi and fantasy sphere, I enjoy a good thriller or horror now and then.From my reviews I learn that different readers enjoy different aspects of my books. Some enjoy the adventure; some find a message of hope, while others have said they find themselves nodding as they read it. One of my favorite reviews for Exodus said that \"This book is science fiction in great form. It doesn't just make you think about the future, it really makes you think about the world around you today\"When I was a kid, I used to draw cartoons and make up all kinds of stories. It still took many years before I learned one can actually reach an audience all over the world, and even longer before I actually finished a book. Now I am thrilled to connect with readers and I'd love to hear from you as well!I love the process of writing, and sometimes feel like I'm living the adventures of my characters. I guess that's the trick; to write the books you'd love to read (although I don't presume to know the formula for a bestseller - yet). So what's my best book so far?

My first impression was that she was a fun-loving, cheerful woman with an outgoing personality. Her enthusiastic faith in God first impacted my life when, as a young single woman, I attended the College and Careers class she taught in the church I attended.           When someone at church told me that Shirley's oldest son had disappeared a few years earlier, I was sure they must have her confused with someone else. This vibrant woman couldn't have suffered something as devastating as the disappearance of a child. I was wrong, of course, too young in the faith to realize the true power that God can have in an individual's life.           Later, Shirley encouraged me to become involved in Christian ministry to women, an involvement that continues to this day. When I moved to another city, Shirley came to visit several times. Each time, she spoke to a large gathering of women eager to hear her personal story of loss and recovery. During these visits, Shirley also gave interviews to the local television station. She never shies away from an opportunity to bring hope to others by telling her story.            Since she so willingly tells her story, people might think it comes easy to her. It doesn't. During the writing of this book, it was emotionally taxing for Shirley to revisit the painful memories of the loss of her son. Shirley is not a woman who lives in the past. As you'll read, she put her son's fate squarely in the hands of God and left it there.            As I write these words, I'm in awe of what God can do in the life of someone who completely gives themselves to Him.            It's Shirley's desire, and mine also, that her story will speak to each reader in a personal way.                                                             Rose McCormick Brandon", "related": [], "rank": 3019921, "title": "Vanished", "author": "Rose McCormick Brandon", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book opens with an explanation of engineering, introduces the different types of engineers, and describes the problem-solving process they use. Canals and dams are given center stage as their structures and the scientific principles behind them are explained, history and examples are given, and disasters caused by or resulting from their construction or aging are shared. Each section is accompanied by several activities, and that's where things begin to crumble. Many of the activities do a fine job of showcasing the information from the preceding section but explanations are often inadequate or directions and illustrations lack clarity. One example: buoyancy is described as a \"force that allows an object to float in liquid.\" Volume and displacement are introduced and Archimedes's principle is mentioned but density is overlooked until the activities section when a foam and cardboard barge are compared and a Cartesian diver is made-all requiring density to help explain buoyancy. Other activities have tenuous connections to the preceding topic or sometimes seem random. A \"Spinning Bucket Trick\" mentions centrifugal force in relation to the canals in Venice but doesn't explain the science or make the connection to canals. And so it goes. Quotes, spot black-and-white illustrations, \"Did You Know\" boxes, and definitions for vocabulary used on the page fill out the spreads. The topic plus the hands-on emphasis is a nod to the growing popularity of STEM initiatives in education but unfortunately this title needs some shoring up.-Carol S.

It was boring, mostly\nbecause Loric and his friends had outgrown common battles. They needed new\nchallengers, and those challengers needed abilities to ignore the call of the\nSword of the Dragon's Eye, that they be more resilient than previous foes.I cast off my original plans and title for this work and rethought\neverything I thought I knew about Beledon and its characters, most especially\nits primary players. I wrote something with potential, but it was not quite\nright. Thankfully, years of revisions reshaped it to keep pace with evolutions\ntaking place in the first two books of The Dragon Eyes Chronicles.Along the way, I fell in love with characters I never expected to love,\nand my pleasant feelings for other characters changed as well, as I learned\nmore about them. I embraced my new outlook and transferred it to Loric, making\nit his battle as well as mine. The resulting dynamics between Loric and\nsurrounding cast members appeals to my love for tension wrapped in irony, with\nacts of war dancing around that twisted totem. In short, I came away with a\nthird book of what I call the first trilogy of The Dragon Eyes Chronicles\nthat lives up to the promise of the first two books. I hope you enjoy reading\nit as much as I have enjoyed the process of shaping it. Thanks for reading.-David S.

It absolutely dragged me in. I\nreally couldn't put it down ... It's a wonderful story' - Martin Bailie, BBC\nRadio Cornwall'A story of faith, trust, and hope, Where Seagulls Fly is an evocative gem of a\nnovel. As quiet and unassuming as the monks who live in its setting of St.\nMichael's Mount in 13th-century Cornwall,\nthis story of friendship and one man's patient struggle to find a place in life\nslowly envelops the reader in its finely drawn characters and setting. The\ntransformation of the main character, a man tormented for so long that the only\nname he remembers is Beast, is at the heart of the novel. My faith is not\nbased on the reasoning of the mind, but on the feelings of the heart, says\nBrother Elwin, summing up the novel's theme of the quiet persistence of\nemotion. This is a truly lovely book, bringing with it both the scent of the\nsea and sense of peace that pervade its setting, a true sanctuary' -Megan\nKitzman, Historical Novel Society 'This lightly philosophical and moralistic tale captures the\nmood and the emotions of a darker age.

With this debut novel, Connie McParland weaves a vivid story that attempts to find meaning in the distance between the decorum of present-day Montreal and the restless soul of a Calabrian childhood. In doing so, she joins a rich lineage of modern Italian-Canadian writing - from Nino Ricci's Lives of the Saints to Vittorio Rossi's A Carpenter's Trilogy - in documenting the complex web of families, traditions, loves and losses spanning across decades and the Atlantic. --Dimitri Nasrallah, QWF award-winning author of Niko.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is\nsupposed to be just another arson and a story for Ellie to cover.\nEverything changes when she finds out that her estranged mother,\nHortensia Borgias Sinclair, is one of the latest victims. It might be a\ndestined fate as her mother often claimed, but Ellie suspects that there\n must be something more to it; something more sinister. She must find\nout who is the real arsonist and their reason for the crime. This\ngripping mystery tale is written by Laura Schofer.The Fingerprint of Destiny is a fascinating mystery with a protagonist\nwho I couldn't get enough of. Author Laura Schofer has certainly got me\nintrigued with her story. While mystery fiction sometimes has a tendency\n to lose steam, it is definitely not the case here. Schofer's inside\nknowledge of journalism and the setting serves her well, and her skill\nin crafting page-turning scenarios also helps. She doesn't beat around\nthe bush, thus making The Fingerprint of Destiny very well paced. Her\nno-frills prose lends itself well to this flawless tale because she just\n gets down to business without excessively long pauses while the\ncharacters examine their motives or engage in some pace-killing\nreflection.Overall, this is a marvelous read that kept me guessing and entertained until the very end.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The essays, only two of which are reprints, share the Latin American theme yet represent unique contributions to scholarship by employing cultural events or activities to relate a nation's history and social awareness. Essays by Pamela Voekel and Matthew D. Esposito take a cemetery and a funeral as their settings, while two other articles report on national exhibits at world expositions to demonstrate the efforts of Argentina and Ecuador to present themselves as civilized nations. John Chasteen, Darien Davis, and Graham Holton turn to music and dance as forms of popular culture. In one of the reprinted essays, Nancy Stepan reviews a volume of photographs depicting medicine and health in Brazil. Collectively, the essays overcome the stigma often attached to the study of popular culture as a legitimate academic discipline that provides insight into intellectual and cultural character and the distinguishing \"images, practices, and institutions\" that create national identities.

His diagnosis of and solutions to escalating costs, improving scholarship, and raising completion rates are thought-provoking, and he cites many real-life innovations. For example, at the University of Minnesota's new Rochester campus, through a collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, only one bachelor's degree is offered—in health sciences, naturally. The University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, by analyzing dismal completion rates found barrier courses  in general education requirements, causing large numbers of students to fail and then drop out. The author ends with a long and clear checklist of how interlocking parts of the higher education world can change the American university. Though Zemsky begins by writing that the number of people on whom change within higher education actually depends is substantially less than a thousand,  this candor makes the book a more satisfying read, cementing his clear wish to not talk down to his audience. The lay reader can only hope this book reaches those under-a-thousand decision makers.

I grew up in a mill village in the south and was thrust into the textile and apparel business at a young age. I have lived through the \"hay day\" of the American economy, and I have seen the change and death of a manufacturing industry. Along the way I have been an accomplished artist, drinker, fisherman, traveler, mover, shaker, and a watcher. I write what I have lived. And through years of honing an ability to relate and see things as others may not see them, I have developed an energetic writing style that is easy to read and rolls off the tongue like a well executed roll cast for a hungry trout. I believe I have lived all of my life for this moment, and the power of that thought is seen and felt in the pages of my book. Technically speaking, I am fairly attractive (Mama told me that at an early age). I am a good conversationalist. I am a personable, easy speaking guy who happens to be creative. I am also an artist who has sold paintings in a few galleries, and I, along with my brothers who also paint, was written up in “Southwest Art” magazine several years ago. I have a few more books that will be published soon, and I look forward to you letting me know what you think of this book and the books to come.", "related": ["B00B74SFUU"], "rank": 2409803, "title": "Shot From Taw eBook", "author": "Austin K Austin", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This was hardly the first time I didn't remember how I ended up where I was waking up. My first thought was Sheila had probably locked the door to our bedroom because she was still pissed at me. My second thought was, \"Wait, how did I get tied up?\" I pulled at the ropes I realized were around my wrists and my ankles. God, it felt like a macramé artist had exploded on top of me.\"He's awake,\" I heard Ben's voice from just outside the door.\"About fucking time,\" Sheila said. She came in carrying a large box. \"I'm so tired of having to deal with your useless ass,\" she yelled at me. \"I'm tired of you getting so drunk you end up thinking doing it doggy style means you roll over and play dead. Now that it's official you aren't man enough to father kids, I've decided there are going to be some major changes.\"The only thing I was wearing besides the ropes was my boxers. She reached into her box and pulled out an enormous pair of scissors. I watched with horror as she brought them near my crotch, but she just used them to cut off my boxers, leaving me exposed.Ben looked at what I had been packing and snickered. \"Hey, Ben,\" she said, \"do you know what you call this useless piece of skin attached to the penis?\" She paused for a moment and said, \"My husband.\" She indicated to Ben to help her unzip her dress. It spilled around her feet and she stepped out of it. She was already barefoot and stood there in her bra and lace panties. \"Hey, Ben,\" she continued. \"Look at what so many men would kill for and look what I ended up with.\" She turned to face him. \"Get down on your knees and push your face into my panties and tell my dickless wonder here what it is you smell.\"", "related": ["B00KI0IBVC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She is officially old enough to know better, but refuses to grow up. She has been, at various points in her life, a jeweler, an artist, a counselor, a minister, a fitness instructor, a singer, counter-person in a coffee-shop, a lab tech, a research assistant,  quarter-staff master, a daycare worker, a high school English teacher, a kindergarten teacher, a stay-at-home-mom, an editor and a writer. She firmly believes in the Heinlein adage that specialization is for insects, and is still working on the tinker, tailor, soldier and spy parts of the list. Elizabeth started writing in grade school, mostly for her own amusement. Her first novel was written while a student at the Bronx High School of Science, where she was regularly accosted before class by her friends, who were looking for the next chapter. She still has that manuscript somewhere, and readily admits that it is absolute and complete crap, but one must start somewhere. Writing got pushed to the sidelines for a good number of years, until Elizabeth got involved in a play-by-email role-playing game that was completely story driven. That game rekindled her love of writing, and she teamed up with another player to further explore the lives of their characters. That exploration turned into a planned series of novels, of which the first two are complete.  Once Elizabeth started writing again, she found that she couldn't stop. A friend pointed out an open call for submissions for a Circlet anthology themed on the Tarot. She came up with an idea about a most interesting tarot reading that turned into \"The Hand You're Dealt,\" her first short story sale.  Elizabeth lives in Central Florida with her husband and son, and a most accepting circle of friends who are both very amused and very proud of the pervy, fetish writer in their midst.  Elizabeth can be found online at http://easchechter.wordpress.com/, or on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/Elizabeth.A.Schechter.", "related": ["B00HSSR8YI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She is a graduate of Virginia Tech with a degree in English. She fell in love with books as soon as she learned how to read. “My mom read to us before bed, and I think that’s how I started to love stories. It was like a little mini-vacation we looked forward to every night before going to sleep. I think I eventually read most of the books in my elementary school library.” That love for books translated into a natural love for writing and a desire to create stories that other readers could get lost in, just as she had gotten lost in her favorite books. Her stories focus on the dynamics of relationships, those between a man and a woman, mother and daughter, sisters, friends. They most often take place in small Virginia towns very much like the one where she grew up and are peopled with characters who reflect those values and traditions. “There’s something about small-town life that’s just part of who I am. I’ve had the desire to live in other places, wondered what it would be like to be a true Manhattanite, but the thing I know I would miss is the familiarity of faces everywhere I go. There’s a lot to be said for going in the grocery store and seeing ten people you know!” Inglath Cooper is an avid supporter of companion animal rescue and is a volunteer and donor for the Franklin County Humane Society. She and her family have fostered many dogs and cats who have gone on to be adopted by other families. “The rewards are endless. It’s an eye-opening moment to realize that what one person throws away can fill another person’s life with love and joy.” See a list of Inglath's books at: www.inglathcooper.com/books Follow Inglath on Facebook at www.facebook.com/inglathcooperbooks Join her mailing list for news of new releases and giveaways at www.inglathcooper.com", "related": ["B00I36DKA0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 70, "rating_average": 4.5571, "rating_total": 319.0}

Here's a little about me:I'm a 20-year-old medical student, I live in Belgium and I am absolutely passionate about health! I am constantly searching for ways to improve my health without me having to grab to pills or medical interventions whatsoever. I've spend a lot of time - next to my medical studies - reading books, articles, blog posts, listening to audio programs, etc. I also attempt seminars on NLP and Ayurveda on a regular basis. I'm not only interested in medicine. I also read a lot on personal growth, motivation, fitness, meditation, spirituality, and so on. Besides my studies and Easy Meds I'm also a Coach for students struggling in high school! This is really valuable to me because I'm able to HELP these students get through rough times and motivate them to get their grades back to normal.This all contributes to my personal growth and to my overall knowledge. I am so grateful that I got into the whole \"self-improvement world\" so early! I've taken my life to a whole different level and I count on keeping it that way!The purpose of Easy Meds in all this is to share all my knowledge and experiences and to inspire people to take responsibility for their own health! It is the action that you are taking NOW that will determine your FUTURE life, so start living healthy NOW. You won't regret it! I believe that health is THE most important area of life. If you are not healthy, you most likely won't be able to enjoy life fully. There are 3 really important keywords when it comes to health: FOOD, FITNESS and STATE OF MIND. All 3 areas are really important and all contribute to our health.I invite you to use my e-books here, articles and videos as a resource to help you achieving optimal health! Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I look forward to seeing you on my page sometime soon!Cheers,- Thomas", "related": ["B00IEJSJ0C"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 45.0}

Ash Turner becomes heir to the dukedom of Parford after uncovering evidence that the current duke's children, Ash's distant cousins, are illegitimate. Among the suddenly disinherited is the beautiful Lady Margaret Dalrymple, now shunned by society. Ash has no idea that the dying duke's beautiful nurse is actually Margaret, set to spy on Ash and collect material to support her brothers' countersuit for a decree of legitimacy. Instantly attracted to almost impossibly kind and charismatic Ash, Margaret is torn between newfound love and loyalty to her boorish brothers. While the love story is genuinely satisfying and Margaret's dilemma movingly portrayed, Milan (Proof by Seduction) leaves Ash's complex relationship with his brothers unresolved--perhaps to be explored further in sequels--and makes the conflict dependent on the unlikely scenario of Parliament legitimizing a bigamist's bastards, fatally marring an otherwise promising novel.
