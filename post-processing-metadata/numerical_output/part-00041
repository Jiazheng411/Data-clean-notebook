In this remarkable portrait of the doctors and administrators at Brooklyn's Maimonides Medical Center, bestselling author Salamon (The Devil's Candy;The Christmas Tree) illustrates the complex machine that is the modern hospital, vying to provide cutting-edge facilities and compassionate care, while making money doing it. Salamon compares Maimonides to a factory, where medicine is industrialized, streamlined for efficiency and as dependent on skilled administrators as on talented physicians. Located in a Brooklyn neighborhood known for its simmering mix of ethnicities and cultures, particularly its influential ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, Maimonides is insanely busy, with perhaps the most densely packed emergency room of its size. A new resident in obstetrics learns to count to ten and say 'push' in Cantonese, Mandarin, Russian, and at least two other languages that I'm not sure what they were. Administrators juggle budgets, politics and feuding staff while insurance paperwork increases mistakes and steals treatment time. Although it's hard to deconstruct the Tower of Babel when you're standing in the middle of it, Salamon succeeds in providing a completely unique, three-dimensional and compellingly human perspective of the demanding work—both frustrating and rewarding—that is not always apparent to hospital patients and their families.(May 19)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As the novel opens, she discovers that her runaway roommate, Taylor, has returned. Taylor quickly resolves her differences with the other Carter House residents and in the process snags a coveted role in the school musical. Just as DJ thinks life in Crescent Cove might settle down, she is injured while saving a child from an oncoming car. Although she has become a local heroine, she struggles with the emotional and physical impact of the accident, feeling alone and insecure as her friends carry on with their lives at school. While DJ recuperates, Taylor and Eliza compete against each other in the homecoming queen contest, DJ's boyfriend reconnects with an old flame, and her volleyball teammates continue the season without her. Although each character represents a type, they are not one-dimensional. As the plot rambles along, jumping from one situation to the next, the author reveals different layers of her characters' personalities and, in the end, provides the satisfying twist of an unexpected result in the homecoming queen election. Reminiscent of Francine Pascal's \"Sweet Valley High\" books (Random), but with strong Christian overtones, this novel touches on a variety of issues, including prescription drug abuse, that will resonate with teens.—Linda L.

In between these bookends, Newman dips into the apocalyptic beliefs of early Christians (such as the vision of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse), Chinese Daoism, the fictional 12th century magician Merlin ( \"associated with prophecy\" throughout Europe for more than 800 years), and the increasingly infamous Mayan calendar that supposedly \"ends\" on December 21, 2012, a false prophesy Newman attributes to commentators who don't understand the writing, religion or archaeoastronomy of the ancient civilization: \"the Mayans, like the Egyptians, were more concerned with keeping the world going than with when it was going to end.\" Entertaining and well-footnoted, this guide to the ends of the Earth will inform skeptics but is unlikely to sway believers.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Gorrell begins by tracing the evolution of \"household canids\" from the wild into the civilized world. Other chapters delve into the many ways in which these animals have been viewed throughout history, what makes particular breeds right for certain jobs, dogs at war, famous pooches, etc. Youngsters learn that canines have been used for food, sport, sacrifice, protection, slave control, maritime work, bear deterrence, and, of course, companionship. The author introduces many real-life workers, such as Opal, a yellow Lab in training to guide the blind; Dart, a German shepherd that sniffs out illegal catches of seafood; and Servus, a Belgian Malinois that nearly died at the ruins of the World Trade Center. The well-captioned, black-and-white photographs and reproductions add greatly to a narrative that's packed with intriguing details. Extensive source notes and a selected bibliography complete the package.

Consequently, \"Oaklayne, A Civil War Saga\" is the result of their combined efforts before Ken's ill health brought about his death.

I was raised in Fort Worth, Texas. I graduated from P.L. Dunbar High School in 1997. I've been married to my soul mate, and the love of my life Terrance for many years and we have four beautiful children together, Trish, Terrance Jr., Trinity and Teagan. My family is my life.my world and I couldn't have done any of this without them. I love you all! I've always had a passion for writing but I never thought about actually doing it until a few years ago when I was just sitting around my house with nothing to do after I quit my management position job. I love to read books by different authors like the late E.Lynn Harris, Sista Souljah, and Eric Jerome Dickey, just to name a few. But I wanted the opportunity to tell a story my way... no rules. Just my thoughts pounded out on the keyboard of my laptop. Needless to say, I really loved to escape into the different characters and make them come alive. My style of writing may not be as traditional as you may be use to but I want to express myself freely in my writings. So you may see some words and writing styles that may not be in other books but my goal is to keep you entertained so that you don't get bored while you're reading my work. My story is one that I am very passionate about. It embodies what I want from myself, the freedom, the wealth, the foolishness, and the friendships. I have two sisters and one brother and our childhood was a rough one. We were close but I've always been standoffish so I never let them get too close to me. I love them dearly but I haven't figured out how to let them in completely yet. But I'm hoping I will figure that out with age. I love you guys! Mom and Dad, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you guys, I love you! I love the simple things in life but I want the extravagant things, if that makes sense to you. I hope my stories inspire you and compel you to live life to the fullest, or", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cornerville, Ga., in 1956 has standards of public respectability and resents \"how that trashy bunch of Odumses have opened the old cafe and invaded the neighborhood.\" Thirteen-year-old Sister is just starting to fathom the hostility directed at her family: her mother, Marnie, is prostituting herself at the cafe run by her newest man, Sade Odums, and has all but abandoned her twin boys and baby to Sister's care. When one of the twins, Mickey, runs away and winds up in Alabama, Sade and Marnie refuse to inconvenience themselves enough to bring him home. Sister has to ask seedy church deacon and politician Ray Williams to retrieve her brother, and the man expects sexual favors in exchange. Luckily, Sister's neighbor, housewife Willa Lamar, is there to help. Willa, who represents the stability and security Sister has never known, comes to Sister's aid after the girl's bloody showdown with the treacherous Williams. Throughout, Daugharty sensitively describes the neglected girl's hardscrabble survival skills; Sister carries her pathetically filthy baby sister on barefoot ramblings that take her from the small stores where she wheedles food (primarily candy) for herself and the other children, and back to her family's garbage-strewn yard. Sister is a believable, resilient character, a lonely, confused child who must too soon shoulder adult responsibility. Her loyalty to her mother, and her longing for the days when \"between the other boyfriends and husbands, Sister and Marnie were close\" is at times heartrending, and Sister's struggle to preserve her love for Marnie despite the growing realization that her self-centered mother doesn't \"give a damn\" charges this novel with emotional power.

Most of us strive for moral wisdom throughout our lives but never totally attain it. In this book, James F. Keenan skillfully brings together deep theological knowledge, historical lessons, acute pastoral sensitivity, broad spiritual experiences, and true prudence in proposing moral wisdom for Christian life and spirituality today. (Charles E. Curran, Elizabeth Scurlock University Professor of Human Values at Southern Methodist University and former President of the Catholic Th)Fr. James Keenan is one of those rare contemporary theologians who compellingly weave together rich pastoral experience and masterful intellectual inquiry. To read him is to hear not only the considered wisdom of Catholic moral teaching, but to have the privilege of hearing a learned man struggling to work out his own moral practices. In this book, lay readers and scholars alike can see how Catholic moral tradition informs a life of discernment, love, and everyday courage. (Tom Beaudoin, Santa Clara University, author of Consuming Faith)Father Jim Keenan is one of today's foremost moral theologians.Moral Wisdomreflects his distinctive combination of intellectual mastery of the tradition and sensitivity to today's concerns. He places the older, \"sin-oriented\" approach to moral theology within its proper context in a sapiential tradition of moral reflection, in a way that is at one and the same time intellectually satisfying and pastorally accessible. While this book is intended predominantly for a general audience, it is also rich in insights for professionals in the field. I recommend it highly and look forward to its publication. (Jean Porter, John A. O'Brien Professor of Theology at the University of Notre Dame, author of Natural and Divine Law: Reclaiming the Traditio)Imagine a book that is at once a source of profound wisdom, a systematic presentation of a moral and ethical tradition, and a \"page-turner!\" This is what James Keenan'sMoral Wisdomturns out to be. There is nothing facile about this volume, nothing superficial, nothing manipulative. It weaves together autobiography, the stories of others, interpretation of biblical and theological texts, and a deep understanding of what morality is and what the Roman Catholic tradition of moral theology has been and can be when it is at its best. Few will come away from reading this book without imaginative new hope, salutary appreciation for \"hard sayings,\" new insight into the meaning of divine mercy, and perhaps experiences of both laughter and the \"gift of tears.\" Thought-provoking and informative, opening questions and not shutting them down: here is a significant contribution to ongoing explorations of the moral life. (Margaret A. Farley, Gilbert Stark Professor of Christian Ethics, Yale University Divinity School)This is a lovely book! Keenan probes his own experiences of struggle, suffering and love, interweaving them with biblical reflection and theological analysis. He looks fault and sorrow squarely in the face, yet sustains buoyant notes of hope and commitment. The content of this book is an exercise in the virtue of its title. (Lisa Sowle Cahill, J. Donald Monan Professor of Theology, Boston College)A readable, uncommonly good book that should be required reading for anyone preparing for or engaged in pastoral ministry. (Library Journal)[Keenan's books] read like very good sermons or college lectures by a priest both learned and engaged in the world. By making the Catholic tradition come alive, the books invite moral reflection and struggle. (Theological Studies)James Keenan puts \"flesh and bones\" on the abstractions of moral theory and demonstrates from his own personal experience how the Christian moral life is a pilgrimage of faith, hope and love. Keenan's book will be used widely in college classrooms and seminaries alike. His clarity, honesty and passion ought to be emulated by every moral theologian. (Stephen J. Pope, associate professor of theology, Boston College)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However, his call to the ministry remained the impetus in his life, and in January 1987, with his family of four, Pastor Shorter founded Pacific Christian Center Church. Dr. Shorter received his masters in business administration in 1993, was ordained by Dr. Frederick K. C. Price in 1994, and received his doctorate of ministry in 1999.

Today, under the oversight of Dr. Don and Kathy Shorter, Pacific Christian Center is a worldwide ministry that ministers to thousands each week through speaking engagements, radio and television broadcasts, regular church services, and business seminars.

This was a land that was violent and filled with miners, railroaders, Chinese, Indians, vagrants, criminals of one stripe or another, outlaws, and stern, no-nonsense vigilantes.The fact that Wyoming finally got its act together and became a place of law is no small miracle. But, it was through many good men and women who banded together to make it happen. They were the first to grant women the right to vote in 1869 and the first to elect a female governor in 1925.And so, I bring together in this story some of the rougher elements of this land, together with a beautiful New York socialite whose father is an owner of ships and has interests in railroads and a ranch in Colorado. The main character is totally foreign to her world. The story opens with the main character headed to New York City to court this woman he'd fallen in love with while on a cattle buying trip to her father's Colorado ranch.These two will come to represent the kind of spirit that ultimately prevailed in Wyoming.Enjoy.", "related": ["B00J1IN4B4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has been a Christian since April 2003. While a difficult one, her life journey has given her the ability to understand many types of pain.   She is a former Jehovah’s Witness and grew up with her mother and stepfather, who both served in full-time ministry. She was sexually abused by her stepfather and suffered physical, verbal and emotional abuse at his hand as well.   As a grown woman, she has suffered the aftermath of child abuse. She has been through two divorces and lived in the world of drugs and exotic dancing.   There is redemption however; otherwise this would be a story like millions of others. While her love for Jehovah, as she knew Him, was misguided, the true Lord of the Bible called her as His own.   Since accepting Christ as her Savior, she has been given the dream of being an author. She felt called to write a memoir of all she’d been through and how God saved her. She is co-founding a ministry called Daddy’s Little Girls and believes the book is to be the springboard for public speaking. She believes there are many women who live in hopelessness every day who can find hope in her story. Thus her story is now available to you, the story of He Showed Me Why.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was born in Bombay, in the Bombay Presidency of British India, and was taken by his family to England when he was five years old. Kipling is best known for his works of fiction, including The Jungle Book (a collection of stories which includes \"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\"), Just So Stories (1902), Kim (1901) (a tale of adventure), many short stories, including \"The Man Who Would Be King\" (1888); and his poems, including \"Mandalay\" (1890), \"Gunga Din\" (1890), \"The White Man's Burden\" (1899) and \"If—\" (1910). He is regarded as a major \"innovator in the art of the short story\"; his children's books are enduring classics of children's literature; and his best works are said to exhibit \"a versatile and luminous narrative gift\". Kipling was one of the most popular writers in England, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Henry James said: \"Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius (as distinct from fine intelligence) that I have ever known.\" In 1907 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and to date he remains its youngest recipient. Among other honours, he was sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and on several occasions for a knighthood, all of which he declined. Kipling's subsequent reputation has changed according to the political and social climate of the age and the resulting contrasting views about him continued for much of the 20th century. George Orwell called him a \"prophet of British imperialism\". Literary critic Douglas Kerr wrote: \"He [Kipling] is still an author who can inspire passionate disagreement and his place in literary and cultural history is far from settled. But as the age of the European empires recedes, he is recognised as an incomparable, if controversial, interpreter of how empire was experienced. That, and an increasing recognition of his extraordinary narrative gifts, make him a force to be reckoned with.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I really think if I were\nto compare this author's writings to anyone's, it would have to be Patterson.\nIn some ways, this was a better book than any of Patterson's books. It was easy\nto like the characters you were supposed to like and hate the others. They were\nfully developed and you could almost feel their joys and pains. The book starts\nfast and furious and never stops though it does slow down a bit at times.I looked for other books by this author but there is only one other novel, a\nfantasy. Generally I don't like that type of book, but considering how much I\nliked this one, I may give that one a read as well. I hope he writes other\nbooks like this one soon.Review by: Megan Norman on April 27, 2012 : 4/5 Stars I always listen to books on tape while I am driving to work and usually it\nis some type of cop book or murder mystery, so when I got a Kindle for my\nbirthday, I was glad that my husband also bought me three Kindle books. I am\nespecially glad he bought (free actually) Last Killer Standing. I must say that\nthe plot twist at the end is one the most unusual I have read. I figured out\nearly on who the primary killer was, but the ultimate conclusion was a\nsurprise. Coburn handled that surprise with skill and a little bit of humor\nthrown in for good measure. Naturally the bad guy was thoroughly unlikable and\nhis character and the rest of the characters were well developed.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Chevy  Chase for his good-natured goofiness? Gene Hackman for his looks and no-nonsense  edge? Woody Allen for his innately sardonic Jewish New-Yorkness? Sounds like a  crazy amalgam, but Bergman (a film director, screenwriter, and playwright) makes  it work, and makes it work well. LeVine himself is a drolly pragmatic character;  Bergman's dialogue and settings capture the essence of the era without ever  stumbling into clichéd kitsch; and the novel's set pieces and pacing  sparkle with admittedly cinematic verve.And the plot itself is right out of the movies: The Case of the Missing Maestro. When Fritz Stern, second violinist with the NBC Symphony, walks into LeVine's office, declares that the great conductor Arturo Toscanini has been kidnapped and that the symphony is being led by an impostor, and asks LeVine to investigate, the PI is inclined to think his client is a few noodles short of a kugel. But LeVine is a sucker for sincerity and beautiful daughters, and Stern has both. When the violinist is found dead shortly thereafter, guilt and vengeance enter the motivational mix.At NBC's urging (is it LeVine's imagination or do those corporate execs have something to hide?), LeVine, hot on Toscanini's trail, heads for Havana, where he finds not the maestro but the mob. Just what is Barbara, Stern's aforementioned daughter, doing with organized crime icon Meyer Lansky? In the process of finding out, LeVine is \"injected with enough high- octane opiates to scramble a hippo's consciousness\" and shipped off to the  middle of a Nevada desert. Newly bustling Las Vegas is a place where people arrive with heads full of dreams and leave with pockets full of nothing. It's up  to LeVine to figure out how corporate greed, a gifted Italian musician, and mob visions of grandeur all come together against this neon-lit backdrop,  and if he can do it without taking a detour to the morgue, he'll be a happy man.Almost 25 years have elapsed between LeVine's last appearance and this cross-country caper, but I'm betting that newly smitten fans won't want to wait that long again for an encore. \"I'm sorry, Mr. Spielberg, but Mr. Bergman isn't taking any calls. He's working on his next LeVine novel.\"  We can hope, can't we?--Kelly Flynn", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sometimes I\nthink that there is a ten-year-old kid trapped inside of me whose ready to jump\nout and fling a ball around with the first person he sees. That kid wants to\nplay and laugh. That's why I am \"stuck\" with the nickname\n\"Silly\" Sottile (So-till-ee). And I have written two poetry books for\nkids because my sense of humor finds a waiting home in children's poetry. 101 SECRETS! A BACKPACK\nOF INSPIRATION AND HOPE FOR TWEENS and teens is my legacy to my five\ngrandchildren and all of the kids that I never had a chance to teach.\nFortunately, during my elementary teacher career I did teach many students.\nSome of the stories are contained in this eBook, and touched with humor. HOW\nCAN THIS BOOK HELP YOU AND YOUR KIDS? This self-help guide for tweens, teens,\nand adults offers suggestions, wisdom, and encouraging stories that will\ndeflate the worse fears and habits of preteens. Preteens will learn to deal\nmore effectively with their worries, insecurities, anger, blame, bullies,\nand fear itself.  They will increase their self-esteem, self-confidence,\nand respect for people of all ages.They will discover strategies for making friends, doing better in school,\nlearning how to be happier and more purposeful in life--starting today! This is\na must-read book for preteens, teens, parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents,\nteachers, principals, and all those adults who frequently guide the lives of\nchildren. The 101 secrets are designed to provide inspiration and hope for all tweens by\na teacher of thirty-three years. Joe Sottile taught over 1,000 students, and\nmany of them claim that he was their \"favorite teacher\" because Joe demonstrated\nthese secrets, the power of words, and humor in the classroom every day. Joe\nmisses his days as a teacher, but now he is a children's poet, author, and\nvisiting poet. He loves sharing his love for poetry wherever he is asked to\nvisit. As a retired teacher, that is his mission in life now: to make the world\na better place one poem or poetry performance at a time.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ancient Mereziah, who's devoted his life to servicing the habitat's elevators, decides to hitch a ride on the outside of one of them, hoping to rise to the fabled top of the world before he dies. Tran so Phengh, a fisherman plying his trade on a polluted and retreating lake deep within the artificial world, leaves his dying wife and sets off on a quest to ask important questions of the Gods. Deidre, a pampered young girl who lives on the beautiful pastoral level at the top of the habitat, is wrenched away from her family by monstrous angels. Eventually, each learns some small part of the secret behind their claustrophobic artificial world and its impending collapse, though the tale ends abruptly, with no real resolution and little hope. With well-developed characters and four strong plotlines told through alternating chapters, Hayward delivers a fulfilling read.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rejected from Yale and feeling like a disappointment to his parents, the Front isn't the place Gilroy wants to redeem himself, but he doesn’t have a choice. Unlike many war narratives, heroic deeds do not provide the drama, or the heart, here. Instead,Privatetakes the reader to that intimate place where death, where evil, is not so remote--where you can feel its nearness, but at the same time feel (almost) numb. How else would Gilroy be able to endure seeing \"skeleton figures, naked, a pile of dead, six and seven bodies high, that stretches fifty yards,\" and not go mad? Our \"hero\" notes that he has come upon this horrific scene after traveling miles through picturesque countryside. It is a sunny day, but, he asks: \"How can it be a sunny day?\" Gilroy does not shy away from the brutal or bawdy, but it is these kinds of quiet, canny observations that givePrivateits soul, and its power.--Erin Kodicek", "related": ["B0078XH8XE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Train was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His father was politician and lawyer Charles Russell Train and his mother, Sara Maria Cheney. Train graduated BA from Harvard University in 1896 and LLB from Harvard Law School in 1899. In 1897, Train married Ethel Kissam and they had four children. Ethel died in 1923 and Train married Helen Coster Gerard with whom he had one child. In January 1901, Train became assistant in the office of the New York District Attorney and in 1904 he started his literary career with the publication of the short story The Maximilian Diamond in Leslie's Monthly. He spent the next decade running the two careers in parallel. From 1915 to 1922, Train was in private practice as a lawyer with Charles Albert Perkins while continuing to write, not just novels but advertising copy, vaudeville sketch comedy, poetry and journalism.  In 1919, he created the popular character of Mr. Ephraim Tutt, a wiley old lawyer who supported the common man and always had a trick up his sleeve to right the law's injustices. He also coauthored two science fiction novels with eminent physicist Robert W. Wood. After 1922, Train devoted himself to writing. This book of Train's is published by Magic Lamp Press, who also publish the Peter Sharp Legal Mystery Series, all available on Amazon.com through the main website at www.legalmystery.com", "related": ["B008I6330M"], "rank": 47179, "title": "Courts and Criminals", "author": "Arthur Cheney Train", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Forced from their town by the Germans in 1941, Philip and his family, along with thousands of other Jews, were deported into the Pruzhany ghetto.They were transported to Auschwitz in the winter of 1942. Philip's parents, brothers, and sisters were put to death in the gas chambers. Philip and two remaining brother were selected for slave labour. From Auschwitz-Birkenau, Philip was sent to Sachsenhausen, Oranienburg, Dachau, and finally Landsberg. Liberated by the American Seventh Army in 1945, after crossing the Tyrolean Alps on a death march, Philip was the only member of his family to survive.Philip sought to leave Europe and start a new life in North America. Only Newfoundland, an independent country at that time, was quick to respond in Philip's favour. In 1946 Philip began his new life as a door-to-door peddler in his new country. Visiting Montreal, Philip met and subsequently married Dorothy Smilestein, who joined him in St. John's. Their two sons are both graduates of Memorial University. In Newfoundland, Philip owned a wholesale dry goods business. By the time he left for Halifax in 1979, he had established a successful import trading company.For many years, Philip did not speak about the Holocaust. In 1989, he gave testimony as a survivor for the first time at a school in St. Stephen, New Brunswick. He spoke to silence Holocaust deniers who claimed that the extermination of 6,000,000 Jews by the Germans had either never occurred or was greatly exaggerated. He spoke for those who could not speak.For more than twenty years, Philip has continued to bear witness as a survivor. At schools, churches, universities, legion halls, and business enterprises throughout Canada and the United States, he has shared painful memories and a commitment to a more just society. For his contribution, Philip has been awarded honorary doctorates by Memorial and St. Thomas Universities as well as the Order of Nova Scotia.Mireille Baulu-MacWillie obtained her Ph.D. from the Université de Montréal and dedicated her forty-five-year career to the field of education. In her first twenty-five years, she taught students at all academic levels: primary school, high school, and community college. She also held the administrative position of principal in a public school. She spent the last twenty years of her career at Université Sainte-Anne in Nova Scotia as a professor of education preparing students for the teaching profession. She has written many scholarly articles and two books, some of these in collaboration with colleagues.She has had a lifelong interest in reading about Holocaust survivors and rescuers since the age of thirteen and tried to read every book or document she could find on the subject. She considers that the project of writing Philip Riteman's story has been a great responsibility, an extraordinary privilege, and a profoundly enriching experience. He was the first survivor she had ever met in person. She is grateful that he chose to let her write his story when he had been asked by others over the years to allow them this opportunity. She has developed an undying admiration and respect for Mr. Riteman's determination to survive and the courage to tell his story.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She fantasized about composing such tales, but the writing didn’t begin until 1990, when a college professor encouraged her to try writing as a way to grieve over her mother’s death. A Stephen King fan, she began with horror fiction, and it enabled her to turn over her grief. Most of her protagonists grieve over deceased parents. Her horror and science fiction short stories have appeared in numerous small press magazines. She later moved on to science fiction and dark fantasy novels to appeal to a wider audience. Night to Dawn published some of her work before the former editor retired. She’s been editing the magazine since 2004. Her first novel, Twilight Healer, has gone through three printings. Author Tom Johnson collaborated with Barbara on an anthology, Blood Moons and Nightscapes. The anthology ran for three years. Last year, Tom and Barbara collaborated on Alien Worlds and Starship Invasions, also short stories collections. By the end of this year, she plans to release Steel Rose, a book featuring a young woman whose search for a cure leads her to a romance with a Kryszka alien and a battle against zombies.  In most of her tales, Barbara brings her background as a respiratory therapist to the printed page, blending it with supernatural horror. With “Death’s Dividend” and “One Last Favor,” the political elephant appears in the room that is the health care crisis. Her medical training provided the technology and grist for the written pages in these tales. Alas, she fears that the political elephant will turn into the monster it becomes in these stories if Congress doesn’t address it now. In 2008, she began publishing books through the Night to Dawn imprint. Novels by Tom Johnson, Neil Benson, Rod Marsden, and others have gone to print through NTD and many of them enjoyed four-star reviews or better on Amazon. Tom followed up his share of the tales with Pulp Echoes, an anthology of pulp tales, and Cold War Heroes, which details the day to day life of a soldier. Barbara’s on Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, and The Writers Coffeehouse forums. Look for the photos with all the Mylar balloons, and you will find her.  Barbara lives in Pennsylvania. When she’s not working on my projects, she’s shopping for Mylar balloons or enjoying a great fright flick.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Our heroine, Emer, has been kidnapped from her island home, Pabaigh, by Viking raiders. In the Dublin slave market, she is purchased by the \"silver-gilt\"-haired Flane Kentilsson, and is immediately torn between \"terror and fascination\" as he takes her to his settlement in the West Highlands to be his \"bed slave\". It's not a case of will they fall in love, but when, and what are they to do, because Flane is already promised to the beautiful, spoilt Katla, only daughter of the chieftain of the settlement - and of course, will Emer ever see her beloved Pabaigh and her family again? Flane and Emer frequently come across as rather too 21st-century. She is as accommodating of his pagan faith as he is of her Christianity, and the portrayal of life in the Viking community veers towards the rose-tinted. However, this story has plenty of sexy romance, a bickering, bantering hero and heroine, a hissable villain, an orphan boy (with an appealing dog!) and beautiful scenery. Just the thing for a cold winter evening! --The Historical Novels Review, February 2009  Ever since Tony Curtis's hawk ripped out Kirk Douglas's eye, and the beefcake from the Bronx subsequently had his hand chopped off in one of the finest films of the 1950s, the Vikings have had a reputation for being a bit on the violent side. Tynedale itself suffered the depredations of the men in the longships, who burned, raped and pillaged their way across the district 1,000 years ago. But in her new book, Prudhoe author Jen Black paints a different picture of the sea wolves from Scandinavia. Far After Gold tells the tale of Emer, a princess from the Hebrides, who is kidnapped from her island home, and turns up in the slave markets of Dublin. There she is purchased by Flane, a Greek god of a Viking, who buys her as a bed slave, much to the chagrin of his spiteful bride-to-be Katla. Given the Vikings' penchant for chopping off their womenfolk's pigtails with flying battleaxes while drunkenly munching on a chicken, Flane turns out to be a bit of softie where women are concerned. He tortures himself into a lather of indecision over whether to do the right thing by the woman he is engaged to, who also happens to be the chieftain's daughter, or whether to make an honest woman of the beautiful slave. Although it's more Mills and Boon than murder and mayhem, and stretches credulity tauter than Flane's rippling torso, it's a book well worth buying. Jen gets a bit fruity at times, but it's all in the best possible taste, and anyone who can introduce characters with names like Snorri Longnose and Skuli Grey Cloak gets my vote. All the ingredients are stirred in for a rattling good romantic read - an orphan boy and his dog, a lascivious lecher, a whipping, a sword fight and a happy ending. What more could a reader want? --Hexham Courant, 2 January 2009  This is a heart-warming romance set in the Hebrides at a time when the ancient Norse religion was being eclipsed by Christianity. Two sets of values, sometimes similar, often contradictory, fight to win men's hearts and minds, much as the hero and heroine struggle towards mutual understanding in the course of the novel. Jen Black is a writer to watch. Her turn of phrase can be most evocative, and she uses it to best advantage to create a strong sense of place. This is not a romance set in a blank nowhere where the characters are forced to act out their dramas on a stage bare of everything save the most basic of props. In Far After Gold the setting is lovingly described and it lends richness and texture to Emer and Flane's story. There is the odd minor stumble with anachronism, where the choice of vocabulary might be more rigorous, but word choice is a very personal matter and this in no way impedes the flow of the story. Jen Black knows how to use drama to help with narrative drive, and the conflict between the hero and heroine is kept clear at all times. ... Far After Gold is an evocative novel, the characters are appealing and they develop convincingly during the course of the story. I enjoyed very much. --Carol Townend, award-winning author of the Wessex Weddings Series  In Far After Gold, Jen Black brings history to vivid and passionate life. The book gripped me from the very first page and drew me in. The writing is lovely, fluent, powerful and evocative. The exploration of the clash between the Viking and early Christian cultures adds layers to the conflict. But it is the characters and their love story that compels the reader's attention. Emer is a wonderful heroine, sympathetic and engaging. Even when she is in desperate straits she displays dignity, strength and generosity of spirit. She draws others to her through her kindness and warmth. Flane is a hero to match her, courageous and strong. The chemistry between them is scorching hot and the love story both seductive and tender. Watching these two characters change and grow throughout the book is a delight. Well-drawn secondary characters also add depth and charm to a compelling love story. This book lived on in my imagination long after I had finished it. --Nicola Cornick, bestselling romantic novelist", "related": ["B00IA9TY4Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.5, "rating_total": 21.0}

The back-story of people in this process was fascinating to me. Humor spiced the history. The strategies were as intriguing as a good detective story.This is a story that you didn't have to be there to re-live. As ND Contributing Editor of Norwegian American Weekly, first person stories by those, like Dr. Eelkema, that detail history with the faces of those that made it happen are my favorite.I enjoyed it immensely and recommend it to others. --DR. LARRIE WANBERG, Curator, Dakota Heritage InstituteThis book recounts the leadership of Dr. Eelkema in responding to two serious health care needs of the time: The shortage of primary health care workers and the so-called maldistribution of the health care services.

His father was a Methodist minister and his grandfather, a Professor of Agriculture. David, however, began his career with a degree in Agriculture at Durham University, England. With a newly acquired  farm in Scotland, David was surprised when God intervened and led him to become a Christian minister. After completing an MA in Theology at Cambridge University, David became a chaplain in the Royal Air Force for three years. He then moved on to pastor a number of churches in England including the Millmead Centre in Guildford where under David’s caring leadership, the church became a model for many UK church pastors. His time at Millmead was also his most fruitful in terms  of the library of his audio teachings. In 1979 David was released from the Millmead Centre to fulﬁll a wider international ministry. David now has an itinerant ministry predominantly to church leaders world wide. Millions of copies of his audio Bible teachings have been distributed to  over 120 countries. He is a writer and speaker of urgency, clarity and uncompromising faithfulness to the Scriptures. He is widely considered to be  one of the world’s ﬁnest biblical expositors.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At all times of the day and night you would find her on the back porch penning her first work, which she would continue to write for the next 22 years.  In 2007 – after marriage, filling her chronic entrepreneurial needs, and having five children – Bernadette began to write seriously with the goal of being published.  That year she wrote 12 books.  In 2009  she was contracted for her first trilogy and the published author was born.  In 2011 she (being the entrepreneur that she is) opened her own publishing house, 5 Prince Publishing, and has released contemporary titles and began the process of taking on other authors in other genres.  In 2012 Bernadette Marie found herself on the bestsellers lists of iTunes and Amazon to name a few.  Her office wall is lined with colorful PostIt notes with the titles of books she will be releasing in the very near future, with hope that they too will grace the bestsellers lists. Bernadette spends most of her free time driving her kids to their many events.  She is also an accomplished martial artist who will earn her conditional second degree black belt in Tang Soo Do in October 2012.  An avid reader, she enjoys most, the works of Nora Roberts, Karen White, Megan Hart, and Carmen DeSousa to name a few.

Everything's where we'd hoped and planned for it to be, right on schedule. Other than taking your immunotoxin every day, there's nothing more you have to do.\"Miranda blinked, overwhelmed by the news. \"I'm…I don't know what to say.\" Was there a rule of etiquette in this situation? Thank you, Doctor? I love you?\"You don't have to say anything. I think you'll find getting better is a lot easier than being sick.\" He grinned. \"Go. Grow your hair. Come back in three months and tell me you feel like a million bucks.\"He left her alone, the heavy door of the exam room closing with a sigh. Miranda went through the motions of getting dressed, all the while mulling over her conversation with the doctor.You're done.I'm done.Stick a fork in her, she's done.After a year of this, Miranda didn't believe you could ever really be done with cancer. It could be done with you, though, as you lay on the medical examiner's table like a waxy victim in a crime show.Snap out of it, she told herself. For once, the doctor's advice didn't make her skin crawl—no precautions about nausea meds and gels and post-op limitations. Nothing like that. His advice was so simple it was scary. Get dressed and get on with your life.She tore off the crinkly paper smock and wadded it up, crunching it into a small, tight ball between the palms of her hands and then making a rim shot to the wastebasket. Take that.As she reached up to pull her bra off a hook, a familiar, unpleasant twinge shot up her right arm. The post-op sensations never seemed to end, although her doctor and surgeon assured her the tingling and numbness would eventually go away.Which was—as of a few minutes ago—over.She told herself she ought to be laughing aloud, singing \"I Will Survive\" at the top of her lungs, dancing down the corridors of the clinic and kissing everyone she passed. Unfortunately, that was the last thing she felt like doing. Maybe the news hadn't quite sunk in, because at the moment, she simply felt hollow and exhausted, like a shipwreck victim who'd had to swim ashore. She was alive, but the fight for survival had taken everything from her. It had changed her from the inside out, and this new woman, this gritty survivor, didn't quite know what to make of herself.She turned to face the mirror,studying a body that didn't feel like her own anymore. A year ago, she'd been a reasonably attractive thirty-eight-year-old, comfortable in her size-10 body and—all right, she might as well admit it—downright vain about her long, auburn hair. During the months of treatment, however, she had learned to avoid mirrors. Despite the earnest reassurances of her friends, family, treatment team and support group, she never did learn to love what she saw there.Some would say she'd lost her right breast and all her hair, but Miranda considered the term lost to be a misnomer. She knew exactly where her hair had gone—all over the bed pillows, down the drain of the shower, in the teeth of her comb, all over the car and the sofa. Shedding hair had followed in her wake wherever she went. Her husband, Jacob, had actually woken up one day with strands of her wavy auburn hair in his mouth. Over the course of a few days, her scalp had started to tingle. Then it stung and all her hair had come out and it wasn't lost at all. It had simply become detached from her. She collected it in a Nordstrom's bag and put it in the trash.As for the other thing she'd \"lost\"—her breast—well, she knew darn well where that had gone, too. During the surgery, the tissue had been ever so carefully bagged and tagged and sent to the hospital pathology lab for analysis. Her diagnosis was made by someone she'd never met, someone she would never know. Someone who had typed her fate onto a neat form: infiltrating ductal carcinoma, stage one, tumor size 1.5 cm, nodes 15 negative.She was considered lucky because she was a candidate for TRAM flap breast reconstruction, which took place immediately following her mastectomy. A separate surgical team came in and created a new breast, using tissue from her stomach. She'd struggled to be matter-of-fact about her reconstructed breast, figuring that if she didn't make a big deal of it, then it wouldn't be a big deal. Even though her counselor and support group encouraged her to acknowledge that an important, defining part of her was gone, that her body was permanently altered, she had resisted. She claimed she hadn't been that enamored of her breasts in the first place. They simply…were there. Size 34B. And after surgery, they still were, only the right one had been created with body fat from her stomach, something she didn't exactly mind losing. And the tattooed-on nipple was something of a novelty. How many women could boast about that?Miranda knew she should be weeping with relief and gratitude just about now, but she still didn't like looking at herself in the mirror. The reconstructed breast seemed slightly offkilter, and although the skin tone and temperature were exactly the same as her other breast, she couldn't feel a thing there. Nothing,nada. And her belly button was pulled a bit to one side.According to the members of her support group, she was supposed to look in the mirror and see a survivor. A phenomenal woman whose beauty shone from within. A woman who was glad to be alive.Miranda leaned forward, looked carefully. Where was that woman?Still in hiding, she thought. Her gorgeous self didn't want to come out to play.After an agony of baldness, she was getting her hair back. Her brows and eyelashes. Unfortunately, the fledgling fuzz of hair on her head was just plain weird. She had a terrible feeling that it was coming in whitish gray. But it was her real actual hair, growing in strangely soft and baby fine, as though she had just hatched from an egg. Her skin was sallow, and new lines fanned outward from the corners of her eyes. The whites of her eyes were yellow. She still hid beneath hats, scarves and wigs. She didn't like looking like a cancer patient even though that was exactly what she was. Correction, she told herself. Cancer survivor, no longer a patient.She turned away, grabbed her bra and finished dressing, pulling on her khaki twill pants and a front-button shirt. She disliked the twinges she felt whenever she pulled a shirt over her head. It was as though her body kept wanting to remind her that she'd been nipped, tucked and rearranged, and there wasn't a darn thing she could do about it. She slung her butter-yellow sweater around her shoulders and loosely tied it by the sleeves, knowing the morning chill would be gone by now. With a deliberate tug, she put on her hat. Today's accessory was a sun hat made of cotton duck, which she'd chosen for comfort rather than style.She finished putting herself together—handbag, cell phone, keys—and walked through the now-familiar putty-colored hallway of the clinic.There was soothing Native American–style artwork on the walls and soothing New Age music drifting from speakers in the ceiling. As usual, everyone here was busy, hurrying somewhere with a chart or heading into one of the exam rooms. And as usual, everyone she passed offered a distracted but sincere smile of encouragement.The waiting room was a different story. There, patients seemed almost furtive as they studied magazines or checked the inboxes of their BlackBerries. It was almost as if they didn't want to make eye contact for fear of seeing something they shouldn't—hope or despair or some combination of both—in the eyes of another patient.Miranda realized none of the people in the waiting room could know she was leaving the place for good. She wouldn't be back for three whole months, and then only for a checkup. Still, she felt an odd flicker of survivor guilt as she passed through the room, past the burbling tabletop fountain, the aspidistra plant that had doubled in size since she'd been coming here, the magazine rack, for the last time.She stepped out into the dazzling sunshine of an Indian summer afternoon. For a moment it was so bright Miranda felt disoriented, as if she had lost her bearings. Then she blinked, dug out her sunglasses and put them on. The world came into view. Seattle in September was a place of matchless beauty, a time of warm, golden days, incredibly clear skies and crisp nights that held the snap of autumn in the air. Today had been graced with the kind of weather that made normally industrious people sit out on the patios of urban cafés, sipping granitas and tilting their faces up to the sun.From the hospital on First Hill—also known as Pill Hill, thanks to the abundance of hospitals and medical centers in the area—she could look toward the waterfront and see the bustle of downtown, with its disorganized tangle of freeways and the distinctive spike of the Space Needle rising above Elliott Bay. Farther in the distance lay Seattle's signature defining view— deep blue Puget Sound lined by evergreen-clad islands and inlets, the horizon edged by mountains that appeared to be topped with blue-white whipped cream. It didn't matter whether you'd been born here—as Miranda had—or if you were a newcomer, Puget Sound dazzled the eye every time you looked at it.A car horn blasted, causing her to jump back onto the curb. Whoops. She'd been so busy admiring the scenery that she hadn't been paying attention to the signals. She dutifully waited for the little green pedestrian man to tell her when it was safe to move forward. It would be incredibly ironic to survive cancer, only to get squashed by a bakery truck.She hiked half a block t...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His prose is rather dense and formal, however, so he has been overlooked of late. English professor and nature writer Elder sought to rectify that situation by following Marsh's footsteps both in Vermont and Italy, where Marsh served as U.S. ambassador. Elder traveled to Italy with his wife and juxtaposes their modern tale of academic research and appreciation against Marsh's experiences. Elder also mines the words of other early conservationists and traces the link between Marsh's pioneering work and that of others, such as Rachel Carson and Aldo Leopold. Elder's avid appreciation for and analyses of the places Marsh loved reveal the heart of a man who proved that concern for the environment was alive and well under Lincoln.

Mayans!I’m sure you’ll agree, these are all big big things to be happening in my life. The biggest thing that happened lately is that I bought an out of date magazine so you’ll understand that the word ‘big’ was used twice in a row for a reason. That brings me to 2013, and wanting to set myself a challenge.I like a challenge. Who doesn't? Anneka made a career out of them and never saw her breakdown so they must be OK. (Probably kept it for when the cameras were off. Maybe cried into a bag of popcorn. I don’t know, neither do you. Have ‘I’m a Celeb’ got her number?)Anyway, a bit ago my Sports Tracker app reached 100 miles. (I only started running in June 2012 and could run 0.2 miles NON STOP!) “ Wouldn't it be great,” said the voice in my head, “To do 1’000 miles in a year!” “Yes!” Said my mouth (making a customer at work look at me funny) “Yes it would!”Then the voice in my head said “ Wouldn't it be better, if you did 2013 miles in 2013!” (Sometimes the voice in my head is a bit of a knob.)“No!” I said. “That’s too much!”“2013km in 2013 then!” Said the voice.“Yes!” Said I!“Just make it miles!”“OK!”“Tell everyone! Then you can’t back out! And do it for charity so you go from ‘mentallist’ to ‘eccentric’!” So I did. And I can’t. And I am.For you maths geeks, it works out roughly 5.5 miles each and every day for a year, about 40 miles a week. What fun…The PlanTo run/bike/swim a total of at least 2013 miles in 2013 and raise at least £2013 for charity. The charity I've chosen is One In A Million: ’One in a Million is a Bradford-based charity that helps children & young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, providing education through sports, the arts and enterprise.’I’ll be doing a proper race at least once a month of at least 10k and a couple of 1/2 Marathons thrown in for good measure.Wish me luck!Kindle blogs are fully downloaded onto your Kindle so you can read them even when you're not wirelessly connected.

A network of suspicious events is quickly uncovered by Isaiah's energetic, fearless son Howard who, in this brisk and sometimes manic mystery, heads off in all directions to find the killer. Some signs point to the sinister Gemtrex Corporation, a mammoth newspaper chain with ties to the Mafia; Gemtrex has been making serious buyout attempts on The Defender . But other clues point to any number of vengeful local residents, insulted, injured or seduced by Isaiah over the years. Suspicion is even cast on Howard's chronically bickering siblings, all of whom had reasons to despise their strong-willed father. Howard, along with his father's former mistress, Suzanne, and Leroy, the paper's ambitious investigative reporter, spare no one in tracking down every lead--and eventually discover that Isaiah was being blackmailed over an obscure but potentially damaging incident buried in the past. Journalist and first-time novelist Squire pulls out all the stops and unleashes explosions, floods and unbridled passion in crafting a tale that, while leaving some ends loose, is forceful and engrossing.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There are few things as satisfying as sitting down to a homemade meal with those you love.  I am by no means a professional chef, but I would like to think that I'm a good home cook. I especially love to create delicious meals that are easy to prepare and made with a minimum of fuss. I believe that if it takes too long to prepare, then it better be worth it! My interest in cooking came to me while I was working as a waitress in a small local café. I loved everything about it ... the amazing smells of simmering soup and freshly baked bread, the spicy aroma of a healthy bowl of gumbo, and the melt in your mouth goodness of an apple pie that just came out of the oven. The art of baking and cooking captivated my soul. My Incurable \"Disease\" But my newly found love for cooking came at a cost. I have developed a severe (but non-life-threatening) disease called \"Low-Resistance-to-Yummy-Recipes-Syndrome\" (a.k.a Cookbookitis). One of the symptoms of this disease is the complete inability to resist collecting cookbooks, magazines with recipes, even those little brand name mini-cookbooks positioned oh-so-temptingly next to grocery store checkout lanes. For years I tried to get around this by doing most of my major grocery shopping at Costco. But guess what? Costco started selling cookbooks and now my collection continues to grow. I'm slightly embarrassed to say that I have at least 500, maybe more, cookbooks (now I did say it's a disease!). I am going to try to inventory my collection of cookbooks soon. I'll let you know how many I have when I finally catalogue and classify all of them. With soooooo many cookbooks, I am always trying to find the best foods to feed my family. I am passionate about only serving my family meals that will strengthen, grow, and energize them. I have been reading my many cookbooks and started thinking about creating my own cookbooks and sharing my many creations with other avid home cooks. There is always so much to learn! You will notice that I try to keep my cooking style clean and simple. I know that the more simple I keep it, the more likely I'm going to succeed in consistently preparing beautiful and tasty meals. It's been a journey of learning and experimenting in the kitchen, but one that I've greatly enjoyed. I hope that my cookbooks will help you in your journey as well!", "related": ["B00LT8DB5S"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 18, "rating_average": 4.3889, "rating_total": 79.0}

The oil companies will usually do what is in their best interest, unless they are forced to consider the dealer s best interest, (and that s when I usually get involved.) Attorneys are the great equalizer when it comes to fighting big oil companies, and it is only getting worse. Dave s experiences at his location are pretty typical for a gas station dealer, and some of those stories he tells are pretty hilarious. This is a very entertaining and educational book that is a quick and enjoyable read. --Thomas P. Bleau, Attorney & Partner at Bleau Fox, a Prof. Law Corp.When I started reading this book, I was immediately taken back to when I opened my first gas station in 1974. My fuel supply was cut off by Exxon, and I was quickly surrounded by angry motorists who did not believe the oil company s reasons for the gas lines that were airing on the nightly news. Dave discusses a very accurate account of the life of a gas station dealer, especially the oil companies attempts at fixing prices, rest room problems and nearly every other aspect of being a dealer. You will learn much from this enjoyable book, whether you lived through it, or are hearing these stories for the very first time. But this time you ll be viewing them through the eyes of the person on the other side of the counter. --Tim Hamilton, Petroleum Industry Consultant/Exec. Dir.

I had the story of the main characters in my head, but I needed research of all mythologies to find the truth of what really happened before the flood. I'll admit it first, my faith was tested heavily, but for every dead end I came to, I was always lead to the truth. As I continued my research I found myself closer to God and understanding more and more that these 100 years or so on Earth are nothing, compared to where you stay for eternity. I truly believe the dream that lead me to this book was a gift from God. I mean this dream really haunted me until I finally figured out what it meant.....and I didn't find out what it meant until I wrote this book! Crazy right? This book will show you so many things all at once. For example,, have you ever thought about the Ipod's logo? Or have you ever thought about anything made by apple? Why is it an apple? This apple would have been fine if it were just an apple, but it's got a bite taken out. Well that's a symbol of the first sin and that sin gave Adam and Eve knowledge of evil. Look at the Ipod, you are wide opened to evil all over the internet,,so why did they decide to go with apple? Weird isn't it?  Ironic actually... How about the beast of revelations? You know, the guy who is going to rule the world in the end times. I always loved this song that talked about Jesus saying the one was and is and yet to come, well the bible says the same thing about the beast except it says he isnt now... meaning the one who was, IS NOT and will be. So if the beast is he who was, wouldn't he had been the one who is, while he was alive? Yeah I found the word that means he who is in Egyptian mythology. Lots of secrets going on in this world that revolves around this guy and my books will reveal them all!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dickens began to diligently study the law and went back to college, building up his degree, and read everything he could possibly find on the subject of credit, thus obtaining excellent credit. He has taken several business and finance classes. This allowed him to find the little-known provisions and loopholes in the laws. Armed with this newly gained wealth of information and knowledge, he has helped himself and many others get their life back on track, stop the debt collectors, regain their financial freedom, and improve their overall creditworthiness.

There is no dialogue between characters. It is not the traditional format for a science fiction novel, but it does add a unique dimension to the story, bringing the reader closer to the main character as the actions and events unfold. The AMP series is also first person, but it follows the popular format with character dialogue.

After dropping out of two problematic boarding schools, Win is now enrolled in his third, Hale, in northeastern Pennsylvania, thanks to a scholarship from Dark Oil & Gas, which runs a fracking operation beneath Hale’s campus, with its stunted vegetation. When his renegade roommate is unfairly expelled for collecting polluted frackwater, Win becomes determined to publicize fracking’s dangers by winning a Scrabble tournament in which first prize includes meeting the governor. Browning’s clever and engaging debut, with its young Scrabble champion turned unlikely environmental advocate and timely ecological theme, is a funny and thought-provoking tale. —Carl Hays", "related": ["B00G4LJEW4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 18, "rating_average": 3.3889, "rating_total": 61.0}

Luce’s pathological need to invent and reinvent herself, her restless, acquisitive drive to conquer new worlds and her cascading calamities end up providing plenty of vivid material.”—Maureen Dowd,The New York Times Book Review “Price of Famebegins seductively (how else?) in 1943, as Luce, the newly elected Republican congresswoman from Connecticut, arrives in Washington, with her battable eyes, sharp elbows and all. . . . The book is rich with detail [and] includes an evisceratingly funny account from C. L. Sulzberger, then the chief foreign correspondent ofThe New York Times,on what an evening chez Ambassador Luce was like. . . . Long and detailed, it captures her professional manner as well as anything else in this book does, starting with how her carefully maintained exterior conceals ‘the most arrogant conceit and the most ruthlessly hard-boiled self-assurance it has ever been my privilege to come up against.’ . . . This full, warts-and-all biography hauls [Luce] back into the limelight and does her full justice.”—Janet Maslin,The New York Times“Vivid . . . There’s a thrilling kind of energy in watching this ruthlessly self-made life take shape, an energy that is matched and reversed inPrice of Fame,as celebrity just as ruthlessly takes its toll. . . . The biography offers a detailed picture of the evolution of U.S. politics and culture from World War II into the Reagan era. . . . In a culture where the rage for fame feels inescapable, [Price of Fame] might just help us to weigh its costs more accurately and count the blessings of obscurity.”—The Washington Post“Exhaustively detailed (and well-written) . . . In her youth, Clare Boothe Luce was a Depression-era Carrie Bradshaw, a go-getting, sexually freewheeling quipster who reveled in the hustle and bustle of Manhattan; by World War II, she had degenerated into a modern-day Cersei Lannister, entitled, power-hungry and morally hypocritical. This sea change is one of the more memorable aspects ofPrice of Fame. . . . Morris chose her title well. Clare paid a heavy price for her fame. Whether she lost her soul after gaining the world, undoubtedly she suffered amid the splendor.”—The Miami Herald“Price of Famecontinues the second half of [Clare Booth Luce’s] amazing story, clearly capturing the successes and pathos of a narcissist infused with shame and self-hate. . . . A running theme throughout Clare’s life is her shimmering sexuality—a lethal cocktail of luminosity, charm, intelligence and wit. . . . It is the author’s steady, sensitive handling of the material, told with humor and objectivity, that makes this biography so poignant and profound. The author’s skill at delving deep into sources was eventually rewarded by Clare herself, who confessed she felt closest to Ms. Morris ‘because you know everything.’ However, it is the late Librarian of Congress, Daniel Boorstin, who said it best: ‘How often does it happen,’ he asked, ‘this coming together of a great subject and an ideal biographer?’ That observation beautifully applies toPrice of Fame,and it is nothing short of a triumph.”—The Washington Times“Moving . . . Beauty was an asset Clare Boothe Luce used to her political (and financial) advantage. But so, too, were the other characteristics summed up by Sylvia Jukes Morris in this second and final part of her exhaustive biography of one of the most remarkable women of twentieth-century America: ‘charm, humour, coquetry, intellect, ambition.’ . . . [Morris] had unparalleled access to her subject before Luce’s death in 1987 and to her papers (all 460,000 of them) in the Library of Congress. The result is a portrait of a woman gifted with intelligence and drive, but marred by narcissism and scarred by a constant sense of loneliness.”—The Economist“Compelling . . . [a] brilliant biography . . . After finishingPrice of Fame: The Honorable Clare Boothe Luce,few readers will find a term as dull as ‘The Honorable’ to be befitting so spirited a personage. ‘The Beguiling’ or ‘The Buoyant’ would be more like it—or maybe, for the woman who negotiated both the boards of Broadway and political office, ‘The Groundbreaking.’”—The Christian Science Monitor “Raised by her mother to manipulate men and compete with women, Luce was fundamentally cold. Lovers were chosen for their looks or status; admirers were welcomed so long as they remained entirely admiring. . . . Narcissism, the need for an audience, and a willingness to use people are hardly uncommon traits in politicians, and it’s to Luce’s credit that she had enough empathy for others to be a staunch, early advocate of independence for European colonies abroad and full civil rights for African-Americans at home, positions not generally held by those who shared her hardline anticommunist views. . . . Morris’s cool portrait is eminently fair, depicting Luce’s faults and fine points with equal detachment.”—The Daily Beast“Morris’s shrewd portrait shows a woman of extraordinary contrasts: a celebrated beauty and wit who inspired giddy love letters from generals; a sharp thinker and writer. . . . Morris, who once lived with Luce and had access to her diaries, evokes her subject’s charisma without unduly succumbing to it; she presents a clear-eyed assessment of Luce’s strong, egotistical personality that does full justice to this fascinating icon.”—Publishers Weekly “Sylvia Juke Morris’s epicPrice of Fameis a thrilling account of one of the twentieth century’s most intriguing and ambitious society figures. This second installment is every bit as compelling as the first. The life of Clare Boothe Luce illuminates the complex forces and fierce crosswinds behind the rise of the modern American woman.”—Dr. Amanda Foreman, bestselling author ofGeorgiana: Duchess of DevonshireandA World on Fire “By the time she was 40, Clare Boothe Luce (1903–1987) had been an actress, Broadway playwright, war correspondent, managing editor ofVanity Fairand Republican congresswoman from Connecticut. . . . Blonde, beautiful and glamorous (Morris includes details about Luce’s sumptuous wardrobe at every occasion), she took many lovers, with a special preference for men in uniform. . . . Desperately, she needed to be the center of attention. . . . Morris perceptively reveals the nightmare in this evenhanded and intimate portrait.”—Kirkus Reviews", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Enter the cast: our narrator/heroine whose sister's death by sleep deprivation powers her own sales pitch to potential donors; a miraculous donor (\"Baby A\") whose pure sleep provides the mother lode of antidotes; and a \"Donor Y\" whose contaminated sleep infects multitudes before it's even detected. Finally, enter a less surprising knot of plot twists powered by typical human self-interest (corruption, the profit motive), and the resulting novella depicts a nightmarish world that, but for the simple addition of its central epidemiology, looks an awful lot like our own.

But I'd go further: this book takes areal panoramic view of the whole subject of baptismand finds many links that I had missed before.In his 16 chapters Dallmann covers specifically 10 different categories of baptism found in the bible. The remaining chapters introduce and link the themes as well as providing summary conclusions and a helpful quick reference biblical chart. Chapter 3 provides four simple questions we need to keep in mind as we explore the subject of baptism across the whole sweep of the Bible: who is doing the baptising, who is being baptised, into what are they being baptized and what is the purpose of this baptism. The answers are sometimes surprising, always illuminating. Dallmann does not do all the work for his readers. Whilst he always provides helpful pointers, he often leaves them to reach their own conclusions.This is a short book but'heavyweight' in its theological content. And yet its a straightforward read and helpful to Believers at whatever stage they have reached in their Christian journey. I highly recommend this book.Peter Sammons, author: \"The Birth of Christ\" (2006).", "related": [], "rank": 2001532, "title": "Baptisms - One? Many?

In 2005 Ayhan launched Ayhan's Menu Plans, a weight loss program based on the healthy Mediterranean Diet. The plan features Ayhan’s restaurant recipes that have been portion controlled by nutritionists and endorsed by doctors. The recipes are delicious, easy, nutritionally balanced and satisfying. A sampling of the weight loss recipes are available in Ayhan’s Shish Kebab restaurants where over 2,400 people have already enjoyed them. Ayhan speaks several languages and every year travels extensively throughout the Mediterranean looking for new products and services to offer to his customers. He resides in Port Washington where he is an active member of the community and where three of his stores are located. In fact, because of his many contributions to his town the mayor dedicated an intersection in his name (“Ayhan’s Corner”).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

William never knew that Elizabeth’s act of charity cost her greatly. Once Cromwell’s men discover that Elizabeth gave aid to one of Charles’ cavaliers, they seize her family’s estates, thus forcing Elizabeth into an unwanted marriage in order to survive. As a widow, Elizabeth arrives in the Merry Monarch’s court hoping to convince the king to restore her lands. William, now Earl Rivers and the court’s official poet, knows he must help his old friend. He knows exactly how to repackage Elizabeth so that she can capture the king’s attention, but what this infamous libertine doesn’t expect is that he will fall in love with his new creation instead. Fueled by sizzling sensuality and sharp wit, James’ refreshingly different historical deftly re-creates the glittering, colorful court of Charles II while also delivering an unforgettable love story. --John Charles", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After getting started on massage, she realized that it's not only about manual therapy. She wanted to expand her services and make them more holistic. She became fascinated with the power of the mind after following coaches like Tony Robbins. Even though she loves being a massage therapist she decided to combine it with coaching and as a result, her very own Holistic Wellness coaching for modern people was born. ''NATURAL THERAPY COACHING FOR BODY AND MIND BALANCE...'' Another ambition that Marta had was to create a global holistic health project- this is why she got involved in writing. She knew that her books could be the best tool to set up her global holistic wellness project so she could spread wellness all over the globe, not only in Barcelona area where she currently lives.
