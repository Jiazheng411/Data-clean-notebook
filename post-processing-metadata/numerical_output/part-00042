Even though Jezer ( The Dark Ages: Life in the United States, 1945-1960 ) clearly respects Hoffman's ability to mobilize dissenters, he does not shirk from challenging Hoffman's attention-getting tactics, often perceived as clownish or macho. Jezer contends that the Jewish Hoffman's upbringing in conservative, largely non-Jewish, working-class Worcester, Mass., taught him to accept people of varied backgrounds and contributed to his energetic support of civil rights. His youth also led him to adopt a \"tough hood\" stance that he never abandoned, and that did not allow him to fully practice nonviolence. Hoffman's formative education in radicalism at Brandeis and Berkeley, his support of antiwar political candidates and his founding of the politicized Yippie movement on Manhattan's Lower East Side are discussed. Anecdotal accounts of demonstrations are here in abundance; much attention is given to \"guerrilla theater,\" police brutality and Hoffman's problems with the law on a cocaine-dealing charge. Little is made of his life outside the political arena, but the manic depression that led him to commit suicide in 1989, at age 53, is shown to have been an ever-present, worsening condition.

Fortunately, a special teacher insisted he write a fictional short story, a two-page tale about something he found interesting. Instantly, TJ became hooked on the fun of writing fiction. Thankfully, he now reads constantly, going from one book to the next, with several in queue waiting their turn. His favorite part of writing is the crafting of a rough draft. A period in the process when the words fly from the storage center deep in his brain like a movie stuck on fast-forward. The agonizing part begins with the painstaking restructuring, as TJ edits one sentence at a time until he is either happy, or exhausted into believing he is happy with his conclusion. His new release is The Raceboys about a national champion forced to come out as a gay driver. Also available is The Will and Stranded. Coming Soon: TJ is currently polishing \"Gay Grifters\" about a handsome young gay man anxious to steal your heart and your wallet, and TJ just finished the rough draft of The Blackfeet Boys.

With its spare lyrics and the moody trumpet playing in the background, Springsteen's song tells the tale of two smalltime losers out for one last try at the brass ring, and provides the inspiration behind the 20 stories found in this imaginative and enjoyable anthology. The 16 readers assembled for this recording are as eclectic as the stories they narrate. Stefan Rudnicki, who also produced the program, brings a feeling of doomed noir to Wallace Stroby's moving \"Lovers in the Cold.\" Maxwell Caufield does an excellent job with Paul Charles's amusing Irish story \"In the Midnight Hour\"; and Harlan Ellison supplies a rich, no-holds-barred reading of Peter David's inspired fantasy, \"Killing Time by the River Styx,\" while Cara Black's \"Mosquito Incense,\" set in Japan, is given just the right sense of melancholia by Moira Quirk. Other notable readers include John Rubinstein, Arte Johnson, Gabrielle de Cuir, Richard Brewer and a most effective Orson Scott Card, reading Jessica Kaye's \"Drink to Long Life.\" From New Jersey to the afterlife, these are 20 rides worth taking.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His father owned a livery stable in Denver in the 1890s, and an uncle had a ranch near Fort Collins. Growing up with horses and spending summers at the ranch, he soon became a cowboy.  By the early years of the Twentieth Century, being a cowboy in Colorado and Wyoming brought exposure to show business in the form of Wild West Shows, rodeos, and horse races. He was involved as a participant, especially steer-roping and horse-racing, and even organized some shows. When the early motion picture companies wanted to make movies with an American flavor, they sent film units to Colorado. In need of someone who could coordinate the local men, materials and animals, they naturally found Harry Gant to be indispensable.  In 1912, he moved to California, and soon became a cameraman, actor and director. Though he had little respect for the kind of stories the writers passed off as \"westerns\", he kept his mouth shut (mostly) and learned the craft.  In the 1920s, it became harder to find work. He turned a dormant interest in geology into a brief career as an oil wildcatter, and tried to interest investors in drilling on the now-famous Signal Hill. He was unable to get all the details arranged in time, and soon others were making millions where he wanted to drill. In 1922 he left California. He spent several years in Colorado, Wyoming, Arkansas, and even one winter in Chicago. Eventually, however, he returned to Hollywood, where he continued to work as cast and crew.  In 1931, he established \"an organization to perpetuate the spirit of days gone by\" and arranged a \"reunion of old time cowpunchers who worked on the open range in the Nineteenth Century.\" This organization came to be called the Chuck Wagon Trailers.  He retired to his ranch in the San Fernando Valley in 1946, where he often hosted reunions of three generations of his descendents. In 1957 he began writing his memoir. He finished it in 1959, but had no success in getting it published. He died in 1967, aged 86. In 2009, his granddaughter and great-grandson published his memoir, adding photographs from his collection. The memoir describes in great detail the life sketched above.  On our website, we have more information about Harry Gant's life, the many people he mentions, his entire collection of pictures, and the mystery of the \"missing chapter\" from his memoir.

Truth is, most first-time mommies-to-be end up with two or three copies of this highly regarded guide to pregnancy, labor, and newborn care. Yet despite all of its helpful information about nutrition, bodily changes, and fetal development, it glosses over vital questions that enter every pregnant woman's mind: \"How should I tell my husband, my family, my boss that I'm expecting?\" and \"Can I park in the handicapped spot?\" or even \"Can I cut in line at the public restroom?\" Author Paula Spencer expertly faces the challenge of answering these and many other serious and comical questions that pop up during pregnancy in this equally smart and entertaining look at etiquette for the new mom--and does so with plenty of sense and sensibility.Spencer focuses on a great variety of touchy situations in chapters that include \"Spreading the News,\" \"Busybodies,\" \"At Work, Birth Ceremonies,\" and \"Life with Baby.\" What can be done about a doctor who constantly keeps the pregnant mom waiting?  Spencer offers four different suggestions, starting with \"Ask why this is the case.\" How can a pregnant mom voice a complaint without being rude (to smokers, for instance)? While Spencer does furnish a nicely worded request, she also suggests the mom simply find \"a more hospitable place to eat with a pleasanter air.\" Along with providing hundreds of thoughtful, reasonable answers to many such questions, she also includes wonderful lists covering do's and don'ts for grandparents, naming traditions from a wide variety of cultures, contemporary baby shower themes, and a thorough chapter of smart gift suggestions.--Liane Thomas", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His discoveries have energized the field, bringing into it many exciting young investigators. The new textbook Genetics Diseases of the Kidney, edited by Lifton, Somlo Giebisch and Seldin, combines the expertise of genetics and physiology in an admirable manner. The chapters cover many practical and theoretical areas: from basic principles of genetic inheritance to detailed analysis of the many newly described syndromes of genetic renal disease. For the general nephrologist or internist there is also a helpful chapter on what is available today in genetic diagnosis - this should aid the clinician in testing and making the appropriate diagnosis. The explosion of recent genetic information had made the general textbooks of genetic medicine quite unwieldy but the publication of this textbook is a welcome addition and fills a real need.

Tooley pens a fascinating young-adult mystery in The Skull, an  installment in her Remy and Roadkill Mystery series. The characters are so  well-rounded that they become like friends we know in depth greater than  usual. Even the secondary characters are well-turned and elicit the  reader's empathy. The plot line reverberates with mystery and suspense,  drawing in threads of social issues such as civil rights, class-ism, and  modern-day gang violence, with psychological echoes of death, grief, and  childhood abandonment. Truly The Skull is an effective mystery novel well  worth reading, suitable for young adults but also enticing to older adults  as well. --Euro-Reviews, April 2007The misfits Remy Bauer and Rob \"Roadkill\" Haislett are an unlikely pair of  sleuths in their small Indiana town.  Each deals with issues like a  parent's death or abandonment.  When Remy buys a monkey's skull at a local  estate sale, she takes it to Rob, who has a reputation as an amateur  taxidermist.  The skull proves to be that of a newborn human baby, and the  search for its identity leads to long-buried secrets and murderous attempts  to cover them up.  A runaway from a nearby Indian reservation, a retired  school teacher and a stalwart sheriff play their part in unraveling the  mystery behind the skull.  Remy and \"Roadkill\" work out a lot of their  issues while they cement their friendship in the thoughtful look at  small-town life.\" --Mystery Scene Magazine, January 2007Tooley weaves the troubles of teens living in the 21st century throughout  in a way that only strengthens the characters and plot. Remy is a child of  divorce, with a seriously deadbeat dad. Roadkill is dealing with the death  of his mother a few years earlier and a father who prides work over time at  home with his son. Andy is a runaway whose parents died when he was a young  child. These characters are real, as are their struggles dealing with  parents and just growing up.What Tooley has started will receive hearty approval from parents who  monitor their tweens and teens reading material - and offer an exciting new  series as clean and mysterious as old standbys Nancy Drew or the Hardy  Boys. --Pop-Syndicate.com, February 2007", "related": ["B00LNLVQ9Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A lovely lady, a fight over cattle grazing rights and claim ownership, Indians, silver, and a struggle for right. The author's weaving of a fine love story into the plot is refreshingly candid since it's told from the man's point of view. It's also surprisingly touching, as men don't often admit to such feelings. A nice touch. Also of interest is his descriptions of the land itself, not to be missed. A complex plot with many characters keeps the reader interested, even through the gunfights. All in all, a really good read. Could almost be a romance.\" Reviewed by Chris J., Network54\"Another great Western by Brian Kelling. The Long Canyon Mountains is Kelling's second western, this one based in New Mexico. Very detailed and complex, for a traditional western. All the usual elements are here: battle for grazing; beautiful woman; gold and silver. But especially satisfying is his inclusion of John J. \"Blackjack\" Pershing as a young officer, and also Elfego Baca -- both historical figures from this era.

While on a summer outing in 1569 with her new ally, Francis Drake, an arrow barely misses Elizabeth, claiming the life of her falconer instead. After another arrow whizzes dangerously between the queen and her herbalist, her royal suspicions of a larger conspiracy solidify. She'll need all her wits and the assistance of her loyal servants to piece out who is the true target of the attacks. While the conceit of Elizabeth herself as an active sleuth requires some suspension of disbelief, readers who buy in will likely find themselves spellbound by the characters, plotting and plausible period detail.

I'm serious, it's tough.  You truly must want to quitto get throughthe hell of quitting.  Even dramatically reducing your smoking to just 5 cigarettes a day can be painful... at first.  Quitting is only hell at first and then it's over.I'm not a doctor and don't claim to be an expert, just someone who has been there and knows. Someone who speaks from experience.  My experience.Cigarettes were more than just some inanimate object to me.  They were my support system and best friend.  It was like a relationship and leaving it forced me to take a good, hard look at myself.  This book is both memoir and manual, complete with smoking activity charts for you to follow my plan or create your own.  The most important thing - as you'll see from my story - is to observe yourself smoking and record those observations.  What you choose to do with the information from your activity chart is up to you... whether it's quitting completely or reducing the amount you smoke.The plan is relatively simple: observe, record, cut, quit.   Good Luck!", "related": [], "rank": 2530945, "title": "The Last Cigarette Quit Strategy", "author": "Cece Serrant", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sally and Robert Zilman, a young married couple, at first seem the only \"normal\" people in the book. Sally's parents, Ervin and Margaret Neal, exist only to torment each other, with Sally in the middle trying to make peace. Robert's parents never forgave him for marrying a gentile, and he fights with them during each annual visit. The plot is almost beside the point here; what's really important are the dynamics of the characters' relationships, and what Naumoff is saying, by extension, about husbands and wives, parents and children. He excels at getting to the core of each character and analyzing why they behave the way they do, from Sally's premarital promiscuity, to Robert's and Ervin's need to believe in her \"purity,\" to Margaret's inability to see that her marriage has shattered. All this could be grim and graceless in another writer's hands, but Naumoff has imbued even the bleakest passages with a sardonic humor, and has, in addition, masterfully evoked the eastern North Carolina setting. Two decades ago, Naumoff won a National Endowment of the Arts Fellowship and other high awards; then he stopped writing for 14 years.

Because Coxtown is only a forty minute drive from The Big Smoke (Dublin, Ireland), it suffers from the overspill of the expanding city. As well as a rapidly growing population, there is an unwelcome growing litany of violence, drug abuse and suicides.Disconcertingly, two of these deaths were of students still attending one of the local schools, a new establishment with its own litany of teething problems. Then two gravediggers disappear and the body of one of them floats down the river nine days later. The second is found in a shallow grave by members of Operation Mule Train, a special hard drugs task force.The school becomes the focus of much activity when Detective Marty Ryan is assigned there as a community officer, saddled also with the task of compiling a report on the recent suicides. Ryan loves the gals and often gets himself into a load of trouble on their account. He cannot resist the school receptionist, a curvaceous blond dolly bird with a lisp, who looks very much out of place. But the surprise she gives Ryan on their night out leads to vital information which has eluded the best efforts of Operation Mule Train.Making sense of the young suicides in the school, sorting out the case of missing student Ann Reid, solving a triple rape, and helping to free Coxtown of the drugs scourge presents Ryan with a mighty challenge. Sussing out the cause of the filthy Valentine cards that plague Greaves Junior and identifying the culprit who stole the penis off the biology model are not easy tasks either.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Connected through social circles in their Toronto neighborhood, they struggle to accept the past while mapping out the future: Josh, a female-to-male transgender works strenuous shifts as a paramedic and tries to erase from his mind the atrocities he witnesses daily; Amy, his ex-girlfriend and an amateur filmmaker, lives off of her wealthy parents; and Billy, a former child pop star, now endures extreme anxiety attacks. As the three become wrapped up in each others’ lives, the emotional roller coaster dips and rises. Haunted by memories of the tragedy of 9/11 and of the rampant fear of a SARS epidemic, which served as the scenery of their youth, this new generation’s members proclaim their true feelings through text messages and drown their excess emotion in booze. A poignant climax seems almost like a dream as the characters drift toward the shattering conclusion. An unforgettable depiction of growing up in the new millennium. --Annie McCormick", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Also headed to England on a visa arranged by Verity through her friend Lord Edward is Georg Dreiser, a young Austrian Jew who claims to have valuable information for the British military. But Georg's asylum proves short-lived when he meets a violent death at Lord Mountbatten's estate, where only a week earlier, Lord Edward and his nephew found the body of an up-and-coming artist.

It still does, and it’s still empty because by the time I had finished outlining I could see there was no way The Ring of Allaire was going to fit in there. My novel about a wizard’s first quest was published in 1981. The Sword of Calandra and The Mountains of Channadran continued Tristan’s saga. (I like to say that my wizard is just like Harry Potter—but Tristan was home-schooled.)

But prolificacy can be a two-edged sword, as this creaky and rough-hewn attempt at a mafia thriller proves. In telling the story of New York accounting firm executive John Carver's battle with the ruling families of American crime, Freemantle creates scenes that feel oddly askew-almost akin to those black-and-white movies about American criminals that British studios produced in the 1950s. There's no shortage of action, and Carver's wife and his mistress-both central to the novel's plot-are sharply delineated. His wife, Jane, the protected daughter of the firm's domineering founder, must slowly come to terms with her father's criminal behavior as well as her husband's infidelity; his mistress, Alice, is a shrewd financial journalist but also a woman with strong mothering instincts. Jane is still reeling from her father's death when the news comes that her husband has been killed, too, in another \"accident\" that smacks of foul play. Alice aids the distraught Jane, and the two become uneasy partners in a world where they can trust no one-not even each other-as the mob closes in and the FBI probe heats up. Their scenes together are always interesting and often credible, but the same can't be said for the unconvincing bad guys.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If you want classic zombie lit with blood and gore and beheadings, then try my story \"The Headhunter.\"The idea for this story came to me one day as I was griping to a fellow writer about all the vampire romance stories being published. Meh. We both joked about a world where zombies didn't just walk among us, but could possibly even be potential love interests. We had a good laugh, a shiver, and went our separate ways.A few days later, as I was mulling this discussion, I wondered what exactly would make a zombie sexy. Certainly not a g-string. But the image stuck with me and became the seed of this story.This is not, however, a zombie romance or a tale of necrophilia (shiver), but a story about a young man (not undead) trying to do what he can to win the affections of the young lady he loves (also not undead). And if his \"competition\" just happens to be the Walking Dead, well, then maybe it's good for a laugh or two. And maybe a few shivers as well.I hope you enjoy reading \"A Thing for Zombies\" as much as I enjoyed writing it.Best,SaulSan Francisco, CASeptember 21, 2011", "related": ["B007Z6KH7S"], "rank": 1498325, "title": "A Thing for Zombies: A Tale of Young Love and Zombies (Insomnia: Paranormal Tales, Science Fiction, & Horror Book 3)", "author": "Saul Tanpepper", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But her story asks: What is this quest for adventure really for, anyway? Ultimately, she surrenders to a mode of travel that is stripped of obligations, and comes to see that traveling is not a race to be won; it's not about how far you go, how many places you visit, or how many stories you have to tell.

Come up with a list of 50 classic albums for the last four decades, email it out to a diverse group of writers, musicians, industry wonks, and some people who defy description, and ask them to write a brief book about why they love it. David Barker did just that with his 33 1/3 series. He found the response from writers impressive and popular. The series of books, which can only be described as cute (measuring slightly bigger than a deck of cards and about half as thick), are a mixed bag that run the gamut from eye-opening looks at the essence of an album to pieces that leap the bounds of appreciation and are positively obsessive. This anthology brings together selections from the first 20 volumes of the series. On the whole,33 1/3 Greatest Hitsis an awesome romp. Think of it as a party filled with your smartest and most literate music friends. We all have at least one album we love, for whatever reason—it got you through a bad period of your life, reminds you of the best summer of your life, first time you made love—and when you hear it there comes a flood of feelings with each song. This anthology, these stories, capture that rush of emotions and brilliantly crystallizes the thoughts. Certainly worth a read.\" - Jim Dunn,Playback St. Louis, February 2007 (Jim Dunn, February 2007)\"You've probably seen the 33 1/3 series at your local bookstore or record shop. They're those great little titles devoted to classic albums likeLet It Be,Paul's Boutiqueand evenTrout Mask Replica. This collects some of the best writing within those books. You'll find commentary about R.E.M.'sMurmur, the Pixies'Doolittle, Bob Dylan'sHighway 61 Revisited, Sonic Youth'sDaydream Nation, Nirvana'sIn Utero, Neutral Milk Hotel'sIn the Aeroplane Over the Sea...After you read it, you'll be a hit at the next hipster social gathering.\" — Whitney Matheson,POP Candy(USA Today pop culture blog)\"When a musician releases enough albums, it makes perfect sense to put out a Greatest Hits/Best Of career retrospective for those looking to have that output condensed to just the highlights. Although that concept doesn't really lend itself to books, it does make a certain amount of sense for the 33 1/3 series since each book is dedicated to an album, and a sampler could be useful for someone new to the series, which is now more than 50 books deep. The second volume of \"hits\" collects twenty brief passages on albums as seemingly different as Kick Out The Jams, Paul's Boutique, Loveless and Born In The USA, to name but a few, with the common thread being that each one is widely hailed as a classic. Although the effect of jumping from one story fragment to another every 10-25 pages is jarring, it does give you just enough to help you decide if you want to seek out individual volumes to get the full story on certain albums - and isn't that exactly what any good sampler should do?\" -Losingtoday.com\"Everybody has their own little best-of lists in their heads — sometimes a jarring mix of records beloved for the most intimate and inexplicable reasons. Each miniature book in the 33 1/3 series devotes itself to unraveling the allure of an album, from Jimi Hendrix's \"Electric Ladyland\" to Belle & Sebastian's \"If You're Feeling Sinister\" to Celine Dion's \"Let's Talk About Love.\" The excerpts crammed into 33 1/3 Greatest Hits Vol. 2 , $15.95 (which follows 33 1/3 Greatest Hits Vol. 1 , $14.95), present a dizzying array of passions that should send music lovers poring through their own music collections.\" -Salon.com\"For all of us that were buying records way beforeback-catalogue compilations and the mp3 came to dominate the music scene, the 331/3 series of short books, each dealing with a different LP, make for perfectstocking fillers.

It provides some unique but interesting recipes that I haven't seen anywhere else before but they are still made with everyday ingredients. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for great appetizer recipes, even if they don't have to follow a gluten-free diet.\" -Marg Ruttan, Best-Selling Cookbook Author \"I picked up this book as my son seems to have a gluten intolerance. So far he's loved the recipes that I've made him (which is amazing as he's rather picky!).  think that these have been tried and tested on kids before - A major bonus when you have picky kids. Looking forward to making more of the recipes, I thought that changing to gluten-free would be hard, but using this book has made it easy - Thank you!\" - Tracey\"Wow...I got hungry just reading this book! There are a ton of great options in this book and several that I want to try right away. I was glad to see that many of the recipes were appropriate for a vegetarian diet, as that's what I primarily eat. And I learned how to make my own goat cheese...very cool.

Larundel is one part of the\nlarger Mont Park facility situated on the outskirts of the city of Melbourne.\nIt was considered one of the most progressive mental institutions in its time.\nThis facility is currently listed under Heritage Victoria for its unique Tudor\ndesign as well as parts of its extensive landscaped garden. Larundel was built\nin the 1940's in a bid to expand facilities at Mont Park. Due to the timing of\nWorld War Two, it came to house soldiers, who could no longer cope with the\nvulgarities of war. While writing this story, I\nhave tried to keep true to certain facts about Larundel, such as dates of\noperation, its location and general layout. This last one has been the hardest\nto maintain since the remaining buildings are under tight lock and key during\nconstruction and restoration occurs. To avoid possible geographical mistakes, I\nhave used as many maps and photos (both current and archival footage) as\npossible to aid in my understanding of this institution. Any errors I have made\nbecause of this, I apologise for. Of course, artistic license has also\ncontributed to this in instances where I have had to alter factual evidence in\npursuit of telling a good tale. As the story unfolded, I\nalluded to the fact that certain events may have happened at Larundel, and that\ncertain members of staff may have been less than scrupulous in their dealings\nwhile working there. This is a work of fiction, so I hope no previous employees\nfrom Larundel or the larger Mont Park facility think I am alluding to them or\npossible incidents occurring during the years Larundel was functional. All evil\nintent is used purely to tell a story, and unfortunately, that can't be done\nwithout the insertion of a couple of bad guys! So how much is real? I have\nused, where possible, factual information for the backdrop, as stated above. I\nhave also created an entire story out of nothing more than a concept and an old\nIrish fairy tale. My aim is to blend these two polarities seamlessly. It is now up to you, as the\nreader, to decide for yourself which bits are true, and which are just a bloody\ngood tale!         Enjoy,Rachel\nTsoumbakos May 2012", "related": ["B00AST1XJU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Two years later, after numerous appointments with a psychiatrist and psychologist and taking medications, she experienced a miraculous and medically documented healing.God restored her broken and confused heart and uses the miracle to inspire you to believe and accept His hand to move in your place of need. To help people with similar problems, the author shares her personal story of physical, emotional, and spiritual experiences, as well as her emerging understanding about the roots of her struggles.After Chrystal’s healing more than 12 years ago, God led her to start an organization dedicated to the message ministry of transformation, Emerging Life Ministry Solutions. The ministry equips those desiring a deeper revelation of Christ and helps people journey through some of life’s hardest places of pain, hurt, and trauma. Community initiatives to “at-risk youth” are also a part of the vision and outreach of Emerging Life Solutions. It’s not a self-help thing—it’s a God thing.Also discussed is how the Church can more effectively help those struggling with depression and other emotional and mental illnesses. A key lesson to be learned is the redemptive purpose that suffering can have in your life.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Yet through fierce determination, unrelenting drive, sheer hard work and extraordinary vision, he has an enduring legacy of community building achievements to his name and was listed withinBRW’s top 50 most-wealthy Australians in 2011.In 1992 Maha’s private, undercapitalised firm purchased 2860 hectares of inhospitable, inaccessible land in an economically depressed region of Queensland, Australia. Two decades later, despite innumerable setbacks, Springfield has emerged as Australia’s largest privately owned master-planned city, and is a striking example of what’s possible when you design a city exclusively around the needs of the community.Stop Not Till the Goal is Reachedexplores the 10 principles for fearless success that have guided Maha throughout his life. It explains the principles through Maha’s personal journey and provides other examples of astonishing achievements from around the world.Karen McCreadieis the author of more than 35 books including several international bestsellers. ‘Maha Sinnathamby is one of the most inspirational people I have ever met. Here is a man who, against all odds, converted a tract of “worthless” bushland into a thriving city. Despite opposition that would deter most people, he persevered with his vision. His story contains invaluable lessons for anybody who is serious about becoming successful.’– Noel Whittaker ‘When I met Maha for the first time I could see in his eyes, in hisdemeanour, and in his language that here was a man who was committed to a vision. He was relentless; he was positive; he had a school-boy effervescence that was infectious. The politicians, bureaucrats, councillors, bankers and others whom he had to persuade along theway never stood a chance. He was always going to win them over.’– Bernard Salt", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Aus eigenem Erleben kennt er die Tricks der Waffenhändler, der Treuhänder in Zürich und die der Banken. Die Methoden der Schlapphüte des KGB und der westlichen Gegenspieler hat er schmerzhaft am eigenen Leib erlebt. Er sagt - ich schreibe aus meinem Kopf ab. Und wenn das nicht reicht, nehme ich die Köpfe meiner Freunde hinzu. Geboren 1942 in Landsberg/Warthe, aufgewachsen in Güstrow, Krefeld und auf vielen Stationen dazwischen. Ausbildung - etwas liederlich, größtenteils auf Reisen, weniger auf Schulen. Reisen nehmen einen großen Teil seines Lebens ein, besonders die Jahre bei der Handelsmarine. Diese Phase beeinflusst ganz wesentlich sein Schreiben. Detlev Crusius hat gelebt und gearbeitet in Krefeld, Köln, Frankfurt, Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden, Rom, London, Moskau, Riad, Jeddah, Tripolis, Damaskus und Zürich. Zu seiner Biografie gehören auch vier Jahre Gefängnis, wegen Verstoß gegen das Außenwirtschaftsgesetz und das UN-Embargo gegen Libyen.

His father, Sir Everard, was executed in 1606 for his part in the Gunpowder Plot. He went to Gloucester Hall, Oxford in 1618. He spent three years in Europe between 1620 and 1623. Around 1625, he married Venetia Stanley. He had also become a member of the Privy Council. In 1628, Digby became a privateer, with some success, particularly in the Mediterranean. He returned to become a naval administrator and later Governor of Trinity House. His wife died suddenly in 1633. Digby, stricken with grief and the object of enough suspicion that the Crown had ordered an autopsy (rare at the time) on Venetia's body, secluded himself in Gresham College and attempted to forget his personal woes through scientific experimentation. Digby received the regional monopoly of sealing wax in Wales and the Welsh Borders and monopolies of trade with the Gulf of Guinea and with Canada. In the Civil War he went into exile in Paris, where he spent most of his time until 1660. He became Chancellor to Queen Henrietta Maria. Digby was regarded as an eccentric by contemporaries, partly because of his effusive personality, and partly because of his interests in scientific matters. Notable among his pursuits was the concept of the Powder of Sympathy. This was a kind of sympathetic magic to cure injuries. His book on this salve went through 29 editions. He was a founding member of the Royal Society. His correspondence with Fermat contains the only extant mathematical proof by Fermat. His Discourse Concerning the Vegetation of Plants (1661) proved controversial. He is credited with being the first person to note the importance of vital air,A\" or oxygen, to the sustenance of plants. Digby is also considered the father of the modern wine bottle. During the 1630s, Digby owned a glassworks and manufactured wine bottles which were globular in shape with a high, tapered neck, a collar, and a punt. Editor Peter Davidson is Professor of Renaissance Studies at Aberdeen University, and has written extensively on 17th-century European culture and history, as well as a book on The Idea of the North. Editor Jane Stevenson is Regius Professor of Humanity at Aberdeen University and not only writes novels and short stories, but also reviews widely for the quality press. She recently published a biography of the painter Edward Burra.

BY GRACE by Arletta Dawdy, is that kind of good read. A good book also has characters that intrigue and change and in the midst of the action we also learn something. Maybe about jewelry design or how to win over a disgruntled employer or how to rely on friends when the chips are down. I also love books that celebrate the landscape. BY GRACE takes us on a tour across the United States offering vivid images of a cream-coddled moon over a Tiffany Studio in New York or a growing village of Virginia City or the dramatic desert of Arizona and other fascinating places of America in 1899. I'm also drawn to titles that carry more than one meaning and BY GRACE does just that giving readers a fascinating woman who appreciates how grace affects our lives. Well done, Arletta Dawdy. Here's hoping there's yet another story of Grace in the works.\"Jane Kirkpatrick, NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR OFWHERE LILACS STILL GROW\"Arletta Dawdy writes with an elegant flourish. Her portrayal of a paddle wheel trip down the Hudson to New York City is mesmerizing. After the loss of her father, and pursued by a killer, Grace heads west and discovers where she belongs, amidst 'the wide vistas, the amazing deserts and glorious mountains of the west.' Her search is epic in scope, and makes for a rewarding tale. Dawdy's research of the time and place is impeccable.\"Velda Brotherton, AUTHOR OF STONE HEART'S WOMAN", "related": ["B00J9YWGTQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

By the end, armies of  djinn are gathering to stop him, but he's more worried about controlling his own lust.This story could be taken as an allegory of a middle-age crisis if you could substitute flying carpets for Porshes.

She grew up in Stryker, Ohio, a tiny village in the northwest corner of the state. Chasta began writing stories and poems as a young child and always aspired to be an author. However, choosing the more conventional route for the area, Chasta began working right out of school at a local corrugated company. Her life's journey took her through several career choices from car sales to Property Management until finally landing in the Human Resources field as she earned her MBA from The Defiance College. Chasta never gave up her passion for writing and continued on even while working long hours in her chosen profession. After much encouragement, having let other's read her material, she began slowly publishing her works in anthologies, college magazines and finally, a first novel. Not faithful to any one genre, Chasta enjoys creating lives in many different settings, the only common factor being that they are all entertaining as hell!

He lived in an apartment but was still able to get an urban form of homesteading done to fill his needs. He then saw the need to share what he had learned from his parents when he saw that his friends were literally struggling to pay the bills and eat. He slowly introduced them to the world of homesteading (an abridged version at last) of how they could grow some of what they need in pots and how to recycle some items. Following up on that he decided to go a step further and share with anyone that was willing to take on the challenge.

I spent my childhood in Florenville, a charming village in the south of Belgium.  After a diverse educational background (others would call erratic!) I began studying civil engineering and then realized that it did not suit me at all, I studied Political Science and International Relations at the University of Brussels. I love to travel which has led me to visit a significant part of our planet, favoring the discovery of other people and respect for local cultures. I had the opportunity to discover the United States, China, in most European countries, but also North Africa, a trip that remains almost as a nightmare for me. I worked in many sectors including rural development and education. Since 1996 I work in the social sector, mainly focusing on literacy for low level skilled people. For over ten years I develop European projects in this field. I came late to writing, I should say to the publication of my writings because I feel I have always written. In the Shadow of the Dragon is my first novel. Others are in preparation, in particular a thriller that will feature some of the characters from \"In the Shadow of the Dragon.\" After ten years in Brittany, I currently live with my partner in Bordeaux, a region very interesting in many ways", "related": ["B00GVGVI0I"], "rank": 2466519, "title": "THE SHADOW (IN THE SHADOW OF THE DRAGON Book 1)", "author": "FRANCIS LAVEAUX", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She writes psychological suspense novels.  The first draft of her first novel, entitled His Kidnapper’s Shoes, was written whilst travelling in Bolivia. Maggie was inspired by an impending birthday along with a healthy dose of annoyance at having procrastinated for so long in writing a novel. His Kidnapper’s Shoes was published in both paperback and e-book format in 2013, followed by her second novel, entitled Sister, Psychopath. Her third novel, Guilty Innocence, has now been published, and like her first two, features her home city of Bristol. She is currently working on her fourth novel. Before turning her hand to writing, Maggie worked mainly as an accountant, with a short diversion into practising as a nutritional therapist. Diet and health remain high on her list of interests, along with travel. Accountancy does not, but then it never did. The urge to pack a bag and go off travelling is always lurking in the background! When not writing, going to the gym, practising yoga or travelling, Maggie can be found walking dogs and fostering homeless cats; animals are a lifelong love!", "related": ["B00JIU1MUK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 33, "rating_average": 4.4545, "rating_total": 147.0}

She was born in Tachikowa, Japan in an Air Force Base hospital on Mother’s Day.  Sharolyn’s dad was an Eagle Scout and throughout his life, an avid outdoorsman and hunter.  Because of her Dad’s love of the outdoors, family outings were often spent hiking in the woods and vacations meant camping. Her sister recently noted how very proud he would be of his daughter's work with Search and Rescue.  Sharolyn’s personal knowledge of outdoor survival, gleaned from a lifetime of experience, adds both to her skill as a SAR volunteer and to the accuracy of the SAR work presented in her book.  Her family is incredibly proud and supportive of her “out of the norm” volunteer work.   Search and Rescue allows Sharolyn to spend time in the great outdoors with her dogs, helping others.  Her K-9 Search and Rescue Group, Central Lakes Search and Rescue, responds to calls from law enforcement across the upper midwest of the United States to search for missing persons.  The strength and purpose of their motto, “. . . so that others may live,” is not taken lightly.  While she truly loves and has fun working with a variety of dogs, training each to cultivate and heighten its innate skills to locate the human scent, the goal is serious.  Through her work with SAR, she is able to give something very important and valuable back to her community.  Although she and many she works with are volunteers, the hours spent on the road, in training in woods and lakes to search for the lost are a precious gift to those they serve.  Over the years Sharolyn has trained and certified three SAR dogs in multiple disciplines with several different organizations.  She has served as an instructor at national seminars, serves as a K-9 evaluator and maintains certification in a number of areas related to SAR beyond the K-9 work she loves.  Sharolyn participates in educational programs for children about the work she and these special dogs are doing.  She is also a trained medical First Responder in her community.  Her hope is that the reader will find in the pages of this book an appreciation for the incredible, highly skilled work that a Search and Rescue dog can do.", "related": ["B005BCO8DM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In accessible language, this text reviews the basic physiological mechanisms of sleep and the intertwined psychological ramifications. Most important, it is up to date, containing the latest information on the influence of orexin/hypocretin, nocturnal eating syndrome, the local cell theory of sleep, the effects of sleep deprivation, and the advantages of delaying school start times for teenagers.

I've transformed from a lifelong couch potato to a trainer, kettlebell coach, and nutritionist.My weight loss journey has also spawned an interest in healthier eating. I'm a self-taught cook, but I'm also educated through Precision Nutrition, where I got my Pn1 Certification.Of course, I wouldn't be the writer I am today without my wife Galina (aka Galya), but in some ways she holds me back!

T. Weaver is the pen name of a Kansas City grandmother of ten. She lives with her cat, Cleopatra, in downtown Kansas City. When I was growing up, the word gay meant happy and carefree and homosexuals were called queer or ‘one-of-those’. However, I never heard those terms until I was married and a mother. Then two men moved into the mobile home court where I lived with my husband and son in St. Charles, and my husband told me they were ‘queer as three dollar bills’. I didn’t knowingly meet any lesbians until 1979 when I started playing music with the Kansas City Women’s Jam. Then my mother admitted her cousin was one. In 2003, through a TV show called Boy Meets Boy, I ‘met’ over 3,000 gay men in a Yahoo group who educated me as to the inequalities suffered by the LGBT community. I visited one of the men in San Francisco who lived just up the street from the Castro. As he showed me around, we stopped in front of what was once Harvey Milk’s camera store. My question, “Who was Harvey Milk?” started my education into Gay history. Before I left San Francisco, I mentioned my lifelong desire to write. Steve’s response was, “I’d like to read a book where the boy gets the boy and they ride off into the sunset together.” That’s when I thought about the story for Acceptance. For the characters of my first two books, I drew on the stories I’d heard from the men in our group. At the time I started writing, the ‘gay erotica’ craze had never been heard of. Though in the last couple of books, I’ve gotten a little more descriptive, I still don’t consider my books to be porn. It’s only people who haven’t read them who call them that. In 2007, I was introduced to Spirit of Hope MCC-KC and met even more amazing members of the LGBT community. At the young age of sixty-five, I attended my first ever protest rally after the passing of Prop 8. I held a corner of the MCC flag across the street from the protesters from WBC. I consider myself a straight ally to the LGBT community and thank all of you for accepting this ‘old straight lady’ into your lives. My aim is to move you in some way. Whether you laugh or cry, love it or hate it, feel free to contact me with comments either good or bad. I always say, “A bad review is better than no review at all.”", "related": ["B00KLRV2UY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It has been an amazing experience so far, and I am pleased to be able to share it with you all. I have been writing for a long time, but had taken a break for a few years and gotten out of practice. Though I never stopped dreaming and thinking up new story ideas, they all went into a book and on a shelf. Then, NaNoWriMo 2011 inspired me to take up the challange to write 50,000 words in 30 days. My first 2 days I wrote nothing because I didn't even know where to start. I figured a general idea would have been a good place, but I didn't even have that. On the third night, I started to panic. That same night, I had a dream. When I woke up, I started writing the prologue of the dream. That prologue got longer and longer, and eventually turned into my novel. The story just wouldn't leave me, and the characters began to feel like family. I still have to write the rest of the story, but now I know the characters voices, and where they'd like to end up eventually. Life may always happen when you're following your dreams, but I hope to improve continuously, and be able to share many more stories with you!If there is any issues, or anything you'd like to see more or less of, please don't hesitate to contact me.", "related": [], "rank": 3302207, "title": "A Once And Future Planet eBook", "author": "Kayla Nicholls", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Together they have now proved quite definitely that a visit from a gorgeous blonde, from a disappearing midget, from your mother-in-law, and from the secret police, are all manifestations of a cosmic principle of homeostasis, maybe.

Their books can be read with a certain pair of spectacles on as political commentaries on Soviet society or indeed any repressive society.”—Muireann Maguire,The Guardian“Their protagonists are often caught up in adventures not unlike those of pulp-fiction heroes, but the story line typically veers off in unpredictable directions, and the intellectual puzzles that animate the plots are rarely resolved. Their writing has an untidiness that is finally provocative; they open windows in the mind and then fail to close them all, so that, putting down one of their books, you feel a cold breeze still lifting the hairs on the back of your neck.”—The New York Times", "related": ["B0093M15D2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Together with his friends, Ducky goes through different identities in a humorous little adventure.What an excellent book for children.I read it with my 6-year-old niece and 8-year-old nephew. They both love the fact that there are colorful, big pictures on each page and that the texts are just the right amount with just the right size. The prose is straightforward and easy for the kids to read or learn to read. In fact, my lovely niece requested that I include this book as one of her regularbedtime stories.Behind this funny, colorful, and imaginative story is an imperative and deep message for the children: learn to love and accept yourself.Brilliant work from author Jenny Loveless. She definitely knows how to write for children and make them love her stories.I am happy to recommend this book to any parents who want to make sure that their children are entertained and educated at the same time. I am going to check out Jenny Loveless' other works and I am planning to make her books as the primary fun-learning source for the children.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.9333, "rating_total": 74.0}

Twenty-six years old, Evy has no father and only her barely-there mother - who seems to have an inexhaustible supply of potential suitors for her daughter to meet - to guide her.  Not to mention there's a huge chunk of Evy's young adulthood, the nearly two years she spent doing God knows what in Europe, completely missing from her memory.  Now, just when things look like they're finally clearing up for Evy, she loses her job, too.  But Evy soon learns that sometimes the things we've lost have a way of coming back to us.  One fateful night at the local bar, she encounters a man who appears to know a lot about her for being a complete stranger.  Or is he?  Whether she likes it or not, Evy is a part of a bigger mystery involving the handsome stranger she's just met and a colorful crew of jewel thieves back in Europe.  But Evy's past doesn't without consequences, as she's about to find out.  The truth is out there, and it's coming for her.\n'Stolen Skye,' the first novel in the Skye Trilogy, is a fantastic debut from new author Nina Loard that's brimming with emotion, a fabulously paced story about discovering what you want in life and being brave enough to pursue it.  What's more, 'Stolen Skye' starts strong and only gets better as more of Evy's tumultuous past is illuminated.  You'll meet the entire line-up of fun and sexy characters that Loard has written into existence here, and Evy herself is a fully realized character with believable actions and a lively personality that's both lovable and admirable.  If you're looking for romance with a bit of bite to it, or adventure coupled with emotional depth, then this is the obvious choice for you.\"", "related": ["B00H6V7WCA"], "rank": 1439275, "title": "Stolen Skye: Book One, The Skye Trilogy", "author": "Nina Loard", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Boo first developed his nose for canine cuisine by sniffing out crumbs on the kitchen floor of his pet parents' home in Labrador, Alaska. Growing up on the coast, Boo loved that his diet sometimes included wild salmon and cod. But it was hard to scratch a living in such a remote part of the world, so when Boo was just one year old the family moved to Dog Bluff, South Carolina, which unfortunately was almost as quiet as Labrador. So with nothing much to do but play dead dog, Boo decided it was time to go walkies on his own. He worked his way through the garbage cans of some of the finest restaurants in the finest cities, took a licking from the best gourmutt chefs in the country and eventually earned admission into the prestigious CIA (Culinary Institute of Animals), graduating later with the school's highest honors of five bones. Mr zeHound is recognized as one of the pawmost experts in the field of doggy dishes and drinks and now he has joined forces with Elizabeth Dodwell to produce The BARKtender's Guide series of Dogtail and Pupcake recipe books for the discriminating dog.", "related": ["B00GUY7L4S"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While the rest of the family settle easily\ninto their new lives, Stephanie is teased and has trouble fitting in to her new\nschool until Jason, one of the senior boys, asks her out. Stephanie falls in\nlove with Jason, and doesn't see the way he is manipulating her to the point\nwhere she has turned her back on everything she once valued. Her descent is not\nhelped by her parents, who seem to have little time for her and no appreciation\nof the difficulties she is facing. Spiralling Out of Control is a well-written but challenging\nread. I think the strong and consistent third-person point of view has captured\nStephanie's descent into mistreatment and exploitation very clearly, as well as\ndetailing the consequences of her decisions. It's an interesting story, because\nalthough Stephanie was forced in some respects, this was still clearly a\nconsequence of the decisions she made, a series of seemingly-insignificant\ndecisions that compound in an almost-ruined life.  This is not a pretty story, nor is it an\neasy read. There are several unsavoury characters and a number of scenes where\nStephanie, Jason and others are falling headlong into sin (to use Christianese\n- a trap Spiralling Out of Control does not fall into). It's not graphically portrayed in that\nthere is little or no description. But the images are still there. In fact,\nparts of Spiralling Out of Control are a study in how much can be implied with a few well-chosen\nwords. Stephanie's descent is very well portrayed.

If you are preparing for an upcoming interview, the book will help you to refresh your knowledge on Aerodynamics, Engines, Performance, Design, Navigation, Weather and Human Performance. Besides, it is also a great source for any pilot to keep up her/his knowledge on the above mentioned topics. The text is illustrated with many graphics, helping you to understand and memorize what you read more easily. Looking up a specific topic is simple. A keyword index will take you straight to the page you are looking for. Topics are well covered and avoid going into too much details unrelevant to the pilot. The presented material is all you need too know at an interview or if asked by a check pilot. I personally found the information on performance, weather and aerodynamics very helpful as they are explained thoroughly but in an easy-to-understand way. The book is so far the best I have seen if you want to refresh your ATPL knowledge, whether it is just for yourself or because you prepare for an interview respectively check. --flitework.comThe PilotsReference Guide has become an invaluable and indispensable part of my library.

She has taught at the high school level, and has held positions as a college dean, a counselor and an assistant principal at the middle school level. Driven by her desire to have a greater impact on elementary school education, Wilhelm made a mid-career detour, securing her life-long \"dream job\" as an elementary public school principal.   For the last 10 years under her stewardship and in collaboration with her outstanding teaching staff, her school has achieved and maintained some of the highest test scores in California, and received multiple achievement honors, including two California Distinguished School Awards. Meriam is also a personal recipient of several Honorary Services Awards, and recently received the California PTA's most prestigious award, the Golden Oak Service Award for \"significant contributions to the welfare of children.   Happily married for over 33 years to her \"best friend\", Meriam is the proud parent of three successful adult children with whom she maintains a close family relationship. As a testimony to her child rearing skills with a strong family focus on life-long education, each of her two sons have completed both Bachelors and Masters degrees, one in engineering, one in business, and her daughter is a Registered Nurse with two related undergraduate degrees. Wilhelm and her husband, a recently retired aerospace executive, live in Southern California and spend time walking on the local beaches and traveling when she is not writing or sewing.  Wilhelm draws from her sometimes challenging earlier life experiences. Being a full time working mom who managed child care demands while actively supporting each of her kid's homework, sports, and scouting demands gave her a unique and relevant basis for the enduring lessons, strategies and recommendations you will find in her writings. Wilhelm gave special import to the value of nightly reading and regularly ended her kids evenings with a Bath, Book and Bed; the title of one of her popular eBooks. Capturing the many actual experiences and demonstrated successful practices from the classroom, the playground, and the \"principal's office\", she brings a balanced approach to the many challenges parents face as they help their kids to navigate through the elementary school years.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It takes a lot of work, and a lot of time. But it is also an extremely rewarding experience. After years of dreaming about doing it, I finally wrote a book. I wrote this book, my first book, and definitelynotmy last book.Ironically, its origin was a vivid dream I had one night many years ago. It was one of those rare dreams that are coherent and tell a complete story—tenuous, but with a distinct beginning, middle, and end. Even more rare, the dream stuck with me, growing gradually in my mind like a seed slowly fed the water it needs to survive. Over the years it flourished, with scenes and characters blooming in my mind. So when I decided I was ready to sit down and write a novel (for NaNoWriMo), it was an easy choice to tell Eden's story first.Of course, that doesn't mean it was easy to write. As I'm sure happens with many first-time writers, I struggled with the beginning. I struggled with finding my voice. And I struggled with putting into words what I saw so clearly in my head.  After all, fiction is a different beast from emails and reports. But by the time I had finished my first draft, I had created a world bigger than just a single story. In fact, I had populated it with many interesting characters that I wanted to know more about. What had started as a simple standalone story became just the first in a series of fantastic adventures.Eden is the first book in what will become a trilogy of action-packed science fiction stories about this new world, a new domain, the NExT domain. If that sounds like fun, then I hope you pick it up. And, more importantly, I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.", "related": [], "rank": 2089926, "title": "Eden (Adventures in the NExT Domain Book 1) eBook", "author": "Jeffrey Bryan", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her passion for writing and reading began when she was a very young girl. She was raised in Copperas Cove, Texas where she grew up in the country with horses and lots of freedom to explore her environment.  It was an idyllic childhood. Terri is the mother of three. Her kids are all grown now and living happy and responsible lives of their own. Terri raised her kids in Granbury, TX and Tomball, TX. Both of these communities offered excellent schools and a country atmosphere that Terri enjoys. Terri still has ties to both towns as well as friends in both places. As an adult, Terri has held a couple of different careers. Her first teaching job was with Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District in Houston, TX. Her next one was as a teacher and reading specialist in Tomball, TX. It was while she taught that she became aware of the kinds of books children enjoyed reading. She also noticed areas in need of good children’s books. You will find many of her books respond to these needs. Terri is very happily married to her best friend, Michael. Together, they live in Oakridge, OR with their black Labrador, Oliver. Terri and Michael enjoy traveling together, fishing, going to the movies, and, of course, reading great books.

His work includes the best selling Dead Days serial, the Brian McDone crime mysteries, The Hunger, Killing Freedom, What We Saw, The Watching, She Remembers, Something in the Cellar and Silhouette. Casey lives in the United Kingdom. He has a BA degree in English with Creative Writing from the University of Birmingham, and has been writing stories for as long as he can remember. In his spare time, he enjoys American serial television, is a slave to Pitchfork's Best New Music section, and wastes far too much of his life playing Football Manager games. Ryan is currently working on a new sci-fi horror called Sinkers, as well as the third book in the Brian McDone crime mystery series.

I was haunted by the atmosphere and  images of Carmilla's lonesome castle in Styria, Rebecca's brooding house at Manderley\nand Clark Ashton Smith's strange palaces and castles in the Forest of Averoigne. After the castle came Vivien.  Vivien is the witch who\ncaptured the wizard Merlin, ensnaring him by his love for her and imprisoning\nhim, some say, in a Castle of Glass. I wanted the story to be lush and\novercanopied with the smell of musk roses and honeysuckle.The other influences on this story are more conscious and\nare definitely the Arthurian taleSir Gawain and the Lady Ragnall, which took\nplace not far from my home - in the legendary, but very real, though now diminished\nForest of Inglewood. In that the loathsome Lady Ragnall asks: what do women\nwant? Only Gawain has the courage to find out. Does Captain Thorpe?There is another story which has\ninfluenced Vivien and that is the Welsh folktale ofMorwyn Llyn y Fan Fachwhere the fairy woman comes out of the lake\nand is a wonderful wife to her husband. She warns him never to strike her, and\nif he does strike her three times she will vanish. So that's where the idea of\nbeing warned not to do something three times comes from. And the idea of woman\nas snake is old - though the picture I had in my mind was Keat'sLamia. So now you know what was going on in my mind when I wrote\nVivien. I think setting it in the 1920s was something about it being close\nenough in time to feel modern, but distant enough to allow it to be a fairy\ntale.", "related": ["B00KO8847Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As an Author, I try to keep my stories as tasteful as possible while still remaining true to my characters. The men in my stories are over the top Alpha males, who will do anything to get the woman that they have set their sights set on. If any of these things offend you, then this is not the series for you.  I do not write stories that leave you hanging in hopes of you having to buy the next book. My stories are complete and will not leave you feeling as if you were forced into buying a sequel. Though my books come in series, each book is capable of standing alone and can be read without having to go through a numerical sequence. I also go out of my way to keep my pricing fair to the reader, because these books are 'self-published' and they are not as long as a standard published book would be. I chose to self-publish these fiction books in order to build up a fan base. As is the case of any other writer, I am growing and learning daily. I am constantly researching and studying in order to better myself for the people who enjoy my books. As my fan base grows and finances come along with that growth, I can promise my readers the traditional published and edited books. Though I am not a world renowned Author, I do have a very vivid imagination and the capability to tell a very emotive and provoking story. I look forward to growing with you and for you, because in my world it is all about you the reader. I hope that you enjoy reading my stories as much as I enjoyed writing them for you.", "related": ["B00K9YXCF2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.6, "rating_total": 23.0}
