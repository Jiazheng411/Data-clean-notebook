They discover a hidden tunnel under the Burger Castle, the Funkhouser family's restaurant, and encounter a weird apparition floating in the air. Deciding that ghosts would make an unbeatable project, they begin to research the Castle's history. They learn that it was once owned by inventor Silas Finklebean, who vanished mysteriously. When they find his laboratory and logbook of plans, they attempt to reconstruct his time machine. Meanwhile, town bully Adam Spanker and his father, owners of the rival Patty Cakes restaurant, are plotting to drive the Funkhousers out of business. Can Freddy and the Fries find a way to save the Castle? The over-the-top action is often difficult to follow and there is little depth of character. The pervasive body and insult humor is reminiscent of a second-grade playground. Black-and-white cartoon illustrations are mildly amusing, but add little. Adult thriller author Baldacci is aiming at Captain Underpants graduates, but this novel lacks both the imagination and the underlying logic of that gleefully anarchic series.

It seeks to provide a strong scientific basis for monitoring that will enable readers to establish cost-effective environmental programs. The book begins by reviewing the evolution of water quality monitoring as an information system, and then defines water quality monitoring as a system, following the flow of information through six major components: sample collection, laboratory analysis, data handling, data analysis, reporting, and information utilization. The importance of statistics in obtaining useful information is discussed next, followed by the presentation of an overall approach to designing a total water quality information system. This sets the stage for a thorough examination of the quantification of information expectations, data analysis, network design, and the writing of the final design report. Several case studies describe the efforts of various organizations and individuals to design water quality monitoring systems using many of the concepts discussed here. A helpful summary and final system design checklist are also provided. Design of Water Quality Monitoring Systems will be an essential working tool for a broad range of managers, environmental scientists, chemists, toxicologists, regulators, and public officials involved in monitoring water quality.

After the \"kind woman at the front desk\" of a San Francisco hotel informs the Wilson family that there are no vacancies, they step into the elevator and discover this \"first-rate room. And it appears to be vacant.\" They are thrilled with its amenities: a full-length mirror, a phone, wall-to-wall carpeting, piped-in music and a panel of buttons to play with. Their vertically mobile home even has a nameAOtis. The author squeezes in some diverting action: the family of four host a catered dinner party for the hotel guests they have come to know (en route to their respective floors), and manage to foil a kidnapping attempt without leaving their quarters. Forgivably, Evans descends to some predictable puns (Wilson pater announces that his family has been in \"many tight spots\") and comes up with some over-the-top wordplay (\"If I don't fit in time to keep fit at the hotel's fitness center, I have a fit\") and alliteration (\"On the twentieth floor, Tom and Tia Twiddle, two tourists from Texas, entered Otis toting trucks\")Aall in good fun. Like the Wilsons' living space, readers' imaginations will expand to accommodate this blithe narrative. Fittingly sporting a vertical format, this clever tall tale will give kids' spirits a lift.

In 1886, Hill and her family moved to Winter Park, Florida, where she got a job teaching gymnastics at a local college. She wrote her first real book there, in an effort to raise money for a family vacation to Chautauqua Lake. The book was called Chatauqua Idyl and was published in 1887 by D. Lothrop and Company, the same publisher that printed her first story when she was twelve. Hill was eventually married and began a family, but lost her husband to appendicitis. At this point in her life, her writing was the only means she had to keep food on the table and money in her pockets. In her lifetime, Hill wrote over a hundred books, only two of which were non-fiction.

Setting out to convince the world that he was the rightful king, he was thrown in prison, lost his fortune and died destitute. In this mostly elegant, sometimes workmanlike, study—part detective story and part history—University of Urbino medievalist Falconieri raises significant questions about the tale. Was Giannino a historical figure or a literary invention? Was he really the royal child switched at birth by a wet nurse intent on saving her marriage? Through an examination of other similar medieval tales and contemporary works that discuss such stories (e.g., Dante'sCommedia), Falconieri answers these questions while offering fascinating glimpses into the intrigues of the medieval French and Italian courts and the weaving of classical Greek and biblical tales into medieval stories about the revelation of royal identity. 2 line drawings, 1 map.(Oct.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She sold her first painting at age 16 and has been a working artist ever since.  The majority of her paintings use subjects very close to her home--in many cases, literally in her own backyard.  Roberta began writing even before she began painting.  She is currently completing a series of related novels collectively entitled Suburban Sprawl.  Her novels are set in Bucks County, albeit in a rather surreal version of the area.  She uses plots as simple as a soap opera to explore some very complex themes, and she enjoys juxtaposing those archetypal plots with offbeat humor, a glaze of sexuality and a touch of the paranormal. Another life-long interest for Roberta has been Tarot and I Ching.  Her compressive guide to reading Tarot cards, The Language of Tarot, is the culmination of over thirty years of work with the Oracle. A series of video companions for Suburban Sprawl and The Language of Tarot are available on Roberta's website, www.RobertaLeeArt.com.  She cordially invites you to visit her there to learn more about her books and paintings, and to become her fan on Facebook.", "related": ["B00B0N10IC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although the Rams scored a touchdown soon after his birth to tie the game, the Colts then scored 17 points to win.  This, along with multi-decade stints at UCLA and as a government bureaucrat, has given Dan an appreciation for the subtle and sometimes capricious agency of action and words.  Among his philosophical influences he cites Thomas Kuhn, David Springhorn, Paul Feyerabend, the Reduced Shakespeare Company and Bullwinkle the Moose. When not working as the local history reference librarian at the Pasadena Public Library, Dan can be found working merrily in the garden, pacing nervously during any UCLA game where the lead is less than 25 points, or walking sedately the beloved puppies with his even more beloved honey, Vendi. Dan has written five books, one musical and a play.  In reverse chronological order his works have been: “WereKitty” a work which considers what happens 20 years after a torrid love affair between a normal human and a member of the differentially animated community; “Gott Mit Uns” a play that tells the story of an 8 1/2 foot penguin, who is a goddess, who is pursued by two people, who are bureaucrats, through today’s America; “Mime Time” a murder mystery about a mime about to be nominated the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 and the people who want to kill him; “Gott Mit Uns” the novel which is the source of his recent play; “Pass the Damn Salt, Please” a novel which explores the importance of language and politeness in relationships told entirely in dialogue; “ICE Girls” an award winning novella which examines the story of the Little Match Girl from the point of view of management; and the award winning musical “Oh No, Not Emily!” an operetta in which a modern fake Emily Dickinson poem is sold to a post-modern English Department. Two of Dan’s works have been nominated for Just Plain Folks awards: “Oh No, Not Emily!” for Best Theater Album, and “ICE Girls” for Best Storytelling Album. Before that he and Mark Sellin were “2 Guys from the 70’s”. Also with Mark and other friends, Dan wrote, directed and acted in several plays at the Renaissance Faire in Southern California, including their greatest hit “Ye Olde Tale of Goode King Arthur.” He also has created radio play versions of the Trojan Horse “The Big Horsey Ride” and the Odyssey “Going Home and Getting Lucky.” Dan is currently working on a history of Pasadena for grade schoolers.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From 1520 to the end of the 18th century, the Knights lived on the glory of the siege and by policing the corsairs of the Middle Sea. But then Napoleon conquered the island, after which the British ruled until 1964. By then, the Royal Navy, long Malta's treasurer, had withdrawn.

This is a book my generation of feminists (who were, before that, sexual liberationists) could not have imagined, because this current generation of assault-and-rape prevention advocates are engaged in the process of making both sex and intimacy a whole-body, whole-mind experience.

In his best selling book, Dark Caribbean, that adventure comes to life and puts the reader right there beside him in the cockpit of his plane as he skims along barely above the waves in order to stay below the radar sweep. At other times the reader will feel as though they are part of the crew aboard his offshore lobster vessel, as they wage a shooting war with armed pirates in the Caribbean. After passing Mile Marker 77 in June 2012, Rick decided to remain in the adventurous world of writing, and forget about slipping out under the radar for one final run to Colombia. Maybe!

Dixon is a masterful storyteller, with a ton of heart, and an astounding facility for empathy. The fact is, I'd read anything Dixon were to write. Even a cookbook. Or a memoir about fatherhood. As fate would have it, it just so happens that I became a father myself two years ago, and I'm a closet foodie--ergo, I jumped at the chance to reviewCooking for Gracie.To call this book a memoir about cooking, would be doing it a great disservice. Not to downplay the wonderful recipes and cooking tutorials that fillCooking for Gracie, but at the end of the day, this book stands alone as a wise, deeply felt and hilarious meditation on being a father, and being a husband.Dixon is not only a craftsman, but an inspiration to anyone who is a father, or a husband, or anyone who aspires to be a father, or a husband.

Her pacing and use of foils and humor make for a fine suspense yarn. But more importantly, she gives her characters rich emotional depth and writes affectionately about the jazz geeks who populate her world.\" Kurt Gottschalk,The Bird CageBilled as \"a jazz mystery with a dash of romance,\" Florence Wetzel's murder-based thriller is that rare beast: a novel set in the jazz world which rings true in every detail. That alone makes it a pleasure to read. But Dashiki is also superbly well crafted, and it ramps up the tension to a nerve-wracking denouement.You would expect any book written by Wetzel--an authoritative CD and book reviewer with All About Jazz--to be accurate on the jazz details, but you might not expect such an action-packed page-turner as Dashiki. Who knew? Commentating on a disc is one thing; creating a gripping whodunnit is another.The story is set over a summer 2003 week in Hoboken, Manhattan and upstate New York (Wetzel wrote the book in 2004). It begins with its protagonist, jazz journalist Virginia Farrell, being shown a shoebox full of tapes, recorded by Naima Coltrane, of pianist Thelonious Monk and saxophonist John Coltrane's extended residency at the Five Spot club in New York City in 1957, and being asked to safeguard their delivery to the Monk and Coltrane estates. The donor of the tapes is Betty Brown, a dying singer who used to babysit for the Coltranes in the late 1950s. Within a few hours of her revelation to Farrell, Brown is murdered and the shoebox of tapes stolen.Without giving too much away, Farrell--like another fictional amateur sleuth, Nancy Drew--has to find the murderer, keep her friend Vincent Garrideb, a jazz magazine editor suspected of the killing, out of jail, and recover the tapes. She also has to thwart an attempt on her own life, which she does with the help of a trumpet once owned by Miles Davis. But that's to get ahead of things. Along the way, there are enough red herrings to keep you guessing.Wetzel's fictional characters are luminously observed. The mildly sociopath jazz magazine publisher, Bassinger Ffowlkes; his lecherous staff photographer, Joe Pascoe; Coltrane obsessive Mortimer Bartesque, who writes the magazine's Coltrane Corner column (and knows everything about the man right down to his shoe size); John Upgrove, an archivist at the Institute of Jazz Studies; veteran hard bop drummer Rex Royal; and more. Another delight is the way Wetzel weaves a dozen or so real jazz people, passed and still with us, into the story. These include reed player Sam Rivers, who sits in with Royal's band at a gig at the Blue Note; the Institute of Jazz Studies' Dan Morgenstern; and trumpeter Lee Morgan, who plays an offstage but dynamic role in the plot.Along the way there's some romance, as Farrell and the jazz-ignorant Hoboken Detective, Robert Smith, initially antipathetic, become attracted to each other.Wetzel has hit all the right notes here, and Dashiki (also published as an eBook) is highly recommended. It is a lot of fun and, no hyperbole, unputdownable.--Review by Chris May, on AllAboutJazz.com, March 28, 2011", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Mere days after Dahmer's burial, Columbus County, Wis., is terrorized by a new cannibal killer whose fingerprints, handwriting and phone voice all match those of the supposedly deceased Dahmer. The press and police are convinced that Dahmer has either faked his death or been resurrected. But Helen Cross, a captain of the Wisconsin State Police Violent Crimes Unit, detects nuances in the crimes that suggest that a copycat with a different m.o. has made a diabolical change in his model's methods. Lee and Steffen demonstrate the same facility for imagining spattery crime scenes that galvanized their previous collaboration, Portrait of the Psychopath as a Young Woman. They are less capable with living flesh and blood. Only Helen, a bundle of instincts and insecurities that intensify when her investigation implicates her lover, medical examiner Tom Drake, has a personality complex enough to match the contrivances of the plot. Her associates and adversaries come across as little more than ghouls or geeks who exist primarily to discuss cutting-edge forensic techniques in numbing clinical detail--none more so than the chortling villain, whose climactic revelations of how he pulled off his crimes read with all the passion of a modern criminology textbook. That's a shame, since the authors come close to making the threat expressed in their lurid tabloid title seem, at least briefly, an eerie possibility.

These are the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS), which were created and are administered by CFA Institute.Expanding upon information associated with the GIPS standards published by CFA Institute, this reliable resource provides practical guidance for today's financial professional—from money managers or firms engaged in attracting new clients to institutional investors looking to hire investment managers that align with their goals.Engaging and informative, this book offers valuable insights on achieving and maintaining compliance with the GIPS standards as well as a detailed explanation of the rationale behind the numbers.Complying with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)is divided into three different parts:Part I:Explains the GIPS standards and how to comply with them by creating composites representing the performance of a firm's strategiesPart II:Addresses the methodology for calculating returns used to quantify a manager's historical performance and examines the statistics that quantify the risks taken to achieve those returnsPart III:Discusses the essential issues associated with reporting performance and reveals what it takes to achieve and maintain compliance with the GIPS standardsAlong the way, the book provides worked examples illustrating particular techniques for analyzing performance, and skillfully describes the most commonly used methods for deriving returns used for marketing purposes.The GIPS standards have changed today's financial landscape. And while past performance cannot guarantee future results, the information conveyed by the GIPS standards has helped prospective investors and investment managers form more informed relationships. Nobody understands this better than authors Bruce Feibel and Karyn Vincent, both long-standing volunteers with CFA Institute's GIPS committees, and now, inComplying with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)they put this dynamic discipline in perspective.", "related": [], "rank": 1304110, "title": "Complying with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) (Frank J.

Nova,\" was published in the Minnesota Writers In the School COMPAS program's 1981 anthology of student writing, When It Grows Up, You Say Goodbye To It, he decided to dedicate himself to writing. Several unpublished novels and short stories followed. Hansen earned two degrees at Minnesota State University at Mankato under the mentorship of young adult novelist Terry Davis. In the years that followed, Hansen worked a variety of jobs related to writing, including editorial work at a small publishing house, holding a position as a website editor, and five years in journalism in northwestern Wisconsin, where he earned several state awards for his writing and editing. His work has appeared in the Meadowbrook Press anthology, Girls to the Rescue, Book 1, as well as the true crime journal, Ripper Notes, in volume 28. His first novel, Most Likely, was released in May. Shada is the first installment of the Ember Cole series of young adult paranormal suspense books. Hansen is hard at work on the next installment in the series, the novel-length book, Ember. Hansen recently moved to Oregon with his wife, a dog, a cat, and his 89-year-old father, a World War II veteran. Craig's interests include the music of Johnny Cash, reading the novels of other independent authors, blogging, and the study of Messianic theology.

Madero and, therefore, the Mexican Revolution of 1910 and Madero's Presidency, including its brutally abrupt end in 1913. On my webpage I offer Q & A about this book, as well as many resources for researchers, including bibliographies, lists of films, podcasts, and more.", "related": ["B00D4KT108"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ryan rightly denounces the unrestrained bombast of the event, with its syrupy feel of anAmerican Gladiatorsre-run, the stage \"Star-Spangled to within an inch of its life,\" the candidates themselves appearing as a cross between \"beauty contestants\" and \"an aging rock band on one last overpriced reunion tour.\" Indeed, every aspect of both the pageantry and the players is fodder for Ryan's raucous, scathing screed. WhereThe Four Stoogesfalters is in its depiction of GOP voters, whom she treats--rather often--with the same blanket condescension that the candidates themselves seem unable to reserve for solely each other. That said, there's much to titter over here, certainly for avowed Democrats, no less so for independents at a loss for a viable conservative alternative to the sitting incumbent, and most definitely for readers with an appetite for witty, enthusiastic writing that delights in taking aim at painfully easy targets. --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B00657YUNK"], "rank": 1602960, "title": "The Four Stooges (Kindle Single)", "author": "Erin Gloria Ryan", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is the eldest son of the late Gordon Eastman, one of the first producers of outdoor-adventure films and a true pioneer in the industry. Mike grew up filming and working on such classic hunting productions as Mule Deer Hunters, Rocky Mountain Safari elk, Rocky Mountain Safari Deer, Talk the Elk, Mule deer Action and Bowhunting Record Mule Deer.As a youth, Mike could most often be found studying and hunting the high country of western Wyoming for trophy bulls and bucks. He harvested his first bull, a 350-class six point at the age of 14 near Jackson Hole, and area that supports one of the largest herds of elk in the world. In his younger years, Mike helped feed elk near his home, where over 8,000 elk waited out the winter on the Jackson Hole elk refuge. Later he was able to turn his love for elk hunting into a profession an outfitter in the Bridger Teton Wilderness.In 1987 Mike launched a trophy-hunting magazine, The Eastmans' Hunting Journal, a guide for big-game hunting in the Rocky Mountain States.

And yet it is for skills developed in these areas, along with her talent for writing, that Hattie is best remembered. Hattie came to Scottsdale with a diploma from the Bushnell Normal College. The principal of Phoenix Union High School, George Blount, wanted Hattie to teach at Scottsdale's new elementary school, built only the year before. He bent the rules a little so that Hattie could teach before she turned eighteen. She taught in Scottsdale for two years, and then attended the Tempe Normal School, from which she graduated in 1901. She taught for a year in Kyrene and then moved to Washington, northwest of Phoenix, in order to teach there. While teaching at the one room Washington school, Hattie boarded at the ranch of Henry Claiborne Lockett, a sheep rancher and Republican senator representing Coconino County in the territorial legislature. Henry was a widower who lived with his three children and his mother. Hattie and Henry married in 1905, and had two children, Claiborne and Robert. In 1912, Hattie founded the Washington Women's Club, which worked to turn the Washington School into a center of community life. This was the first of many community groups Hattie would help to organize. Hattie earned a Phi Beta Kappa key, and received her Master's degree in archaeology in 1932. Her thesis, which became a popular book, was The Unwritten Literature of the Hopi: First Hand Accounts of Customs, Traditions and Beliefs of the Northern Arizona Indian Tribe. Hattie gathered the material for her thesis in her home near the summer pasturing area of her flocks in Flagstaff. Between 1941 and her death in 1962, Hattie wrote many poems and short stories. She was president of the Arizona branch of the League of American Pen Women, and served as their poetry chairman. She inaugurated Arizona Poetry Day in honor of Sharlot Hall.  In 1952, she was placed on the honor roll of the American Artists and Professional League for her skills as an orator and poet, and for her work with the advisory board of the General Federation of Women's Clubs and the National Arts Society. Hattie Greene Lockett died on May 23, 1962, at the age of eighty-two.", "related": ["B00332FFHA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While not the only industry expert attracted to the Supply Chain approach, Martijn has done a masterful job of adapting it to the realities of Market Data practices.  Here, for the first time, is a coherent descriptive framework to describe how the pieces fit together, why they need to be handled the way they are and what metrics and aspects of information quality can be used.  It doesn't go into the mechanics of pricing and valuation for various instruments - that's not the point here, and there are plenty of sources for information on that.  There are other places where Martijn neatly draws the line, and stays focused - if you need a concise overview of information management and the products and processes in the operations of the securities industry, including practical discussions related to trade-offs and legacy overhang, you now have it.\"--From the Foreword by Bill Nichols,Program Director of Securities Processing Automation, FISD/SIIA\"Managing Financial Information in the Trade Lifecycle: A Concise Atlas of Financial Instruments and Processes by Martijn Groot hits at the heart of a key industry challenge. The importance of the kind of data management processes it describes cannot be understated. It's a wonder it's taken so long for institutions to finally begin to get a grip on this crucial operational issue.”--Andrew Delaney, Editor-in-Chief, A-Team Group, Publisher of Reference Data Review Newsletter\"It's a pleasure to welcome Martijn Groot's new book Managing Financial Information in the Trade Lifecycle: A Concise Atlas of Financial Instruments and Processes to the growing canon of works dedicated to the business and technology of market data.  It offers instructors a source for courseware, and practitioners a means of enhancing their skill sets.  Groot's book joins Marc Alvarez' Market Data Explained as essential items in the market data professional's library.”-- R. \"Tee” Williams, Principal and Head of Financial Industries Training, Tee Williams Associates\"An excellent primer on one of the most important challenges- effective data management- facing the financial services industry today. The book provides a succinct business process framework in which to understand the variety of data types, sources and content that comprise securities trading.\"-- Ayesha Khanna, author of Straight Through Processing for Financial Services\"The world of financial market data is awash in the use of specialist jargon and metaphors that fall short of describing the sophistication and complexity of the domain. Refreshingly, Martijn Groot undertakes to consolidate these issues, viewing them as parts of a single supply chain across the many uses of data content within financial firms and across the industry. Any firm looking to invest in their data management and supply infrastructure should start here in order to understand fully both the scope of the data management landscape as well as the industry context. Every CTO or CIO will be well served by keeping a copy on their bookshelf.\"-- Marc Alvarez, author of Market Data Explained: A Practical Guide to Global Capital Markets InformationManaging Financial Information in the Trade Lifecycle discusses the present and future of financial data management by focusing on the lifecycle of the financial instruments (stocks, bonds, options, derivatives) that generate and require data to keep the markets moving.

His A History of New York, published in 1809 under the name of Diedrich Knickerbocker, was a satirical history of New York that spanned the years from 1609 to 1664. Under another pseudonym, Geoffrey Crayon, he wrote The Sketch-book, which included essays about English folk customs, essays about the American Indian, and the two American stories for which he is most renowned--\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" and \"Rip Van Winkle.\" Irving served as a member of the U.S. legation in Spain from 1826 to 1829 and as minister to Spain from 1842 to 1846. Following his return to the U.S. in 1846, he began work on a five-volume biography of Washington that was published from 1855-1859. Washington Irving died in 1859 in New York.Heralded as the greatest artist of the triumvirate of modern illustrators that included Greenaway and Crane, Randolph Caldecott is highly praised for introducing techniques of animation into picture book art and for his humorous, satiric extensions of the text in his illustrations. Caldecott's fame centers on 16 books, often referred to as the \"Toy Books,\" reprinted by Edmund Evans in his innovative printing techniques, featuring mainly traditional nursery rhymes and songs, and published in pairs. They include: The House That Jack Built (1865), The Diverting History of John Gilpin (written by William Cowper) (1878), Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog (written by Oliver Goldsmith) (1979), Babes in the Wood (1879), Sing a Song of Sixpence (1880), The Three Jovial Huntsmen (1880), The Farmer's Boy (1881), The Queen of Hearts (1881), The Milkmaid (1882), Hey Diddle Diddle with Baby Bunting (1882), A Frog He Would a-Wooing Go (1883), and The Fox Jumps over the Parson's Gate (1884). Caldecott generally drew his illustrations in sepia applied with a brush rather than a pen; he included an average of three uncolored illustrations for each colored one. He has received praise for his fluid style, which created a sense of movement across a page and from one page to another; he is also lauded for his insight into human nature and instinctive grasp of what appeals to children. Each year the American Library Association awards a highly coveted medal in his name to the best illustrated book by an American author.", "related": ["B00EXRFLBO"], "rank": 31053, "title": "Bracebridge Hall", "author": "Washington Irving", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was raised in Mooresboro, NC. After the death of his mother, at the age of 10, Curtis felt as if there was no hope left for him. Shortly after that, he moved in with his grandparents, but the feelings of hopelessness and bitterness towards the Lord were still heavy on his heart. Curtis was looking for something to fill the void in his life, so he turned to the streets looking for love and anything else, he thought would and could fill that void. And if life had not already been hard enough for this young man, his father was murdered when he was seventeen; his grandmother passed away the same year, and his house burned down in flames the same year. Yet another hit, another event in his life that only added to the feelings of hopelessness. Finally, when Curtis was in the 12th grade, he dropped out of high school and pretty much gave up on life. THEN ONE NIGHT, Curtis came face to face with God and he gave his life to Christ. He started attending Christ for the Nations church in Shelby, NC. Through the love of God and his church family, the teaching of the uncompromised Word of God, things started falling into place for this young man. He found hope, unconditional love and the support he desperately needed to make the necessary changes in his life. He went back to Isothermal Community College and received his High School diploma and is currently attending Oral Roberts University seeking a BA in Church Ministries. He is now married to a wonderful woman, and has three beautiful children. Curtis found what he was looking for, what couldn't be found on the streets, and that was love of Christ. It changed his life and gave him a hope and a future. It has given him confidence and assurance, that he is not alone and that there is nothing he can't do, with the power of God in his life.

Barton is the author of several fast-paced mystery and thriller series, featuring lively characters and lots of action. \"Miz Scarlet\" (Scarlet Wilson Mystery series) is a teacher-turned-innkeeper, who throws herself into danger with a feisty determination to make things right, relying on cohorts like \"Captain Peacock\" and \"Colonel Grey Poupon\" to help her solve the clues. Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans.

Leach recently retired as Professor and Chair Emeritus from the Department of Systems and Computer Science at Howard University, where he had taught since 1969.   He received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Maryland at College Park and the M. S. degree in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University.  His research interests include distributed systems, performance modeling and capacity planning; and most areas of software engineering, especially software reuse, fault-tolerance, and software performance measurement and their empirical foundations.  Much of this book is based on his 27 years of UNIX experience as a researcher in fault-tolerance; a teacher of operating systems, emphasizing UNIX; and as a consultant, who has analyzed hundreds of thousands of lines of UNIX code.  Some of his current work includes the application of computing to the social sciences, especially in the area of name matching within historical documents, using both his computer search skills and genealogical knowledge.  He is a frequent member of ABET site visit teams.  He is an experienced cruise ship lecturer, with special emphasis on identity theft and computer forensics.  He also lectures to other groups. Ron Leach is the author of seven print books: \"Using  C in Software Design,\" Academic Press Professional,\"Advanced Topics in UNIX,\" John Wiley; \"Object-Oriented Design and Programming in C++,\" Academic Press Professional,  Software Reuse: Methods, Models, and Costs,\" McGraw-Hill, \"Introduction to Software Engineering,\" CRC Press, \"Genealogy for the Information Age,\" Disruptive Publishing, and \"Relative Genealogy,\" Disruptive Publishing.  He has published two books on the subject of identity theft: \"Twelve and a Half Steps to Avoid Identity Theft,\" as an ebook, and \"Identity Theft in the Cyber Age,\" which is available as both an ebook and in print.  Revised editions of many of these are available as ebooks.   Dr. Leach has offered technical training and seminars on software reuse, reengineering, and testing on three continents.  He has lectured on a variety of other topics between continents!  He is also the author or co-author of more than one hundred technical papers.  In his spare time, he is the co-Editor of the Maryland Genealogical Society Journal and is webmaster for its newly designed website.", "related": [], "rank": 3059473, "title": "The 101 Most Important UNIX and Linux Commands eBook", "author": "Ronald J.

Writing is her passion, and that becomes evident once you begin reading one of her written works; her detailed paragraphs, and action packed pages draw you in and hold you hostage until the very last word. Though ‘North Philly’s Finest’ is the trilogy to look out for, it is only the beginning. Muffin can write on any topic, any genre with ease, and she never fails to leave her reader mesmerized! Her educational book, ‘1001 Things Your Child Should Know Before High School’ was featured in the Philadelphia Metro, and is a step by step lesson in elementary school mathematics, writing, and problem solving; while her hot new novel ‘The Arsonist: A Philly Inferno’, is searing its way into people’s hearts! She is scheduled to drop a new book on Christmas titled, ‘I Put That On My Life’. Muffin has been ghostwriting for years, and she has never failed to give her customers exactly what they were in need of; a gripping story line that will spark emotion in the most avid reader! Though writing is her first love, Muffin is talented on many levels, and she owns a small gift and greeting card company titled ‘Magical Moments By Muffin,’ where everything is originated, and personalized for the customers! Recently, Muffin has tried her hand at acting, and landed a small role in the upcoming movie titled ‘North Star’ starring Clifton Powell, Lynn Whitfield, Jeremiah Trotter, Keith David and more!

Of course I had to read them all. I look at writing as a continual\nlearning process--the more I write, the more I learn about it. More importantly,\nthe more I learn about myself. I wrote some interesting pieces, some first\nperson, some with animals as the characters delivering the greater message,\nsome with points of view that bounce back and forth--kind of like trying out\ndifferent tennis shoes or brands of coffee to see what suited me best--at the\nmoment.One thing I discovered was my\nrepeating theme--that old second chance, usually hindering on betrayal of some\nsort. I have lived through and seen the fallout of other people's bad choices,\nbut I have also survived and breathed the hope of the second chance.What I write is merely a\nperspective on something I've chosen to explore. Relationships in many forms\nintrigue me. So does moral ambiguity. I'm also a huge champion of the\nunderdog--throw bad stuff on a main character and just when you think she will\nsuffocate in the muck, she'll dig her way out and be much stronger for that\nvery muck. Love that stuff. I also write about people who make choices for a\nperceived happiness or because they aren't up to the task of the \"hard stuff\"\nof living. Sadly, they lose in the end, like Gloria Blacksworth, ofA Family Affair. They are also those\nlike my buddy, Harry Blacksworth, again ofA\nFamily Affair, who have dodged accountability for years and despise\nthemselves for it. Redemption comes in many forms and for those who can\ntolerate Harry's vulgar mouth and incessant womanizing to glimpse the fractured\nsoul beneath--there is hope for him.I'm offering these stories to\nreaders so they may see how certain novels evolved. Chunks of thought, bits and\npieces of a theme, all topsy-turvy but eventually smoothing out into a full\nnovel. Or two. Or ten. They are but meager offerings from a then-new writer who\nhad years of writing to experience.So, why am I sharing this with\nyou? Because the ideas sparked novels­­--lots of them. I never gave up hope for\nthat second chance. Of course I waivered--who doesn't? But I got up and\ncontinued on. Maybe you've written a story, composed a few lines of a song,\ncrafted a bookcase...you fill in the blank...and maybe you want to continue,\nimprove, perfect your skill.And maybe you should.

She is an award-winning author of ten published books for children and young adults.  Although born in Wisconsin, Karen grew up in the Northern Alberta town of Grande Prairie, where the Aurora Borealis flickered and shimmered across the night sky. The winters were long and cold, so cold her nostrils stuck together when she breathed too deeply, so cold her legs turned blue if she were foolish enough to go outside without warm stockings or pants, so cold she could hear the ice on the slough snapping and popping as she lay in bed at night. Winter days were short. It was dark when she left for school in the morning and dark when she came home. No matter how cold, she ice skated and played hockey, often by moonlight. When she was older, Karen curled, her favorite winter sport. She wishes curling had been an Olympic sport when she was younger, because she would have loved to try out for the Olympic team. In the summer, the sun rose very early and darkness didn't arrive until nearly midnight. Days seemed endless, wonderful for a child who loved to wander the countryside, either on foot or by horseback. And both the long nights of winter and the long days of summer were perfect for a child addicted to reading. After graduating from high school in Grande Prairie, Karen attended the University of Alberta, first in Calgary and later in Edmonton. She taught first grade for a few years, then studied journalism at the University of Utah. There, a class in writing for children unearthed her passion. Now living in Southern California, Karen continues to work at the \"play that she loves.\"", "related": ["B00IHUPJX8"], "rank": 2852116, "title": "Sexted! eBook", "author": "Karen Mueller Coombs", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With her support Katherine was included in choir, dance classes, acting classes, school plays, and high school color guard.

She overcame these medical obstacles surprising the doctors by living beyond their projected life span of twenty-four hours. Later, in her teens, she was introduced to the world of writing when she submitted a poem for creative writing class which got featured in the school yearbook. Her professional background has expanded from working with family owned business to Fortune 500 companies as an executive assistant. This led her to start her own virtual administrative business, Key Business Partners, LLC in 2007. Following an internal sense of purpose, she turned that enterprise into an online book promotional company that has helped numerous authors share their  personal message with others. In 2011, this native Floridian's true life purpose came to the forefront. As an inspirational writer, poet, and coach, this author is an advocate for people who want to realize and celebrate their own uniqueness. She serves as a reminder  that even though life can be challenging at times, each of us can choose to learn lessons and develop self growth from these experiences.  Teresa shares her passion to empower others to overcome their obstacles and realize their own voice through the celebration of self trust and love.

We have come to know of certain black tulips in our own time, including the demand which was created when banks started buying up mortgaged-backed securities and the resulting fall-out. Alexandre Dumas'sThe Black Tuliptakes us back to an early example of this in seventeenth-century Holland, where the cultivation of tulips of all colors was a pastime of the wealthy. The Haarlem Horticultural Society devises a contest to award the person who can grow a black tulip a prize of one hundred thousand guilders (which seemed to have been a great deal of money at that time). Naturally, because greedy human beings are involved, the race to be the first one to grow the black tulip compels certain 'tulip-fanciers' to go to any lengths - including incrimination - to win the prize. Cornelius van Baerle is an affluent tulip-fancier who has successfully cultivated many types of tulips. He takes up the black tulip challenge and gets very close but his envious neighbor, Mynheer Isaac Boxtel, discovers a means to get van Baerle imprisoned and hopefully executed so that Boxtel may grow the tulip and win the prize. Van Baerle would be ruined were it not for the beneficence and creative scheming of the jailer's daughter, Rosa, who falls in love with van Baerle when he is locked up in her father's jail, and maneuvers to save both him and the tulip.The Black Tulip'sbeginning is rather tough going for a modern listener, especially one not familiar with, or particularly interested in, the complicated political machinations of Holland four centuries ago. Dumas uses a rather lengthy, melodramatic exposition to explain the background of his main character, Cornelius van Baerle, and the ways in which this background was used to land van Baerle in prison on trumped-up charges, all in an effort to steal away the prize. IfThe Black Tulipwere written today, there is no doubt that there would be less discussion of this old Dutch political wrangling, but once listeners make their way through this, the twists of the plot draw us in and the exposition is neatly tied to the story's final thrilling conclusion. A fascinating story, intertwined with a true-love tale and some truly funny moments - including Rosa's sarcastic replies to van Baerle when he tries to convince her that he loves her more than the tulip - makeThe Black Tulipwithstand the more than hundred and fifty years that have passed since it was published, and the emergence of more modern examples of artificial demand. Peter Joyce, a stage, radio, and television actor, revels in the reading of Dumas's characters and this high-stakes story. He expresses the excitement of certain crucial moments - will Rosa succeed in convincing the prince of Boxtel's treachery in time? - through his beautiful and deep voice, carrying the listener with him through the telling. --Joanna Theiss, SoundCommentaryAlexandre Dumas is known mostly forThe Three MusketeersandThe Count of Monte Cristo. His novelThe Black Tulipdeserves to be better known, and Naxos AudioBooks has done something about it. In an excellently real audiobook, we are taken to late seventeenth-century Holland. There, the conflict between the Dutch and France is one theme of the book, and the obsession with tulips is another. Treason, deceit, greed and love drive the story ofThe Black Tulip. Peter Joyce gives it a highly dramatic reading that makes listening to the story almost compulsive. --Alide Kohlhaas, Seniors ReviewThe quest to grow a black tulip doesn't have the same narrative appeal as Dumas's COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO or THREE MUSKETEERS, but it provides adventure enough for those who love the great melodramas of the nineteenth century. Peter Joyce delivers a fine rendition of Dumas's meaty prose and is especially good at depicting villains and brutal jailers, less effective at conveying his nubile heroine. Although this is a lesser work by Dumas, the author s judicious detachment, voiced so well in Joyce's calm and untroubled delivery, holds the promise throughout that innocence will triumph and justice eventually prevail: The villain will be vanquished, and the power of the black tulip will somehow open the prison doors and unite the fateful lovers. --D.A.W. © AudioFile 2013, Portland, Maine", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

White is one of a number of rising chefs here who aren’t Italian but have felt the freedom to refresh the concept of Italian food.”—Associated Press “The future of Italian gastronomy, thanks to the spectacular inventiveness he brings to modernizing the world’s most popular cuisine.”—Gotham “I’ve watched and tasted as Michael White has matured into his current position as one of the preeminent stewards and pioneers of Italian culinary tradition in America. Even his signature modern dishes are as relatable as the classics—and are perhaps even destined to be deemed classics in their own right some day.”—Thomas Keller, from the Foreword “Michael White has, in very short order, grabbed the Italian food crown for New York City. He’s created some of the most exciting new dishes of the last few years at Marea, and his Osteria Morini is my go-to casual for date night. He is well in his way to ruling the world. And when that happens it will surely be a more delicious place.”—Anthony Bourdain", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Nelson was born in a little farmhouse on the prairie in eastern North Dakota in 1944. Some doctors made house calls back in those days. He remembers kerosene lamps, bathing in a large galvanized tub, and their phone number was a long ring followed by four short ones, and everybody in the neighborhood could rubberneck. (Imagine that today!) James has been telling stories most of his life. Some of his first memories happened during recess in a one-room country schoolhouse near Walcott, ND. His little friends, eyes wide, would gather round and listen to his every hastily-imagined word.  It was a beginning.  Fascinated by the world beginning to open, he remembers listening to the teacher read to all twelve kids in the eight grades. He was living in that same house on the land originally homesteaded by his great grandfather, when a savage tornado hit in 1955 and destroyed everything. They rebuilt and his family remained until the early nineteen-seventies when diversified farming began changing to industrial agribusiness (not necessarily a good thing.) He spent four years in the US Navy during the Vietnam War (USS Carbonero and USS Archerfish.) After the navy he worked many jobs and finally has settled on a few acres exactly two and one half miles straight west of  the original farmstead, ironically likely the very spot where the 1955 tornado first struck, which sometimes gives him a spooky feeling. He lives among goldfinches, chickadees, nuthatches, blue jays, crows, cottontails, squirrels, deer, mink, badgers, coyotes, wallflowers, spiderworts, sunflowers, goldenrod, big and little bluestem, switchgrass, needle & thread grass, June berries, chokecherries, oaks, willows, boxelders and cottonwoods, in the outback of eastern North Dakota.", "related": [], "rank": 1521623, "title": "New World Order Rising Book 2: The New Civil War", "author": "James W.

John and Carol Arnott model this tension perfectly and have now put it in their book, The Invitation. The task at hand of bringing light to dark places is great, and there is an urgency to be ready and full of the Holy Spirit. This book brings realignment to the reader to pursue the oil of intimacy, to be awakened to the hour in which we are living and to make an impact on the earth. You will be challenged, encouraged and equipped as you read The Invitation. --Bill Johnson, Senior Pastor, Bethel Church, Redding, CaliforniaFrom the very beginning of history, God has declared His intention to prepare a glorious Bride for His worthy Son. He has worked out His plan throughout history to bring forth a Bride who voluntarily loves Jesus with all of her heart and strength. In The Invitation, John and Carol remind us that God is looking for voluntary lovers of God. This inspiring yet practical booklet gives a fresh call to fully respond to the Holy Spirit who will empower us to make ourselves ready for that day (Revelation 19:7). --Mike Bickle, Director, International House of Prayer, Kansas City, MissouriEvery time I hear John and Carol Arnott speak, I am reconfirmed in my decision of 1994 to endorse the Toronto Blessing . Reading The Invitation has given me that same warm feeling as listening to them in person. If you are looking for a book that is focused on intimacy with Christ and is full of integrity, this is for you. Caution: this book could change your life! --RT Kendall, Former Minister of Westminster Chapel", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He started working in his father's hardware store on Nassau Street at the age of ten, where he could be found after school and every summer until high school graduation. In 1970 he started his apprenticeship as an electrician with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 269 of Trenton, New Jersey, and retired after forty-two years. In 1983 he became a volunteer firefighter with Engine Co. # 1 of Princeton, New Jersey. The combination of firefighting and construction work is typical of the blue-collar experience in \"any town\" USA. John has drawn on his forty-two years of experience in the construction industry to put his slant on what goes on behind closed gates and between the people who wear the hardhats. He sees the construction site as a life-form, a fascinating living entity, the success of which relies on the highly skilled tradesmen on the job.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For those who can remember the 1960s, that word brings to mind a hard, tired part of the country where stark black and white pictures spoke more than words ever could.  I was a part of that culture, and in the maturing evolution that eventually overtakes almost all of us, have come to have a deep appreciation of my roots and of the qualities of the inhabitants of that region.  Words like grit and determination and pride and perseverance come to mind.  In 1980, I left that world and moved to Florida.  I needed to test myself away from the comforting circle of family and friends to see if I had what it took to make a life of my own.  My husband and I ventured far afield of our roots and all that was familiar.  Though I moved far beyond that area in distance, I was never far from its influence.  I am an ordinary woman who took an extraordinary journey. I relived that journey of some 50+ years in a set of four books published in 2013 on Kindle and Amazon.  Each book dovetails into the next as part of The Crossover Series and were written under the pen name of Micala: “The Day After Yesterday” “From Here To ... Everywhere” “Crossing Bridges And Burning Others” “In Search Of Me” The book you have read ... and hopefully enjoyed, “Black Snow” is my first novel. I should say it is part fiction, because the subject ... global warming ... is real. I have been an active genealogist for the better part of forty years and have written seven books on specific parts of my family’s history.  I have also been a contributor to certain web sites devoted to genealogy.  I wrote and published a history of my Church in observance of its 20th anniversary.  I am humbled by the warm reception these other books and articles have received.", "related": ["B00BSGIA16"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As an Author, I try to keep my stories as tasteful as possible while still remaining true to my characters. The men in my stories are over the top Alpha males, who will do anything to get the woman that they have set their sights set on. If any of these things offend you, then this is not the series for you.  I do not write stories that leave you hanging in hopes of you having to buy the next book. My stories are complete and will not leave you feeling as if you were forced into buying a sequel. Though my books come in series, each book is capable of standing alone and can be read without having to go through a numerical sequence. I also go out of my way to keep my pricing fair to the reader, because these books are 'self-published' and they are not as long as a standard published book would be. I chose to self-publish these fiction books in order to build up a fan base. As is the case of any other writer, I am growing and learning daily. I am constantly researching and studying in order to better myself for the people who enjoy my books. As my fan base grows and finances come along with that growth, I can promise my readers the traditional published and edited books. Though I am not a world renowned Author, I do have a very vivid imagination and the capability to tell a very emotive and provoking story. I look forward to growing with you and for you, because in my world it is all about you the reader. I hope that you enjoy reading my stories as much as I enjoyed writing them for you.", "related": ["B00LF3R4WI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I absolutely love\nthem. I feel they are underrated and misunderstood. Growing up for\nme had been harder than any other part of life, and more so because of inner\nconflict. I'm hoping to shine a light in those dark places for young people with characters they can relate to, in a fantasy world where they can feel safe. One person sums up the essence of the saga in her review.\"They grow up too fast don't they? At least, that's what everyone says,\nand in Dianne Lynn Gardner's Ian's Realm trilogy, young Ian is certainly\n growing up--but he's not full-grown. After all, heroes aren't born,\nthey're nurtured with wisdom from mistakes, valor from battles, and\nkindness from pain. Ian learns all these lessons in this book as he\nsteps forward to take his father's place, and learns there's a lot more\nto leading than just saying no to potential followers.\"One note about the short stories that are now included with the novels.There's much more to the Realm\nthan what Ian is seeing in his short time there. There's legend, and these\nshort stories introduce us to the magic, and conflict that is stirring in the\nRealm. They are doors to future books as well, and some of them hold little\nnuggets bout Ian's story that you wouldn't see otherwise. I am really glad\nwe're including them with the novels this time. I'd like everyone to have the\nchance to read them.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She self-studied nutrition and natural healing modalities, including Aroma Therapy, Flower Essences, Bio-feedback, Theta Healing, Martial Arts, DNA Activation, Detoxification, Craniosacral Therapy and more. Using what she learned, she not only healed herself, but also became the author of the Japan's very first book on Raw/Living Food Lifestyle, “Hajimite Miyo Raw Food Lifestyle”, which was published in 2005.

In\nthat and many other regards, this novel is a unique specimen.  WTTFD is told from the\nprimary perspective of Rogan Dalait, a Green Beret medical sergeant, but the\npoint of view shifts from chapter to chapter and within chapters so the reader\nexperiences the Zombocalypse from multiple perspectives, rounding out the experience\nof joyriding with a Special Operations Veteran as he moves about his new world\nof wandering, flesh-craving bags of animated rotting meat. This story is unique to the\nscience fiction realm in that it is the first of its kind. Not the first\nmilitary-sci-fi-zombie novel--there's already somebody holding down that crown\nas a first-to-publish--but this is the first and ONLY zombie novel about a Green\nBeret battling through the zombie apocalypse, written by a\nGreen Beret. The tactics, weapons,\nthought processes and actions demonstrated throughout the book are A) part\nGreen Beret combatitives and B) part my imagination's way of dealing with\nevents where the odds are stacked against the protagonist. This realm is where\nGreen Berets thrive, hence the moniker \"masters of chaos\". Fomenting chaos is a\nlarge part of what we do in the real world, so I decided to keep it real-deal\nin WTTFD too. Trust me--Rogan Dalait\ndelivers on the chaos element and much, much more. Take a chance on this\nstory. I promise you that you have never read a story quite like this. I can't\ntell you what you'll feel--I can't guarantee you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll\nsnicker and rage and giggle and bite your nails wondering how the heck the\ncharacters are going to get out of each situation--but I can guarantee\nthat once you've committed to the story, you won't ever be bored.  That's a promise. This is\nan order: Enjoy the hell out of my zombie book. And thank you for your time and\nconsideration. You won't be disappointed.", "related": [], "rank": 1893271, "title": "Welcome To The First Day eBook", "author": "Rory J.
