That is the question that educators Bob and Judy Fisher set out to answer when they interviewed 104 hospice patients ages five to 98. There are no surprises in this slim volume: people talk about family more than work, and about living in the present. The book is organized thematically around topics like priorities, simple pleasures, regrets and forgiveness. This leads to some repetition and overlap, but also helps each chapter stand alone for individual study. The tone is comfortably conversational and liberally peppered with tie-ins to popular songs, although sometimes the authors' commentary gets in the way of their subjects' more powerful words. This is not a soul-shaking book, but it is an effective invitation to self-reflection. It stands out among the growing number of books about death and dying in that it is aimed back at the living: readers can find inspiration in these voices to make better choices in the here and now, find deeper joy in every day and live life with no regrets.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was six-thirty in the afternoon, and the ferocious heat of the day was beginning to give way to something a little more acceptable. Even so, it was still too hot for anything other than a pair of light chinos and a short-sleeved shirt.In one hand he nursed a whisky on the rocks, which he had been periodically sipping for the past half-hour, content to just sit back on the cushioned wicker lounging chair and watch the scenery. And the scenery was indeed magnificent. To the right, just a short walk from his bedroom, was a stunning infinity pool overlooking Santorini's famous flooded volcano. Meticulously manicured gardens swept around the pool and curved towards the drive, which had been impressively designed to give the illusion of dropping off the side of the caldera.He had forgotten how tranquil and soporific the place was, but then again he rarely visited the villa. In fact, appreciating scenery was something Theo didn't do much of. He simply didn't have the time. He lived his life between London, Athens and New York, controlling the vast shipping empire which his great-grandfather had founded and which was now his legacy. Taking time out was almost unthinkable.But then an eightieth birthday was not something that came around often and his grandfather's eightieth, to be celebrated in the villa on the very island where he had met his wife, was the equivalent of a royal summons. Most of the family members who lived on mainland Greece would be there for just the party, flying in on private planes which had been chartered for the purpose. Others, from as far afield as Canada, would be staying for the full week at the villa, or else hiving off to stay with other family members in other parts of Greece, some of whom they had not seen for a very long time.Theo planned to stay for three days only, long enough to pay his respects and toast his grandfather's health before resuming his ferociously work fuelled life in London.A taxi had stopped on the drive and he watched through narrowed eyes as first Michael, his brother, emerged from the car and then his companion.So this was it. He was finally going to see this mysterious woman who had suddenly appeared on the scene. It had come as a source of relief to everyone, not least his mother and his grandfather. Theo might be single, yes, but he ostensibly enjoyed the company of women. He was also a pragmatist and fully comprehended the advantages of marrying the right girl with the right connections. He would, he had once dryly told them both, be married by forty. In the meantime, they were not to interfere with his private life.Michael had always been another kettle of fish. Five years younger, he had always been a fragile child, prone to bouts of ill health. Whereas Theo had been sent to boarding school in England from the age of thirteen, something that had gone some way to giving him the hard-edged independence that had become the cornerstone of his formidable personality, Michael had been kept at home. Lina Toyas had not been able to face sending her delicate, sensitive son away from her. She had always worried about him and she still did. The fact that he had never brought home any nice girls to meet her had been just one more thing to worry about. He was shy, she knew, and shy men could often become lonely bachelors and that, for her, would have been a fate worse than death.The sudden appearance of a girlfriend had brought tears of joy to Lina's eyes.Theo, in receipt of this emotional telephone call, had been less thrilled.Things didn't add up and he knew, as a shrewd businessman, that if something didn't add up then it was most probably wrong.How was it that the name Abigail Clinton had never once crossed his brother's lips? Surely if they had been an item he would have mentioned her somewhere along the line, in one of the many calls he made to his mother in Greece from his home in Brighton? In fact, the girl's name had only been uttered a fortnight ago, when he had amazingly announced that he was engaged to an English girl and would be bringing her to his grandfather's birthday celebrations in Santorini.Theo had tactfully refrained from voicing any of his suspicions to his mother. He intended to use his brief stay at the villa constructively. He would watch, question and determine whether the girl was, as he suspected, after his brother's money. Because Michael lived in Brighton and ran a couple of restaurants and a nightclub did not mean that he was unaffected by the fabulous Toyas wealth. In fact, he owned a great deal of highly valuable shares in the company and the trust fund into which he occasionally dipped was well beyond most people's wildest dreams. He lived a modest enough lifestyle, and at first glance might just come across as being an up-and-coming successful young businessman. That, as Theo knew only too well, was only the tip of the iceberg, just his brother modestly disassociating himself from the vast fortune that was attached to his name. Anyone interested in tapping into the mother lode would only have to do some rudimentary detective work and he was pretty sure that was exactly what had happened.He was equally sure that he would do anything in his power to prevent his brother being exploited. Although he worried less about Michael than his mother did, he was still very protective of him. Michael trusted people, a huge drawback in life as far as Theo was concerned. To trust was to be vulnerable. Only fools were vulnerable.He sat forward, black eyes hard as he focused on the girl emerging from the taxi. She was slight in stature, with long, very blonde hair, almost white-blonde in fact, which fell down her back in one perfectly satin-smooth, straight curtain. She kept playing with it, lifting it with one hand into a makeshift ponytail and then letting it drop, and all the while she stared around her, lips parted, taking in the opulence of the surroundings.Clocking the price tag around Michael's neck, Theo thought cynically to himself.Still, he conceded grudgingly, the boy had taste. He couldn't see the details of the girl's face but she was neatly built with slim legs and very slender arms. A boyish figure, barely filling the short, strappy dress. Unlike him, Michael had never shown the least interest in the voluptuous, sexy girls that Greece boasted.He watched as suitcases were taken out of the taxi, his mind ticking along its ruthlessly logical path. When they disappeared from view he pushed himself off the lounger and sauntered into his bedroom, draining the remainder of the whisky in one gulp and dumping the empty glass on the sideboard in the room.His room was typical of most of the many rooms in the enormous villa. It was luxuriously but simply furnished. The stained wooden floor was dominated by a large, brightly patterned rug and the walls were painted a pale terracotta, an effective backdrop for the cream curtains that hung from floor to ceiling. Against one wall was an impressive Syrian chest embellished with mother-of-pearl and above that hung a darkly compelling painting of the island's famous volcano by twilight. The majority of the furniture was of dark wood, which gave the room a decadent, opulent feel.Theo barely noticed any of it. He was busy thinking, working out the best way to approach the girl without rousing his brother's suspicions or incurring his mother's displeasure. The latter, he thought to himself, would be slightly more of a challenge.And who, he thought with a small smile, ever said that Theo Toyas didn't appreciate a challenge?He was still contemplating the technicalities of revealing this gold-digger in their midst when, an hour later, he made his way to one of the sitting areas where he knew drinks would already be underway for the guests who had arrived. Not that many of them had so far. Most would be descending the following day, but on this first night there would essentially be just close family members. His grandfather, of course, and his mother, as well as uncles and aunts and their various offspring. And Michael and the woman.Drinks were being served in the sitting area which overlooked the back gardens. He had spent a couple of pleasantly invigorating hours here earlier on with his mother, arguing the practicality of lighting up the outside area with lanterns and had, as he had expected, lost the debate. As he entered the sitting area, though, he had to admit that the effect was stunning.The gardens seemed alive with giant fireflies and several of the guests were outside having their drinks, seduced by the romance of the scenery.'I admit it looks rather splendid,' Theo said, grabbing a drink en route and strolling up to where his mother was quietly contemplating the stage she had masterfully set.Lina turned to her eldest son and smiled. 'George likes it too. He fussed and fretted about all the effort involved, but look at him out there, puffing and preening like a peacock and accepting all the compliments. It is just a shame that your father is no longer around. He would have enjoyed the moment.'Theo slung his arm around his mother's shoulder and nodded. 'We haven't had one of these family gatherings since…since that wedding five years ago. Elena and Stefano.''They will be here tomorrow. Along with their two children.' Lina turned to him and gave him a long, critical look. She was, he freely admitted, the only human being on the face of the earth who could look at him like that and get away with it. 'It could have been you,' she pointed out, without bothering to beat about the bush. 'You are not a young boy any longer. This dynasty needs its heirs, Theo.''And they will be produced,' Theo murmured placatingly, 'all in good time.''Alexis Papaeliou will be coming,' Lina ventured. 'She would be a good match, Theo. Her grandfather grew up with George. They still keep in touch now, even though it is not as easy as it once was.''Papaeliou…yes the name rings a bell.

His family had been back in power less than six months and he was already sick of the toll it was taking on his private life. He hadn't spent five years leading a rebellion in the mountains so that he could be treated like a rock star. He'd thought they were fighting for bigger things. Now he wasn't so sure.The dark streets were pretty much deserted and only dimly lit by flickering street lamps. A lone car went by. Then a cluster of giggling teenagers, late for their curfews. As he started over the Gonglia Bridge, he passed a young woman whose eyes were strangely vacant; she seemed to gaze right through him. Her mass of blond crimped curls was wild around her pretty face, but that seemed to be a style that was popular these days and he didn't think twice about it. That otherworldly look in her eyes stayed with him, though, and when he reached the high point of the bridge's arc, he turned and looked back to see what she was doing.\"Hey!\"What he saw had him running back. The crazy woman was about to jump! In the half a minute since he'd passed her, she'd climbed out on the scaffolding and was leaning over the inky waters that rolled beneath, racing down out of the mountains toward the sea.\"Hold it!\" he yelled as he flung himself at her.She looked up, startled, and tried to avoid him, twisting away so that she was even more dangerously close to crashing down into the river. He grabbed her roughly. There was no time for niceties. Gripping her upper arm, he sank his other hand into her thick hair and yanked her back onto solid surface. She fell against him and he had just time to take in the soft, round feel of her breast as his palm unintentionally slid over it, before she turned on him like a scalded cat.\"Get away!\" she cried, glaring at him and backing away. \"Leave me alone!\"He grimaced, annoyed with her, annoyed with anyone who would make such an obvious play for attention as jumping from a bridge. And then her soft blue jacket fell open enough for him to see her body and he realized that she was pregnant. That put a different light on things. He winced, knowing from experience that a pregnancy could change everything—for everyone involved. He looked deeply into her wide dark eyes and saw something that tugged at his sympathies after all.\"I'd be happy to leave you alone,\" he said, trying to shave any harshness from his comments, \"if you think you could refrain from flinging yourself into rivers.\"She shook her head impatiently. \"I wasn't trying to jump.\"\"Really? You were doing a pretty good imitation of a bridge jumper.\"\"No, I was just looking for my things.\" She looked away distractedly. \"He…he threw them over the side of the bridge and…\" Her voice trailed off and she met his gaze again, her own eyes hooded. \"Never mind,\" she said, hunching deeper into her jacket and turning away.He'd only heard half her muffled words but he was willing to join in. \"What were you looking for? Maybe I can help you.\"\"No.\" She seemed to be trying to put distance between them. Glancing at him sideways, she began to move away. \"You can't help me.\"It was dark. He was large. And male. He knew he probably looked threatening to her. He didn't mean to. But what the hell? He had better things to do with his time than to follow a crazy woman around. So he shrugged.\"Fine. Have it your way.\"She glanced back over her shoulder. \"I will, thank you.\"He slowed, then came to a stop and watched as she hurried away. He supposed it was best to leave her alone, just as she'd demanded. Still, he hated to do it. She bothered him. There was something in the way she moved, to quote an old song.Besides, this town was only a few months into recovering from a war and the place was crawling with unsavory characters who had nothing better to do than to make trouble for someone else. It was a problem he and his brothers were going to have to deal with very quickly. One of many. And right now it could be a problem for this troubled lady.You can't save them all.Those words echoed painfully in his head and he shook them away. Gordon Greiva, his best friend and comrade-in-arms, had said that often in the old days when they'd been fighting for their country's liberation.Nico, let it go. You can't save them all.The irony was, Gordon himself had died in that final battle.No, he couldn't save them all. Truth to tell, he didn't have the greatest track record in saving much of any of them. And what could he do to help this one? Not much. She'd certainly made it clear she didn't want his help.With a careless shrug, he turned away and started back toward the other side of the bridge. He needed a drink.He heard the pub before he saw it, music and laughter an appealing invitation to step into the crowd. But he hesitated in the doorway, peering inside. He would love to go in, order Scotch, neat, and sit back and let that liquid fire burn its way into his soul, restoring him to something resembling real feeling again. It was tempting. He could see himself sitting there in the darkened room, letting the smoke and conversation wash around him while he contemplated life and all its twists and turns.But he knew that picture was a fantasy. As soon as he sat down, the waitress would look at him sharply, then whisper to one of the other customers. The buzz would begin as people craned their necks, staring, until finally someone would get brave enough to come over and start talking. And once the ice had been broken, the flood would come, people wanting to rehash the war, people wanting to know why everything wasn't instantly wonderful now that the good guys had taken over again. And who knew if it was a bar full of patriots or a refuge for disgruntled losers. You paid your money and you took your chances. But tonight, he didn't feel up to testing those waters.Turning away from the pub, he looked back at the river. He couldn't seem to shake the image of his distressed jumper, her wild curls floating around her face, her dark eyes filled with mystery. He wondered if she'd found what she'd been looking for, and if she was going to have any trouble making her way home. The bridge looked ominous from this angle, like a path into dangerous territory. The wet streets were empty. It was getting late and time for him to make a decision as to where he was going to spend the next few hours.He started down the walkway that fronted the river feeling vaguely uneasy, his hands shoved deep into his pockets, his gaze running restlessly over the scene. And then it sharpened. Something was moving down by the riverbank, where various debris was piled up around a short pier. He stopped and looked harder, then swore softly and vaulted over the river wall to get to the water's edge. It was her.A few quick strides brought him to where she was bending over a large black plastic bag.\"What the hell are you doing?\" he demanded.She looked up, startled once again. Straightening, she pushed at her damp hair, leaving wet strands plastered to her forehead. \"It's none of your business.\"She'd been crying. Once he saw the tears on her cheeks, he knew he was a goner. Itwasnone of his business, but there was no way he could stay out of it now. She was far too vulnerable. Only a cad would leave a woman like this to fend for herself in the night.Still, his impulse was to growl and start ordering her about. He restrained it. He knew enough about women to know that wasn't going to work out well. Taking a deep breath, he said carefully, \"Why don't you tell me what you're doing. What's wrong?\"She stared at him for a moment, then shook her head. \"Please, just go. I'm really busy here. I've got to find…\" Her voice trailed off and she went back to trying to move the huge plastic bag.Instead of leaving, he moved closer. \"You've got to find what?\"She shook her head and threw a hand out as though covering the waterfront. \"My bag. My things.\"He frowned. She could hardly be talking about this big plastic bag she seemed to be so intent on moving out of the way. He reached around her and moved it for her, revealing only more, smaller plastic bags, all filled with suspicious substances. It was obviously trash someone had stacked there, along with things that had washed up on the shore.\"What sort of bag?\" he asked her. \"What did it look like?\"She straightened and looked around, her bottom lip caught by her teeth, her eyes worried. \"I…I'm not sure…\"He resisted the impulse to throw up his hands. \"Then how are you going to find it?\"Tears welled in her dark eyes and she turned her head away, her damp curls flopping limply against her neck in a way that somehow touched him. He could see her finely cut profile against the lights from across the river. Her features were delicate, yet strong in a determined sort of way. Her body was slender despite the pregnancy. Her legs were long and exotic, like a dancer's, and her short skirt showed them off in a way that would turn any man's head. She moved like a dancer, smooth, fluid motion, like a song brought to life. But that thought made him want to laugh at himself for thinking it. He wasn't usually quite so sentimental.Then she turned and his gaze dropped to her full breasts and the way they strained against the soft sweater she wore under her jacket, and he felt a reaction so quick and so hard, it threw him off guard for a moment.\"I don't need help,\" she said, but her voice quavered and the tears were still in her eyes.Something caught in his chest and he grimaced. No, he wasn't going to let her get to him. At the same time, she obviously couldn't be abandoned here. He'd already noticed someone skulking farther down along the river. No, he was going to make sure she got to safety—wherever that might be.But he wasn't going to care. Never again. That part of him was gone—and good riddance.\"Just go away,\" she said, wiping her eyes with her sleeve. \"Just go.\"\"I'm afraid to ...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Izzy, fearful and mistrustful, soon meets the gently protective neighbors and hears stories of elves, ghosts and the monster stalking the nearby woods. Though warned against visiting the woods, Izzy gives into the pull she feels toward the dark woods with a long terrifying history.

Mere hours after lonely, dissatisfied Charlotte Lawrence has finally requested a divorce from her husband, Peter, she receives word that he has died in a car crash. Departing Brussels, where one of Peter's frequent job transfers had landed them, she returns to her home village of Hulme Welford. But retired father who is obsessed with gardening and a mother just a few degrees warmer than Medea do little to improve Charlotte's spirits, and she doesn't share her feelings of guilt with anyone. Worse, her meddling younger sister, Hilary, throws a dinner party, hoping to fix up Charlotte with new man in town, Alex Hamilton. Less than two days after her return, Charlotte is accused in church of already having slept with two men. The pranks, while humorous, have a bit of an edge, as when the local philanderer switches the town prohibitionist's nonalcoholic vino with something stronger at a fork supper, prompting a rousing rendition of Sinatra tunes from the smashed teetotaler. And some supporting characters shine, particularly the teenaged babysitter Tiffany, who drills her charges in math and helps Charlotte hunt for a job. With puce-colored hair and a decidedly postfeminist attitude, she's the freshest breath of air in this sturdy little English diversion.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B006Y0QZFO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The three of them along with a party of friends and Indian relatives endure harsh weather and forbidding terrain on their journey from the Wyoming territory to the coast, but the situation goes from bad to worse after they find and care for a badly injured woman, Lei Palua, who has escaped from a psychopathic gang whose leader, Kanaka Boy, vows to get her back. When Sam and his group are bushwhacked, their herd of horses stolen and Esperanza kidnapped by Kanaka Boy, Sam embarks on a rage-filled orgy of bloody violence.

Nearing the end I was regretting having to say farewell to the intriguing cast of characters, some of whom had become good friends. This is a wonderful read, just what historical fiction should be: beautifully written, historically accurate and, most important, an engrossing and thrilling read. Bravo! So I have now read the whole trilogy (THAT OTHER JUANA, A MATTER OF PRIDE, WIVES & OTHER WOMEN) a must read for all lovers of historical fiction. --Alain TomasThis is an excellent book: I started it last night and finished it this morning. I just could not put it down. I was taken into an area of history I knew little about. And what a story! The history I did at school was all about H VIII and QE I with barely a mention of Mary Tudor. The nine chapters about Philip's time in England with Mary quite overwhelmed me. Without a doubt the best historical fiction I have ever read. I came away with an understanding of Mary's horrible predicament and a great sympathy for her. And the chapter about her phantom pregnancy was so emotional and heartrending I shall never forget it. But every part of the story was fascinating and made for a superb read: the unfortunate Prince Don Carlos; his third wife Isabel de Valois; his mistresses; the court intrigue - all of it fascinating and wonderfully told. May you long continue with your research and writing for the likes of myself and many others who would enjoy reading more about other areas of history written so brilliantly an interestingly. --J. FairlambPhilip II of Spain could be forgiven for feeling rather depressed when he first set eyes on his bride-to-be, his aunt Mary Tudor, Queen of England, shortly before their wedding in 1554. He was a handsome fellow who was used to having his pick of Europe's most attractive women. She, aged 38 and 11 years older than him, had plain features, tended to squint because of poor eyesight, and had several teeth missing. She was certainly not the beauty that Philip had been promised. But their marriage was to be one of political convenience rather than love, as Linda Carlino points out in this historical novel, which completes her Spanish Hapsburg trilogy. Philip hoped the link with England would give him support during his struggles in Europe. Equally important was an urgent need for an heir. The bridegroom paid only a brief visit to his new wife's bed on their wedding night, and then went off to check on a pretty young thing he had spotted earlier. Poor Mary, daughter of Henry VIII, led a lonely life with a lot of ill health while her husband, who became King Philip II, went off to do battle or dally with other women. She failed to produce a baby and died after four years of marriage, to be succeeded on the throne by her half sister, Elizabeth I. Linda spent ten years on research before completing her first novel: the next two have followed more speedily. She says she has stuck firmly to historical facts in this book about the life and loves of Philip II, though she has used her imagination to splice them together in a colourful manner. Linda is now embarking on research for her next book, on the life of an illegitimate baby girl who was placed in a convent by Philip but went on to have a very adventurous life rather than the obscurity intended for her. She was too interesting to be ignored. --J.

She needs help to gather the sacred ingredients that will help her hatch her baby, an event that has never before been possible. The children are given magical feathers to travel through time and are tempted to use the powers of the sacred ingredients to solve their own personal problems. They soon find out that there are no shortcuts to overcoming troubles and that it takes courage and determination to face the obstacles that get in the way of success. Children who grew up loving Mary Pope Osborne's “Magic Tree House” series (Random) will enjoy this lively romp into the world of the mystical and magical. The story moves quickly, and the characters come with their own peculiarities, strengths, and weaknesses that endear them to readers. Though the book contains undisguised lessons in making good choices, the negative toll of lies, and the consequences of self-promotion, they do not detract from the adventure. The happily-ever-after ending is a satisfying conclusion to the trials and tribulations suffered by the children in their efforts to do the right thing and help a friend in need.–Debra Banna, Sharon Public Library, MA.

Realistic and gritty and yet still manages to purvey a sense of hope laced with down-to-earth northern humour. --The Chronicle, September, 2009Taking current events to a logical hyperbole, the author weaves an immediately grabbing, absolutely terrifying soon-to-be future. Without giving too much away (because this is one I firmly recommend reading) a cocktail of Iraq, China, Swine-flu, and all around poor human decisions bring about the collapse of society as we know it.But the book's broad-scope beginnings merely set the stage for a coming of age tale that is something of a mix between Mad Max and Stephen King's The Body. It is the characters in this story that really capture the reader and keep you turning pages well into the night. Let me put it this way; at 322 pages, the book is a respectable length and I took it with me to be my reading material on a three day trip - I was done with it in a day and a half.The boys the novel centres around are a charming mix of battered, world-weary angst, fun-loving immortals, and quietly introspective naïveté, and the perilous journey they make across post-cataclysmic Northern England is just the right mixture of suspense, humour, and characterization. The setting, like many of the characters, is gritty and hopeful at the same time. If you are a fan of Mad Max, or the recent video games Fallout 3 and Mass Effect 2, you'll find this book enormously enjoyable.In all, The Killing Moon is a fast-paced thrill ride with a pack of guys who could be anyone's best  friends. --Orion's Child Magazine, February 2010Testosterone and cordite waft off the pages of this post-apocalyptic tale from the very start. It's set in the near future, when escalating conflicts have led to the accidental release of a manufactured virus. The infection has wiped out most of the population, spreading panic and leading to the collapse of civilisation as we know it.Most of the action takes place 20 years after the cataclysm, and it centres on a group of young people living in a small settlement in northern England. Nature has reclaimed the cities and roads, and the survivors have had to adjust to life without modern conveniences or communications. Their rural community is slowly picking up the threads of life when three newcomers arrive. Their appearance soon shatters the peaceful scene, and the friends undertake a nightmarish journey to the Black City.Descriptions of the Black City aka Middlesbrough, and the decaying wastelands of the north are detailed and atmospheric. The importance of friendship is brought to the fore as the characters endure separation and hardshipRod Glenn doesn't hold anything back. It's full of the kind of casual violence that the prudish, the easily offended, very young children and those with high blood pressure or a heart condition should avoid.

In \"How to Comfort the Sick and Dying,\" a yeshiva student struggling to leave behind his drug-dealing, womanizing ways is sent by his rabbi to visit a man dying of AIDS, but guilt about his past and his inability to comfort the dying man spark a crisis of faith. \"Accounting\" is the sad tale of an aging father and a willfully optimistic mother forced to face yet another betrayal by their handsome, profligate son: \"Cleaning up after Eliot had become for them not only an act of penitence but an attempt to correct the balance, an effort to ensure that the world did not suffer a net loss on account of their son. For every debit inflicted by him they were obliged to provide, in the other column, a credit.\" In \"Henny's Wedding,\" it is 1943, and a young bride stumbles through her wedding ceremony nearly incapacitated by morning sickness. Younger sister Shirley, far from being embarrassed or ashamed, vows to make daring choices of her own, and quickly finds herself in the arms of a charming cad-the groom's brother. The collection's heartwarming finale, \"The Diviners of Desire: A Modern Fable,\" describes a different kind of courtship; set in Jerusalem, it pokes gentle fun at the labors of matchmakers. Throughout these stories, Leegant reveals herself to be an empathic, gifted creator of people and worlds. Thought-provoking and funny, touching and disturbing, this is an auspicious debut.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 2220100, "title": "An Hour in Paradise: Stories", "author": "Joan Leegant", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Each believer will find this book to be a magnificent help to see how God foretold and is in control of what is happening in our world. This is a great book! --Dr. David C. Gibbs, Jr.,Christian Law Association, Seminole, FloridaWe live in a time where the reporting of sensational events seems to appear in our news headlines every day. We read about great natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and record breaking storms. We hear of political upheaval at a pace we have never observed before and see how it is linked to financial issues that even a few years ago were inconceivable. Yet, all of these events are so clearly spoken of and predicted by the Word of God.Understanding the Timesdoes a brilliant job of bringing to our understanding the message of the prophets in the light of our experience. It is a balanced, accurate, and encouraging look at Bible prophecy. --Dr. Michael Edwards,Pastor of Heritage Baptist Church, Woodbridge, VirginiaMy consideration of Paul Chappell's book,Understanding the Times, followed a Sunday night preaching series at Southwest Baptist Church. The series included numerous sermons from Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and most of the Minor Prophets. I am of the persuasion that Pastor Chappell's title is very appropriate. God's people need not fear the times; we need only to understand the times. God has revealed clearly that He will fulfill His purposes upon Israel, upon His saints of this age, and upon an unbelieving world.Understanding the Timesis indeed motivation to wholeheartedly serve God.

Harry, 12, accompanied by a dog he finds, must provide for the two of them while avoiding the authorities who will certainly turn him over to his dreaded Cousin Elsie. On his travels, he meets physical and emotional challenges with growing confidence based on innate resourcefulness and sensitivity. The novel is sparely written but rich in details of time and place and especially in character. Even minor characters are vividly depicted. Adult concerns Harry must contend with (the death-dealing destructiveness of war, potential child molestation) are handled appropriately for young readers. The plot is engrossing, studded both with moments of drama and action, and quieter, more reflective scenes. Sights, sounds, smells, and emotions are all revealed with clarity and honesty. British terms and occasional dialect are discernible in context. The one real flaw in an otherwise superior novel is the resolution, which takes an unfortunate change of direction without preparing readers, a change that seriously undermines the magic of what has gone before. It also seems gravely unfair to Harry, who has undergone so much and matured so greatly. This concern aside, Kingdom would be an excellent selection for private enjoyment, for reading aloud, as a supplement to units on war, or as a discussion starter on the human capacity to survive extreme adversity. --Barbara Hutcheson, Greater Victoria Public Library, B.C., CanadaCopyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The Silent Female Scream argues that there is still room for considerable improvement. Rosjke Hasseldine, relationship consultant and psychotherapist, traces her personal journey from childhood to motherhood, as she brings into focus the struggles women face in order to be recognised in what is still a male-dominated world. Insightful and revealing analysis about female marginalisation is derived from autobiographical description of her father's withdrawal, animosity from her mother, strains in relationships and final break with her family after years of difficulty and depression. The often less dramatic tensions which are present in almost all women's lives benefit from comparison with Hasseldine's story and the case studies she uses: unequal gender dynamics are perpetuated not only by men, but also by the women who conform to complacent male expectation. The three parts of the book identify why women's voices are stifled, ways that their voices can be reclaimed, and finally, how such empowerment leads to stronger and more successful relationships. Hasseldine examines the compromises which arise as a daughter, professional, friend, and mother. Of particular interest is her insight into the mother-son relationship which too often goes ignored. The end of each chapter poses a series of questions encouraging honest reflection about one's own attitudes and behaviour, which made me realise how often I fail to challenge unfavourable situations. The Silent Female Scream celebrates the value of womanhood; it is perhaps wishful thinking to hope that men too might read Hasseldine's important and persuasive message.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He spent thirty years teaching in a Vocational School in Breifne Ui Ruairc, Leitrim/Cavan border.  He returned to his native parish in 1953 when he wrote Thiar i nGleann Ceo.

Here  are three books for capturing small critters, Hammond's in  colored pencils, Scott's in paints, and Wynne's in both. Hammond  is a highly accomplished artist with several North Light books  to her credit. Here she has developed a special graphing system  for beginners, primarily for drawing cats, dogs, horses, and  squirrels but for a few bears and tigers, too. It's an excellent  system for those intimidated by the variations of eyes, mouths,  ears, and feet found on our furry companions. Scott's approach  is for the advanced student who wants a more classically based  style for painting rabbits, ferrets, mice, raccoons, and foxes.  The influence of the Old Masters can be detected in her 41  mini-demonstrations and 16 full treatments in oil, acrylic,  gouache, and pencil. Wynne is a British artist who has painted  many well-known and royal pets, including the horses at the  Royal Mews of Buckingham Palace. Hers is a lovely, loose style  using either pencils or watercolors for cats, dogs, rabbits,  guinea pigs, and horses. All three books are recommended and  should prove popular.

Best suited for those relatively unfamiliar with children's services, the book examines the competencies in broad categories, succinctly defining core values and providing background and suggestions for building skills. The resource lists that end each chapter contain the occasional outdated title, but they also point to an impressive variety of sources, including materials produced by state associations and thinkers outside the library profession. The text occasionally relies on language geared toward female practitioners (Your goal is to be perceived as an expert adult, not a child in high heels) that isn't balanced by language geared toward men, a surprising oversight in a book seeking to welcome both genders to the profession. This isn't meant to replace standard texts such as Virginia Walter'sChildren and Libraries(ALA, 2001), but it's a fine resource for staff new to children's services and those who train them.–Adrienne Furness, Webster Public Library, NYCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

McCulley started as a police reporter for The Police Gazette and served as an Army public affairs officer during World War I. An amateur history buff, he went on to a career in pulp magazines and screenplays, often using a Southern California backdrop for his stories.   Aside from Zorro, McCulley created many other pulp characters, including Black Star, The Spider, The Mongoose, and Thubway Tham.

Thurman's writing in the past seven years, despite a tangent or two, displays the qualities that best serve a cultural critic: intelligence, curiosity, sharp wit and little tolerance for fools. There's an edge of imperiousness about Thurman, which is reflected in many of the people she writes about, such as the Italian performance artist Vanessa Beecroft, designers Elsa Schiaparelli and Rei Kawakubo, and Madame de Pompadour. Thurman writes primarily about fashion, its personages, trends and history, but there is room in this collection for some extracurricular interests, too; in addition to some fine book reviews and historical pieces, we get personal looks at the art of making tofu, the history of New York row houses and a lovely vignette of an evening spent with Jackie Onassis, smoking cigarettes and talking about men. Fashion, no longer ghettoized as a trifling women's concern, has grown increasingly popular in our cultural imagination, but it is ephemeral, dependent upon seasonal change. It is to Thurman's credit that she not only celebrates the creative exuberance of fashion but, in her intellectual probing, considers its lasting significance, too.(Oct.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Eight hours later, more than 5500 Diggers lay dead or wounded: the equivalent of all Australian casualties from the Boer, Korean and Vietnam wars combined. The phenomenon of Fromelles has captured the hearts of Australians all over the country. The story of Australia’s worst military disaster and the resulting international campaign to reclaim the lost soldiers of the Battle of Fromelles sparked national and international headlines, a military investigation and an archaeological dig to find the resting place of these missing soldiers. Lambis Engelzekios’s tireless investigation and Patrick Lindsay’s sensational resulting book Fromelles was the catalyst for much of this action. Fromelles has sold over 30,000 copies since publication, and now Hardie Grant presents the perfect version for fans of military history. An abridged version covering the battle itself, Our Darkest Day will intrigue military history fans who are keen to learn about this most infamous wartime battle.", "related": [], "rank": 1807500, "title": "Our Darkest Day", "author": "Patrick Lindsay", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I had written a Special Forces series already (another future series), but never a spy or secret agent novel.I didn't want to write just another spy novel, though. That had been done and redone, so I thought, if I couldn't write something unique, I wouldn't write one at all. And in the spirit of L'Amour, I asked myself, if L'Amour were to write an out and out spy thriller, what would it be like? My answer? All action!I've taken my thrill for action, tied it together with tension, and carried the plot through to a climactic ending. That first spy thriller became Dark Liaison, A Christian Suspense Novel.That's the short version. So, here's the rest of the story of just how my first two novels in the COIL Series came about.If you want to hear the truth, Dark Liaison was probably the most agonizing writing project I've ever encountered. My editor would certainly agree. The action/adventure/espionage manuscript was first written by hand, as I usually do with my first drafts. The initial Dark Liaison manuscript took only a few weeks once my research was complete. But it seemed too short at only two hundred and some pages. So I tied in a whole second conflict with the same villain from part I to make the novel longer. Inside two months of hand-cramped scribbling, I had close to six hundred pages of international spy action.However, my editor took one look at it and said it was too long for today's market and for a first book. She suggested I cut it in half to make two novels rather than chop its content to a shorter length. Thus, the first two novels of the COIL series (Dark Liaison and Dark Hearted) were born.And after two years of drafts, edits, rewrites, new beginnings, new endings, a dozen field tests, more tweaks, and a lot of prayer, I excitedly say . . . ebook readers, here we come!It's a lot of work to write a novel, but very rewarding. I hope you enjoy this book. I'd love to hear your thoughts on it when you are finished.-- David Telbat", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 28, "rating_average": 4.6429, "rating_total": 130.0}

Never happen.\"But let's look at something. The story mentions that Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian runner, holds the record for the fastest marathon at 2:03:59, set in September of 2008 at the Berlin Marathon when he was thirty-five-years old. That was true at the time I wrote the draft, but in September of 2011, Patrick Makau of Kenya ran the Berlin Marathon in 2:03:38. Makau's time is faster than that of Gebrselassie by almost a second per mile.The year before Gebrselassie's fastest run, he also ran in record time, at 2:04:26. That means in one year, he improved his time by 27 seconds, also about a second per mile. Makau improved the time yet another second per mile three years later. That's nearly a minute shaved off the fastest time in four years. At that rate, we'll see the final four minutes overcome and the first sub-two-hour marathon by sometime before the year 2030.How does that compare with shaving four minutes from the record before Gebrselassie took the record right at the 2:04 mark in 2008? How long had it been since the record was about 2:08? That was Steve Jones of the United Kingdom, running the Chicago Marathon in 2:08:05 on October 21, 1984. That's four minutes faster in twenty-four years, which projects a sub-two marathon by, yet again, around the year 2030. That's a pretty consistent improvement over a long period of time.I acknowledge the absurdity of predicting anything in sports with that degree of mechanical precision. But it certainly makes me think it's possible. I choose to believe the two-hour mark will be broken in my lifetime. I hope so.

The diary entries allow the\nreader to get inside Piccolo's head - to laugh along with her and to cringe at\nall of the embarrassing moments which occur in her life. She is an incredibly\nlikeable narrator who makes the best out of every bad situation. . . .What If The Hokey Pokey Really Is What It's All About?is an extremely\nfun read, and is both amusing and compulsively readable.

Banner (How the Indians Lost Their Land) identifies three central factors: the speed of white settlement, the extent of native people's political organization, and, most importantly, agriculture, which colonists equated with ownership. When colonists encountered indigenous farming people, the colonists recognized the natives' land ownership. Thus, when the British arrived in New Zealand, they conceded the agricultural Maori's property rights, and tried to buy the land. But when American settlers arrived in California, the non-agricultural native population struck them as primitive, and the settlers refused to acknowledge Indian ownership. Banner sketches the ongoing impact of these colonial encounters, underscoring that indigenous people's property rights today are based on what unfolded 150 years ago. Occasionally, Banner states the obvious, as when he notes that the British ability to take control of New Zealand boiled down to the Brits having more \"power\" than the Maori. Yet his overarching argument is an important one: dispelling the myth that colonization patterns were driven by policies set at home. This original and significant study will appeal to readers hoping to understand an issue whose ramifications are still felt today.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Whilst gifted academically and musically, she was not encouraged to  further her talents by attending university, and instead joined the  civil service in Scotland as an assistant press officer. In 1946, she  married Alastair Dunnett, who was at the time the chief press officer to  the Secretary of State for Scotland. He went on to become editor of The  Scotsman newspaper, whilst she later worked on a statistics handbook  for the Board of Trade. After a brief spell in Glasgow, the couple  settled in Edinburgh where their home became a centre for hospitality  and entertaining, mostly in support of Scottish art and culture. Dunnett  had also taken evening classes at the Edinburgh College of Art and the  Glasgow School of Art, and from 1950 onwards she established a prominent  career as a portrait painter, being exhibited at both the Royal  Scottish Academy and the Royal Academy. She was also an accomplished  sculptress. Her interest in writing developed during the 1950's. Her own  tastes took her to historical novels and it was her husband who  eventually suggested she write one of her own, after she had complained  of running out of reading material. The result was The Game of Kings, an  account of political and military turmoil in sixteenth-century  Scotland. Whilst turned down for publication in the UK, it was  eventually published in the USA where it became an instant best seller.  Other titles, such as the Lymond Chronicles and House of Niccolo series  followed and which established her international reputation. She also  successfully turned her hand to crime, with the Johnson Johnson series.  He is an eccentric artist, famous for bifocals, and of course amateur  detective. All of the titles in the series somehow also feature the  yacht 'Dolly', despite ranging widely in location from Scotland, to  Ibiza, Rome, Marrakesh, Canada, Yugoslavia, Madeira and The Bahamas.  There is plenty of sailing lore for the enthusiast, but not so much it  detracts from the stories genre; crime. Each of them is told by a woman  whose profession explains her role in the mystery and we learn very  little about Johnson himself, save for the fact he is somewhat  dishevelled in appearance.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Journeying from the history of sacrificial Judaism to the emergence of traditional Jewish institutional life and extending to today's New Jews who dwell in spaces both online and off, End Of The Jews is only the beginning of the process of excavation, analysis and self-reflection that continues to shape today's discussion on Jewish identity and meaning.Esther D.

As a mother of two children with autism, my dedication to their lives are even more pronounced than the normal parent, however, my sense of humor and the light that burns inside of me because of my children, allows me to earn the reputation of being the oldest living 10 year old on the planet. I am an amusement park junkie, music lover, martial artist, avid sports fan, and a writer. I attended the University of California, at Santa Barbara as a film major before transferring to Columbia College Hollywood to pursue filmmaking as a screenwriter. I have written two screenplays, one of which I tried in vain to produce as an independent film while still attending film school. Once I became a mother, my priorities changed but I never gave up my love of writing; thus here I landed, as an author of popular romantic fiction novels. With two books published so far, I hope to continue entertaining my loyal readers for as long as I can!", "related": [], "rank": 4750894, "title": "The Golden Horizon", "author": "Cherrone Davis", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Is it a thriller, a science fiction\nor a romance? I have difficulty answering that question before the book was\npublished. I just told my readers, \"I can't say anything.\"I've planned this story for two years (ignore the Author's Words in the\nbook--it's part of the story), but during that two years, I wrote two other\nbooks. I procrastinated to write this book as it requires a lot of effort, in\nboth research and writing. Eventually, when I decided to pen this, I knew it\nwould take a lot of time...and I was right.Instead of the typical nine months to complete a novel, I took fifteen months. I\nput in more hours daily too. In addition, the research for this novel was done\nnot just online, interviews or field trips; I had to play roles. For example, I\nwanted to check how easy it is to cancel a person's mobile phone line; I\ncancelled my own line. I wanted to check how easy it is to cancel a person's\ncredit card line; I cancelled my own line. I did all this subtly, so as to\nexperience how the protagonist would feel, and what difficulties he would face.The result is not justThe Perfect Story, but lots of information about\nsocial engineering. It turns out that in a developed country, manipulation could\nbe easier as people are complacent over security. It's really interesting to see\nhow we can get free meals from McDonald's or KFC--by just planning instead of\npaying.", "related": ["B008BGBO0A"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

[Die Erotik] is a philosophical and psychological reflection on the meaning and purpose of the erotic in our lives and how it is this primal force that simultaneously serves to connect us to the most basic and most transcendent aspects of our existence. . . . In this brief but important essay, Andreas-Salomé captures the essence of the erotic as a unifying force that serves as the grounding of our humanity. . . .The Eroticis not just an essential text of psychoanalysis: It is more than that and can stand on its own as an important and insightful text that would seem to be as relevant today as it was 100 years ago.”—James M. Hepburn,PsycCRITIQUES“The publication at last of Lou Andreas-Salomé’s book,Die Erotik(1910), in English is very welcome. Also welcome is the book’s introduction by Gary Winship detailing Andreas-Salomé’s close involvement with Nietzsche, Rilke, and Freud; her ethic of ‘sexual continence’ and ‘mental eroticism’; and her pioneering account of the erotic as less a matter of ‘interior pleasure’ than as a way of establishing relations with others.”—Janet Sayers, emeritus professor of psychoanalytic psychology, University of Kent in Canterbury; author,Mothers of Psychoanalysis“Until a few years ago I only knew of Lou Andreas-Salomé from her letters to Freud and her psychoanalytic writing on female sexuality. I did not realize that at the time she met Freud she was more famous (and infamous) than him and had published more widely. With a compelling introduction by Gary Winship, the translation and publication ofDie Erotikshows why a writer so deeply concerned with the politics of sexuality was destined to become such an important innovator in psychoanalysis; a source of inspiration and judicious criticism for Freud and one of his most intimate friends and collaborators.”—Ivan Ward, director of education, Freud Museum", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She selects and compresses the salient details beautifully; one often feels as if one is actually present at the scenes she describes. There can be no higher praise... Inconvenient People is as interesting a work of social history as you are ever likely to read\" -- Anthony Daniels Spectator \"The great gift of Sarah Wise's excellent Inconvenient People is to blow apart the myth that the most likely victim of the lunacy laws was a married woman... If much of Inconvenient People reads like a mood book through which Wilkie Collins might have flipped if stuck for inspiration, there are moments of high farce too. Wise is flexible enough in her narrative register to make it all right to find this very funny indeed\" -- Kathryn Hughes Guardian \"Deeply researched and gripping... The book owes its enormous power to Sarah Wise's patience. She has sifted through hundreds of case histories... It makes for harrowing reading, but much of it is also hilarious, and as gripping as the most lurid Victorian melodramatic novel.

I really appreciate you stopping by and taking a look. I guess in some ways I am an alternative medicine renegade. I talk about topics that, in my opinion, are critical for human health (mental, physical and spiritual). However, many people don't want to hear it because it places the responsibility for their weight and health squarely on their shoulders. I believe there is a health crisis in our country. We've all heard of the obesity epidemic and how children of grade-school age are being diagnosed with adult diseases as hypertension and Type II Diabetes. And, if the children are ill and overweight, then that means the parents are probably just as bad or worse. Indeed, there is a health crisis. But more than that, there is a crisis of personal responsibility. Giving in and 'going with the flow' is easy, at least for now. But sooner or later the piper comes around to collect with some sort of sickness, an unexpected condition that suddenly sobers the mood. And the truth can no longer be denied or escaped. That is why I have written this series of books. I want to use them to carry the message that EVERY weight loss goal CAN be reached with the proper mental artillery and physical preparation. I know what it's like to suffer with obesity and an eating disorder. Food addiction took more than 20 years of my life, and I want to prevent that from happening to anyone else. So here I am for all who care to listen.

I can't sing worth a darn but I know how to make kids excited about being outdoors and have a lot of fun doing it.      Although my expertise leans towards fire starting without matches, some would say that what I am really good at is how to convey skills to kids in a fun way.      Many leaders of groups are good at the organization (yet another weakness of mine) when it comes to camping etc. What I teach are fun ways of doing basic things like how to set up camp or cook dinner along with activities, games and projects. These projects are just as fun to do by adults as with the kids.       I have been writing a comprehensive book about fire for 7 years now including absolutely everything that I can find on the subject. I want it to be so thourough that 50 years from now it is still \"THE\" book about fire. (Portions of this book can be found in my e-books.) Included in it are ways to create smoke that attracts animals, what wood only burns when it is green, how to make torches, and over 100 ways of starting fires without matches. These include all of the chemical formulas, how to start fire with air showing the math that is involved in the process, starting fires with Canadian coins, or getting sparks by striking bamboo against bamboo.       Life is fun and kids are our future. Teach them all that you know, spend some time with them and create memories that you can think about when they have grown up and moved out. This is as much about making the parents happy as it is for the kids.", "related": ["B00CFQOFQ2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The author's guidance, through dozens of applied examples, makes the book an invaluable resource. Readers who learn well from examples will find the book to be effective training. At the same time that it offers practical examples, it also does an admirable job of covering the underlying principles of objects and their associated properties and methods.\" --Pat Bland, OptumHealth, The opinions expressed are those of the reviewer only, and do not reflect the opinion of OptumHealth or United Health GroupIf you are a SAS programmer who is ready to advance your programming skills, you should check out Michele's latest book about hash objects in SAS! Being able to use look-up tables is so basic for many SAS programming projects. Adding hash object programming to your DATA step arsenal can make your programming more efficient and more powerful than other look-up methods you are already familiar with (formats, merges, joins, etc.). Michele explains how to get started using hash object programming in SAS. She steps through typical examples to show you how, why, and when to do it. She might even convince you that hash object programming can actually be more easily programmed for complex look-ups than techniques you are already familiar with now. --Sue Hakomaki, OptumHealth, The opinions expressed are those of the reviewer only, and do not reflect the opinion of OptumHealth or United Health Group.\"Within the first 6 pages, you'll get the concept and start seeing applications in your own work. This book has all the detail you need to get you through simple and complicated uses of hash objects. You'll be surprised that you had not known how to use hash tables before. They are a particularly important tool for those using large data sets who want to speed up simple operations. And, if you run into code with hash object programming, this book will provide everything you need to understand and modify it.\" --Peter Graven, Research Faculty, Center for Health Systems Effectiveness, Oregon Health and Science University\"I knew this book was written for me when I read the opening sentence, Programming hash objects in SAS sounds like a geeky process, and then immediately saw examples using DATA step merge, PROC SQL, and the hash object to present problems and show how the hash object fits in the solution space. The book starts with a no-nonsense approach that continues throughout, illustrating all the concepts with clear examples. I recommend this book to anyone who needs to learn how to effectively use the hash object. If you have a limited time budget, the clear examples will quickly show you how the hash objects work. When your time budget expands, you can revisit the book to learn why the hash object works as it does.\" --Peter Eberhardt, Fernwood Consulting Group--Peter Eberhardt, Fernwood Consulting Group", "related": [], "rank": 609163, "title": "SAS Hash Object Programming Made Easy", "author": "Michele M.

He was raised on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, but in 2000 moved to Brooklyn, where he still resides today. He started out a graffiti artist, with a passion for comic books and drawing. But at the age of 21 he realized the written word was his true path. He considers himself the ultimate \"geek\", and he is not only a collector of rare action figures and old video games, but a history buff as well.   He spent his childhood digesting such movies and television shows as Doctor Who, Blakes-7, Star Wars, The Shining, Aliens, Dawn of the Dead, and The Incredible Hulk; his cartoon diet consisted of shows like He-man, Thundercats, Transformers, and G.I. Joe. He cites authors Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Ray Bradbury, Graham Greene, Jack Ketchum, Stephen King, Kurt Vonnegut, Charles Bukowski, Jules Verne, and even Lewis Carroll as some of his early literary heroes; one would see where he gets his inspiration from.   He is a freelance writer of non-fiction by day and genre fiction by night, and is probably best known for his short stories and novelettes. He has consistently covered science fiction, fantasy, and horror. He is currently the author of almost 400 published and reprinted works in pulp magazines, small literary journals, digital markets, and webzines viewed countless times around the globe. He currently has digital stories out with such places as Damnation Books and Steampunk Tales. His first \"official\" short story collection, FRESH BLOOD: Tales From The Speculative Graveyard, was released in spring 2009 by Sam's Dot Publishing. He is currently at work on many novella-to-fuller-length works for Kindle, Nook, Apple, Kobo, Sony and Smashwords. He also has a novel being shopped around.

He is bored, stuck at home with nothing to do, so when the wife of John Wickson, one of the town's richest men, asks Henry to investigate the brutal mutilation of her favorite horse, Henry jumps at the chance. The dead horse is just part of the story. Wickson is apparently into the Mafia for big bucks, and their attack on the horse was a warning. The police are getting nowhere identifying the mastermind behind the Mafia plot, so Henry's former boss \"unofficially\" asks Henry to investigate. His efforts culminate in a tense shoot-'em-up that will leave readers breathless. Skillful writing, a tautly woven plot, plenty of unexpected twists, and a main character who's both intelligent and appealing add up to a fine read.Emily MeltonCopyright © American Library Association.

Then a man collapses at her feet in the alley outside her saloon. She stops to help him and hears his last words, “Macgillivray, Culloden.” She has no idea why he has linked her name with that of a battle that took place in eighteenth-century Scotland. Meanwhile, a photographer, Eleanor Jennings, has arrived from Chicago, a Russian count with a love of gambling is hanging around the saloon, and a magician appearing in Fiona’s variety show may be up to something unsavory. There’s a lot going on, to be sure, but Delany stitches it all together skillfully, delivering a satisfying historical mystery filled with action and humor and starring a strong female protagonist. --Barbara Bibel", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Our undergraduate students already valued its accessibility, clarity of description and detailed coverage of English accents. The addition of further descriptions of languages other than English and in-depth discussion of issues in pronunciation teaching make the book highly recommended reading for our postgraduate students in linguistics and English language teaching, too.Leendert Plug, University of Leeds, UKStudents often ask me for books about phonetics and phonology, andPractical Phonetics and Phonologyis the first that I recommend. It is an excellent combination of theory and practice, with abundant resources and practice material both written and spoken, covering a large number of English accents and including outlines of some major languages. Presented in direct and easy-to-follow language, with first-rate diagrams and illustrations, it allows readers to study the subject as if they were attending a series of interesting lectures. This new edition is going to be a 'must' for all students of phonetics and phonology.Masaki Taniguchi, Kochi University, JapanI liked the second edition and I like the third even more. The book is carefully planned, diligently structured and clearly written. The contents are up-to-date; they are geared to the needs of newcomers to phonetics and phonology. There is a strong emphasis on the practical side: the reader’s understanding is tested repeatedly throughout the book with more than 120 activities. Many sound samples are provided for close listening and analysis. A highly recommendable book!Petr Rösel, University of Mainz, GermanyPraise for the Second Edition'...one of the most successful introductory texts in the field, as it manages an ongoing seamless combination of phonetic and phonological theory and areas of practical application. As a textbook it covers a vast amount of material, but is consistently successful in presenting only what is immediately relevant for the undergraduate/ EFL level it is aimed at.'--Linguist List, 2008'I have used the first edition ofPractical Phonetics and Phonologyin my teaching with great success -- my students were very enthusiastic about it. So I am delighted to welcome this second edition, which contains many additional goodies.'John Wells, Emeritus Professor of Phonetics, UCL, UK'An impressive combination of  academic research and educational applications. The invaluable and updated resource for the students of phonetics and phonology.' Masanori Toyota, Kansai Gaidai University, Osaka, JapanPraise for the First Edition'...gathers together a far wider range of topics than other books on English phonetics. Many more accents of English are discussed, and we really learn about English as a world language.

She grew up in a variety of different homes, including a riverside shack with no electricity or running water, and even a tent.

Despite the difficulties of this lifestyle, she wouldn’t swap it for all the luxuries in the world (though she is rather fond of her running hot water and indoor plumbing now!) She met her husband in ‘Family Therapy’, an elective they were both taking as part of their psychology degrees. It took several years for them to get together, in fact, their roleplaying characters got together before they did! They married on the beach at sunrise in 2002, two months after Rinelle popped the question. Although she had always loved to write, it wasn’t until her daughter was about eighteen months old that Rinelle started writing seriously. Probably not the best stage in terms of having spare time! And time only became scarcer when her daughter gave up her day sleep six months later.  But by then, Rinelle had well and truly caught the writing bug, finding time somehow to continue with her passion. Her fast typing speed learnt from spending way too much time chatting on IRC, and the investment in an iPad when they came out, helped immensely. Rinelle now lives on acreage with her husband and homeschooled daughter. In her spare time, she sells stock photography through an online site to support her family, and is hoping that writing will be able to add to that.", "related": ["B00K94J2OW"], "rank": 285715, "title": "Forbidden Planet (Worlds Apart Book 1) eBook", "author": "Rinelle Grey", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 17, "rating_average": 4.1176, "rating_total": 70.0}

At least until the music stops . . . and we're left with nothing but the bills. And the interest payments. And the sleepless nights. (And what do you mean you're taking my stuff back?!)Personal finance experts Laura McDonald and Susan Misner realize that most of us never let it get quite to that point, but we've all got our little indulgences. You know, those small things that can become big things if we don'talsoindulge in a little financial responsibility.10 Ways to Stay Broke . . . Forevertakes you through the best ways to squander your money and short-change your financial future, showing you what all these good times are really costing you, what you can do about them, and how much more fun you can have later if you apply a measure of restraint now.Their goal is to help everyone understand (and enjoy!) the difference between sustainable spending that allows you to build wealth and needless spending that will leave you, well, broke. Indeed, having money in your pocket is a good feeling, but having money in the bank means possessing power, possibility, and opportunity— and nothing feels better than that.

At the age of 15 his father, a businessman, was robbed and murdered so he had to leave school to work full-time in several British manufacturing firms to help support the family. At the age of 38 he retired from employment to become a full time writer. Allen - together with his wife Lily and their daughter, Nohra - moved to a small cottage in Ilfracombe, Devon, England to pursue a simple life of contemplation. There he wrote for nine years, producing 19 works. He also edited and published a magazine, \"The Light of Reason\". His most famous book, As a Man Thinketh, is now considered an all time classic self-help book. Its underlying message is that noble thoughts make a noble person, while lowly thoughts make a miserable person. Allen died in 1912 at the age of 47.", "related": [], "rank": 4978819, "title": "Through the Gates of Good", "author": "James Allen", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was governed by Dragon gods and magick gods, called Deuces. A confluence of natural and supernatural events created a shift that allowed them physicality on the Earth plane. Some of those gods took advantage, and to their surprise, they became human and fell prey to the sensual lure of humanity. Angels dispatched to regulate the situation also fell to the lure of human love. The Tryah-an angel, a Deuce and a Dragon-tried to stop the proliferation of half-human/half-god offspring, known as Crescents, by inciting war. The violence caused the energy to shift back so suddenly that the island sank. The inhabitants made it to the mainland, but the wayward gods and angels were trapped between their home and the Earth plane. Over these last centuries, Crescents have learned to keep their magick hidden. Because of their god essence, they can see demons and creatures Mundanes humans cannot. Crescents straddle the razor's edge of the Hidden and the normal world, fighting dark elements as well as the dissension between the three classes of god progeny. It doesn't help that they are all confined to the Miami area, because they require the energy in the Triangle to feed their god essence. Technology has made it much harder to hide their true natures. And their passions. There are burdens and dangers and wonders in being a Crescent. You must always remember the wonders, my dear. Because you are a Crescent.", "related": [], "rank": 1323118, "title": "Dragon Rising (The Hidden Series)", "author": "Jaime Rush", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 17, "rating_average": 4.0588, "rating_total": 69.0}

One of the stories I tell in Seek This, Not That is how and when that changed and the impact it had on me.  A little background on me: I grew up in a small Iowa town in a large family (one brother & six sisters). Growing up in Iowa was great - wonderful people and good values. In 2010 I was at a crossroads. I had a good paying corporate job, was healthy and surrounded by friends and family, but something was missing. I was burned out with the corporate world and needed a change of scenery. In 2011, I left my corporate job and moved to Arizona to follow my dream of owning my own business and escaping the cold winters. My business, Smartful Coaching, provides Business Coaching, Life Coaching and Motivational Speaking. In my spare time, some of my favorite things to do are travel, listen to live music and spend time with family and friends.

Roosevelt's Oval Office; the rest of\nthe story takes place primarily in 1999, with frequent flashbacks to the 1940s\nand '60s. The various timelines' twists and turns introduce many new\ncharacters, and offer clues to the primary mystery. As the action builds toward\nthe book's climax, the puzzle pieces click satisfyingly and unpredictably into\nplace. The authors skillfully manage the multiple time frames and large cast,\nand never leave any plot threads dangling. The book's science-fiction element\ndrives the major plot twists, but the most engaging scenes are those in which\nreaders learn the real relationships and histories between the characters. kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/mf-thomas/seeing-by-moonlight/  IndieReader - 4.5 Stars SEEING\nBY MOONLIGHT is an intriguingly dark thriller, with enough twists and turns to\nkeep the reader turning pages up until the rather surprising conclusion.

Author Belinda Tors chronicles the life of Margery Arturo as she suffers for twenty years in an abusive relationship. Financially dependent on her husband, and having two growing children, it takes a lot of courage for Margery to finally free herself from the relationship. Fortunately, she finds the courage to stand on her own. What sends a chill down my spine is that there are a lot of women out there who continue to suffer in their relationships. The most impiortant lesson from this book is for women not to be scared to break out of an abusive relationship. After she left her husband, Margery's journey is not very easy, but things eventually look up. And the most important thing is that in the end, she learns to stand on her own and course her own destiny.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While another short story, ‘BRANDI AND THE TRENCH COAT MAN,’ was adapted to a screenplay by Film Maker Josh Allen and became the short film entitled:  ‘EVIL WITHIN.’  It has since been taken to various Film Festivals from Louisville, Kentucky to Los Angeles, California.    One Screenplay; a Romantic Comedy called, ‘FIRES OF EVA’ has been optioned to 'S Entertainment' in Canada - The film company that produced the movie ‘PUMP UP THE VOLUME’ Starring Christian Slater.     Another Screenplay, a Comedy called, ‘SÉANCE,’ was Quarter Finalist in the 2002 'Next Success Writing Contest' in Hollywood, CA. Actress Kathy Najimy has read this script and expressed strong interest in portraying the character ‘Rebecca Spritz,’ once a Director has signed on to it. Other scripts include: An Action/Suspense/Thriller, ‘WASTELAND STALKERS.’  An Action/Adventure/Thriller, ‘LEAVING BABYLON.’ And a Horror/Drama, ‘DEADLOCK.’     Brad’s first Novel, ‘THE MELTING’ is a Horror story stemming from Vengeance of the Dead. This is a truly original first novel and has been endorsed by Horror veteran ANNE RICE in her statement:     “Brad, Congratulations and all blessings on The Melting. You know the secret; it’s courage. We need you and your work.”    Brad’s second Novel, The Fictional Biography of a Warlock called,  ‘TROPAES,’ is the story of a man born in 1822 with certain metaphysical powers that develop with each year of his life. By his 28th birthday, he has acquired full power and ceases to age from that moment on. This story spans his lifetime up to the year 2005.       Brad third Novel is a murder mystery full of deceit, mystery, murder and mayhem called “DAMEN BRIAR.”   And now he has unleashed the Two Volume set of books featuring his complete collection of short stories - TENDRILS; Book I -Creepy- and TENDRILS; Book II -Crawly-.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

(They're still from the kindergarten word list.)  They're words like garden, hippo, and mouse.Also, I used very different words for each game page.  So, on the page with the duck photo, the words are Dog, Doll, and Duck.  (I didnotinclude a word like \"bird,\" that could confuse a child. After all, a duck is a bird, too.)  That makes it easy for the child to know which one is the correct word. This is my first book using interactive software.

I say 'most' because we're always learning, and I certainly can't say that I 'have arrived'or know it all. However, I do know enough to tell you that, if you are struggling with your weight or health, fasting could be theAce in the Holeyou were looking for. If you are ill, I cannot 'guarantee' that you will be healed. What ICANtell you is thatEVERYperson that I have coached through a period of fasting hasALWAYScome away better off than they were when they began.In terms of weight loss, there isn't anything on earth that can burn the pounds as quickly as fasting. I know of people who have lost 50+ pounds in merely ten days. Yes, a lot of that weight is initially water. Nonetheless, those are pretty exciting numbers, wouldn't you say? The bottom line is this: Fasting(or any other weight loss program)cannot help you if you aren't willing to make permanent eating-habit changes. If you want to lose the weight and keep it off, youMUSTrelease the old (completely) and embrace a new (clean and healthy) eating structure. I really cannot emphasize this enough. You can fast for 100 days and lose every last ounce of flab from your body, but if you haven't thoroughly planned out what you will eatAFTERthe fast, then it is a mathematical certainty that youWILLregainALLof the weight. Some people get mad at me for being so blunt; they call me insensitive. But am I? In my humble opinion, I'm here to give youTHE FACTS,not pie in the ske bye and bye, right? So please: I applaud you for your interest in losing weight and improving your health. However, remember that the process doesn't end when the fast is over.Actually, it is there that you will either create new eating and lifestyle habits that will sustain your progress, or you will succumb to the old and go back to square one. Now that isn't to say that you have to be perfect, or that if you make a mistake and regain some of the weight, that you wasted your time. No. If, in your heart of hearts, you are walking forward with the full realization that your old way of eating (and behaving towards food) needs to change, then youWILLmake progress. For these reasons, I want you to pay close attention to the last chapter where it talks about thePermanent Weight Loss Diet.THAT, is the eating structure that kept me from regaining all of the weight. Why? Well, it is low-fat and bans sugar and junk food. But, most of all, it works because it gave me an eating structure. In the past, I would eat whatever, whenever and, as you can guess, many (most) times my choices were not good. By blindly following a structured eating plan, I no longer have to'think' about what I'm going to eat. I just follow what is on the menu, and that's that.While at first it was tough and I resented it, today I can firmly say that, without the structured plan, I would not have made it. I'm not saying that you have to agree with everything that I outline on the diet, or that you have to follow this plan for the rest of your days. Certainly, in the measure that you get good at eating with structure, you can enhance the plan to include foods that you personally enjoy. In the beginning, however, when we are fresh off a fast, we need something solid to hang on to. ThePermanent Weight Loss Dietdoes exactly that. Use it as a tool in your journey towards optimum health. If there is something about the diet that you disagree with or cannot stomach, then veer your way around it.But don't throw away the baby along with the bath water. One gentleman, for instance, wrote me a few weeks ago, angry because I talk about eating 'six' meals daily rather than three. He indicated that, by doing so, I was advocating astatus quothat made me lose credibility. I respect everybody's opinion. And, by all means, there is a specific reason why I talk about eating six meals daily rather than three. When we come off a long-term fast, the digestive system is in a state of dormancy, hibernation.Since the body viewed the period of fasting as a crisis (like being shipwrecked and having nothing to eat), it will have a tendency to'hoard' fat 'just in case' another crisis hits. Eating small, regular meals gives the body time to 'relax' and realize that there's no danger; it keeps the inner furnace (metabolism) burning at an even level hour after hour. In short,  the six-meal structure is invaluable in helping the body stabilize after a long fast, and it starts to give the body a different (and better) feeding routine (one based on smaller, more frequent meals rather than larger, infrequent ones).In short, the success of your fasting efforts will depend on what you do once the fast is over. Keep that clearly in  mind going forward and you will have the right perspective; you won't be deceived into thinking that you can fast and then go back to eating 'whatever.' Visualize yourself releasing a box into a bottomless abyss. The box, ugly, dirty and old, has the words \"old eating habits\" scribbled on it. Once you release it, a new, shiny box emerges; written on it in bright, large letters is \"new eating habits,\" along with the words, shining in yellow like the sun, health, life... freedom!  And so you have seized the solution: Following a structured eating plan for at least one year after the fast is over will maximize the benefits you received and transform your mind and body in amazing, unfathomable ways.

Then one day she quite calmly asked me for a book of her own!\"  Bedtime stories and his daughter’s request would lead to the first book in the Seren trilogy. 'Ellie and the Rabbits' in which our young heroine meets a group of talking rabbits. \"My main goals were to induce a sense of wonder for my daughter, a sense of purpose and the importance of helping others.\" A short book of poems for children followed and the sequel 'Ellie and the Dragon' was released in August. The trilogy was completed and published in December 2013 with 'Ellie and the Battle.' “One of my proudest moments was completing ‘Ellie and the Battle’, reading it to my daughter and she understood the message I was trying to convey.” Darren was interviewed for his local newspaper recently, for more details please see www.derehamtimes.co.uk (please search for Darren Lewis) Facebook Page   https://www.facebook.com/Ellieandtherabbits", "related": [], "rank": 1600120, "title": "The Seren Trilogy", "author": "Darren Lewis", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 24.0}
