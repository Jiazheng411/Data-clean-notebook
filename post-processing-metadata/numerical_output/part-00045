A fly on the wall might say the man teaching law could only be Italian. One thing was certain. With his striking Latin looks, impeccable tailoring and autocratic stare, Lorenzo Domenico could hold an audience spellbound. Women had stampeded the law school to secure a place in his class and on this first morning they outnumbered the men ten to one. Lorenzo Domenico might be new in town, but he was already a legend.Lorenzo paced as he spoke, pausing occasionally to shoot an impatient glance at his adoring audience. He wanted to check if they were listening. He intended his standards to be the highest on the faculty. He'd worked hard, and now he expected that same application from his students. He tested them constantly, often in the most unexpected ways. In Lorenzo's opinion anyone who possessed a photographic memory could pass an exam, but could they fathom the intricacies of law and come to the best result for their client? He called it lateral thinking. Some of his students called it unreasonable; they were the ones who didn't make it through the course.Along with heading up the scholarship programme he had agreed to mentor a pupil barrister at the top flight chambers in the city where he had tenancy. Multitasking was his speciality, intolerance of those who couldn't keep up his only failing—though his adoring Italian mother would have disagreed, and persuaded him he had no failings. Lorenzo smiled. Mama was always right.Pausing mid-stride, he checked his register. There was someone missing. Instinct made him glance out of the window. He tensed. 'Will you excuse me? That wasn't a question,' he added as a groan of disappointment rose in the lecture theatre. He was already halfway through the door. The student who was late had just slammed her rusty old bike into his pristine Alfa Romeo.'You cannot wipe it off,' he roared, exiting the outer doors like an avenging angel. He had arrived just in time to see the young woman's pink tongue flick out to wet her finger.'It's a very small scratch,' she explained, her green eyes rounding with sincerity. 'Oh…' The blood drained from her face. 'Hello…'He stood motionless, taking in the facts. Whichever way he looked at it, this was bad.Carly paled as her mind absorbed the information: Carly Tate crashes into the car of her senior tutor Lorenzo Domenico on her first morning in his class. Not only that, she'd just received a letter to say he'd been appointed her pupil master in chambers, plus he chaired the committee for the Unicorn scholarship; the scholarship she had promised her parents. How much better could it get?No prizes for guessing his thoughts: Oh, no, not her again! Shortly followed by, Do I associate with failure? She could hardly pretend the fiasco last night had escaped his notice. And now this! To distract them both she pointed to the damage on his car. 'You can see how small it is…' But now she looked again the gouge seemed to have grown.'Small?' he said with a curl of his lip.No wonder she hadn't recognised him last night. Since arriving in the UK Lorenzo Domenico had barely settled long enough to register a shadow. Winning a no-hoper case in his first month in town had raised his profile to the extent that the clerks who managed his diary were looking at a twelvemonth waiting list. Lorenzo wouldn't be returning home any time soon—or ever, if the rumours were to be believed—so it was time to build bridges.Fast. 'I'm really sorry about your car—''You will be.' He cut her off crisply.He hadn't been dubbed the scourge of the courts for nothing. What a perfect start to her scholarship hopes! Her fellow pupils had all landed some elderly old duffer who schooled them in an atmosphere of calm and dusty academe, while she had scored Torquemada, Chief Inquisitor.She had been so sure she could deal with a man like Lorenzo Domenico when she had first read the letter, in fact she'd been rather thrilled, but there was a huge gulf between the written word and the man standing in front of her now. And ominously his socks were tartan, suggesting he was poised to dance a jig on the grave of her ambition. But she wasn't going down without a fight. 'I think you'll find that the scratch will polish out—''Do not presume to practise your advocacy skills on me, Ms Tate.' His eyes turned cold. 'Take a look at my car.''Very nice—''I mean the damage to my car, Ms Tate. Look at that. If you examine it closely you will see that the scratch will not polish out.'She shook her head like a wayward pony, sending shimmering auburn curls flying round her shoulders. He admired the hair, but it distracted him. She was a student and his sole purpose in life was to whip her into shape.'I can hardly see it,' she protested.Her determination to fight pleased him. He liked a fight. 'And avery smallscratch on a hired car will affect my deposit how,MsTate?' He would drive her hard like all his students. Time was short, and they had to learn more than the letter of the law, they had to absorb an immeasurable lexicon of nuance and interpretation. If they weren't up to it, it was better to find out now. 'Come on, come on,' he goaded her. 'Aren't you supposed to be a lawyer?''I am a lawyer,' she retorted, holding his gaze.Another rush of pleasure hit him. He didn't want his students to fail; he wanted them all to excel—even this sorry excuse of an MC. 'You may be a lawyer one day,' he said, 'but not yet. And if you're late for my class again, you never will be. You will fail the course and lose your chance to be considered for the scholarship.''I'm really sorry—''Sorry doesn't cut it with me, Ms Tate.''Verysorry…'She raised her head to confront him in a way that almost made up for her blunders, because now he caught a glimpse of a strong inner core. She would need that when she stood up in court. Her face was easy on the eye too. Though not glamorous or attractive to him, she had a fresh-faced look he found appealing. After all the painted sophisticates he'd been introduced to on the so-called social scene she was a refreshing change.And then there were his students. His impression of them to date was that the females were slightly less good-looking than the men, which, as a serial heterosexual, was a serious concern to him.He'd read the report on Carly Tate, as he had read the reports on all his students. She was the brightest of the bright, but was she right for law? That was what he meant to find out. But if she was going to work with him she'd have to clean up her act. For instance, what was she wearing? A jacket with bald cuffs, which she had teamed with ripped and faded jeans, and on her feet something that looked as if she had made them herself out of a couple of hides and a yard of ribbon.She hadn't made the slightest effort to impress, which insulted him. She looked as if she'd just climbed out of bed, which enraged him. Women should be chaste and available and waiting for him to notice them. His eyes darkened as he pictured his ideal woman waking slowly and languorously with the memories of the previous night still heavy in her eyes, and on her plump, perfectly formed lips…Why was he staring at her lips? Did she have a milk moustache?Clearing her throat, Carly made that her excuse for swiping a hand across her mouth.Charming! Such grace and style, these Englishwomen. 'So,' he rapped, staring at her, before turning to look at the one thing that could distract an Italian man from thoughts of family, football, fashion or fornication: his car. 'What do you intend to do about the damage and my claim for reparation?'She recited the relevant passages of law to him flawlessly, but then, remembering the preliminary notes he'd circulated prior to the course, he realised what a good teacher he was. 'I see you've read my notes.''OfcourseI have,' she said, pinking up again.'I'll leave you to report the damage, in that case,'he said coldly. 'Arrange for repairs and keep me informed…'He was pleased to see how well she responded to instruction. But as he turned to go he could have sworn she clicked her heels. He almost swung round to challenge her, but then contented himself with the thought that dealing with troublemakers was something he excelled at. He loved trouble; his career had been built on it.Reaching the entrance to the building, he stopped and turned abruptly. Her cheeks flamed red as he fixed a stony stare upon her face. Pleased with the effect, he moved in for the kill. 'As you've already missed the main thrust of my lecture I'd like you to return home and dress for court.'Her face brightened. 'Court?'There wasn't a student barrister alive who didn't ache to ease the tedium of study with some real-life drama in the courtroom. 'Yes, court,' he said evenly. 'I left my wig and gown there. You can collect them for me.'It amused him to see her eyes fire bullets at him while her face remained carefully blank. He revised his opinion of her again—upwards. She'd make a great lawyer if she possessed the will to do so. But he hadn't finished with her yet. 'You can't go to court as my representative dressed like that.''Oh, don't worry about me,' she said, starting to gather her spilled belongings. 'This suit will brush down fine.' Retrieving some rag from the gutter, she shook it out.'In case it's escaped your notice, Ms Tate, that suit is covered in mud, and you work under me now.' An unfortunate turn of phrase, perhaps, but too late to call it back. He added some iron to the mix. 'I forbid you to go to court dressed like that. What will people think?''That I can't afford cleaning bills…?'There was such an expression of innocence on her face he considered his grounds for launching a rebuke uncertain. Everyone knew that pupil barristers existed largely on fresh air and the charity of their parents, plus her face was already flaming with mortification, and his intention had never been to crush her.

When the girls and boys secretly explore an abandoned coal mine on a double-dare, they become witnesses to an explosion caused by a stranger and ultimately aid the police in solving the mystery. The characters are well developed through their dialogue, actions, and relationships with one another. Fans of the earlier books will want to read this engaging novel to decide for themselves who really wins the war.–Rebecca Sheridan, Easttown Library & Information Center, Berwyn, PACopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Son of an Italian mother and a British soldier wounded during WW II, Pietro struggles to come to terms with his mother's death from cancer. We travel with him to Vermont, where he frantically pursues his American high school classmate Laura; to the balmy California coast, scene of their painful breakup; to Oxford where, as a lab assistant, he undergoes therapy with a female psychiatrist who helps him overcome agoraphobia, insomnia and depression. In the unconditional love of his Dutch-Belgian wife Hannah and their children, Pietro at last achieves an emotional anchorage. Faulks, a former literary editor of the English newspaper the Independent , has written a wonderfuly insightful book that reverberates with epiphanies large and small, a celebration of life in all its beauty and tragic brevity.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The New World tells of Viola's journey to the New World, brilliantly capturing the hope and fear of settlers in search of a new life. \n \nPatrick Ness told Amazon exclusively that he wrote it \"as a huge and deeply-felt thank you to readers. I've had so many questions about Viola and what her life was like before that I couldn't resist the opportunity to reveal just a little bit extra. I knew these things - they're vitally important to her as a character, even if they're not directly in the novels - so it felt like a secret trip I could take readers on. The challenge was to make it work on its own, too, so anyone could read it. That was really, really good fun, and I hope the final result is an exciting one.\"\n \nThe New World can be read before or after the trilogy – and some readers may choose to do both. The story works as a standalone piece, but readers already familiar with The Knife of Never Letting Go will learn more about Viola’s life and the events leading to her arrival and first encounter with Todd, while newcomers to the trilogy will discover a white-knuckle ride of an introduction to the series.

I added in no uncertain terms that if he didn't like it, he'd need to get on a plane in order to kick me out of the office. He laughed and agreed. Knowing that this was a $100m/year business, I immediately started sweating bullets. But from that point on, I was selling--both myself and our company's services--and practicing my ABCs (Always Be Closing... the deal that is). Luckily, success ensued, and a few months later I was awarded the job permanently. So why this book? When I started in the GM role, I had little idea of what a GM was meant to do. The title does give you a good hint as to what's required; kind of like General Electric tells you the company has something to do with electricity. But one thing's for sure, I couldn't ask my boss, as I'd just spent a good deal of time convincing him that I knew what I was doing so that I could get the job. While there is a plethora of literature on the different aspects of leadership, management, and marketing, it is rarely brought together in a useful form. A wise person once said, \"There is no such thing as coincidence.\" If something works once, and you understand the how's and why's, there's a damn good chance you can get it to work again. And if the concept also happens by some stroke of luck to agree with some sort of academic theory, then by classic triangulation you have something that perhaps is worth documenting. It doesn't matter if you're working in good times or bad, at the end of the day solid, common-sense management practice will serve you and your team well and allow you to achieve the results that you deserve. So enjoy the book, and I hope it helps you avoid calamities and produce results that are far from \"lackluster.\" Stay Scrappy ! - Michael", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's the story of brave young Prince Esfandiyar's battle with his country's aging soldier hero Rostam (whom English-language readers may have encountered in Matthew Arnold's narrative poem ``Sohrab and Rustum''): a task ordered by Shah Goshtasp, who fears either his son or his enemies may dethrone him. The tale exudes as much ironic fatalism as romance, and comes to a powerful conclusion with the stated realization that the defeat and humiliation of a national hero is a sin that must be expiated.

Well, this was my chance, and I didn't care if it would seem odd to the others if I got my salad before going back to the table.I reached for a plate and got in line behind Mr. Gorgeous.He dropped fresh mushrooms onto his bed of lettuce then looked around at me. \"Hello again...Ginny, isn't it?\"I was surprised but pleased he remembered. \"Ginny North. Ginny with a G. And you are?\"\"Pete Adams.\"I picked up the nearest tongs and put something on my plate. I wasn't watching what I was doing. I was looking into Pete's eyes.

I--\"I shut up before I started begging him to take me away.\"Blind date, huh?\"\"She asked me if I'd do her a favor and go out with him.\" I shrugged. \"We're not hitting it off too well. He doesn't talk much.\"\"I wouldn't think so,\" Pete said with a glance at the hulk.\"Huh?\"\"Sorry,\" he said with a wry grin. \"He just doesn't look like the talkative type.\"\"Right.\"We rounded the end of the bar where the crackers, croutons, and dressings were grouped. I grabbed the first handle I came to and looked down to drizzle the dressing over the stuff on my plate. Ugh, I'd blindly picked out most of the things I didn't like and was now covering it in ranch, my least favorite dressing.\"I don't usually butt in on a date,\" Pete said as we left the salad bar, \"but you don't sound like you're having much fun. I'll be in the bar for a while. You can join me there if you like.\"We'd come to the point where we had to part ways and stopped.\"Thank you.\" I drew in a deep breath. \"I'll probably take you up on that offer.\"\"See you later,\" he said with a wink and a heart-stopping smile.

Ball, Ph.D., is an independent entheogenic researcher, writer, novelist, and musician.

His most recent books on entheogens include Being Human: An Entheological Guide to God, Evolution, and the Fractal, Energetic Nature of Reality, and The Entheological Paradigm.  Martin earned his Ph.D. in Religious Studies in 2000 with an emphasis on Native American traditions, shamanism, comparative mysticism, entheogens and religion, Buddhism, and the philosophy of science and religion.  He began his independent writing career with Tales of Aurduin in 2003, applying much of what he had learned as a student of religion and culture in shaping a vast fantasy epic.  It took several years to complete the four-book project, complete with invented languages and glossaries.  From there, Martin branched into writing non-fiction works on entheogens and spiritual/mystical experiences where he has documented his own explorations and insights.  Recently he has focused primarily on a nondual interpretation of entheogenic experiences and their use as tools to reach unitary states of awakening and personal transformation. Martin's books are challenging, entertaining, insightful, and often radical.  He's not afraid to be himself and call it as he sees it, always pressing for deeper clarity into truth and personal awareness of the unitary nature of being.  His fiction works on multiple levels simultaneously, melding philosophy, spirituality, and dynamic storytelling, all told through the lives of engaging characters that defy conventional categories.  With the release of Beyond Azara, Martin is excited to be returning to the fictional worlds and ideas he first explored with Tales of Aurduin.", "related": [], "rank": 3551475, "title": "The Fate of Miraanni (Tales of Aurduin Book 2) eBook", "author": "Martin W.

Located outside Houston, the village–turned–town was situated on the gradually sloping lands that marked the approach of the Texas hill country. Children, playing with abandon, filled the streets and parks, euphoric with the months of freedom stretching out before them.Katherine Blake felt equally enthusiastic about summer. Especially since it meant vacation Bible School this first week of June. It was one of her favorite activities at the church. There was much to love about being minister of the warm, caring congregation, but there was something so very special about anything involving the children.And she really loved it when she got to sub in one of their classes. She rarely had the opportunity to step out of her administrative role. However, because they were short of volunteers, everyone hadbeen reined in to help on this first day. And Katherine had drawn the class of five–year–olds.Surely it was one of the Lord's many wonders— the amount of energy a room full of five–year–olds could generate. With no children of her own, Katherine appreciated every moment of her time with the many who belonged to the church. And she tried not to think about how much she longed for children of her own.\"Katherine, can you round up the paints and brushes for the art project? Oh, and the clay, too. I want to get started and take attendance.\"\"I'll get right on it, Donna.\" Katherine didn't mind the grunt work. She admired Donna Hobbs, the teacher of the class. Twenty–seven years old, bubbly, a pretty blonde, she was one of the best Sunday School teachers in the church.As Katherine collected art supplies, she checked out the children still entering the classroom. As they continued parading inside, she suddenly recognized two of the miniature faces. Tessa and Annie from the grocery store collision!It dawned on Katherine why Tessa had looked so familiar. She was new to the church—her family had just joined recently. The Spencers had changed churches because they wanted a stronger youth program for their family, which included a teenager and two younger children. Tessa had been visiting her grandparents when the family joined Rosewood. Katherine had only glimpsed the youngest child lastSunday, when her parents had retrieved her from the children's church service.Pleased to see her new friends, Katherine approached them. \"Tessa, Annie. Great to see you.\"\"Hi!\" they greeted her in unison, still somewhat shy. But their grins were welcoming.\"Are you the teacher?\" Tessa asked, her face puckered in anticipation.\"Actually, I'm the helper.\"\"Daddy says I'm his best helper,\" Annie confided, losing a touch of her shyness.Katherine smiled as she met Annie's large blue eyes, which were filled with bashful pride. The child was a charmer. \"I'm sure you are the very best helper,\" Katherine agreed.\"I help, too!\" Tessa added, not wanting to be outdone by her friend.\"Oh, I'm sure you do,\" Katherine replied seriously, although her eyes danced with amusement. What a pair!Since Donna was trying to quiet the class, Kath–erine left them with a wink. But throughout the morning, she found her gaze wandering toward the winsome duo.The time spent with the five–year–olds was as much fun as Katherine had anticipated. When Donna called for the closing prayer, Katherine was nearly as disappointed as the children to see the class end.asked Katherine to man the classroom door while she escorted some of the children out to waiting cars at the front drive.Glancing down the hallway, Katherine recognized Annie's father striding down the hallway. His purposeful gait didn't match his surroundings. Michael Carlson looked like he belonged atop a steed or perhaps the modern–day version—a massive Harley. She shook her head at the notion.\"Mr. Carlson—\" she began with a smile.But he cut her off. \"I'm here to pick up Annie and Tessa.\"Although his words were controlled, she could see that he was angry. She wondered why.\"Of course. They're right here. We certainly enjoyed having them today.\"\"This one time had better last Annie.\"Confused, she watched as he began to shepherd the girls out of the room. She snagged his sleeve. \"Mr. Carlson? I don't understand. Is something wrong?\"\"Annie was here without permission. Tessa's mother didn't mean anything by it, but Annie won'tbe back.\"\"But why not? She seemed to enjoy it so muchand—\"\"We don't go to church. Ever.\" Katherine felt his distress in her own soul. \"Oh, surely you can't mean that!\" \"I said it and I meant it.\" \"Perhaps if you and your wife discussed it—\"\"My wife's dead.\"Stunned, Katherine was silenced for a moment, even though her eyes flicked to the ring he still wore. \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be insensitive. But I do hope you'll reconsider about Annie.\" She paused, sensing his loss, knowing words couldn't dilute it. \"I'll be praying for you and your family.\"His blue eyes met hers, the darkness in them hiding what she guessed was a wealth of pain. \"Don't bother.\"The children in tow, Michael strode through the hallways, slowing down only long enough to accommodate Annie's and Tessa's shorter legs.He kept up the pace as they left the church and drove rapidly toward home.But he couldn't stop thinking about Katherine Blake. He had been aware of her in the grocery store when they met. In fact, she'd lingered in his mind. And again today when he spotted her, he'd felt an unwelcome jab of attraction. It wasn't something he was ready for.Michael could still see the compassion in Katherine's eyes. But he had seen similar expressions all too often after Ruth had died. He didn't need the pity of dogooders, certainly not from lady Sunday School teachers.He and Ruth had just moved to Rosewood and only attended the local Methodist Church a few times when she became ill. Staying home to carefor her and the kids, Michael hadn't realized then it would be one of the last times he'd enter a church.No, he and his kids didn't need anything from anyone… not anymore. There had been a time when he had begged, pleaded. But that time was gone, never to be recovered.Once at home, Michael took over for the babysitter, Mrs. Goode, who was happy for the rare opportunity to leave early. Tessa and Annie retreated to the world of Barbie dolls and make–believe. His son, however, was more practical.\"Dad, I'm hungry,\" David announced, shifting from one leg to the other in an impatient dance.\"I know. You'll have to wait until it's cooked.\"David tried to finagle. \"We could order pizza.\"\"By the time the pizza could get here, I'll have dinner cooked.\"\"But if we order pizza, you wouldn'thaveto cook. You could read the newspaper or watch TV.\"\"Nice try, David. But you need your vegetables.\"David sighed, a heartfelt groan of disappointment. \"Then, can I eat at Billy's?\"Michael stared suspiciously at his son. \"Any special reason?\"\"Well…\" David hedged.\"Why?\" Michael insisted.\"His mom's areallygood cook,\" David finally admitted.And it went without saying that Michael wasn't. So much about their lives had changed since Ruth's death. So many things he felt his children had beencheated out of—things he couldn't compensate for or replace. But he had to try.\"It's important that we eat together as a family. Why don't you see if Billy wants to come over, instead?\"\"Uh, if he does, could we have somethinggood?Like pizza?\"\"We already covered that, David. No pizza. So, you going to call Billy?\"\"Nah.\" With seven–year–old resilience, David scampered away.Dinner was a quiet affair. The children picked at the overdone pork chops and soggy cabbage. Clearly David could picture the pizza he'd been denied. And Michael dreaded the difficult task ahead of him.Once the dishes were stacked in the dishwasher, Michael approached Annie, who was in her room enthralled with her new toy stove. \"Hey, princess, you have a minute?\"She looked up, her sweet smile melting his heart. \"Sure, Daddy. You want to play?\"Obligingly, Michael sat down next to his daughter, trying to fit his long legs into the cramped floor space between the stove and all its accessories: miniature bowls, pans, silverware and mixer. \"What are we playing?\"\"Dessert. I'm baking ahugecake.\"Feeling his love for his precious daughter swelling, Michael smiled. \"What kind of cake?\"\"Chocolate!\" she chirped, opening the door to theplay oven, her imagination filling in where reality stopped. \"Good. My favorite.\"Again she looked up at him. \"I know. That's why it's chocolate.\"His heart completely undone, Michael accepted the small plastic plate filled with part of an Oreo cookie. He took a bite, then waited a moment. \"This is delicious, Annie.\"Obviously pleased, she broke into a grin.\"Thanks, Daddy.\"For a few moments he enjoyed the bites of cookie, accompanied by water served in tiny teacups. But he knew he had to tell Annie, to get this over, even though he dreaded doing so. \"Princess, I need to talk to you.\"\"About what, Daddy?\"He paused. \"Honey, you can't go with Tessa to vacation Bible School tomorrow.\"At first Annie's small face reflected only confusion. \"But why not, Daddy?\"\"We don't go to church,\" he replied, not wanting to meet the questions in her eyes.Then her lips quivered as her face crum...", "related": ["B0055PRNXC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

To my mind, Fantasy is the true blank canvas of creative fiction allowing an author to construct elaborate and innovative worlds...free from all constraints. In epic fantasy, a writer can bring the full weight of his or her imagination to the creative process, unfettered by the need to respect existing convention and structure.The primary influence and inspiration for the Journey series springs from my loves of the tales of King Arthur and his knights of the round table. To my mind, this cycle of stories, in its many incarnations, is the foundation upon which all western fantasy is constructed. As I began to develop the story line for this first novel, it was my intention to pay homage to the myth and legend that is King Arthur. This is by no means a retelling of those great legends...rather; it is an elaboration on the concept of some of the pivotal characters in the original tale. In the first novel of this series, the weaving of the Arthurian lore into the fabric of the story is so subtle that it may go unnoticed even by the most devoted of Arthur fans.Islena Doraux's story is actually one that evolves along three parallel levels and this approach to the tale has allowed me the latitude to craft a story that can be a triumphant epic saga on one level and personal tragedy on another. This has also afforded me the opportunity to constantly challenge the reader's perception of who Islena Doraux is and continually force them to re-evaluate their opinion of this complex and mercurial character throughout the course of the series.Islena is an intricate, complex woman...though there are times in the story when she seems brutally intransigent. She is a woman of strength and unflinching determination, who thrives on challenge, but whose refusal to compromise makes her seem cold and inaccessible on occasion. There is a duality to her nature of which she is only obliquely aware as the first novel begins. She has only vague inklings regarding the existence of this duality, but the truth of her exact nature is revealed in small increments during the course of her arduous journey through the antiquated world. Islena has a rather unique passion and vocation and my decision to portray her in this light is my one grudging nod to realism...In the course of this novel, Islena is forced to flee hundreds of leagues through harsh terrain in the face of unrelenting enemies, enduring food deprivation and even physical abuse and extreme duress...something a woman without Doraux's specific physical credentials simply would not have possessed the wherewithal to survive. I can say that Islena Doraux has been the most difficult character I've ever created...perhaps this can be attributed to her conflicted nature. Whatever the reason, Islena has certainly presented some interesting challenges from the creative perspective, but her character has still been a pleasure to create and develop. This novel is the first of what I anticipate will eventually turn out to be a six book series...dividing into two distinct, but connected tales. The first three (possibly four) novels will deal with Islena Doraux's epic quest through the Land of Shades, while the final two volume segment will be a sequel (of which Islena will not be a part) that takes place some seven years after the conclusion of Islena's tale.", "related": ["B008HJS896"], "rank": 3885915, "title": "Journey through the Land of Shades eBook", "author": "George Straatman", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This work would appeal to students of early American studies, American history, and women’s history.(M. Susan AnthonyJournal of American Culture)Meacham has studied and interrelated a broad variety of primary sources for this book: diaries, letters, account books, probate inventories and wills, cookbooks, court and local government records. The result is an eminently insightful, readable, and usefully annotated history.(Carolyn CooperTechnology and Culture)This book does a real service in putting free women's work (enslaved women receive far briefer attention) at the center of colonial experience... With its focus on the methods and organization of alcohol production,Every Home a Distillerywill appeal to anyone interested in early business history.(Ellen Hartigan-O'ConnorCommon-Place)Meacham offers an engaging, thoughtful analysis of the gendered nature of alcohol production, using original sources and challenging historians to think in more complex ways about colonial men, women and gendered labor.(Monica D.

This book provides an important look at the gendered production of alcohol. It is useful to anyone interested in colonial history, women's history, or the history of alcohol.(Gina HamesJournal of Social History)What is instructive about Meacham's book is that it examines the whole landscape of drink production and consumption in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and explores the linkages between domestic and commercial output, the tavern trade and the nature and impact of alcohol drinking... An interesting, well-written book that makes an important contribution to the literature.(Peter ClarkEnterprise and Society)Anyone interested in daily life in the colonial Chesapeake would certainly benefit from reading this work.(Alexa S.

BertelsenGastronomica)Meacham's study is a welcome addition... By focusing her narrative on the production side of the alcohol market, Meacham establishes the basis for the ultimate microbrewery—the home, but, in her case, the plantation.(Linda L.

The premise of the book captured my interest so I duly downloaded it. And, I loved it! The story is utter nonsense, let's be honest - recreating Jesus Christ through cloning?! But, it is written in such an engaging manner that I found myself drawn in unwittingly. Mid-read, I actually broke my ankle and I found myself begging my family to bring my Kindle to the hospital so I could continue reading the book! I would recommend this highly to any one else, with the proviso that they suspend belief and read it for what it is - a truly interesting and captivating piece of fiction!Five Stars: By Mr. A. Zabinec (Notts, UK)Browsing the Kindle store for something to 'unwind' me, I chanced upon this excellent gem of a book. To my mind, the Author mirrors perfectly the Biblical events of Jesus' birth 2000 years ago and the subsequent 'Revelations' predicted for our time. The Characters are totally believable, able to deduce and thwart the plans of the Americans and British governments and to hide the true Messiah. A well thought out and researched book by the author, I was totally absorbed in it from start to finish. Believers & non believers alike will enjoy this thumping good read!!!Five Star \"Pageturner!\" By Ultramum (UK)Great book ... as I said in the title a real page turner ... some of the science lost me slightly but it didn't detract from the reading ... I really got involved with the characters and didn't want to stop reading and turn the light out without reading just one more chapter...", "related": [], "rank": 363657, "title": "The Messiah Conspiracy - A gripping page-turning Medical Thriller - [Omnibus Edition containing Book 1 & Book 2]", "author": "IAN C.P.

They also know\nwhen you step-out of your truck before daylight where you're going, what you'll\ndo, how you'll hunt, and what time you'll leave the woods. They know more about\nhunters than hunters know about them. Therefore, you have to forget everything\nyou know about turkey hunting and hunt these turkeys as if they're deer. A PhD gobbler is one of those bad birds, usually with a name\nor a reputation. When a well-known turkey hunter comes to camp, that's the\nturkey everyone wants to see him try to take. Rob Keck, once the executive\ndirector of the National Wild Turkey Federation, explains, \"When I get into a\nhunting camp, and my guests ask me to hunt a turkey with a name, they'll\nusually let me out of the truck and tell me where to go to try and hunt that\nturkey. As soon as I see the tail lights of the truck disappear, I try to get\nas far away from that spot as I can and find another turkey to hunt. If I'm\nsuccessful, when my guest comes to pick me up he'll say, 'That bird doesn't\nlook like Old Sloughfoot,' to which I respond, 'Well, he's the bird that\ncame-in when I called,' and I never say a word about not hunting that named\nturkey.\" Question: Why did\nyou pick the people as subjects in this book?Phillips: As\nprofessional hunters, the men in this book have to hunt turkeys every season\nand in several-different states. The more turkeys you hunt, the more PhD\ngobblers you'll encounter, and the longer you hunt, the more you'll learn from\nthese ole, smart birds. Everyone can remember the tough turkeys they've had to\nhunt better than they can recall the easy turkeys. Everyone who hunts a tough\ntom learns another lesson in his or her program to master the sport of turkey\nhunting. I asked each of these master turkey hunters to share with us the\nlessons they've learned from these old birds. All of them are also personal\nfriends. I've hunted with most of them, and I respect them and their abilities\nto take toms.", "related": [], "rank": 1473240, "title": "PhD Gobblers", "author": "John E.

Not a killer at heart, Daniels leaves the band after a bloody melee.

She is the co-founder of Brown Essence, Inc., a small publishing company that has set out to put a realistic face on the problems in the African American community. With six authors and eight books within three years, they are hoping to become a household name in the literary industry. Brown is the co-author of Stages, a self-motivational book filled with inspirational words of wisdom; Saying Nothing, Writing Everything and The Minds' Chaotic Episodes, collections of poetry where the many emotions of life are captured. She has also released two novels, Somebody Else's Vows which poses the question of whether or not marriage vows come with a turn off valve for other attractions and its sequel Sexual Suicide which explores the consequences that come from not adhering to the turn off valve. In April, 2012, Brown has now unleashed her purpose as she has obediently released a work that God ordained. Destroying the Mask is a collection of short stories that explores the detriments parents often bring to their children through abuse and neglect. Brown has now penned her first short story to be included in an anthology brought together by Kendra Norman-Bellamy entitled, Love Said Not So with an expected release date of July 2012.  With much to say, Brown plans to continue writing, with the hope that through her work readers may find something entertaining, enlightening or purposeful. “It doesn’t matter which,” she admits as she believes her writing is much more than just words on paper. Brown served as the first Vice-President and founding member of a faith based writer's group, M-PACT (Motivated Pens and Creative Thoughts) founded and led by national best-selling author, Kendra Norman-Bellamy. She is also a member of the National Association of Professional Women.

He was dragged south across the border by his parents when he was too young to protest and has lived in California the rest of his life. He entered the military right after high school, then attended college and began a career in business. His military work and forty-five years in various business management positions had him traveling to many parts of the world and he remembers well the beauty (as well as the poverty and unrest) of so many places. He retired early and moved from the city to his quiet country place in Twin Oaks, California. The loudest noises now are some howling coyotes, the wandering cattle and a million raucous birds. The rabbits and quail have come to recognize that Shiloh (the ranch) is a sanctuary for them, so they hang around every day looking for handouts. Jim just hangs around the ranch trying to be a hermit (at least that's what a lot of people think.) He does still manage to get shaved once in a while and can look half-way presentable when someone comes up the driveway (if given enough warning.) Jim's work now appears to be writing. SANCTION took about ten years to finish, as it was written in bits and pieces. Now THE LESSER EVIL and COP have joined the bookshelves, and more are on their way. Jim would love to hear from you. Give him a write some day, ask questions and swap stories. After all, he doesn't have anything else to do. You can catch him at JimMagwood@aol.com. (And he does answer his mail.) His Website is http://www.JimMagwood.com.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At the age of twenty-one he sold a play to the BBC and continued to write following his graduation while working as a stockbroker’s clerk. In 1938, by this time writing full time, he created the character Paul Temple, a crime novelist and detective. With Steve Trent, a Fleet Street journalist and later his wife, Temple solved numerous crimes. Durbridge’s style was very much in the mode of the earlier Golden Age middle-class amateur detectives. The first book,Send for Paul Temple, was written along with John Thewes as the novelization of a radio serial. Many others followed and they were hugely successful until the last of the series was completed in 1968.", "related": ["B00EXRFLBO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My closest friends over the years consistently call me with questions about starting businesses and promoting them so I decided to combine my knowledge with my love of writing into one platform.

Another first: the first time he had ever kissed a girl in a theatre\nduring a film. The list went on and on, and he kept track of every first in his\nmind.When they left\nthe theatre, there was just enough time left to rush home. Brandon calculated\nthat if he broke the speed limit three times, they would roll into Hope's\ndriveway at precisely 11:30. They were one minute late when they reached the\nfront door.Hope quietly\nopened up the door and saw that Josephine was fast asleep on the sofa. Johnny\nCarson was wearing a genie cap and reading mail from a bag. Ed McMahon barked\nlaughter at the end of every reading. Hope put her finger to her lips and\nmotioned for Brandon to take her hand.They quietly\ncrept past Josephine and up the staircase that descended from the darkness of\nthe second floor.Hope quietly\nopened the door to her room and led him inside. Her room was rather plain with\na woven Indian rug on the floor and a four post oak bed that had four or five\nstuffed animals resting against the pillows.On a desk by the\nwindow were all of her school books. The single picture that hung on the wall\nwas of a woman who looked much like her. Brandon assumed that it was Hope's\nmother. The wallpaper was that of something that might have been in style 30\nyears earlier. Hope sat on the bed and patted the spot next to her for him to\nsit.\"I've never had a\nboy in my room before. I wanted you to be the first,\" she whispered.He kissed her,\nand they lay back on the soft handmade quilt. He kissed her again, slowly this\ntime. She took his hand\nand moved it to her chest. He could feel her heart beating rapidly. She moved\nhis hand lower, under her blouse, under her bra. Another first. Her breast was\nsoft, smooth, warm against his hand. He could feel goosebumps forming as he\ncautiously, lightly, gently ran his fingers over her skin. He let his hand\ngently rest fully upon it for a moment, but not with its full weight. He was\nafraid of hurting her. She sighed, and he could feel her heart pounding faster\nstill. Her skin became moist and grew warmer-almost flush. She began to tremble\nlike she was frightened. He could see it in her eyes: she was afraid, yet did\nnothing to stop him.He took his hand\naway, placed it on her cheek and stroked it lightly, moving his fingers gently\nthrough her hair. She placed her hand on top of his and closed her eyes, still\ntrembling. He kissed her once more. He felt hot and flush as well and realized\nthat his own heart was racing within his chest. He, too, was frightened, as\nfrightened as he had been when he had climbed on the back of the bull, but was\nonly now realizing it. She opened her eyes once more, and he gazed into\nthem. Hope shed a single tear, which he\ngently wiped away.\"I'm sorry,\nBrandon...\"\"Sorry for what?\"\"I really wanted\nto. I wanted tonight to be perfect\"\"Itwasperfect, and I love you for that.\"She smiled. It\nwas the same smile as the one he had captured in the print from the art room.\nHe kissed her once more. She was no longer trembling. She felt safe in her own\nroom now, in her own bed. After a few moments, he stood up, not because he\nwanted to, but because it was the right thing to do. Now was not the time - for\neither of them.They crept back\nthrough the living room and to the front door. She wrapped her arms around him\nand hugged him tightly, more tightly than she ever had, before kissing him good\nnight.\"I love you, Brandon.\nI will forever...\"\"Hey, You two!\nWhat time is it!?\"Josephine had\nawakened and was eyeing the both of them.\"We're late,\nJosephine. Sorry...\"\"We had a flat\ntire on the way home,\" Brandon spoke up.Hope giggled\nquietly, placing her hand quickly to her mouth in an attempt to hide the tell.\nIt was too late; Josephine's brow furrowed. She knew something was up, but\nwasn't quite sure what. Brandon looked at his watch; only twenty minutes had\npassed since they had entered the door, nine hours since they had first driven\naway. It seemed like a lifetime had passed. The whole night had simply slipped\naway into his memory as some fantastical blur.\"Flat tire my\nhind leg. Hope, you go on up to bed. You skedaddle on outta here, Brandon. Your\nfolks're gonna think you run off the road somewhere.\"Brandon kissed\nHope once more, adding to the memory, and then turned to leave. He was sweating and hot even though the air\nwas chilly. He could feel the ridiculous grin he wore on his face, but didn't\ncare. He drove home in silence without turning on the radio or 8-track player,\nsimply riding the euphoria of his first real endorphin high. It was unlike any\nfeeling he had ever had.He just wanted to\nsavor the memory of the evening, replay it in his mind so that it would never\nfade. He felt like he could do anything: ride a bull, rush into a burning\nbuilding, climb Mount Everest. He was Luke Skywalker swinging across the vast\nmetal chasm of the Death Star on a thin lifeline under a volley of heavy laser\nfire, the arms of Princess Leia wrapped tightly around him.When he got home,\nhe took his first official cold shower, still wearing that same ridiculous\ngrin.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.6667, "rating_total": 28.0}

A worker and a listener, Peggy grew up in a remote hollow in the Appalachian Mountains of Northwest North Carolina, and has spent most every day of her life absorbed in some type of farm work. Her heritage shows from head to toe -- in her tough, work-worn hands, and in the easy, flowing cadence of her mountain voice. Always curious, she wants to know everyone's story and has a knack of getting it -- from the old timers of her childhood to all the other people she has come across since -- from laborers to affluent developers. One cannot encounter Peggy without sharing stories. Many of her stories have roots in her own experiences:  Her dad grew beans and raised livestock. Her mother worked at a local factory to supplement the farming income. Relatives, extended family, and church provided a unique atmosphere for living and learning the old mountain traditions. She married at seventeen, finished high school, and started a family. She furthered her education at Appalachian State, but the responsibilities of six children quickly made formal study impossible. She did manage to write a few manuscripts on an old portable typewriter. Her husband teased about her spelling and sentence structure, causing her to become somewhat disillusioned with writing. She turned to crafts to assist in the struggle for survival, marketed her crafts through Blue Ridge Hearthside Crafts Cooperative, and became a board member for the organization. Moving to her own farm, she continued to raise her own food, adding a milk cow and other livestock. Tobacco was the main cash crop. Christmas trees were planted to assist the children through college. Being active in agriculture, Peggy became a board member of Farm Bureau Insurance, the local Christmas Tree Association, NC Agricultural Extension Advisory Council, and NC State University. These positions enabled her to experience some of the life beyond the mountains. For more than thirty years, Peggy assisted her husband -- a land surveyor-- with the field and office work. Through contacts made with a developer client, she started selling her Christmas trees on a lot in Naples, Florida, becoming known there as the \"The Christmas Tree Lady\". The survey business gave Peggy additional insight on the impacts -- good and bad -- to the community as the mountains became a tourist and second home destination.   As the children grew up, went to college, married and had families of their own, there became time for writing. Wanting to know if she was good enough to write seriously, she attended many classes and joined a local writers group. During a luncheon, Terry Kay told her \"All words are the same. It's how you use them that makes the difference\". He also advised her to write something that wasn't personal. Her first (2003) published novel, Heaven-High and Hell-deep, resonates with Peggy's unique strong voice and storytelling ability. Always resourceful, Peggy decided she would not only write books, but she'd make and market them herself. Consequently, every book is uniquely hers: she writes the stories, paints the cover picture, then prints and binds each one at her farm.  Whether from her experiences, shared stories, or from the spirits of the past; characters keep evolving in Peggy's imagination. Then they nag her until she relates their story. Often she is working on seven or eight novels simultaneously, completing one for the character that becomes the most persistent. They just have to deal with Peggy casting their stories in her beloved mountains.", "related": ["B00BRM7QCU"], "rank": 564933, "title": "The Rising Sun: Seeking Justice", "author": "Peggy Poe Stern", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I joined the Royal Navy straight from school, did four years at engineering college and then went to sea for three years in destroyers. I took a commission after that and joined the Fleet Air Arm as a helicopter pilot. I was married, had two kids and now have four grandchildren and one great grandson. I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a closeted transgender woman, she could no longer stand working in a business culture that didn't protect or support gender identity and expression. After coming out at work in the corporate diversity office (which ultimately led to her leaving), and also coming out to her family, Fox found success on her own terms--those that allowed her to be herself, completely. She started Lori Fox Diversity Consulting and now works with human resources and management departments at large corporations to create cultures of inclusion. She also consults with individuals to help guide their personal and professional transitions. Fox's is just one of 36 stories featured in Out & Equal at Work: From Closet to Corner Office, released last week (on Valentine's Day) by the national non-profit Out & Equal. Showcasing stories and essays by major business leaders who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or allied, the anthology aims to advance LGBT rights in the workplace, and illustrate how companies thrive when individuals are free to be authentic. --Gaper's Block Book ClubOut & Equal at Work is an anthology consisting of thirty-six stories from lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender business leaders who hold prestigious positions in the workplace, including those who work as executives at Fortune 500 Companies. Among other stories, this anthology shows how advancing LGBT rights in the workplace helped propel Kayla Shell to her current role of Legal Director at Dell, how Maggie Stumpp found support as an executive at Prudential during her transition from male to female, and how George Kalogridis bravely came out and worked his way to President of Disneyland Resort. Many more stories are edited by Selisse Berry, the founding executive director of the Out & Equal Workplace Advocates. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has even contributed to the foreword of the book. --Caliber MagazineOut & Equal at Work is an anthology consisting of thirty-six stories from lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender business leaders who hold prestigious positions in the workplace, including those who work as executives at Fortune 500 Companies.

When her mother dies unexpectedly, only a few weeks pass before determined Odeline leaves her childhood home and purchases a narrow boat, Chaplin & Company, in a London canal where she plans to live while she cultivates her lifelong dream of becoming a great mime. Her romantic ideas about her bohemian adulthood are quickly smashed when she finds that her boat is tacky and ill kept, her first booking is in front of a pub full of drunks, and her neighbors don’t respect her art. But she softens as she grows more integrated into the offbeat community of outcasts. Debut author Fellowes tells the story of Odeline, her neighbors, and the narrow boat in clear, eloquent prose, capturing every detail of Odeline’s environment and her unselfconscious, achingly whimsical ways. Though Odeline—who, despite her much-reviled art form, is incredibly gifted—triumphantly begins to find her own way, Fellowes unrelentingly weaves threads of heartbreak and longing through this coming-of-age story. --Sarah Hunter", "related": [], "rank": 4063359, "title": "Chaplin and Company", "author": "Mave Fellowes", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Once he went to school, but, since the murder of his parents, he has suffered unspeakable brutality: taunted for his combination of blue eyes and dark skin; surviving through prostitution, especially with men; abused, exploited, and robbed; scavenging for food, always hungry and high. Then he climbs Table Mountain and finds shelter and a kind of magic in a cave. This entry in the Modern African Writing series, dotted with slang and obscenities in various languages, holds the reader with its vivid descriptions of the gorgeous setting, with the striking portrayal of the physicality of Azure’s daily life—the misery and the beauty of rain, the joy of keeping warm—and, finally, with the magical realism of his escape, which brings the recognition of those we know are out there, but we do not see.

Are you?This book brought out every emotion I ever had working in the high stakes, low moral startup game in Silicon Valley. I try to relate the flip-side of what you read in the papers, to make this story not only believable but more relatable to my many many technology brothers and sisters out there who live the story I wrote. This story is rich and filled with as many of the \"characters\" that I have come across in my career, as I had the stomach to drag through it.It's a thriller that will make you say, \"Holy shit! I know that guy.\"I'm gonna warn you right up front, this book is uncomfortable on so many different levels... It's going to chew some of you up and spit you back out. Many of you that have read it and who knew and worked with me over the last twenty years have already recognized its authenticity. Some people will scoff and say, \"That never happens.\" ... But it does.After you read it, you're gonna go to work and check under the conference room table. You are gonna sneak into your VP's office and look under his desk. You'll look twice at that pocketknife the IT guy carries with him wherever he goes. And you will delete that massive stash of porn that you think you are \"hiding\" on the corporate IT servers. You know who you are...That's right. I said it. And they know it's true. And you know what else... Those IT guys that annoy everyone so much... They know everything. And they sit and wait, and they bide their time until someone does something they can't let slide. Then one day, just like Wesley Brickman, someone gets \"walked\" to HR with no clue. Then the little fictional world that they live in comes crashing down around them like the ton of bricks that their minions have been packing.As an IT Director for at least 15 of my twenty years in tech, I saw it all. And I do mean all. The front lines of corporations and high tech startups are manned by overworked and over-caffeinated, Star Trek geeks who think mounting the hard drive of the CEO's laptop to see who has what stock options and who is getting paid what, is just good late night fun.Bugging the boardroom--child's play.I've seen software engineers crush the company's Internet bandwidth with streaming porn, CFO's and CEO's who think a clever lie is far better than the truth, and personally witnessed talented people I respect and love take public ass-chewings so a VP could exercise his authority.I've watched people get walked to HR because they were on the wrong side of a spreadsheet--hell, I've been that guy. I've seen favoritism and cronyism that would make a government official cower in shame. I've watched self absorbed executives parade through the halls in their bike shorts, dripping sweat on everyone they pass, and no one willing to stand up and say, \"Hey, I don't want your ball sweat on me!\"Enough to the porsches parked in front of the building, to the lying, to the indifference toward the people who stop everything they are doing to rush to work on Christmas and fix everything. Then after years of that, I've sat in board rooms and watched the new good 'ol boys' bike club, pat themselves on the back and get paid, hiding every last detail they can so those pesky employees don't find out how bad they got screwed.I struggled to find the courage to stand up to that kind of behavior. Every time I did, the machine chewed me up and spit me out--dispassionately said, \"Next.\"The true world in Silicon Valley isn't what you read in the papers. It's not gazillionaires cashing in stock options for millions of dollars every day. It's arrogance and treachery and deceit on a scale only the government can hope to match. It's Vegas for techno-geeks. But the dice are loaded and the game is rigged, and you don't know the right people. It's the juiciest stuff I could imagine for great fiction thrillers.When I first started writingMassacre, I was bitter. By the time I finished it and ironed out the concepts for the three books that would follow it, I was flat out pissed. But make no mistake, these books are love stories. They are my tribute to the crazy talented, overly dedicated, technology professionals that I worked, and laughed, and \"bled\" with in 24X7 datacenters while Edward Emerson rode his bike up Skyline boulevard.One of the best things I was told when I started writing was, \"When you think the unthinkable--write that.\" As I researched government spying, and drones, and two ten year unending wars, I couldn't write fast enough to keep up with the reality of it all. I wrote a quick section on drones at the beginning and told my wife, \"You watch, if we wind down two wars there are military contractors who need a place to market those things.\" Then BAM! Drones over America on the cover of Time.You're gonna meet Wesley Brickman in this book. He's a bit pitiful, a bit whiny, and more than a little cynical. There was no way he could be anything else.InMassacre, Wesley has to decide if he wants to snap out of it or not. I hope that his journey makes you squirm a little at your own. I hope you are just as afraid of what you think isn't real, as you are comforted at what you \"know\" to be true.TheCRAMDOWNseries is not a happy, joy-joy read. It's brutal, and bloody, and cynical. It's about control and power and ultimately about corruption of the soul. You know, normal every day work kinda stuff...But more importantly, theCRAMDOWNseries is filled with regular people, like you and me.  I wanted to find out what would happen if those people finally snapped under the mind-numbing pressure--woke up and found out who they really were--who they wanted to be. Because heroes are born everyday. But like \"Gage\" says, \"If you wanna make a wolf, you gotta kill a few sheep.\"IF you think you can stomachCRAMDOWN:Massacre, download a sample or buy it today.And thanks for spending your hard earned time on reading my book!I'll try to earn it.Steve", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The implication for the reader is double-edged; one can either be frustrated by the author's self-conscious, highly stylized prose or delighted that she trusts enough to leave so much detective work to the reader. In \"The Trick,\" for example, she writes of a couple: \"They were somewhere other than under the quilt\"-a ruffling sentence perhaps, but one whose construction parodies the adulterous characters' inability to speak in direct terms. \"The trick is not to think,\" explains another character in the same tale. Several of the 16 stories here deal beautifully with the mother-daughter or father-daughter bond, and the title story illustrates one opinion about the differences between male and female socialization: the boys in the story are all \"holler and tilt,\" while the \"squealing-clean\" girls watch the world through a window pane. More than anything else, though, it is the cold beauty of Raffel's writing that takes hold of the reader, allowing these brief stories, many of which were first published in the Quarterly, to transcend the limiting category of experimental fiction.

Though Mily Balakirev, Aleksandr Borodin, César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, and Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov did have predecessors—principally Mikhail Glinka—in building a truly Russian art music, they put it on its feet despite lack of musical education beyond piano tutoring anywhere in Russia (only Rimsky-Korsakov had academic training), of career paths for musicians in Russia, and of encouragement by Russian elites. As the title of Walsh’s brilliant volume signals, the greatest of these composers is now considered to be Mussorgsky, whose work was so structurally unusual for its time that most of it wasn’t performed as he wrote it until the later twentieth century. In absorbing dicusssion of virtually every bit of his production, Walsh argues that Mussorgsky invariably chose emotional expression and the rhythms of Russian speech rather than the rules of classical form to shape his music, outstandingly in his 60 songs and transcendent opera, Boris Godunov. Walsh discusses the most ambitious works of the other four musical friends with similar penetration as he unfolds the life and career trajectories of all five, constantly bedeviled by lack of time to compose and shortage of venues for performance. A masterpiece of Russian cultural history. --Ray Olson", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's a city that's packed full of history, culture, food, shopping, and energetic markets.The first section of this Delhi, India, travel guide focuses on arriving in the city. The two main ways to travel in to Delhi are by airplane or by train at one of the city's main stations. The guide also extensively covers the best ways to get around Delhi. The modern Delhi Metro is a very convenient way to travel around the city and it's extremely affordable. For short journeys on smaller roads it's easiest to jump in an auto rickshaw (a tuk tuk). Also, if you're wandering around Old Delhi, specifically Chandni Chowk or Chawri Bazaar, one of the fun methods of getting from place to place is by human powered cycle rickshaw.Choosing where to stay, while visiting any city, is one of the top concerns for any traveler. While I was in Delhi, I was able to visit quite a few accommodation options ranging from budget to luxury. So within this Delhi, India, travel guide you'll find my personal recommendations for places to stay when you visit.The main section of this Delhi, India, travel guide is a list of the top 25 things to do. The comprehensive list includes breathtaking sites like the Lotus Temple, Lodi Gardens, the Red Fort, and many other attractions in Delhi that are worth visiting, and that I personally visited. Each item on the list of top 25 attractions comes with a description, a full size photograph, directions on how to get there, and other highly useful visiting information like open hours, phone number, and prices.While visiting the incredible historical sites and temples around Delhi is amazing, local North Indian food is also a big part of any visit to the city. Spicy curries, rich chole, and freshly cooked chapatis are just a sample of the wonderful flavors. Food is everywhere and it ranges from street food on the side of the road to fine dining world-class restaurants. This Delhi, India, travel guide lists 10 different sit down restaurants where you can go to get a meal that will surely satisfy your taste buds. For the more adventurous, there's a listing of 8 delicious street foods and where you can sample them. For each restaurant or street stall recommendation, you'll find information on how to get there, what to order, how much it costs, and open hours, along with a tantalizing food photo that will make you want to eat it immediately!Safety can be a concern when visiting Delhi, and it's an issue that I take seriously by offering my personal travel safety tips. Unfortunately scams are a common part of traveling in India, and Delhi is no different. The milk scam and the official tourist office scam are a few of the frequent scams to look out for. Also, remember to always count your change after you pay for anything. One of the common ways people get ripped off is by not receiving the correct amount of money back - so always count your change!Delhi is a huge city that has an abundance of things to do, places to go, and food to eat. While it can be hectic and frustrating at times, having clear information about how to get places, prices of things, and knowing where to go and what to eat, will make your visit to Delhi extremely rewarding.Mark Wiens, Migrationology.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has been active with National Chemistry Week, science in the classroom, and chemical health and safety.   As the mother of two children with college degrees, both home schooled through high school, Dr. Wood-Black understands the need for specific hands on curricula for the home school student and parents.  She has been through the struggle of finding the right text for the student’s learning style, finding the supplies and materials, and the need for documentation of the learning.  Thus, her materials are designed not only for the student but also for the one that will be presenting the material. Frankie received her degree in physics from Oklahoma State University, has an MBA, and is a Registered Environmental Manager.  She has seen the public school system through the eyes of a military child, 13 different schools from kindergarten through senior in high school and understands the current education complexities.  She has been working with universities, junior colleges, learning centers, and other educational institutions to understand the challenges associated with the new common core requirements.

The draft of that novel has long since disappeared, but the story is still simmering within, and I have high hopes of finishing the adventure one day soon.  I was born in Aruba to American parents, and I lived in Venezuela until my family returned to the United States when I was twelve. I couldn't fight the global travel bug, and I joined the U.S. Air Force at eighteen to \"see the world.\" After twenty wonderful and fulfilling years traveling the world, I pursued my dream of finally getting a college education. With a license in mental health therapy, I worked with veterans until I retired. I write time travel romance, romantic suspense, contemporary romance and light paranormal/fantasy romances. I am currently working on my twenty-first novel. I can be contacted through my web site at http://www.bessmcbride.com or my blog at http://willtravelforromanceblogspot.com.

She felt such a strong desire to soothe him, to touch him, and ease some of the pain he felt. Even though it was unorthodox she had learned over the years to be guided by her instincts. When her fingertips coasted along the wrinkling of his forehead in a loving caress, his entire body reacted. His arms tightened, his shoulders stiffened, and his back became rigid. She could see all of this and instantly wondered if she had made a mistake, but as her fingertips completed their journey from one side of his forehead to the other, his body unfurled from its tightened state. She continued the path of the caress down along the curve of his cheekbones, out around the edge of his cheeks. She swept them over his chin, and felt his jaw ease into a more relaxed position. Her fingertips traveled back up to his brow again. She smoothed them along his eyebrows very lightly and his expression relaxed further. He exhaled, and she felt his heartbeat slowing even further.When her touch traveled down along the subtle indent of his cheeks toward his lips, an alarm sounded in the far reaches of her mind. In that moment she became aware that she was crossing the line between comfort and intimacy, but she felt as if she couldn't resist. Her touch played lightly along those quirked lips, the warm softness of them slightly hardened by his need to always be ready to speak.As she felt his lips soften beneath her touch she reacted in an unexpected way. Her own heartbeat quickened. She felt as if she had connected with him in a way she had not connected with any man in a very long time. Her fingertips lingered for a split-second before she pulled them away.\"Breathe,\" she reminded him in a whisper. Whether he breathed or not, she couldn't be sure, because he suddenly leaned in close to her. When his lips were a hair away from hers she couldn't take her own breath. He advanced further, and she felt the supple warmth of his lips brushing slowly against hers. It was less than a kiss, more of a caress, that made her heart skip a beat. Her entire body came alive with a driving desire that threatened to overtake her. When he bucked his lips against hers, more firmly this time, and she felt the graze of the tip of his tongue along her lower lip, a shiver seized the base of her spine and climbed slowly upward.", "related": ["B00F0MU0VW"], "rank": 849651, "title": "Romance: Away From Him (Contemporary Romance)", "author": "Kaelyn Swan", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 42.0}

Mifflin (English, Lehman Coll., CUNY) tells Oatman's story, from the unorthodox religious convictions that led her family west, through her captivity and assimilation into Mohave culture, to her rescue and reassimilation. Mifflin engagingly describes Oatman's ordeal and theorizes about its impact on Oatman herself as well as on popular imagination. The author seeks to correct much of the myth that has sprung up around Oatman, owing partly to a biography written with Oatman's participation during her life. Mifflin takes the position that Oatman was almost fully assimilated into Mohave culture and resisted \"rescue,\" and that her return to mainstream society was a cause of ambivalence, if not anxiety. Though Mifflin sometimes seems a bit eager to make this argument, her book adds nuance to Oatman's story and also humanizes the Mohave who adopted her.
