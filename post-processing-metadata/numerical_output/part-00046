But Gentry is not a lightweight pop author; he is editor in chief of the Journal of Behavioral Medicine, and has been working with victims of what he calls \"toxic\" anger (\"anger that is experienced far too often, is far too intense and lasts far too long\") for decades. Believable case studies illustrate how Gentry’s seven steps can work, and he accepts the irrationality of the love that makes people reluctant to leave such relationships (though if the other steps fail, he advises, it may be necessary to leave). Questionnaires and tables help readers evaluate their situation and answer such questions as \"how angry is too angry?\" He then offers sensible, tested steps, not to change the angry person, but to manage the anger and one’s response to it, such as getting a support network and controlling one’s own anger. Anyone in a toxic anger situation will benefit from Gentry’s calm, wise advice.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I wondered where it would go and if it would get \"weird.\" But I kept on reading and to my great surprise, I found myself being pulled in by the tale and the sensuality. Ryan's character was amazing. I think most women, and quite a few men, would kill to have a man like that in their lives. His caring and giving were anyone's dream, and his bedroom behavior was yet another reason one might kill to have a man like that. It was also a joy to watch Lily \"bloom\" and discover who she was and what she really wanted. I was very pleased with the way things turned out for all partied involved, but especially Lily. She had many issues to deal with, and none of them in particular were actually her fault.

This is a clear, accessible, and useful manual for those who wish to align their will regularly with nature's processes and elements for healthy living. Beginning with the premise that \"ninety percent of all psychic attacks are not attacks, but self-created illusions,\" Penczak goes on to delineate the genuine need for protection from such forces as physical harm; harmful energy, judgments and projections; evil eyes; time traps; psychic vampires (drainers of energy, vitality and emotion); unenlightened gurus; past life energies and last but not least, oneself. Subsequent chapters discuss the symptoms of a person in need of psychic protection, then describe methods of diagnosis and physical, emotional and spiritual self-purification. Penczak identifies graphic protection symbols (designs, stones, etc.), as well as tools to evoke protective spirits. The book's real philosophical beauty is in the final chapter that addresses the dilemma of competitive magick.

As an historical author his books, Services of Colored Americans in the Wars of 1776 and 1812 (1851) and Colored Patriots of the American Revolution (1855) became available to the public. These represented the premier exhaustive studies of African Americans. Nell studied law in the early 1830s; however he was never certified as a lawyer because he would not swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United States. He believed it advocated the enslavement of millions African Americans throughout the South and so he could claim no loyalty to it. Around this time, Nell also began his association with acclaimed white abolitionist Garrison and with The Liberator. This connection would continue until the paper’s termination in 1865. Nell fought for the ideals of Garrison unfalteringly throughout the abolitionist campaign. Nell worked with Frederick Douglass on his abolitionist publication, The North Star, from 1848 until 1851. In 1850, Nell lost the Free-Soil candidacy for legislature in his home state. That same year, the Fugitive Slave Law gave Nell new inspiration to continue the fight against slavery. He was prompted to create the Committee of Vigilance, which served a similar purpose to that of the Freedom Association of 1842, but was much more illegal at this point. He encouraged and engaged in the “Underground Railroad”. During 1855, The Liberator employed Nell to journey around the Midwest and study African American anti-slavery efforts. After the publication of the devastating Dred Scott decision in 1858, Nell orchestrated a remembrance of black Revolutionary martyr Crispus Attucks to remind people of the civil status of African Americans at the time of American separation from England. That same year, Nell organized the Convention of Colored Citizens of New England. This action was decidedly in opposition to his earlier abhorrence of segregated abolitionism, but he argued that this new insult to blacks constituted sufficient reason to act separately. Nell spent the time between publications working for legislation to allow blacks into the Massachusetts military, one of the few struggles of his life in which he was not successful.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Drawing on the perspectives of teachers, parents and students, this book is a window through which to explore the possibilities of schooling in disadvantaged communities. The authors contend that teachers, parents and students themselves are all involved in the game of reproducing disadvantage in schooling, but similarly, they can play a part in opening up opportunities for change to enhance learning for marginalised students. Rather than only attempting to transform students, teachers should be also be concerned to transform schooling; to provide educational opportunities that transform the life experiences of and open up opportunities for all young people, especially those disadvantaged by poverty and marginalised by difference. The book is also designed to stimulate understanding of the work of Bourdieu as well as of a Bourdieuian approach to research. Seeing transformative potential in his theoretical constructs, it airs the possibility that schools can be more than mere reproducers of society.Carmen Mills and Trevor Gale take up a problem that Australia keeps trying to avoid: the veryunlevel playing field it has createdfor its schools, its teachers, its students and their parents. This book lets you see how difficult this problem is on the ground, and compels you to think about what would be a better way forward.Professor Lyn Yates , Pro-Vice Chancellor Research from University of Melbourne, AustraliaCarmen Mills and Trevor Gale make two important contributions to the sociology of education in this timely book. Through a detailed case study of one disadvantaged school – Crimson Brook Secondary College in rural Australia - they elucidate not only how inequalities are reproduced and legitimated through many of the practices of schooling, but also the possibilities for policies and practices which interrupt and destabilize such outcomes. In so doing, they also make a significant contribution to Bourdieuian scholarship in their empirically grounded and reflexive application of his ‘thinking tools’ to their case study and deconstruction of the synchronous productive and reproductive character of schooling practices.Professor Bob Lingard, The University of Queensland, Australia", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the preface Swift explains the title: sailors toss a tub overboard to distract a whale that might attack their ship; in the same way Swift's work may act as a decoy to deflect destructive criticism from the state and established religion.  The 11-part \"A Tale of a Tub\" is the most impressive of the three compositions for its wit and command of stylistic effects, notably parody. The sections of the \"Tale\" alternate between the main allegory about Christian history and ironic digressions on modern scholarship.  --The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature", "related": ["B0093M15D2"], "rank": 23763, "title": "A Tale of a Tub", "author": "Jonathan Swift", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Casey, a junior research fellow in politics  at Trinity College, Oxford, asserts that the war with Germany  was never overly popular with the American people and that  during the prewar years of 1938-40, public opinion was very  isolationist or almost pro-German. Numerous public figures  during this time (including Father Coughlin and Charles  Lindbergh) spoke in favor of Germany. President Roosevelt had to  deal with public opinion and walk the \"tightrope\" of too much or  too little involvement. Even after the attack on Pearl Harbor,  the public was more inclined to support the war against Japan  than the war against Germany. Roosevelt had to stay in touch  with public opinion polls regarding the conduct of the war and,  later, the question of the reorganization of the postwar world.  Casey documents his position with numerous footnotes and an  extensive bibliography. While numerous books have dealt with the  propaganda issues of World War II, this enjoyable work is the  first one to deal with public opinion polls and their influence  on American foreign policy during the war. Recommended for both  public and academic libraries.

To be much more successful, consider and use the new rules of media relations:• Non-targeted, broadcast pitches are spam.• News releases sent to reporters in subject areas they don't cover are spam.• Reporters who don't know you yet are looking for organizations like yours and products like yours- make sure they will find you on sites like Google and Technorati.• If you blog, reporters who cover the space will find you.• Pitch bloggers, because being covered in important blogs will get you noticed by mainstream media.• When was the last news release you sent?  Make sure your organization is busy.• Journalists want a great online media room.• Include video and photos in your online media room.• Some (but not all) reporters love RSS feeds.• Personal relationships with reporters are important.• Don't tell journalists what your product does.  Tell them how you solve customer problems.• Follow journalists on Twitter to learn what interests them.• Does a reporter have a blog?  Read it.  Comment on it.  Track back to it (send a message whenever you blog about a subject that the reporter blogged about first).• Before you pitch, read (or listen to or watch) the publication (or radio or TV show) you'll be pitching to.Once you know what a reporter is interested in, send them an individualized pitch crafted for their needs.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

partly because,\nin the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because\nif I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately\nwithCaptain Vorpatril's Alliance) it would upwhack the numbering\nsystem. Nevertheless, the books and\nstories do have a chronological order, if not a strict one. It was always my intention to write each book as a\nstand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with\nthat book that's in your handright now, don't put it back on the\nshelf! While still somewhat true, as the\nseries developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that were\nricher for each other. I will list the\nsub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats. Shards of HonorandBarrayar. The first two books in the series proper,\nthey detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral\nVorkosigan of Barrayar. Shardswas my very first novel ever;Barrayarwas actually my eighth, but\ncontinues the tale the next day after the end ofShards. For readers who want to be sure of beginning\nat the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two. The Warrior's ApprenticeandThe Vor Game(with, perhaps, the novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" tucked in\nbetween.) The Warrior's Apprenticeintroduces the character who became the series' linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the\nfirst book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by accident; the second\nhow he fixed his mistakes from the first round.Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things\none can best discover for oneself),The Warrior's Apprenticemakes\nanother good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male\nprotagonist. After that:Brothers in Armsshould be read beforeMirror\nDance, and both, ideally, beforeMemory. Komarrmakes another good alternate entry point for\nthe series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read beforeA Civil Campaign. Borders of Infinity, a collection of three of the\nfive currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure\nsampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit\nthemselves to length. (But it may make\nmore sense if read afterThe Warrior's Apprentice.) Take care not to confuse the\ncollection-as-a-whole with its title story, \"The Borders of Infinity\". Falling Freetakes place 200\nyears earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with\nthe main body of the series. Most\nreaders recommend picking up this story later.It should likely be read beforeDiplomatic Immunity, however, which\nrevisits the \"quaddies\", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in Miles's\ntime. The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear\nin italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words\nand 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.  Falling FreeShards of HonorBarrayarThe Warrior's Apprentice\"The Mountains of Mourning\"\"Weatherman\"The Vor GameCetagandaEthan of AthosBorders of Infinity\"Labyrinth\"\"The Borders of Infinity\"Brothers in ArmsMirror DanceMemoryKomarrA Civil Campaign\"Winterfair Gifts\"Diplomatic ImmunityCaptain Vorpatril's AllianceCryoBurn                   Caveats: The novella \"Weatherman\" is an\nout-take from the beginning of the novelThe Vor Game. If you already haveThe Vor Game, you\nlikely don't need this. The original 'novel'Borders of\nInfinitywas a fix-up collection containing the three novellas \"The\nMountains of Mourning\", \"Labyrinth\", and \"The Borders of Infinity\", together\nwith a frame story to tie the pieces together.Again, beware duplication. The\nframe story does not stand alone, and mainly is of interest to completists.  The Fantasy Novels My fantasy novels are a bit easier\nto order. Easiest of all isThe\nSpirit Ring, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed\nbooks that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are the four volumes ofThe\nSharing Knife--in order,Beguilement,Legacy,Passage,\nandHorizon--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one\ncontinuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks. What have come to be called the\nChalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written,\nlike the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and\ncan in theory be read in any order. (The\nthird book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely\nconnected first two.) Some readers think\nthe world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in\npublication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the\nfirst (but not the third.) In any case,\nthe publication order is: The Curse of ChalionPaladin of SoulsThe Hallowed Hunt  The short story collectionProto\nZoawas an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three\n(1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but\nnot in this handy format. The novelette\n\"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" may be of interest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is\nthe first story in which that proto-universe began, mentioning Beta Colony but\nbefore Barrayar was even thought of.My latest original e-edition isSidelines: Talks and Essays, which is\njust what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of my nonfiction\nwritings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions,\nand some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove an interesting companion\npiece to my fiction.Happy reading!  -- Lois McMaster Bujold.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Foster's passion and clarity help focus on the key issues concerning the nature of religious feeling in human life, demanding a quality of response from the reader that matches his own high standard of thought and exposition. Professor Chris Gosden, School of Archaeology, University of Oxford 'A look at the ultimately important questions of life that is itself wonderfully alive: you may not agree, but you will never be bored'. Iain McGilchrist 'In this tour of the weird and wacky in religion and spirituality, Charles Foster displays his gift for making science accessible and philosophy entertaining. He will amuse and irritate religious believers and non-believers in turn but won't let either group stray too far from the evidence. You may not agree with all of Foster's answers, but he is certainly asking good questions.' Justin Barrett 'Foster takes us on a most enjoyable journey through the drugs, dreams and profound experiences that lead people to believe in the existence of souls. Although I disagree profoundly with his conclusions Foster's exploration of why we are so incurably religious is both serious and entertaining.'

Their worlds were so separate that, apart from the  Civil war, they might never have met. Yet, here were two men from the  same adopted state, with the same unusual capacity to absorb  disappointment and failure, and the same single vision for winning the  Civil War. As Edward Bonekemper shows in his usual straightforward and  uncluttered fashion, this odd couple brought together the political and  military energies of the American republic in an unstoppable  combination. Their linked histories have been Bonekemper's special  study, and Lincoln and Grant: The Westerners Who Won the Civil War is  the monument to that study.\" - Dr. Allen C. Guelzo, Henry R. Luce  Professor of the Civil War Era and Director, Civil War Era Studies  Program, Gettysburg College\"Nobody knows the Civil War -- or brings it alive so successfully -- as  Ed Bonekemper. Thorough research and meticulous documentation always  back up a clear, strong, unambiguous point of view about the War and the  individuals who fought it.  Lincoln and Grant is the latest addition to  a distinguished collection of works exploring this watershed period in  the history of our nation.\" --  Dr. Peyton R. (Randy) Helm, President  and Professor of History, Muhlenberg College\"With this book, Ed Bonekemper continues his studies of Ulysses S.  Grant.  Once again, he demonstrates the general's many talents.  This  new book's linking of Grant with  Lincoln is insightful, and Civil War  readers will not want to miss this page-turner.\" --  Dr. John F.  Marszalek, Executive Director of the Ulysses S. Grant Association,  Mississippi State University\"Bonekemper's finely crafted, first-of-its kind analysis, ably  illustrates how similar life experiences and shared values forged an  iron-clad relationship between the indomitable duo of Lincoln and Grant.   This book weaves together the complex tapestry of how these two  Westerners were able to restore the Union and end the South's peculiar  institution.\" -- Prof. Jonathan A. Noyalas, author of Stonewall  Jackson's 1862 Valley Campaign: War Comes to the Home Front and other  Civil War books\"This unique examination, a dual biography merging strategic and  political concerns with the course of winning the Civil War, will give  every student of the conflict another opportunity to ponder how that war  was won. Indeed, Lincoln and Grant were the Westerners who won the  Civil War.\" -- Theodore P. Savas, Esq., award-winning author\"With this book, Ed Bonekemper completes a hat trick on Ulysses S. Grant  -- first a stand-alone study, then a study of Grant and his great  adversary, Robert E. Lee, and now a volume focused on the relationship  between Grant and his commander in chief, Abraham Lincoln.  It is  surprising that there has been no book-length study of this topic, and  Bonekemper's sesquicentennial volume deserves attention for the heft of  its subject and as a much-needed spark to more intense focus on the  Civil War frontier between politics and generalship.\" -- Carl R.  Schenker, Jr., Esq., Civil War historian and author\"Edward Bonekemper succeeds marvelously in presenting the relationship  of these two Civil War icons. Lincoln and Grant outlines the divergent  paths each of these two men took, until fate blended them together into a  winning team for the Union. This excellent study presents a fresh and  thought-provoking analysis of their lives, successes, adversities, and  leadership styles. Lincoln and Grant is a must-have volume for the  historian at all levels.\"  -- Larry Clowers, Grant interpreter,  historian, and book reviewer.\"So much has been written about Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant  that there would seem to be no unplowed ground. Just in time for the  Sesquicentennial, Ed Bonekemper proves this assumption wrong. In his new  book the author explores in revealing detail how the Civil War careers  of these two leading figures converged and evolved into a  political-military collaboration that produced victory for the North.\"  --  John Foskett, Esq., long-time Civil War buff and book reviewerA long time ago, a friend told me that the war was fought in the East  but won in the West.  Edward Bonekemper's excellent work on the  relationship between Grant and Lincoln firmly attests to the veracity of  that statement.  He has concisely articulated and described their  iron-clad relationship, rooted in the hard life of the antebellum West,  which preserved the Union from destruction.\" --  John Michael Priest,  author of  four Civil War books and Antietam Battlefield guide\"Once again, Ed Bonekemper has scoured the past and brought forth  another remarkable book. This time, Bonekemper examines President  Abraham Lincoln and his most aggressive and successful general-in-chief,  General Ulysses S. Grant. He uncovered factors in their difficult  Western frontier upbringing, their leadership styles and other aspects  of their lives that created a bond of trust and mutual respect which  would help them, working together, win the awful war thrust upon them  both. Bonekemper identifies and examines complementary personal traits  of each man that helped mold the two of them into a winning team. This  is a book for those looking for more than tactics, maps and a further  rehashing of skirmishes, battles, and campaigns. This is a study of the  two great leaders that won the war and how their Western roots  contributed to their success.\" -- Edwin E. Powell, retired military  intelligence officer\"History at its best. An overdue exposition of a neglected subject.\" -  Captain Joe Derie, USCG (Ret.), long-time Civil War buff and book  reviewer\"Bonekemper sought to bring together the story of how these two remarkable men came to trust each other and work closely together. In so doing he gave us a work that sheds light on the key relationship between a commander-in-chief and his top general. Bonekemper's subject is certainly worthy of study. He has given us much to ponder and many ideas to contemplate as we compare Lincoln and Grant with, say, Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee, Franklin Roosevelt and George C. Marshall, and Harry Truman and Douglas MacArthur.\" - Richard M. McMurry, Civil War historian, Civil War News.\"It could be said that the best minds the North had in the Civil War were not even Yankees, but instead Midwesterners. Lincoln and Grant: The Westerners Who Won the Civil War looks into the pre-war experiences of the President and the General, and how their upbringing in Illinois and Ohio respectively gave them the skills and vision needed to do their part reuniting the Union. An interesting perspective on the bigger picture of war and the impact of the hometown, Lincoln and Grant is a fine addition to any American Civil War study collection.\" - Helen Dumont, The Midwest Book Review", "related": [], "rank": 365200, "title": "Lincoln and Grant", "author": "Edward Bonekemper", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Eh. But then came issue #2; and instantly I was sold.The backstory for the Clown Jexter is told, and it is a marvelously inventive, original, and cohesive origin - three descriptive adjectives I'd feared I wouldn't be able to use for the series. With this sequence the entire epic premise comes into view like the bottom of a stilled-water lake on a cloudless day, and the excitement it garnered, for me, was second to none. A host of new characters within the Carnival are introduced and the series at last revealed its true purpose:one character's story will be told each issue, with a greater, epic arc building within and around each one, until the entire series comes together to form one massive, intricately laced tapestry.\"David Baxter - Broken Frontier", "related": ["B008HG1ZDK"], "rank": 4879619, "title": "CARNIVAL OF SOULS", "author": "Jazan Wild", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her father, Canon Jocelyn \"rather despise[s] the rest of Europe\" and is \"an austere critic of young women, demanding little of them in action, but everything in repose.\" Mary's few acquaintances are old family friends to whom she feels more obligation than true affection and, try as she might to deny it, she knows all tenderness in her father died with her mother. Now a middle-aged spinster, Mary is used to being lonely, but she cannot stop longing for love. Then Mr. Herbert, the son of her father's old friend, moves into the neighborhood. Slowly, surely and without intention on either one's part, love blossoms. Love so strong that Mary cannot speak of it or control her blissful fantasies. When Mr. Herbert leaves for the seashore to recover from a chill, they both believe he will return to ask for Mary's hand in marriage. An elegantly written and scathingly honest account of society, manners, and marriage,The Rector's Daughteris a fiercely passionate and quietly tender story of love and loss.-- For great reviews of books for girls, check outLet's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14. --From500 Great Books by Women; review by Jesse Larsen", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was educated at English private schools and Cambridge but left without a degree. European travel was cut short by the loss of most of Thackeray's inheritance in 1833 in Indian bank failures, upon which he decided to make his living as a painter. Returning to London in 1837, he found himself with two young daughters and an insane wife by 1840 and forced to write for a living. Most of his early output was reviews, sketches, comic items or short serials for magazines, often under pseudonyms. His first novel, Barry Lyndon, was serialised in 1844, and Thackeray also published three travel books in the 1840s. His satiric vein and discontent with contemporary fictional norms led to his first major novel, Vanity Fair, in 1847, followed by a handful of other major novels over the next dozen years which turned from satiric to historical. Published lectures on the new field of English literature led to tours of the United States from 1852 and The Virginians, a novel set partly in America. Thackeray was a founding editor of the literary journal The Cornhill Magazine in 1859, but resigned due to ill-health in 1862, though his last works were published in the journal. He died in 1863.", "related": ["B002LVUSY4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her understanding of the paranoid-schizoid mechanisms and of the role of envy extended the range of patients who can be psychoanalyzed, to include those suffering from borderline states between neurosis and psychosis. And her work shed light on the psychological basis of ethics, on theories of thinking, on group relations, and on aesthetics.Hanna Segal worked with Melanie Klein and is now one of Britain's leading psychoanalysts.

His career in football is over, but Marti is determined to get him walking again. Jim, however, is his own worst enemy, making injudicious comments to the press and trying to talk Marti into bed at every opportunity until her patience is sorely tried. He understandably resents her seeing him at his most vulnerable even while he craves her undivided attention on a more personal level. Swift has penned a very enjoyable contemporary romance between a major sports figure and the therapist whose skill is all that stands between him and life in a wheelchair.Lynne WelchCopyright © American Library Association.

He also battled chronic depression as far back as he could remember and after several years of attempting to establish a career in the creative side of Hollywood, he decided to leave California to write a satire about all he had experienced.   He drove across the country in a Honda Civic loaded with food and his worldly possessions. He spent six months living in northern Lake Michigan on a place called Beaver Island. While there, he heard many tales of Beaver’s history in the nineteenth and twentieth century that he recorded in a daily journal while he wrote his first novel Blockbuster. Dreams, Faith & Ammunition documents Sven’s battle with his own depression, the isolated culture he met on the island – locals referred to Beaver as if it were a separate country– and his more recent research on the Mormon society that had been established and then brutally expelled from the island in the 1850s.  Two thirds of the book takes place during the spring and summer of 1997. The other third covers the much earlier Mormon period. For the modern part, the book is mostly a straight forward telling of Sven’s experience. For the historical portion, Sven read over a dozen sources and tried to choose a balanced point of view of what happened during that time.  Only one book he read was based on interviews with survivors who had been children when the events occurred.  In Sven’s experience, all history, no matter how unbiased its author tries to be, is always painted by the emotions, ideals, and opinions of the ones who write it. The only way to obtain an unbiased account is to let a camera document events without any editing. But this has never been a realistic option. The nineteenth century portion of the book is a novelization of the major events leading up to the demise of the Mormon culture on Beaver Island. It is a fictional account based on fact.  Because of this, Dreams, Faith & Ammunition is referred to as a combination of memoir and historical fiction.  Sven lives in Los Angeles with his wife and young son.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Growing up in a Muslim country, Svetlana observed the beauty and grooming routines of the Muslim women from a young age. This developed into a passion to work with women in the beauty industry. Svetlana wanted to capture the balance between internal and external beauty and deliver this to women through her services.Migrating to Australia in 2002, Svetlana began extensive study completing an array of courses to work towards achieving her ultimate career in beauty.

She believes Australia gives women the freedom and the chance to \"get what they want out of life, whatever that might be.\" She adores the country and is proud to be Australian.In 2005, Svetlana opened a business called \"Sweet Image.\" Although it was a great start to the industry, she found that clients could never remember her salon name. Svetlana was known to her clients as the Eyebrow Lady, Brow Perfectionist or Eyebrow Specialist. So in 2008, Svetlana followed this trend and now runs the highly successful EyebrowExperts salon.EyebrowExperts is located in Sydney's charming suburb, Woollahra. Director and Chief Brow and Brazilian Artist, Svetlana has a passion for eyebrows and waxing that borders on the obsessive.

Educated at Eton and Oxford, Knox was ordained as priest in the Church of England but later entered the Roman Catholic Church.

The university was also where she completed her first full-length novel…set, of course, in medieval England. Later, her fascination with Henry II led her to expand her research horizons to the far reaches of his “Angevin Empire” in France, which became the setting of her first published novel, Loyalty’s Web (a 2007 Whitney Award Finalist). When she’s not writing, Joyce loves to read, play the piano, and spend time with her sister and friends. A highlight of her year is attending the annual Arizona Renaissance Festival . Joyce is a multi-published, multi-award winning author who specializes in sweet medieval romances heavily spiced with mystery and adventure.

Just as the 12-year-old is beginning to relax and enjoy her new life in Paris, strange things start happening around her. A mysterious swirl of dust that seems to have the shape and colors of a purple-eyed man is following her, and growing regions of magical transformation bring danger and threatening magical creatures to the city. When Maya inadvertently reads a letter that holds a magical compulsion, it seems that she will be forced to give up her own life in exchange for Henri's. With the help of her friends Valko and Pauline, Maya is determined to outwit the constraints of the letter and defeat Henri again. Magical gargoyles and their egg add to the mystery as Maya tries to understand what they need her to do and how they can help her with her mission. Nesbet creates threatening evil and an engagingly magical setting. She gives Maya real doubts and worries, particularly about protecting her family and her mother's recurring illness.

Other details arrived later.It didn't take me long to fall in love with Shane, and later Veronica.As you read Rewind, you can also tell the mood I was in while writing. If Shane and Veronica were having a fight, I was quite likely in a similar mood while writing. There were also several evenings during the writing of Rewind when I kept a box of tissues with me.As of December of 2012, I've started playing with a new novel that will include Shane, Veronica and everyone else from Rewind, but introducing new characters.

This will not only help the lamb develop a great flavour from the marinade but it also means you have more time to do the important jobs, like chilling the beers and having a drink or two with your mates. If the butcher has not done so already, take a rolling pin to your leg of lamb and bash it a few times on the thickest point on the cut side of the meat to even out the thickness a little. Then make a couple of quite thick slashes through the thickest part of the meat to help the heat penetrate evenly. Put the meat on a large plate or shallow dish. Combine the remaining ingredients, the except the garlic, and rub all over the meat on both sides, with your hands. Then also on the cut side of the meat, make a few shallow cuts (about 10 or so) at random and then stick a slice of garlic into each slit. Preferably leave to marinate in the fridge for up to 24 hours; if you don't have time, no worries, just start cooking. However, if you do marinate it, try to bring it back to room temperature for about 20 minutes before you BBQ it so it cooks more quickly and evenly. Get your grill to a medium heat - too hot and the meat will just char on the outside and remain raw in the middle - and add the meat (cut side down). Cook for about 15 minutes, then turn over and cook with the hood down for a further 15 minutes until both sides are crusty and dark brown. If you don't have a hood, no worries, just cook it for about 15 minutes, or until done to your liking - stick a sharp knife into the middle and see - if it's still too pink and translucent cook it for a little longer, maybe turning down the heat so it doesn't just burn on the outside. Remove the meat from the barbecue and sit it on a plate by the side of the barbie (where it is a bit warm) covered with a sheet of foil, for about 10 minutes. This will make for a much more succulent meal, as the juices will be drawn back into the meat, rather than onto the plate when you carve it. Again if you don't have time, just serve it, maybe with some crusty bread for mopping up the juices. TOP TIP #1If you are going to rest your meat after cooking (see end of recipe), then it will continue to cook a bit during this time, so it's best to pull it off while still a little pink in the centre", "related": ["B005R836AQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Barton is the author of several fast-paced mystery and thriller series, featuring lively characters and lots of action. \"Miz Scarlet\" (Scarlet Wilson Mystery series) is a teacher-turned-innkeeper, who throws herself into danger with a feisty determination to make things right, relying on cohorts like \"Captain Peacock\" and \"Colonel Grey Poupon\" to help her solve the clues. Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans.

Buckman's novel focuses on the  Konicks, a broken family in a poor Illinois town whose nature and experience  seem to lead them hopelessly toward misfortune. Patriarch Bruno Konick, an  expert in obsolete crafts, lives a meager, largely isolated life, haunted by the  horrors he witnessed as a soldier during World War II. His emotional distance  and anger alienated him from his sons, who nonetheless followed him into  military service and returned from the Vietnam War with similar psychological  damage. Elder son Bruce, a violent alcoholic with a gruesome facial scar,  harasses the townspeople and steals from his father. Memories of wartime  atrocities, a long-standing heroin addiction, Bruce's childhood sexual assaults,  and his father's neglect have left younger son Len a weakened shell of a man.  Bruce's abandoned son, Luke, possesses an intelligence that offers him a  possible escape from this familial cycle, but it's at odds with the aimlessness  and resentment he inherited from his father and the limited options around  him.Though troubling in its subject matter, Buckman's perceptive yet restrained  characterizations offerThe Names of Riversresonance and poignancy.  Brutally precise yet compassionate descriptions help convey the helplessness and  regret of this gallery of displaced, lonely characters, lending the book's hard  lessons a sense of disquieting accuracy. A persistently sad novel,The Names  of Riversrewards readers with the kind of wisdom gained from such a painful  journey.--Ross Doll", "related": [], "rank": 3304136, "title": "Names of Rivers eBook", "author": "Daniel Buckman", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I attended Grace Bible College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where I received a bachelor’s degree and which provided the space, friendships, and life opportunities to question all that I had held dear. I went on to achieve a master’s degree in forensic psychology from Walden University. During that time and before and continuing into the future, I have and continue to study philosophy and psychology extensively, though the education never ends there, often branching into history, sociology, and religious ideology. I am of the mindset that truth will know truth no matter how deeply or how far you look. I now dwell in the philosophic spirit of scientific uncertainty and seek always to broaden my understanding of the unknown, finding that life is more honest and full of serenity, love, and joy within science, humanistic principles, and the open religious structure of Science of Mind or New Thought. My defining quote is from Bertrand Russell: “Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life; the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.”", "related": [], "rank": 3267546, "title": "Journeys Of A Spiritual Atheist", "author": "David Teachout", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The sonnets are clear, and simple; yet they are full of depth and spiritual insights. These sonnets tackle every aspect of love; from Platonic love to friendship, to abandonment and disappointment to the loss of loved ones. It is rare that a book can make me cry, but I often found myself weeping as I read some to the sonnets, and smiling deep within as I read others. You can not read love Vignettes without being affected. At times I found the sonnets a bit too personal, and some were a little sappy, yet I found myself identifying with the thoughts conveyed. The ending couplets in each of the sonnets always conveyed a deeper message: \"Frindship's not to be had by possession/But by making an inward concession\", is one of my favority couplets. It is from sonnet 2. So if you are looking for something that will make you think a little deeper about love, then Love Vignettes may be for you. --Customer", "related": [], "rank": 4875592, "title": "Love Vignettes", "author": "Donald Murphy", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This has been followed by Blood Diamonds Conspiracy; Driven By Lust; Baring Her Soul and From Serbia with Love. I refuse to be constrained by genres as you will see. See details on my website above. Readers have commented that my writing is controversial, compelling, descriptive and evocative, and they become involved with the characters. What more could a writer ask for? I am unable to restrain myself from becoming emotionally involved in humanitarian issues, as well as with my clients, readers and it comes through in my stories. I currently live in my hometown in Auckland, New Zealand and love to travel to other countries and have been to Europe many times, as my very talented partner Harald,who designs my covers,is from Germany. This has given me the opportunity to fall in love with historical landscapes and their cultures, and also indulge in three of my passions, good food, wine and great conversation. I have gleaned many ideas and settings for my stories by traveling to well known cities in Europe, and also through the small villages, each with their own special story, which have enabled me to create believable and sympathetic characters. Currently I teach English to Muslim immigrants from Iraq. Both of these experiences were so enlightening, giving me an insight into the spirit and courage these people, whom I admire tremendously and respect, portray in their everyday lives.", "related": [], "rank": 2304586, "title": "From Serbia With Love: Crime Lords, Feuds, Diamonds and a Suave English Spy", "author": "Yvonne Crowe", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 35.0}

AndersonRemember, Not A Word\nby Rebecca D. Myers should be subtitled Profiles in Courage.This is an amazing\nbook. A true story of personal child abuse and later marital abuse suffered\nby the author. It must have taken a tremendous amount of courage by Myers to\nput her story into words. I'm glad she did because this is a textbook for\nothers of how to cope and triumph above these abominable acts.I must say much of\nthis book is not easy reading and turns the stomach in places and some people\nmay find it too much to take. But I think it would do people good to read this\naccount and realize society needs to take stronger steps against this kind of\nabuse. I have no personal\nknowledge of child abuse but I know something of spousal abuse since my wife\nsuffered it in her first marriage. She was a battered wife until she had enough\nand took refuge in a women's shelter with two young children. She got her life\nback on track, went back to school to become a nurse and raised her two kids as\na single parent until I came onto the scene several years later and we have now\nbeen happily married for 21 years.I must say that\nRebecca Myer's book at times made me ashamed of my gender. But I also realize\nthere are many good men out there and I hope that I am one of them. Real men do\nnot abuse children or their wives or girlfriends.This book is well\nwritten, well edited and a powerful voice against abuse. Let's hope many people\nread it, listen and help take action to stop abuse.I think the really\nmoving thing for me in the book is that Rebecca later meets her soul mate and\nis now happily married to a wonderful man. She deserves it.Bravo, Rebecca D.\nMyers. I salute you!", "related": [], "rank": 2369447, "title": "Remember, Not A Word", "author": "Rebecca D.

Forced through overwork to take a long rest, and forbidden by his doctors to do any 'serious' reading, Wright read over two thousand detective novels and books on criminology. Subsequently, as S.S. Van Dine, he wrote a series of best-selling crime novels. His detective Philo Vance - one of the most famous amateur sleuths of his time - was immortalised on screen by William Powell in The Canary Murder Case.

The university was also where she completed her first full-length novel...set, of course, in medieval England. Later, her fascination with Henry II led her to expand her research horizons to the far reaches of his \"Angevin Empire\" in France, which became the setting of her first published novel, Loyalty's Web (a 2007 Whitney Award Finalist). When she's not writing, Joyce loves to read, play the piano, and spend time with her sister and friends. A highlight of her year is attending the annual Arizona Renaissance Festival . Joyce is a multi-published, multi-award winning author who specializes in sweet medieval romances heavily spiced with mystery and adventure.

Growing up as a small child, Carrington was like regular children his age, showing an interest in sports, video games, cartoons and action figures. There was also something different about Carrington. He had a great imagination and loved to write and tell stories. In the third grade, Carrington began writing short stories, and writing and performing plays for his third grade class.   At the age of nineteen he began posting his short stories on his social networks sites. After posting close to twenty short stories Carrington gained a fairly loyal fan base. At the age of twenty he began interfusing his love and knowledge of sports with his love for writing, and started writing sports articles for his own blog. Soon thereafter, Carrington received requests from the bigger sports pages to write articles for their sites. After writing a few articles Carrington realized that he would rather return to his own personal work of writing short stories and poems.   Carrington says his favorite writers come from an array of genres; including J.K. Rowling, John Grisham, Dan Brown, Stephen King, and Eric Jerome Dickey. When asked which genre his personal style belonged, Carrington responded, “I feel like my work can’t be placed in a specific genre because I like to write about different things and interfuse different genres. I just like to write and would like for my work to touch everyone, instead of a particular group.”   His personal hobbies include watching sports, listening to music, cooking, reading, fishing, and spending time with his family.", "related": [], "rank": 3141255, "title": "The Night of the Black Moon (Green Grove Series Book 1) eBook", "author": "C.V.

Callies coached AAU track & Field for ten year and AAU Basketball for fifteen years. His first encounter with AAU sports occurred while teaching Math and Science at a parochial middle school and Athletic Director. He coached volleyball, basketball and track in the afternoon and weekends when an staff member from the Davis Scott YMCA recognize his coaching skills and talent level of his student athletes. Coach Callies, as he became known, volunteered his time and took some of the kids from the school and merged with local kids from the YMCA and competed at the AAU nationals. After his sons matured beyond playing church league and at the local boys club and he introduced them to AAU basketball. He explained to his son that the game they once knew will become more physical and skilled. It would require more preparation and dedication in order to get better but could still be fun. Coach Callies continue to coach his sons until they were in high school. Feeling as if they had heard his voice long enough as a coach and he had taught them the basic fundamentals of the game it was up to them to prove they were able to compete and overcome some of the adversities that comes along with playing a team sport. For the first time he and his wife were now AAU parents experiencing the low times of what it was like for their child to start the game, sometimes not playing more than two minutes the entire game to getting benched after making one mistake. But, they also experience the high times of their son being the lead scorer, making a steal or playing the whole game. Arlington never charged for his services of coaching AAU sports because he felt it was an opportunity to help his sons and other kids in the community stay in school, create an opportunity to get a scholarship, mature as a person, learning life lessons and becoming good citizens.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It wasn't until the 1980s that his interest in spirituality and religion began to blossom and his investigations into the Western religions began. However, by the early 90s, he was looking to Eastern philosophy for his \"answers\". Not long after he came to realize that the dogmas of organized religion were \"one part mysticism and nine parts water\". For him, that was not enough which drove him further toward the direct inquiry into the nature of \"his reality\". By the late 90s, he was writing about the more mystical aspects of Eastern meditative pursuits, exploring the writings of Dogen, Jiddu Krishnamurti, both Shunryu and D. T. Suzuki and Ramana Maharshi among others. In 2010, he published \"Disillusionment: The Doorway to Present Moment Clarity\" which details the results of this inquiry and in 2011 he published the first English translation of \"The Lost Writings of Wu Hsin: Pointers to Non Duality in Five Volumes\". Having traveled extensively throughout the world, he currently calls South East Asia his home.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

W. Kenyon(1867—1948) was born in Saratoga County, New York. At age nineteen, he preached his first sermon. He pastored several churches in New England and founded the Bethel Bible Institute in Spencer, Massachusetts. (The school later became the Providence Bible Institute when it was relocated to Providence, Rhode Island.) Kenyon served as an evangelist for over twenty years. In 1931, he became a pioneer in Christian radio on the Pacific Coast with his showKenyon's Church of the Air, where he earned the moniker \"The Faith Builder.\" He also began the New Covenant Baptist Church in Seattle. In addition to his pastoral and radio ministries, Kenyon wrote extensively.For more than fifty years,Don Gossetthas been serving the Lord through full–time ministry. Born again at the age of twelve, Don answered his call to the ministry just five years later, beginning by reaching out to his unsaved family members. In March 1948, Don overcame his longtime fear of public speaking and began his ministry in earnest, preaching for two country Baptist churches in Oklahoma.Blessed with the gift of writing, Don became editor of the Bible College magazine in San Francisco; afterward, he was invited to become editor of an international magazine. Following this, he served as editor of T. L. Osborn'sFaith Digest, a magazine that reached over 600,000 homes each month.Don has penned many works, particularly ones on the power of the spoken word and praise. His writings have been translated into almost twenty languages and have exceeded twenty–five million in worldwide distribution. Additionally, Don has recorded scores of audio series. His daily radio broadcast, launched in 1961, has been released into eighty–nine nations worldwide.Don raised five children with his first wife, Joyce, who died in 1991. In 1995, Don found lifelong love again and married Debra, an anointed teacher of the Word. They have ministered worldwide and have lived in British Columbia, Canada, and in Blaine, Washington State.In September 2009, Don and Debra (also an ordained minister) founded a new church in Vancouver, British Columbia, where they continue to serve as pastors. The International Community Church truly is an international body of believers with members from many nations sharing a vision: to bring the saving, healing, and restoring power of Jesus to the community, locally and abroad.", "related": ["B00EUQTTLG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is not an easy read, but the insights and rewards are great. --Trends in Cognitive ScienceGallagher and Shear have put together a fast paced yet savvy set of readings on the thorny problem of the self. It is a must read. --Michael GazzanigaMODELS OF THE SELF should be of interest to all thinking human beings, but I suspect that, covering as it does such a wide range of disciplines, most readers will be content to sample the volume in accordance with their particular specialist concerns. For my part, I have found many of the contributions stimulating, and in places illuminating.  --Urgyen Sangharakshita, Times Higher Education Supplement, London, March 17, 2000The book successfully spans a multidisciplinary mix of fields, from psychology and cognitive science through philosophy to mysticism, and some of these papers achieve a genuinely interdisciplinary exchange of ideas. Especially useful are the papers on topics such as psychiatry and Tibetan Buddhism, which may be overlooked in standard Western philosophy courses, but which illuminate the self by decomposing it. Louis Sass, for example, examines the pathological dissolution of the self in schizophrenia, and Jeremy Hayward takes us through the careful self- dissection of Buddhist meditation.  --Peter Lloyd, TLS, 11/12/99 - Times Literary SupplementWe cannot understand consciousness without tackling the self  and this book tackles it head-on.   --Susan Blackmore[This] is a challenging and provocative book.

Masterson wants to mediate between the three powerful and competing contemporary approaches to the divine - the phenomenological, metaphysical and theological - seeking to find a way to continue talking about God in our bleak, post-confessional landscapes...Masterson's careful and challenging engagement with Jean-Luc Marion is a particular highlight of the book. Overall, Masterson offers an important corrective to postmodern philosophy and theology. He strongly defends the values and insights of the Thomist tradition but also welcomes phenomenological explorations of the human experience of the divine. -- Dermot Moran The Irish Times Should we approach God through reason and philosophy-or should we let God approach us through divine Revelation? Approaching God is a elegant account of how we can do both, and it is full of wise and discerning counsel about how to manage such a delicate operation. Starting from a robust defense of Thomistic metaphysics in the face of postmodern critics of onto-theology, Patrick Masterson brings Aquinas into living dialogue with contemporary philosophy, providing in particular an original and extended confrontation of Aquinas's notion of God as subsistent being with Jean-Luc Marion's God without being. Genteel but magisterial, lucid but deep, generous but critical, this book represents an insightful tour by an erudite and skillful guide of the most daunting questions in philosophy and theology today. -- John D. Caputo, The Thomas J. Watson Professor of Religion Emeritus, Syracuse University, USA Approaching God contributes a new and compelling voice to the current debate on the return of religion, bringing together three different discourses, the phenomenology of Marion, the ontology of Aquinas and the theology of Barth. It is a brilliant triangulation of these three voices. -- Richard Kearney, Charles Seelig Chair of Philosophy, Boston College, USA The major strength of Approaching God is its critical dialogue between Thomistic realism and Marion's phenomenology, and it is intrinsically interesting on that score, since these two lines of philosophy very rarely meet. I cannot think of another work trying to engender such a meeting. This fine work does this with impressive thoughtfulness and fidelity to the richness of the partners in dialogue. -- William Desmond, Professor of Philosophy, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium The phenomenology of Marion, the metaphysics of Thomas Aquinas, the fideism of Barth: often enough any two of them are brought into positive conversation with one another, but rarely, as in Masterson's new book, all three together, and even less commonly with so constructive and nuanced an outcome. A remarkable achievement. -- Denys Turner, Horace Tracy Pitkin Professor of Historical Theology, Yale University, USA", "related": [], "rank": 1993174, "title": "Approaching God: Between Phenomenology and Theology", "author": "Patrick Masterson", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Pastor Kuda's message is that of hope, breakthrough, and dominion as he pursues to raise champions for God. He also has an apostolic mandate to bring a message of alignment to the body of Christ. Pastor Kuda is, however, a versatile seasoned teacher of the Word, having preached the gospel for over eighteen years in twelve nations in Africa and Asia. God led him to move the ministry headquarters to Brakpan more than three years ago, and he calls it \"one risk that paid off\" The new branch is fast growing and vibrant and has notably become an international model of influence.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As I said, when I first started talking to her, I've already read two of her books, so before I knew here I was already pimping her book! I'm always honest when I say that Tara is just fantastic!My first two books by her were \"dark\", mind f***ck ones and than I started reading other books by Tara and that characteristic that is so hers, to turn a story into something completely unexpected and build different stories inside one story appeared in every one of her books that I read so far...Last week I finally read her book My Side and it was  a surprise! I couldn't find that characteristic, but it didn't make the story less amazing! Just the opposite...Taking unexpected turns wouldn't match with that story, so I was pleased to see a different side of Tara with it. By the way, I super recommend it, LOVED My Side!And than I started reading For Love or Money and BAM! She does it again! It sure has a few turns but nothing like I would expect. Tara blows my mind again! She never, NEVER disappoints and fail to amaze me! If you want to read a book by a writer who doesn't write what you expect and just simply writes amazing stories, Tara is your girl! I'm convinced, Tara can write ANYTHING and I'm sure she can turn any subject into an interesting one and come up with an amazing story! Seriously...I have a reader crush on her, obviously LOLIn For Love or Money we meet Lana, a very selfish rich girl who has everything she wants and is a cry for attention. I didn't expect to like her, on the first pages I actually disliked her very much, she was just too superficial. But even then I knew there was more to her.Than enters James, the hot college football player who also has some secrets in his sleeves and tatooed body. James intrigued me from the start and damn, what a hot, dirty boy he is! I finished this book feeling like I NEEDED to meet him, I honestly would be happy with one goal in my life: being James's dirty girl. Honestly!The combination of Lana and James though, makes the story  just flow! Lana needed James in her life and us readers needed him in her life so we could see she actually wasn't always that selfish girl and inside her there was this completely different girl trying to come up to life again. Only James to be able to bring the real Lana not only to the surface, but for the whole world to see. He is as real as you get, even though he has his own dirty secret, Lana is pretty drawn to him (as would any living hetero female in the world!!) and she needed a dosage of his realness so she could show the world not only her potential, but herself!She is afraid of a lot of things and James makes her fears not only disappear, but also be blindsided by how much more she can be when she forgets about them. With James there's no barrel, no fears, no secrets and she can simply be...James also needed Lana in his life...only she was able to show him that he could actually have the dual life he wanted, the college boy and the musician he was. Both of them are incredibly gifted, but both were afraid to show it. James fear though is not like Lana's, he isn't afraid to show the world his talent, but he's afraid his talent and love for music would shadow his future, he wanted to have opportunities besides music. But when this two incredible people get united, they are unstoppable.  No fears, no crazy people, nothing and no one could stop then from shining!But in the middle of all this there's also a mystery of Lana's crazy perv stalker/rapist to be solved. Since she is pretty much addicted to sex, her being used is not something people would think of, after all in the eyes of the world she asked for all she got, but she is not that. She feels and she gets hurt and she feels guilty for being so out of control, people would think she wanted the attention of crazy guys or that she would drug minors just to have a good time.Lana needs to prove herself for her father, the mega music mogul, but she also needs to prove her value to herself, and making her work for it is the best lesson her father ever gave her. Along the way she will learn a lot, specially about herself.You will certainly laugh a lot with her, root for her, swoon over James and just enjoy this crazy yet amazing ride!This book has action, rock, music and players, what else not to like? Oh, did I mention the steamy scenes???!!! Oh boy! You're in for a treat...The only thing I wanted more was for James secret to be more explored, but that doesn't make the book  and the story bad, it's just my crazy Tara-addicted mind wanting more of her writing!!!Oh, you don't need to read My Side before, they are different stories, but the main character from it is mentioned in For Love or Money and I smiled big every time someone talked about him...I just love Tara's characters...the guys are always swoon worthy, amazing and the girls are always badass, snarky girls, and I relate so much with them haha I feel like I'm best friends with them and in the end I just want to hug the whole book! I wish there was a way I could meet all of them, what a crazy and fun party that would be!!!", "related": ["B00ITZRDW6"], "rank": 336255, "title": "For Love or Money", "author": "Tara Brown", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 20, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 90.0}
