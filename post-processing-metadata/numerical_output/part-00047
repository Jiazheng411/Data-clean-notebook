Miller's book is at once a history of that idea and a penetrating discussion of its vicissitudes in the American experience.

Scattered throughout are little gems of insight, such as his explanations for why there is not cooperative ownership of utilities in urban areas as there is in many rural areas...for why country clubs are member-owned rather than investor-owned...and for why charities and listener-supported public radio stations are run on a non-profit basis...[This book] is a substantial contribution to organizational sociology.

After all, she's only 12, and besides, she doesn't plan to marry–ever. The whole notion of a dowry is old-fashioned, even in Budapest, 1933. Mother and daughter are constantly at odds; one is critical and imposes her own dreams on her child; the other, in turn, is both rebellious and hurtful. Still, they make the railroad trip to Halas, known for its fine lace, every few months to check on the progress of the gift. Juli befriends the lace maker's daughter, Roza, an uneducated farm girl who helps her mother with her handiwork and chores. Despite her mother's harsh opinions of common country folk, Juli dreams of a life in Halas, reading and lying in the grass. When Roza's mother becomes ill, almost blinded by the strain of the minute stitchery, Juli hatches a secret plan to help. Under the ruse of buying shoes for the dance classes her mother insists she attend, she asks for money. She then uses it to buy a pair of magnifying spectacles for her Halas friends. This final deceit leads to a blow-up in which Juli's mother reveals painful information about her own life, which enables her daughter to finally understand and appreciate her. Though the family dynamics are realistically portrayed and fairly universal, the setting and particulars of the story have limited appeal. Still, readers might empathize with the protagonist as she struggles with her mixed emotions.–Barbara Auerbach, New York City Public SchoolsCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It became apparent that prepositions are one of the most difficult concepts to comprehend.  Upon his request, she began to write a children’s book using a number of prepositions.  The end result is The Dance of The Caterpillars.  Adele has used twenty three prepositions, 1 two-word multiple, and 2 three-word multiples in this story. Adele’s children’s books have become popular for English as a second language students all over the world and are on the top 10 list of ESL study material on Amazon.  At the time of the publication of this book, How the Fox Got His Color is available on Kindle and Nook in twelve languages, Where Hummingbirds Come From is available in ten languages, and The Dance Of The Caterpillars in ten languages. This book was written as a fun way to learn some of the words in t he English language that are difficult to explain.  If it helps even one child or English language , student, it will have been worth it. Thank you to my son-in-law, Bin Hu, for showing me how difficult it can be to learn the English language.

It's also entirely not real.This stunning debut novel from Toronto's Derek Winkler is the type of book that you have to restrain yourself from tediously retelling its entire plot to a friend over coffee. It's all I can do to stop myself from blurting out the twists and turns of this imaginative novel in this review.If you Google Pitouie, a website for the fictional Federated Pitouie tops the list. On the site is various info about the island (including a link to its Wikipitouia page) and a notice that Winkler's novel is \"not a true depiction of events\" nor sanctioned by the island's government - the Pitouie Development Corporation LLC.Pitouieis about waste. The island is offering disposal of hazardous waste, free of government regulations, in its volcanic lake. It's a tale of two men - Otis Wilson and Lars Varick. Wilson is a modern-day journalist working at the soul-sucking industry magazine,Waste Insight. Varick is a bored radar technician in the last small-crew Distant Early Warning line station in Canada's far north in the '70s. Both are wasting their lives, and Federated Pitouie is their escape.It's also a story about an unbelievable con - one that aims to capitalize on a world that has come complacent about waste.Pitouieis smart, like a good Hollywood indie film. It's quirky and fun with just the right levels of confusion and absurdity.Pitouieis the second book from The Workhorsery, a small Toronto publisher whose mission is \"to re-define what springs to mind when one comes across the term 'Canadian literature.'\"Pitouiedoesn't just re-define CanLit, it reinforces how good it can be. --Mike Landry, St. JohnTelegraph-Journal\"Adventure\" and \"intrigue\" are two of the last words you would expect to ­associate with a novel in which the main character works a dead-end job as the associate editor of a waste management trade magazine. But Derek Winkler s debut isn't typical. When Otis Wilson travels to the remote tropical island of Pitouie an independent corporate freehold with no industry, economy, or natural resources, just a group of industrialists willing to fork over big bucks to dump their waste into the island's volcano what he finds is much more complicated and strange than he expects, and the plot's well-­calculated twists keep the reader guessing.The novel uses alternating chapters to uncover pieces of Pitouie's puzzle while also telling a different story set 35 years earlier in a small Arctic military station and an Inuit village. Although this back-and-forth style initially hampers the story's momentum, the novel hits its stride near the halfway point as the drama and danger escalate, and the reader starts to see parallels and connections between the two stories.What makes Winkler's novel stand out from other tales of corporate intrigue is his sly and subtle use of humour. Typical adventure stories depend on violence, but Winkler's comedic timing and clever plot twists keep this tale fresh. --Suzanne Gardner,Quill & Quire", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Despite making his name in historical fiction, Griffin's portrayal of Moffett is masterful, a one-sitting page turner that hits from the opening sentence: \"When I shook Mark Moffett's hand, I realized it was swollen and marked by a distinct red mound the size of a grape.\" (It gets grosser.) Despite the brilliance of his photography and the ambition fueling his science, Moffett's fierce independence has left him something of apersona non grataamong the academic establishment, and that's without his theory on the more-than-analogous connection between ant colonies and human cities.

Su interés médico-científico inicial se centró en el campo de la neurología, derivando progresivamente sus investigaciones hacia la vertiente psicológica de las afecciones mentales. Freud innovó en dos campos. Desarrolló simultáneamente por un lado, una teoría de la mente y de la conducta humana, y por otro, una técnica terapéutica para ayudar a personas con afecciones psíquicas. Probablemente, la contribución más significativa que Freud ha hecho al pensamiento moderno es la de intentar darle al concepto de lo inconsciente (que tomó de Eduard von Hartmann, Schopenhauer y Nietzsche) un estatus científico (no compartido por varias ramas de la ciencia y la psicología). Sus conceptos de inconsciente, deseo inconsciente y represión, fueron revolucionarios; proponen una mente dividida en capas o niveles, dominada en cierta medida por una voluntad primitiva más allá de la esfera consciente y que se manifiesta en producciones tales como chistes, lapsus, actos fallidos, sueños y síntomas.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After learning her secretary is quitting to become a mail-order bride for an alternate world, Jane demands to meet the \"wizard\" arranging the multidimensional trip. Confident of exposing a sleazy scam artist, Jane is shocked when she's actually transported to the magical Great Northwest. Juanita Parker reads with enthusiasm as she brings to life an unusual world where unicorn rancher Max Farrel has spurned the beautiful wizard Cordelia, resulting in dire consequences for the entire frontier. Parker is particularly effective in her portrayal of Jane, a rude, pragmatic, loud-mouth New Yorker who may hold the key to saving both a man and a country from the curse of evil wizards. This engrossing tale of love and magic is highly recommended for fantasy collections.

Nate and Lunchbox, the superintelligent basset hound fromLunchbox and the Aliens(Holt, 2006), are back. Parker's Power Pooch Pellets, the best dog food (froonga) ever made from garbage using alien technology, is a huge hit, but the family business is going to be in trouble if they can't figure out how to make more machines. While the boy's parents go off to a pet-food convention just before Christmas, Great-Aunt Nelly arrives to look after things and starts baking up a storm, intent on winning the local fruitcake festival. Meanwhile, Frazz and Grunfloz, the aliens who helped Nate build the original froonga machine, are also in trouble. They have been caught by old enemies who want to take over the Earth, and the froonga. Not that it matters, since they probably won't survive Grunfloz's grudge-match of lob-lock against Oogash, a game that includes shock-producing balls, zero gravity, and extra points for creative insults. Will Lunchbox be able to save the planet from the evil aliens and the even worse fruitcake? It takes careful readers to keep track of the weird and wacky names and insults, but the quick-moving plot, silly situations, and fun illustrations keep everything moving at a smart clip.

To shake the police's unwarranted suspicion, Ricky starts his own investigation into the murder. Among the drug addicts, warring Hispanic street gangs, and friendly--or otherwise--fellow criminals, he discovers a big cover-up as he investigates. This novel is more than a simple murder mystery. As Ricky tries to track down several leads, he gets caught up with spurned romance from his past and has to deal with all those emotions again--as unpleasant as they were to live through the first time. Ricky is a likable, if somewhat misguided, character, and readers will find themselves rooting for him despite his many shortcomings.Ellie Barta-MoranCopyright © American Library Association.

DON HARPE has had a varied career, from military service in the 60’s to years spent as an industrial engineer for a major appliance firm. Harpe is a songwriter who has had many of his songs recorded, and who for years ran his own music publishing company. While in Nashville Harpe was the office manager of a publishing company that had several number one country music hits, and was also the Creative Director for Climbing Country, one of the most successful syndicated radio programs of the early  90’s. During this time he won the coveted Silver Pen Award from the Nashville Banner newspaper. Since retiring from public work in 2004, Harpe has concentrated on writing novels, and 2011 will see his fourth and fifth books published. He also has nearly 40 short stories available on line, including two in an anthology called Twisted Tails II, published by Double Dragon Publishing, which won the EPPIE AWARD for best science fiction anthology of 2007. His book of memoirs, THE LAST OF THE SOUTH TOWN RINKY DINKS, published in September of 2008, was an instant success with friends and readers alike. The stories are touching, down to earth tales of small town America, and will bring tears and laughter  to all who can remember when the world was a kinder, simpler place. It’s the kind of book that you won’t want to put down, and one that you will re-read many times over the years.  Now retired and living in south Georgia, Harpe devotes his time to Helen, his wife of 45 years, to his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren, and to his writing.  “I’m pretty satisfied in my own skin right now,” Harpe says, “and I just want to continue to write things that will entertain and hold the readers interest.” All of my work is currently available for the Kindle, the Nook and most other ereaders, and many are also available in print versions.", "related": [], "rank": 5101817, "title": "SUNDOWN TWO eBook", "author": "E.

In high school we shared many adventures. After years of living in New York, Vermont, and India I returned to my hometown and rediscovered my admiration for my old friends there, and saw that a colorful Mexican-American neighborhood had been re-christened “Hero Street” in honor of the men it had sent to America’s wars. I wanted to tell a story about Midwest America with a narrator from this community.    Diving for Carlos is an American myth. The narrator (Cruz) is mestizo, of mixed ancestry. I identify with this, feeling my psyche is a mix of influences—twenty-five years of studying and writing about India, teaching Asian Religions and Comparative Religion for twenty-five years, deeply interested in African-American music and creativity, married to a Jewish woman for forty-some years, etc. I think most Americans are now multi-cultural.    I studied at Goodman Theatre, the Art Institute of Chicago; in Vermont; in India; and I received my PhD at Harvard University. I taught courses about Comparative Religion for 25 years at Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis. I am the author of books about the singer-saints of South India (\"Vijayanagara Visions\"), fractals in cultures (\"Heaven's Fractal Net\"), and compassion in America (\"The Wisdom of Generosity\"). Besides writing, I like to make collages of found objects, and to edit music videos.    Diving for Carlos was a finalist in ForeWord magazine's Book of the Year Awards in the fiction category. A suspense novel by me, Gypsy Escapades, set in India, is being published by Rupa Publications in New Delhi.", "related": [], "rank": 4641136, "title": "Diving for Carlos", "author": "William Jackson", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

An emeritus 'historian of the English language', Hughes knows a lot about dictionaries of every stripe, whether orthodox or slang. He can provide the history of innumerable words, enabling readers to follow semantic changes, neologisms and other evolutions in the 'word field.'\"  (Times Higher Education, November 2009)", "related": [], "rank": 1807994, "title": "Political Correctness: A History of Semantics and Culture (The Language Library Book 28)", "author": "Geoffrey Hughes", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We'd been there a few years before, but just for a quick afternoon stopover on our way home from visiting family in Wisconsin. We'd loved the Island for the few hours we'd been on it and promised ourselves we'd go there again someday. So when we began to plan for our anniversary vacation we traveled back for a longer stay of six days. I'd made reservations months ahead at the Iroquois Hotel on the water's edge ofLake Huron and when the time came, after packing up everything we'd need, we jumped in the car and took off.The Island doesn't allow cars, only bicycles, horses and snowmobiles (in the winter) so we left our vehicle in a Mackinaw City parking lot on the mainland and boarded the ferry that would take us across the water to the Island, our luggage and two bicycles in tow. It was much cheaper to bring our own bikes instead of rent them there.It was late August and the Island was beautiful. Crowded with colorful, fragrant flowers, clomping horses, whizzing bicycles and, of course, lots of tourists.Fudgiesas they were called because they came, purchased and devoured so much of the little town's fudge.The Iroquois Hotel was lovely with its bright pastel colors and friendly service; a fancy in-house restaurant and our room with its wall of windows facing the lake. A lake that to me was as large as an ocean...because it went on forever.Our six days there were heaven. We rode our bikes, peddling around the horses, carriages, and equine taxis, around the eight-mile in circumference island and enjoyed the sights. The friendly people. The breathtaking views of water, boats and woods. The fudge.We sped along West Bluff Road to the ritzy Grand Hotel(made famous in the 1980 romantic time travel movieSomewhere in Timewith Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeve), ate the scrumptious and lavish tourists' brunch there and afterwards, so full we could barely ride our bicycles, we gawked at the magnificent Victorian mansions with their elaborate gardens liningLake Shore Drive.We visited Fort Mackinac and listened amusedly to people talk about the ghost soldier some had reported seeing when twilight began to fall. My husband, a photography buff, even slipped out of our hotel room in the middle of one foggy night to get artsy pictures with our new digital camera of the fort, hoping to catch the ghost. He captured no ghost, but plenty of stunning photographs.One night we even sat, spellbound, as a Lake Huron thunderstorm pounded wildly at our wall of windows. It was as if we were gazing at a tumultuous ocean.Then one day someone, in a cubbyhole of a local hamburger joint, over our lunch, said something aboutthe ice bridge, as the islanders called it. During the dead of winter, when the straits froze over, it was a narrow path that stretched about four miles across the ice that separated Mackinac Island from the St. Ignace mainland. The locals would drive in old Christmas trees along the path to show the way, to show it was now safe. To them the ice bridge meant freedom to come and go for up to two months a year without paying ferryboat or airplane fees. To me it sparked an idea for my next book...what if someone crossed the ice bridge one wintry night and fell through the ice? And disappeared...maybe even died?I started asking questions of the locals: Had someone ever fallen through the ice and perished? Turns out over the years, that yes, some people actually had. Fallen in. When the ice wasn't firm enough. Or when they'd gone off the solid marked path. Or in a snowstorm. Some on snowmobiles. Some were saved, dragged out, and some had not been.Hmmm.That's all it took for the book to begin forming in my head. The rest of the trip I looked at the Island with different eyes. A writer's eyes. Writer's ears. I filed away the memories and the home-grown stories recounted to me.Though most of my earlier books were romantic horror, I'd written a couple of straight contemporary murder mysteries,Scraps of PaperandAll Things Slip Away, a few years before and Avalon Books had published them. I'd quite enjoyed writing them.So I thought I'd write another one with Mackinac Island and its real and fictional ghost tales as the background. I'd show the beauty of the island, changing of the seasons, what it was like in summer, fall and winter (tons of snow and ice), and describe the historical landmarks. I'd spotlight the quirky close-knit inhabitants and have the protagonist gather their imaginary spirit stories to put into the ghost book she was writing. I'd make the Island nearly a main character itself with its enigmas, water, snow, ice and fog.The novel would be about a woman,Charlotte, jilted in love, coming back to heal and visit her poignant childhood playground, and her lonely Aunt Bess. She'd meet an Island cop, Matt, and together they'd not only fall in love but would embark on a great dangerous adventure together. There'd be a spunky old lady, Hannah, living next door and the four would be great friends. Until the old lady disappears on a winter's night while crossing the ice bridge and the mystery would begin. Had Hannah been murdered by someone....how exactly...by whom...and why? The remainder of the book would be the unraveling of that mystery as the central characters try to keep from being killed themselves by the devious murderer behind Hannah's death. I'd embed the Island's so-called ghost tales throughout the book to spice up the story even more. So it'd be a romantic ghostly murder mystery. Ah, ha. I couldn't wait to begin.When my husband and I returned home, refreshed and happy, I started it right away, with the memories of lovely Mackinac still fresh in my mind. Gosh, how I'd loved that Island. A tiny piece of old-fashioned paradise. The book came easily to me. And soThe Ice Bridgewas born. Now with a stunning new cover by Dawne Dominique and edited by my publisher, Kim Richards Gilchrist, it's out in the world for everyone to read and, I hope, enjoy.Written this 10th day of June 2012 by the author Kathryn Meyer Griffith", "related": ["B00JBLKWHU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.1667, "rating_total": 25.0}

Other days simply go from bad to worse. Despite Melanie Prentiss's best efforts to believe in redemption, today promised to be of the latter variety.The bad-day vibe began when she lit her hair on fire. Well, more of a smolder than an actual flame. All she'd meant to do was heat up her eyeliner pencil so the color would glide on smoothly. She'd been going for the larger-than-life-eyes look, not the she-barely-escaped-a-burning-buildingalive look.Fingering the singed chunk of hair at her right temple, Melanie sighed. That was the moment she should have taken notice and called in sick. But because her mother had raised her to be tenacious, she'd ventured on—only to spill her grande-size caramel macchiato all over her lap on the drive to work. A little mishap that nearly caused her to rearend the car in front of her. Not to mention the so-not-fun sensation of steaming hot liquid drenching her thighs.But did she turn her car around and head toward home like any sane person would've done? No. Something she regretted hugely when she entered her office building, rushing because she was already late, and managed to catch her heel on the rubber floor mat in the lobby. She'd flown across said lobby like a bird with an injured wing, landing in a pile of coffee-soaked clothes in front of the bank of elevators. Minus one shoe, naturally.And now:this.Melanie scowled as she stared at the hastily scrawled message from her boss stuck to her monitor:Melanie! My office. ASAP!Why today? She'd hoped for a longer reprieve before being summoned by Kurt, the editor she worked for at the small newspaper in Portland, Oregon. How likely was it that he wanted to see her about something other than her latest column? Not very, she admitted to herself. Heck, she couldn't even blame him. She'd crossed a line she shouldn't have.Again.Shrugging off her coat, she plopped down in her chair. No, the blame could only rest on her shoulders. Her emotions had gotten the better of her. Mostly because of her mother's latest broken heart. Loretta Prentiss had at least three of them per year, and it was always up to Melanie to help bandage together the pieces. Her mother was intelligent, attractive, the owner of a successful business, and ferociously devoted to finding her \"one true love.\"Too bad she had terrible taste in men.Loretta's men, as Melanie called them, all fell in the \"too\" category: too suave, too handsome and too charismatic. They laughed too hard and too loud, and the far majority of them bleached their teeth a little too much. Basically, they were too good to be true.At least the latest heartbreaker had waited until afterChristmas to commence with the wreckage. But with Valentine's Day less than two months away, Melanie wished he'd put it off for another seven weeks. That he'd wined and dined Loretta and gifted her with some roses and chocolates before waltzing off into the sunset.Yeah, that would have been perfect, and so much easier on LorettaandMelanie.Melanie's gaze landed on the note again, and she groaned. Giving advice that stayed on the right side of the line shouldn't be so difficult. And now… Well, there was a better-than-average chance she was about to be fired.Maybe she'd be lucky and Kurt would assign someone else as the advice columnist and let her focus on her other tasks. It wasn't as if becoming the next Dear Abby was her lifetime goal. In truth, the only reason she'd accepted the position was to get her foot in the door. It had taken her nearly five years after earning her degree to get this job.She'd considered herself fortunate to receive any offer. Especially with the undeniable fact that newspapers were laying off more people than they were hiring. So yes, she'd jumped at the position, even though her duties were mostly administrative in nature. Other than her column, she spent her time researching information and fact-checking for other staff members.Swearing under her breath, Melanie grabbed the bright yellow Post-it and crumpled it in her fist. What would she do if Kurt fired her? She had little to no savings—not because she spent money carelessly, but because she didn't earn that large of a paycheck to begin with—and between her car payment and rent, she barely managed to make ends meet.She could ask her mother for a loan, but that might squeeze her an extra month at most. Her mom's salon was successful, but not successful enough to support both of them for very long. Melanie tossed the balled-up note into the trash, leaned back in her chair, and closed her eyes in an attempt to ignore her building panic. In all likelihood, she was screwed.\"Out partying too late last night, Mel?\"The rich, melodic voice eased into her like sunshine on a cool day. The fact that such a voice came from such a man only served to irritate her more. Without opening her eyes, she said, \"Not hardly. That's your game, Jace.\"\"That's where you have me wrong. I don't play games.\"She cracked one eye open and immediately wished she hadn't. She'd never before come across a man who got to her the way Jace Foster did. Broad shoulders, narrow waist, tight hips, long legs, chiseled cheekbones and dark-chocolate eyes that promised long, sultry nights filled with tantalizing sex. She'd wanted him—no, she corrected herself, she'dyearnedfor him—from the moment they met. But dipping her toe into the water of the office's resident playboy was a mistake she refused to make. Tenacity wasn't the only lesson she'd learned from her mother, and Jace definitely fell in the \"too\" category.\"Go away,\" she said, closing her eye again. \"I'm thinking.\"\"Go ahead and think, darlin'. I'm happy to wait…and watch.\"Melanie felt him approach, heard him slide himself up on her desk, but she ignored him. Well, she tried to. She did okay until she heard the rat-a-tat-tat of a pencil tapping. Damn it!\"I know you don't see women thinking very often, so while I understand the appeal, I'd prefer to be left alone,\" she said.He laughed, a deep rolling sound that unhinged something tight inside of her. And how frustrating was that? \"I'm supposed to tell you that Kurt wants to see you posthaste,\" Jace drawled. \"Did you do something to irritate the head honcho?\"Her eyes snapped open. \"Since when did you become Kurt's assistant? Are you bringing him his coffee now, too?\"\"Just passing the message along, like he asked.\" Glints of humor, and something else, shone brightly in Jace's eyes. As if he had a secret. He knew something, and he couldn't wait for her to find out what that something was. She was sure of it.\"Spill it. What's going on?\"Jace tucked the pencil behind one ear, his longish black hair covering most of it. Holding both hands in front of him, as if giving up the fight, he said, \"Go talk to the boss. We'll talk when you're done.\"Standing, she planted her hands on either side of Jace and leaned in close. The spicy scent of his cologne began a curl of heat deep in her belly. \"What's going on?\" she repeated.\"I said—\" his head tilted forward \"—go talk to the boss first.\" He brought one hand up, his fingers touching her temple, and the heat of it forced a tremble that began at her toes.\"Wh-what are you doing?\" she stammered. A series of shivers stole over her, and for a breath-stealing second, she thought he was going to kiss her.Here.In the middle of the workplace. And why in Heaven's name was that idea so appealing?Full lips turned upward at the corners in a smile that had surely charmed dozens, if not hundreds, of women before her. His fingers brushed back until they tugged gently at her hair. \"I'm wondering when singed hair became the newest fashion statement, Mello Yello.\"In an instant, the desire she'd began to feel evaporated. Pushing herself away, she centered herself by crossing her arms. \"Bad morning. Is it about to get worse?\"\"Depends on your definition of worse.\"She angled her head toward Kurt's office. \"What do you know that you're not telling me?\"Jace blinked long, sooty lashes in feigned innocence before shoving himself off her desk. \"I'll be waiting for you,\" he said over his shoulder as he sauntered away.Without fully realizing it, she watched him as he walked off, his long-legged gait one of lazy sexuality. How many women had been lulled into his bed by the look of those legs in tightly fitted denim? By the crazy, heart-pumping want of unbuttoning his jeans and stripping them off of him, one leg at a time? Far too many, she was sure. And all of them had likely believed in happily-ever-afters and all too easily had visualized Jace as their knight in shining armor. Well, not her. She wouldneverbecome a notch on Jace Foster's belt.Battling the annoyance rising up, she inhaled a mouthful of air. The sound of a throat clearing caught her off guard.\"You want to have this discussion out here, or shall we go to my office?\" asked Kurt, now standing in front of her desk. \"Either works for me, but you might appreciate some privacy for this conversation.\"Yep. She was going to be fired. \"Your office. I was just on my way,\" Melanie replied, nervous all over again. \"Just let me grab my notebook—\"\"Don't need it.\" He turned on his heel with the confidence of a man in charge, knowing she'd fall in behind. Not that Kurt Winslow was a bad guy, because he wasn't. But he was most certainly the boss, and the people who worked for him respected and feared him in equal measures.Well, except for Jace. He respected Kurt well enough but seemed to fear nothing.She waited t...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Say goodbye to the industrial-age business mentality which seeks financial returns for shareholders above all else. The problem with a single-minded obsession with short-term financial profits is that it often harms communities, nature, and future generations. Haque argues that such a pursuit also leads to the destruction of \"higher-order wealth\"--the social, intellectual, and emotional capital that fulfills our lives. Businesses, he says, can pursue financial capital and the other kinds of capital that fuel human potential. Consumers are beginning to demand things that make them feel relationally, spiritually, physically, and creatively fulfilled. The business of \"betterness\" inspires an authentically good life, elevates and enlightens us, and increases our human potential. Haque's writing is exciting, motivating, and infectious. Yet it's also practical. He examines a handful of companies that focus on building human potential and nurturing our collective welfare, and he shows how they are doing it. For business leaders he offers concrete steps to begin a transformation from within.

He’s always loved the quirky, risqué and funny sides of life and, on reaching the age of forty, he decided that it was about time he put some of the stories he’s been part of, or heard, on paper rather than keeping them for the pub.  John writes to make people smile and to remind people that you don’t always have to take life too seriously and that if something embarrassing has happened to you, somebody somewhere is probably relating the tale down the pub right now - or writing about it in a book! But, on the bright side, always remember, no matter how embarrassed you’ve ever been in your life, there’ll be somebody somewhere who’s been more embarrassed – and John Kendrick probably knows the tale!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

(Mac Jackson, The University of Auckland)An impressive work of scholarship... a genuinely original and valuable addition to the substantial body of criticism of Shakespeare's Sonnets. (Stanley Wells)Boyd demonstrates how literary study can, should, and will be done in the future. (Jonathan Gottschall, Washington and Jefferson College)The book showcases Brian Boyd--the Vladimir Nabokov expert and author of the well-received On the Origin of Stories: Evolution, Cognition, and Fiction--in brilliant conversation with Brian Boyd, the voluble and energetic reader of evolutionary biology. Boyd-lit offers subtle and capacious readings of the sonnets' playfulness, their ways of challenging and attracting four centuries of readers. Boyd-bio explores the affinities between the sonnets and science: from terror management theory to male mating efforts, from cognition research to Maori battle songs…The risky leaps that Boyd-bio takes are breathtaking, and open Shakespeare's art to fresh enquiry...The admirably informed Boyd-lit offers crisp and clear readings of sonnets...Boyd's valuable syntheses of literature and science range beyond those of A. N. Whitehead, beyond Nabokov perhaps, and certainly beyond the cutting remarks of scientist T. H. Huxley. (David GewanterTimes Higher Education2012-04-26)Boyd proves a delightful guide to the sonnets' tortuous passages, artfully describing their twists and turns. He compares the sequence to a kaleidoscope that \"continually taps or shakes its colored chips into new configurations\" at times teasingly reminiscent of nearby sonnets. Without story to seize our attention, Boyd argues, Shakespeare--like all lyric poets--must load his lines with \"more or less pure patterns of verbal form\" that command our focus at the risk of exhausting it. Displaying a scholar's skill and an evangelist's enthusiasm, Boyd points out patterns sonic, semantic and imagistic...His volume marks an intriguing entry point into a line of inquiry that will surely continue to evolve, providing ever more particular reasons for our rhymes. (Abigail DeutschWall Street Journal2012-04-28)[A] lively and unusual account of Shakespeare's sonnets...[Boyd] has a lot of good things to say about the details of the sonnets, much that is subtle, humanly interested, and closely observed. He writes evocatively about the confusions and ambiguities of narrative in the poems. (Seamus PerryTimes Literary Supplement2012-05-02)A most accessible book that blends the local with the vast, particularly in Elizabethan sonnets, which have the human disposition towards natty verbal patterns...Gerald Brenan once observed that \"One of the marks of a great poet is that he creates his own family of words and teaches them to live together in harmony and to help one another.\" And Shakespeare was such a canny harmonist. Boyd has an excellent ear for the sounds and steps of this lineal family, reading the most relevant sonnets persuasively, coaxing out their innuendoes, even their resistances.

The likes of Oates and Plimpton and even Remnick may turn a phrase, but only Schulberg has seen most every important fight since Louis-Schmeling. This collection gathers together reviews, biographical sketches, and boxing reportage from throughout his life. The pieces are largely brief and often very recent--chapters are devoted to the likes of Arturo Gati and Prince Nasseem Hamed (whom Schulberg calls \"the little prince\"). Throughout, Schulberg exhibits a boxing IQ matched by his wit. He writes, for instance, of Archie Moore's \"beautifully timed and perfectly thrown right hands, which remind one of well-told stories, short and to the point.\" With relatively few punch-by-punch recounts of fights and quite a lot of strategy analysis, this collection will appeal most to seasoned boxing fans. But most anyone can enjoy the wonderful 80-page piece that closes the book, a stirring eulogy for the famously greedy and self-involved fight promoter Mike Jacobs.John GreenCopyright © American Library Association.

Iris, a rising star at the brokerage firm McKinney Alitzer, is already dealing with a back-stabbing regional manager when she is thrown into an even worse situation. Her friends Bridget and Kip Cross have used his programming skills and her business savvy to turn Pandora Software into a wildly successful computer gaming company. But their marriage is crumbling and, not long after Bridget decides to take the company public, she's murdered. Naturally, Kip is the main suspect. Iris is named in Bridget's will as trust administrator to run Pandora, which lands her smack in the middle of a nasty, multiparty fight. The rambling plot involves multiple murders; a Texas business raider's attempts to control Pandora Software; adultery; interoffice intrigue at McKinney Alitzer and Pandora; and a little girl who saw her mother's murder but repressed her memory of it. Pugh doesn't seem to try to craft all these elements together with any elegance. In addition to nervous verbal energy (much of it expended on describing what characters wear), she relies on plot contrivances (some, like cars that don't start, used more than once) and the titillating atmosphere of narcissistic L.A. to hold a reader's interest.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 1533764, "title": "Foolproof (Iris Thorne Mysteries -- Book 4)", "author": "Dianne Emley", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He considers the claustrum dweller's projective identification into an internal object to be not \"massive\" (a quantitative concept), but rather, \"intrusive\" (a qualitative concept), hence its malignancy. He also discovered that not only the uterus, but also other spaces of the internal mother figure, are susceptible to becoming a \"maternal claustrum\", each giving rise to distinct pathologies.' - REBECA GRINBERG, Training Analyst and Child Analyst, Asociacion Psicoanalitica de Madrid, IPA 'In this book Meltzer both develops and brings into direct clinical use the later aesthetic vertex of Bion, in a radical post-Kleinian and, I would say, systems-oriented understanding of severe personality disorders, more illuminating than life and death instincts at work. Meltzer shows that however dynamic a person's life may seem to be, his inner world may be dominated by stagnant, narcissistic, closed systems with no vital interchange. No real commitment to others and no true relation to his inner self will then be permitted, and his inner life will eventually disintegrate if he does not change. In a clear-cut but not simplistic way Meltzer shows how to identify these patterns, and the omnipotence and claustrophobic fears that accompany them.' - LENNART RAMBERG, Training Analyst, Swedish Psychoanalytical Association, IPA and IFPS 'Perhaps it can be seen as a diptych together with The Apprehension of Beauty. For the claustrum dweller in intrusive identification, no freedom is given to the object and so the riches and beauty of the host turn sour...the claustrum in its deepest unconscious mentality is a world of misconceptions, misrepresentations, failed recognition and delusion.' - JON MORGAN STOKKELAND, Stavanger, Norway & LARS THORGAARD, Aarhus, Denmark, Adult Psychotherapists and Psychiatrists 'Living unconsciously in head/breast, genital or anal compartments has severe psychopathological consequences. Meltzer's investigations in these narcissistic worlds profoundly enlarge our understanding of schizophrenia, borderline states, perversions, addictions and claustrophobic phenomena.' - TOMAS PLAENKERS, Training Analyst, German Psychoanalytical Association, Sigmund-Freud Institut, Frankfurt 'I find this a wonderful book. Meltzer has a light touch in talking about very serious problems of mental growth, without belittling them. He also gives a picture, with tenderness and his ever-present wry humour, of how we can find something better, more alive for ourselves and for our patients. His work is inspirational for students and experienced practitioners alike.' - KATHERINE ARNOLD, Child and Adult Psychotherapist, UK", "related": ["B0067J68JA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But something is wrong with this picture of holiday cheer: it is Germany in 1938 and Egon is a Jew. Kristallnacht has just occurred; Egon has already been humiliated in school and denied basic rights, and his sister's mysterious disappearance is met by indifference by the police. He knows not to attract the attention of the Gestapo, but disastrously, he does exactly that when he gets into a traffic accident which is the fault of a prominent Nazi Party member. Egon then becomes a fugitive. After wending a tortuous route, he arrives at the Danish border on Christmas Day and eventually gains freedom through the good will of a Danish sergeant. This true story about the author's father-in-law is not unrealistically upbeat, however, and Ray describes the particular fates of members of Egon's family in an afterword. Told in straightforward prose, the story is absorbing, hopeful yet not naive.

Along with his wife, Sharon, he is co-author of over eighty internationally-published novels. Originally born in Chicago a long time ago, Sharon Ahern met her future husband and co-writer, Jerry Ahern, on the very first day of High School, and they became friends for life. They eventually married and had two wonderful kids, Jason and Samantha, and five beautiful grandchildren.  Sharon began her writing career in the public relations department of Illinois Bell Telephone and stringing for a local newspaper. Always an avid researcher—Sharon was always eager to do book reports and term papers—she was happy to pull out the Britannica and become an instant expert on whatever information Jerry needed for a story, whether a particular time in history or facts concerning a far away place. Now the musty volumes have been replaced with the internet. She has interviewed people on a wide range of topics such as Voodoo practices and biker gangs. Sharon is also a professional photographer, her works having been published in magazines throughout the world.  When not working with Jerry, Sharon enjoys reading, antiquing, and gardening in the long Georgia summers, where they have resided for over thirty years.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Walker and Carter G. Woodson). The texts, which were originally published in the early 1990s, are clearly written and presented in a clean design. Captions for the full-color photos and illustrations provide additional information and the further reading and websites have been updated. Some of the text-heavy pages might present a problem for lower-level readers, but overall, the language is simple and straightforward. Challenging vocabulary is set in a bold font and defined in the glossaries.

Philippe Matthews is a star, and with the SHOCK Philosophy he continues to cast his inimitable light.”– Marianne Williamson (Spiritual Leader, Author)“I spent decades of my life not only sabotaging my own success – - but taking it even further – - using my talents and turning them against myself. Philippe Matthews teaches you how to overcome this problem with his SHOCK Philosophy and to rely on the innate – - the spiritual – - to create success and wealth. Matthews is without a doubt, one of America’s best motivators.”– Andy Behrman, (Author: “Electroboy“)\"I’ve been a fan of Philippe Matthews for a long time. He understands success on every level – financial, spiritual, practical. He’s done it again with his SHOCK Philosophy – a practical tool that will lead you step-by-step through his process toward greater insight, awareness and achievement. At each step, he’ll challenge your assumptions, and he’ll challenge you to dig deeper into your thinking, your self-insights, and your world-view.\"– Dr. Stephen J.

The museum gets tugged around by a blue whale and giant octopus; Larry finds his daughter swimming around with ancient amphibians (giving Trenc the opportunity to introduce the coelacanth, a living fossil fish); and other watery havoc ensues before Larry is able to set everything high and dry for the morning. Pencil lines and watercolor washes plunge the night city into deep watery blues, and the pop-eyed underwater critters are a uniformly friendly bunch. Little marine biologists will savor the thought of favored museum exhibits coming to life, and the story is jaunty enough to become a favorite for anyone who enjoys a fine, imaginative flight of fancy.

Nothing seemed to fit...  I've been mulling around the idea of this book for roughly a year, but other obligations kept me away from it. When my mother passed away on Oct 14, 2012 after a year and a half battle with lung cancer, it became clear which charity and so the story that had been swirling around in my mind for roughly a year began to write itself for me.While I'll be donating 30% of the proceeds of this book to the Canadian Cancer Society (For July and Aug) if the donation doesn't make it to the $1000.00 mark, by the end of the donation period, I will step in and bump it up myself to achieve that mark.

Case in point: the mystery of Pioneer 10's stubborn refusal to adhere to its projected trajectory. Launched in 1972 and now quietly hurtling well beyond Neptune's orbit, Pioneer 10 drifted hundreds of thousands of miles off course. But why? Could some as yet undiscovered fundamental force have finally tipped its hand? As with most hopes and dreams, the promise of groundbreaking scientific discovery isn't easy to let go, and amongThe Pioneer Detectives, one scientist's refusal to relinquish his belief that the spacecraft's errant path provided the smoking gun for a new physics proves particularly powerful and sad. Another's long and careful journey to the core of the mystery illustrates both the brilliant self-correcting venture of science itself and--more to the point--journalist Konstantin Kakaes's understanding that science stories are, at their base and at their best, human stories. --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 591095, "title": "ebook,Konstantin Kakaes,The Pioneer Detectives: Did a distant spacecraft prove Einstein and Newton wrong?

In the face of global ecological and economic crises, she offers utopianism as a robust and realistic method that encompasses both a critique of the existing world and alternatives for a better one that can be mobilized in the process of transforming, indeed redeeming, the dark times in which we live.' - Tom Moylan, Professor Emeritus and Co-Director of the Ralahine Centre for Utopian Studies at the University of Limerick, Ireland'Author of the path-breaking The Concept of Utopia Ruth Levitas has produced a new powerful reflection on the protean nature of the utopian. It is a very fine work, theoretically innovative, truly interdisciplinary, and combining scholarly integrity with a distinctive political voice. The meditations of a lifetime.' - Vincent Geoghegan, Professor of Political Theory, Queen's University Belfast, UK'Ruth Levitas' Utopia as Method is a profound and deeply original exploration of the connection between utopian thinking and social theory, and an urgent call for sociologists to place the imaginary reconstruction of society at the centre of their work. It is a wonderful, inspiring book.' - Erik Olin Wright, Vilas Distinguished Professor, University of Wisconsin, USA  'This book is an indispensable support for deep change in trivial times, a testimonial to the transformative power of imagination, and a celebration of life as a journey that can find an echo across all cultures in our changing world.'  - Jenneth Parker, Research Director, Schumacher Institute, UK 'In Utopia as Method, Levitas offers an urgent and convincing application of utopian theories to IROS (the Imaginary Reconstitution of Society). She builds on her magisterial earlier work The Concept of Utopia to persuade readers that the current era (late capitalism in its death throes) has made utopian thinking mandatory not self-indulgent or irrelevant.

I’ve always been poetically inspired, but in college I discovered a way to translate my thoughts into well-crafted stories. I knew then my purpose, but feared the sacrifice that my calling required. After two years of remunerative denial, I left corporate America to pursue a full-time writing career. Since then, I’ve discovered that true success is the fulfillment of one’s purpose, whether in the boardroom or the home office. I’ve made it my goal to spread that message to my generation. In 2010 I co-founded The Young Dreamers Movement, Inc., an education based organization with the mission for every person in Generation Y to declare a dream.  Authoring my first book, “Memoirs of a Dreamer”, I hope to reveal the process of success: the struggle, the sacrifice, and the faith required.  My future aspirations are to dominate film, television, music, and literature - catalyzing the entertainment industry toward inspirational productions that will awaken the world to achieve their purpose and dream again.", "related": [], "rank": 4133465, "title": "Memoirs of a Dreamer", "author": "Ferrell Fellows", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although part of the Shojo Beat line, likeNana, this series is for the older reader, due to both premise and occasional profanity. The art fits both genres: it's got the stern-but-attractive older boss and the lovely-but-insecure young woman in panels dominated by emotion and decorated with flowers. The boss-servant tells her how to behave, how to do her secretarial job, even how to speak; he also knows her measurements intimately. Longing looks, over-the-top tension (a knife-wielding crazy takes her hostage), and passionate verbal exchanges make for a thrilling roller-coaster love story. The powerful, perfect man who becomes a lady's slave for love is a staple of the text romance; here, the servant part is simply more literal. His protection is overwhelming and much too traditional—some readers may not understand why she puts up with such controlling verbal abuse —but the moments of kindness he shows are seductive.(Dec.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

My guess is no, because I have yet to pick up something by this amazing author and not enjoy it start to finish!White Girl Problems is a very 21st century fairy tale.From her Ugg boots to her need to instagram everything, Finley is about as \"white girl\" as anyone can get. I love Finley. I love that she's immature and silly and real. She doesn't change over night and she has flaws that are still apparent at the end of the novel, but she's working on herself and she's growing up and she's maturing.Aiden is your classic prince charming with a twist... he doesn't always say or do the right thing... in fact, he seems to mess up quite a lot- don't worry, he always makes up for it and it's never intentional. He's trying to work out his love for Finley and his family issues and he always has good intentions. He's a great character and totally book boyfriend worthy!Hattie and Jess are wonderful characters as well that I couldn't help but fall in love with. What can I say? I relate to the girl who spends too much time locked in her room on computers... though I never played WOW. And what's not to love about a feisty old lady? Especially when she's a better parent/role model for Finely than anyone else has ever been.White Girl Problems is one of my favorite reads of the year!I had a smile on my face more often than not because it was just such a fun book to devour... and I did devour it!(This is the review from my blog bookitbookblog.wordpress.com/2013/12/18/white-girl-problems/)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 33, "rating_average": 4.4848, "rating_total": 148.0}

I love watching teen drama shows, reading, writing, and listening to music.  I have a loving family, my mother who’s taught me about love and lasting relationships. A father who pushes me to excel and succeed at anything I desire. My younger sister and I’ve become very close over the years, and she’s very supportive of everything I do. I’ve been married for nine years to my best friend. I love my husband more than anything. He’s so kind, loving and supportive. He likes to joke with his friends, “My wife writes porn.”  We have a twelve year old daughter who’s so smart and talented. I can’t believe how fast they grow up. She’s turning into quite the young lady. She aspires to be so many things, and I encourage them all. She loves to write songs and has even tried her hand at writing a book. Maybe one day, she’ll follow my example.  Being that I’m from a small town, I’ve made some long lasting relationships. I’ve two best friends who I’ve known for most of my life. We’ve continued to stick together over the years, and we’re always there for one another. I couldn’t imagine my life without them.  Animal lover I’m not, but I have a headstrong dog that’s the absolute best-behaved dog I’ve ever seen and a cat that drives me insane, but I love her nonetheless.  I’ve always aspired to be a neonatal nurse, and I continue to work towards that goal. Maybe one day it will come true. However, writing has become my new favorite love.  I never would have dreamed that I’d become a writer, but some really great people convinced me otherwise. Eventually I decided to give it a try and what do you know? I just finished writing my second book and I couldn’t be happier. I’ll continue to write in my spare time with hopes of it becoming a full time career at some point in my life. So take note, I’m just a small town girl trying to bring light to your darkness, anything is possible if you work hard at it. So hold your head high, get out there, and do what you love.", "related": ["B00L82ZVYE"], "rank": 1485251, "title": "Unexpected Destiny (Unexpected Series Book 2)", "author": "Charlene Martin", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 22, "rating_average": 4.6364, "rating_total": 102.0}

She raised in a small town, in the middle of nowhere. Small town life is something she cherishes. Having spent her afternoons outside or with a book, she grew up with a love of reading and writing. Her mother and grandmother fully encouraged this in her. Many years later, after a husband and children, she made a promise to her dying grandmother to fulfill her dream of being an author. Her grandmother lived to see Nicole's name in print. This was a turning moment for her. Driven by ambition and a promise made, she has since published her first trilogy (The Mohawk Series). When not writing, Nicole spends her time cuddling up with her daughter or enjoying her husbands company. Encouraging reading in our youth is something Nicole feels strongly about. She reads to her daughter daily and loves to see others do the same. She exists purely on coffee and still enjoys to read as much as she enjoys writing.", "related": ["B00HG15RHM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Along with that illustrious lineage, she was related to vaudeville performers, horse trainers, cowboys, entrepreneurs, teachers, and preachers. With such diversity surrounding her from childhood, she still managed to grow up and develop a deep love of books. It was only natural that along the way, she would write them too. The Survivors: The Time of Chaos is her first published novel. More will undoubtedly follow.  Freak Files: The Unexplained Tales is a collection of stories believed to be true to life. After decades of experimental cooking, much to her family’s chagrin (after all, the family is inflicted with the less-than-wonderful versions that never see print!) Gia began writing food articles and a food blog.  It was inevitable that cookbooks would follow.  This is the eighth cookbook.  Previous titles include: All Chocolate—Easy & Economical Recipes Anyone Can Make At Home, 55 Fantastic Fudges, The All American Biscuit, 56+ Marvelous Homemade Mixes, 55 Frightfully Fun  Foods, A Home Style Thanksgiving, At Grandma’s Stove, The Poverty Perspective Cookbook: Recipes for Rock Bottom Budgets and My Precious Cookbook.  Most titles are available in both print and digital editions. Today, after many incarnations along the way, Gia Scott lives in Mississippi with her husband, three dogs, and two cats in a funny little house surrounded by very big and gnarly trees. Having reached that age of privilege, she can often be found in her garden, wearing peculiar clothes and tending her plants. When she can talk her husband into it, they enjoy going for road trips, looking for the elusive town of New Hope. In between road trips and gardening, she manages to fit in an internet radio talk show called the Dawn of Shades, interviewing a variety of people, including other authors, and promoting causes dear to her heart. In addition to all of that, she still maintains blogs on general topics, cooking & food, and camping, emergency preparedness & outdoors activities. She also helps with content for websites.", "related": [], "rank": 2358246, "title": "Dips and Spreads", "author": "Gia Scott", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sometimes darkness will cloud your path. But just as sure as the sun rises, you’ll always have a way out. You can find your way back to Happiness Road and I can help you.      My name is John Anthony and I am a UK based spiritual awareness coach, medium, counselor and writer who specializes in Spiritual Development. Through my connection with the unseen world I help people from all walks of life discover who they truly are, figure out their life’s purpose and heal from difficult situations.       I was drawn to this path twenty five years ago when I became a home based care giver for my wife. Needing to make sense of all the challenges we were faced with, I began developing my own spiritual awareness and researching the history of human development.      From that point on, I knew with one hundred percent certainty that I’d found my passion.      Over the years I’ve had extensive training, working with a number of experienced mediums, the Spiritualists’ National Union and the Institute of Spiritualist Mediums. I have conducted countless private sittings and provided public demonstrations of clairvoyance and psychic connection. I’m honored to say that through my work I’ve helped hundreds of people reconnect with loved ones and explore their own natural spirituality.      Another of my passions is awareness workshops, which my wife and I conducted when we operated the Essex-based Spiritworks Center (near London UK) in 2001. At Spiritworks we helped guide those who came to us towards self-fulfilment so they could lead happier more empowered lives and rediscover their natural spirituality.       Today, thanks to the internet, I work with seekers from all over the world.

Whether it's a demonstration of love between partners, a fun shag between friends or a tool of domination and subjugation, sex comes laden with emotional baggage that effects most of us at one time or another.'Shafted' is the story of a young woman who falls prey to a couple with ulterior motives beyond their adoration of sex. The web is drawn so tightly around her, she cannot see the manipulation.Her background story, which is not included in the book, is that Alex Osborne is a legal secretary that has worked in the same firm for her entire working life. Her new boss is a misogynist asshole who belittles her at every opportunity. She is on the verge of leaving the company when her favourite aunt, Beatrix, dies in a car crash. Beatrix is an eccentric, wealthy spinster who purchased the abandoned manor on a whim a few years previously but hadn't gotten around to restoring it. This job is then bequeathed to 27-year old Alex who at first is hesitant, but sees it as an opportunity to escape her single life in London and her horrid boss. So instead of quitting, she takes long service leave and plans to spend six months repairing the manor. Alex didn't have long term plans for the house to begin with; a gap which is exploited by the builder, Dan Baronet, and his wife. Thus begins an intense roller coaster for the protagonist which ends... well, you'll have to read the book to find out that part!It was a delight to write this story and I used my own refurbishment experiences to inspire much of the story.I hope you enjoy it.Rachael Hayden", "related": ["B00IGCUGA8"], "rank": 1106834, "title": "SHAFTED: an absorbing, suspenseful erotic thriller", "author": "Rachael Hayden", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The doctors told me I had Prostate Cancer. At that time, I had just received a lead role in a play that I was acting in. The doctor told me to come into his office and sit down, that he wanted to explain some things to me. Mr. Porter the doctor said. You have three choices. You can do nothing and you will survive three years. Then we will only be able to make you comfortable with some medication. The second thing is to have an operation and clear all the Cancer out of your body. And lastly, you may take radiation treatments for that will also clear the Cancer from your body as well. The medical procedures will leave you with some problems for the rest of your life. These procedures if done early enough will leave you with a better quality of life. We have seen a 90% success rate from having these procedures done. I walked out of that office afraid and angry. Once I arrived at home,called my children, and we discuss, what would be the best decision for the family. We all agreed that radiation would be the best way for us to go. That was in November of 2009 as I went through those horrible weeks of radiation. Five days a week without fail. I studied 300 lines that I had to bring to memory. I was the lead actor in the play called \"The Devil Is Loose\". Most of those eight weeks were very uncomfortable. I still was able to perform and did a good job. I told none of the production staff about my medical condition. Now, I write e-books for Amazon Kindle, and happy to say I will continue as long as I can. I hope that when you purchase one of my books. My belief is you will enjoy the stories that I produce. I write like there is no tomorrow, so you will get my very best every time out.", "related": ["B00G6P1TMG"], "rank": 2313128, "title": "Do You Love Horror Books? \"Whore\" Will Scare You Senseless & Awaken Your Innermost Nightmares", "author": "Richard Porter", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The writing style helps ‘excite’ students to this area of psychology.”--Sue Ludwig, Grant MacEwan University “I like the Social Psychology in Action chapters, other textbooks do not have these and I feel it is very beneficial to put the concepts discussed in a ‘real life’ setting.”--Kim O’Neil, Carleton University “I love this book. It is very well-organized and extremely well-written. The topics are covered in sufficient depth for an undergraduate class. There is a nice balance between theoretical discussion and presentation of research findings. I also like the transitions from classical to current research studies. There are many topical examples used throughout the text. This along with the emphasis on Canadian content helps keep the students engaged and provides a great springboard for in-class discussions.
