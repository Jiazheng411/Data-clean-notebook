Isadora has built a tough exterior so as to not get hurt again. She is an intelligent woman who has cut herself off from people, yet instead of deterring Beau, he is captivated by what is hidden behind her prickly façade. This proposition allows Beau to carefully plan a slow seduction of Isadora’s body and heart even though she is uncomfortable being ten years his senior. The connection they feel is quite passionate and never humiliating. The use of BDSM allows Beau to slowly teach Isadora to trust him and more importantly herself. The sex scenes, although later in the story, were quite seductive and well worth the wait. The anticipation of their union was orchestrated so well that toys should be at close hand. The main focus of the story is the building relationship between Isadora and Beau with minor secondary characters that help to initiate the proposal. I found that even though Beau likes to be in control, he gives up his control for Isadora by cherishing and making her feel special. Beau is definitely a hero that I fell in love with at the very beginning. Not only did Beau have the perfect lure for Isadora, he saw beyond her beastly reputation to her inner beauty. I found this tale an entertaining entry to the BDSM genre.

But as the 20th century progressed, the impact of such scientific thinkers as Darwin and Spencer led to popular endorsements of various theories of eugenics that undercut religious beliefs about the sacredness of human life and promoted popular support not only for a right to die, but for the killing of the feebleminded and infirm. By 1939 \"roughly 40 percent of all Americans polled said they supported legalizing government-supervised mercy-killing of the terminally ill.\" Dowbiggin has brought together a wealth of social history, medical knowledge and political analysis to elucidate the complex history of U.S. movements that endorsed mercy killing and the ever-shifting public sentiments that they engendered. It was the horrendous misuse of euthanasia under Nazism that shifted both the tone and the content of public discourse. Dowbiggin's clear, nuanced prose untangles the complicated interweaving of these arguments, and he is not afraid to fault the morally dubious arguments of some euthanasia partisans, who made little distinction between mercy killing and the harshest forms of eugenics. Most of Dowbiggin's arguments are illustrated through a history of the Euthanasia Society of America (founded in 1938) and chronicles its evolving positions and high profile cases such as the 1976 New Jersey Supreme Court decision to let Karen Ann Quinlin's parents remove her from a respirator. The final two chapters cover Kevorkian and AIDS-related issues, among other pivot points. Without shying away from making his own ethical judgments, Dowbiggin offers an intellectual and moral approach to a cultural flash point.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B007B8H5W0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Someone out on short term leave for bad behavior. I love this stuff. He's one of the new, and more than promising, writers making his mark, and a dark and wonderful mark it is.\"--Joe R. LansdaleQuestions for Michael BoatmanJeff VanderMeer for Amazon.com:First off, please describe where you are as you're answering these questions.Boatman:I'm sitting in my office, which is downstairs in the basement of my house. The windows in my office look out over my backyard and a thick patch of woods. It's 9:00 AM on a foggy December morning.Amazon.com:How long have you been writing?Boatman:I've been writing for about 13 years. I started after I injured my leg in a freakish household accident. I was unable to work for about 12 weeks. One day, Don Cheadle, who is a good friend, stopped by for a visit. He took one look at me, fat, bearded, and depressed, and encouraged me to explore writing, as I had always expressed an interest in creating a screenplay. The screenplay was terrible, but I loved the process and I've been writing ever since.Amazon.com:Where do writing and acting intersect creatively? How do they influence each other in your life?Boatman:Acting and writing both stem from the most primal form of entertainment, which is storytelling. I've come to believe that I actually became an actor as a kind of creative misfire. I was always a voracious reader. To this day, I'm unable to go anywhere without a book. However, writing was something I'd never considered. It seemed too mystical, something working-class kids from the inner city weren't supposed to do. I stumbled into acting in high school (of course to meet chicks), and I discovered that I enjoyed being a part of a creative endeavor. After more than 20 years as an actor, I've realized that, at least for me, the two art forms are linked. An actor communicates his part of the larger story in which he participates, but a writer creates the story. Now I find telling my own stories more compelling than communicating other authors' stories.Amazon.com:Writing is a solitary activity. Acting is, I assume, solitary in the preparation but very social in its application--and dependent to some degree on the imaginations of other people. How easy is to navigate between those two worlds?Boatman:I find it easy to navigate the two worlds because I've been an actor for so long that it's part of who I am; I know my way around Hollywood sets and the professional theater. Also, being a writer helps me understand another writer's intention for his characters in a way that I didn't when I was just acting. Recently, I was presented with the opportunity to rewrite huge chunks of a feature film in which I was acting. When I was younger I never would have had the courage to insinuate my ideas into someone else's screenplay. However, during production we encountered some serious script problems. The director took my suggestions and applied them to the script. Ultimately we wound up rewriting a lot of the film. Writing novels and short stories and screenplays on my own gave me the confidence to step in and effectively address the problems. It was great fun and a huge confidence booster.Amazon.com:What writers have most influenced you in your fiction?Boatman:Tolkien opened up the door to entirely new worlds for me.The Hobbitwas the first book that took me on a quest. I read it when I was nine years old and it changed my life. In a weird way, that book introduced me to literature in general and fantasy in particular. I read the entire Rings sequence  every few years and learn something new every time. Stephen R. Donaldson's Covenant books are a continuing source of profound enjoyment. On the darker frontier, David J. Schow and Joe R. Lansdale are my heroes. I said in another interview that since Dave Schow has become my friend I am even more in awe of his talents. I feel like Dorothy exposing the Great and Powerful Oz only to discover that the man behind the curtain really is a wizard. Stephen King is another writer who I believe to be, in a strange way, underrated. I thinkThe Standreally may be the great American novel. And the Dark Tower books are unlike anything I've ever experienced.Amazon.com:What projects do you have upcoming, both acting and writing?Boatman:My novel,The Revenant Road, will be published by The Drollerie Press in 2008. Of course I've got \"A Father's Work\" in Weird Tales coming soon, and stories in a couple of anthologies. Two screenplays I've written are being considered around Hollywood. On the acting front, I'm costarring in an independent film calledThe Killing of Wendy. It'll be in theaters next June. Also a film calledAmerican Summer, coming soon.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 24.0}

Soon, the gifted orator was delivering dozens of public lectures critiquing the progress of the Civil War and Lincoln's refusal to renounce slavery. Taken under the wing of leading abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison, Dickinson was both a celebrity and an oddity, with a lecture attended by Lincoln and Congress and a rash of newspaper coverage, including one story that dubbed her \"a Joan of Arc that God sent into the field\" to help a nation in crisis. After the war, the iconoclastic orator had a complicated relationship with the suffrage movement and with Susan B. Anthony, and added novelist, playwright and actress to her already bulging résumé. Middle age brought poverty, illness, alcoholism and a lawsuit against the Republican Party for withheld lecture fees. Her lowest point came in 1891 with a brief but humiliating commitment to an insane asylum by the sister Dickinson had supported financially for years. Illuminating the life and times of an extraordinary 19th-century woman, historian Gallman's (Mastering Wartime) well-researched volume will mainly interest scholars of American and women's history.

What would happen if they actually found DNA within the capsule and cross-matched it with tissue found on the Shroud of Turin? What if it matched?  This little flight of fantasy was the beginning of a journey that took me through dozens of false starts, years of writing and eventually through the never-ending editing process. The tale that emerged was as much a surprise to me as to anyone. It was very much like a story breaking free and escaping from my computer.

Only in the end to find where you are is exactly where you want to be. The hero and heroine in this book are two very strong characters. Jaelynn is a woman with strength, and the need to be loved by the right man. I like that fact that Jaelynn had her own bumps in the road. This made her more real to the reader. Logan is the male presence in this book. He will hold you captive with his good cowboy nature, and stir your body with his passion. I really liked the feel of Logan's character. His story comes through strong but not overwhelming. Logan's Lessons, book two in the Sunset Cowboy series, is a story filled with a lot of heart. Come read Logan and Jaelynn's story and see if Logan can lasso Jaelynn's heart. Or will Jaelynn show this cowboy he's not the only one who knows how to work a lasso?

His vessel,  the Persistence, is a 20' cold-molded plywood sailboat that he  hand-built 22 years before. Several days before departing there  was a break in the weather, and the 66-year-old sailor set forth  only to be caught in the \"Green Storm\" his first day out. Though  his boat was knocked onto its beam-ends, there was no damage,  and he continued his journey. In this engaging account, Bree  copiously describes the history of the area and devotes a whole  section to the voyageurs of New France, whose 40' birch bark  canoes once plied Lake Superior, but does not mention points of  sail or sail handling.

Dr. Elise Hanover is smart, cheeky and determined to protect humankind from the bloodthirsty werewolf population—even though she's a werewolf herself. Elise has concocted a serum to quell her blood lust, but she still turns furry when the moon is full, a fact that led her to walk away from a promising relationship years earlier. She gets a second chance, however, when her old beau, FBI agent Nic Franklin, arrives at the compound where she's been researching cures for werewolfism. In a breakneck sequence of events, the compound explodes; Elise and Nic flee to Fairhaven, Wis., where a handful of her co-workers are hunting werewolves; and they get caught up in solving the mystery of why so many people have gone missing in Fairhaven. In the process, Elise—Handeland's most appealing heroine yet—learns to embrace her inner canine. Though some of the plot twists will be old hat to those who have read the previous books, and Elise's co-workers have an annoying habit of wanting to shoot everyone (including Elise), this tense, banter-filled tale provides a few hours of solid entertainment.(July)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

English writes to the highest scholarly standards … Moreover, he writes with the common reader in mind: he has crafted a fine balance of detail and analysis and his prose is clear, fresh and jargon-free … sets a new standard for debate on republicanism’Peter Hart, Irish Times‘a work which eclipses all other studies of the IRA and must now be regarded as the single most important book on the topic … a penetrating and rewarding study’Keith Jeffery, Times Literary Supplement‘excellent book’ Patrick Bishop, Daily Telegraph‘the best analytical history of the IRA yet written. Even those who grew up with the Troubles will find it a provocative and freshly compelling work. More importantly, perhaps, fifty years from now it will still be required reading – generations who look back and wonder what the Northern conflict was all about will find many of their answers here. Superb … the rigour and depth of English’s analysis is exceptional’Niall Strange, Sunday Business Post‘fluent, fascinating account of the origins, actions and ideologies of that caucus of shadows, the Provisional IRA … an enormous challenge of narrative, historical research and tact. In all these regards, English succeeds … his description of what he refers to as the “personal” consequences of republican violence is ultimately as heartbreaking as it is dispassionate’Joseph O’Neill, Guardian‘a great book. What impressed me most was the way Richard English managed to present such an historical and contradictory mess with such clarity and fairness. The book grabbed and held me like a very good novel’Roddy Doyle, author of A Star Called Henry‘This is a book whose time has come. At a historic moment when Irish republicanism is in the process of redefining itself, a highly-talented historian gives a compelling analysis of its past. The book’s genius lies in its non-judgemental approach, an approach which has induced many leading republicans to speak more frankly to Richard English than they have done to any previous historian. This mixture of skilful historical research and totally new personal statements from key republicans makes this a captivating, authoritative and highly readable book. It is masterly and hard-hitting and is likely to become something of a modern classic.’Marianne Elliott, author of The Catholics of Ulster‘an impressive achievement … Richard English’s study is the most probing and thorough analysis of the “Provies” ever. He ranges wider and uses a broader variety of sources than any previous writer. He seems to have read almost everything relevant, and has interviewed many key participants’Stephen Howe, Independent‘a marvellous piece of work: insightful, seriously academic and articulate, both in terms of its language and the maturity of its emotional content … Here is an author fully in command of his data sources and arguments. His book is immensely readable, coherent, systematic and thoughtful … an important book’Mike Ritchie, Ireland on Sunday‘page after page of cool, clear insights are the book’s motif … What sets Armed Struggle apart, though, is the strength of the pre-Provo years and the remarkable range of sources, both primary and secondary, to which English – a Belfast-born Protestant – has been given access’Steven King, Irish Independent‘This vivid, reflective work will likely become the standard introduction to the subject. It also serves as a valuable corrective for anyone who thinks that the difficulties in Northern Ireland are amenable to quick-fix solutions’Ian McBride, Financial Times‘a fine and illuminating work’Literary Review‘the best study of the Provisional IRA to have appeared so far … Professor English’s important book should be read and thought over by all those who are committed to the cause of democracy in Ireland and Britain, and to establishing permanent good political relations between the peoples of our two islands’Anthony Coughlan, Irish Democrat‘from the stream of recent publications chronicling the IRA campaign … Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA by Queen’s academic Richard English is almost certainly the best, benefiting from a cool, dispassionate approach’Belfast Telegraph‘About Richard English’s Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA there is a kind of passionate objectivity, you’ll rarely find on this subject. The author works mightily to present two sides of a story that keeps shifting. You might read the book wondering, perhaps, where his sympathies lie, but even if you sneak a look at the last chapter, where he lays out his credentials, you’ll come away impressed with his balance and fairness... this is the one book I recommend for anyone trying to understand the craziness and complexity of the Northern Ireland tragedy.’Frank McCourt, author of Angela’s Ashes‘With fine detail and a flair for narrative, Richard English chronicles the rise of the IRA from the ashes of the Easter Rising to the promise of peace today. Balanced and thoughtful, Armed Struggle offers new insight into Ireland’s republican movement. And it reminds us, in the author’s words, that “the voices of the victims still deafen”’Terry Golway, author of The Irish in America‘Richard English has now completed his extensive research into the IRA, work distinguished not only by his mastery of the sources, but by a deep understanding of the mentalities that drive republican violence, as well as a sensitivity to its cost’George Boyce, author of Nationalism in Ireland‘The detailed research in this even-handed book makes it of great interest and value. It is filled with well-referenced detail on the recent decades and astute judgements of men and events’The Irish Catholic‘an elegant, erudite and accessible piece of scholarship. It draws on a phenomenal range of oral, literary and historical sources … a significant contribution to the literature that will be the standard reading for the foreseeable future’Paul Arthur, author of Special Relationships: Britain, Ireland and theNorthern Ireland Problem‘casts valuable new light on the development of republican thinking and strategy’Liam Clarke, Sunday Times‘This impressively intense account of the IRA since its birth nearly a century ago is timely … The exhaustive research informing Richard English’s work is obvious. But what gives the book substance is the detachment with which the facts are delivered … a considerable, and unquestionably valuable, achievement’Robert Kee, BBC History Magazine‘the best overview of the IRA campaign that there is … a description of an ultimately futile campaign by the IRA, assessed and interpreted by one of the finest intellects in the country’Malachi O’Doherty, Fortnight Magazine", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When someone bashes in the head of retired NYPD police officer Augie Donatelli, whom Des thinks is the flasher, Des finds herself a suspect because she had a public fight with the victim shortly before the murder.

Once again, Mitch steps in to lend Des a helping hand. Series fans will have fun catching up with the latest twists in the always interesting relationship of this interracial couple. (Oct.)

John Weiss, a continent-hopping investigator for an insurance company, tracks the forger to Montreal in the dead of winter, only to find that he has been stabbed to death. With his genuine appreciation of the paintings, this case is more than just another job to John. His other motives include one-upping an associate and the presence in Montreal of his fiancee, Cassie Newman. Cassie herself shows a natural aptitude for sleuthing, while also indulging her taste for fine food and other luxuries on John's expense account. But who is the ruthless and clever killer? Early evidence points to assistant curator Jan Bergma, who has movie star looks and a questionable connection to the oil-rich Sheikh Rashid. John needs all his wits plus the help of Gino, a crude, sharp Canadian Mountie, who would be a scene-stealer if not kept in check by the author. Smith ( Capriccio ) skillfully intertwines suspense and humor, and the bantering John and Cassie are an engaging pair.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00K0XZX8G"], "rank": 1201831, "title": "A Brush with Death", "author": "Joan Smith", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the meantime, she has been hiding her looks and her thoughts from him to dissuade him from marrying her off to one of his cronies. Before her mother dies, she divulges a secret that strengthens Serena's determination to leave. She is accosted in the street soon after but is rescued by Marcus Graye, newly returned from the war. Marcus involves himself in Serena's plight. He suggests they marry so that her father has no hold over her, but Serena is still not safe. As she and Marcus find themselves in danger, they begin to truly fall in love. But they have no future, unless Serena's father can be stopped. With great attention to period detail as well as psychological suspense, Jacobs' dramatic tale works on many levels.Maria HattonCopyright © American Library Association.

Now a practicing surgeon for over 30 years living in West Texas, science has changed so much of what we know and what we believe.  Drugs are being discovered from natural sources harvested in every corner of the planet.  Genetics have identified the basic biochemical causes of many afflictions and the cure for them is nearly at hand.  Archeology has raised more questions than answers including just when did homo sapiens develop and how did they dominate so quickly.  The Maya themselves were the most accomplished astronomers in the world using no technology.  How and why would they create long periods with absolutely accurate observations that abruptly end on 12/21/2012?  The author is a fan of alternative hypotheses and his work, \"Fifth Age of the Maya\" is just that.  Could the end times spoken of in the Bible be connected with the end of the Mayan fifth age?  Are there forces behind human development that simply can't be explained by science so that even the most intellectual give intelligent design a nod?  The author believes there are other forces and that we cannot be the only intelligent life in the universe.  This book was begun almost 15 years ago but science and technology kept raising new questions as well as new explanations.  Dr. Pelfrey was impacted by Ben Stein's movie, \"Expelled\" which raised many of these same questions.  He hopes his book will cause others to question conventional dogma as Mr. Stein's movie did.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ben-Gurion's centrality has made him a lighting-rod for the celebration and criticism of the Zionist experience.  In a unique and extraordinarily productive approach, Aronson plumbs the relationship between Ben-Gurion's pragmatic political leadership and his deep and sometimes eccentric intellectual commitments. In leading us through a reconsideration of major issues and events that engaged Ben-Gurion and shaped Israeli history and its polity, Aronson puts forth an illuminating and brilliant portrait that challenges the recent litany of attacks that have become standard fare in the strident negativism of Israel. This rehabilitation of Ben-Gurion is thereby a sophisticated and compelling refutation of Israel's detractors.\"-Ilan Troen, Brandeis University\"A compelling tour de force, Aronson's thought-provoking reassessment of Israel's founding father David Ben Gurion is a huge contribution to a needed reconsideration of Ben Gurion's statesmanlike role in Israeli and Jewish history. While \"the old man\" is pilloried in recent post-Zionist scholarship as a Jewish tyrant and ruthless politico, his actions interpreted as the seed of many contemporary Israeli evils - the lack of a written American-type constitution, the extraordinary place of the ultra-Orthodox in Israeli society, the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict - Aronson offers a more persuasive and better informed view. He places Ben Gurion's pragmatic left-Zionist leadership in the larger historical contexts of the crisis of modern Jewish society, the 'trap' of global politics culminating in the Nazi Holocaust, and the critical post-war juncture during which statehood was achieved and built despite multiple challenges.\"-Kenneth Waltzer, Michigan State University\"We have here a thoughtful and detailed analysis of the origins, development, and application in practice of the concepts that guided a key figure in the creation and history of Israel. On the basis of vast archival research, command of the literature, and personal interviews and experiences, Aronson brings the towering figure of Ben-Gurion to life as a statesman of ideas in a challenging world.\"-Gerhard L.

His other books, I Think I’m Having One of Those Decades (2006), I May Be Big But I Didn’t Cause That Solar Eclipse (2007) and Holly Jolly Frivolity (2009) also received critical acclaim. His latest book, Crossbow, is a darkly comedic mystery, and his first foray into full-length fiction. From 1994 to 2007 readers in both Canada and the United States enjoyed his weekly syndicated humor column, Gordon Kirkland At Large. He has been a frequent guest on radio and television talk shows in both countries. In 2007, BookExpo-America cited him as one of the seven notable book industry “characters.” One of his syndicated columns was incorporated into the collection of the Harry Chapin Archives in New York.  He has garnered a very large and loyal fan base in the United States and Canada, as well as elsewhere around the world. In addition he has worked with and enjoys a strong mutual respect and friendship with other authors including Ridley Pearson, Dave Barry, Lynn Johnston, Garrison Keillor, Jeffery Deaver, and many more. Gordon Kirkland has been a workshop leader and keynote speaker at dozens of writer’s conferences, festivals, and university programs over the past ten years. This includes three sessions of the University of Dayton’s Erma Bombeck Writer’s Workshop, six years on the faculty of the Southern California Writer’s Conference, as well as many more. He has lectured at Simon Fraser University (Vancouver, BC), Ball State University (Muncie, Indiana), The University of Georgia (Athens, GA), and Florida First Coast Community College (Jacksonville, FL.) In 2009, Kirkland was one of the stars of The 3-Day Novel, a television series on Canada’s BookTelevision, in which 12 Canadian writers were locked in a large bookstore with the task of writing a full novel in just 72 hours. It was carried out under the watchful eye of television cameras, store customers, and with numerous interruptions aimed at breaking the writers’ trains of thought.

Something was going to happen, he could feel it, but it would be another sleepless night before he’d learn the cause. His chosen retirement was bothersome, despite the fact that he now had the time to focus his attention to his beautiful model companion, Sena. He had to get back to work.His bad news came from his best friend, Thomas James, or TJ as he called him. His daughter Jacki had been arrested for murder.  Winston rushed to her rescue, learning that she’d been drugged and had no clue about what had happened. It was enough evidence to insure her release, but ‘Detective Winston Simon,’ wasn’t done with this case. His daughter had told him of the club she’d recently joined. The ELM, short for Earth Liberation Movement, had held responsibility for a lot of misconduct in the past. His interest in this case would prove to be more trouble than he expected.‘Lethal Knowledge’ is a fast paced, well plotted crime story that will keep the readers interest. This is normally not my favorite genre, but I enjoyed this read a lot. It would make a great addition to any crime-lovers library.*****Reviewer: GhostWriterGenre: Action/Adventure", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His daughter is kidnapped; his personal fortune is sequestered; even though it is clear he is being used by his anonymous persecutor, he has no choice but to follow up what leads there are. The trail leads him from one exotic planet to another, through desperate scrapes, devious conspiring, an entrancing weave of heroic action and high-concept satire; in fact, so faithfully is the spirit and texture of Vance-s space operas maintained, it-s tempting to view The Faces of Immortality as a sixth Demon Princes novel - Yet Coles has original cards to play as well- Many ideas and in Faces directly recall elements from the Demon Princes - Coles builds on such Vancean riffs, elaborating twists and parodic delicacies of his own. The rival civilizations on the planet Lore, clashing in artificial wars, are wittily set forth. Some of the Lore set-pieces are extremely funny; the bizarre alien ecology on Chanticleer is ingeniously worked out and the lost world of Lokmar, with its tragic political schism and dark legacy, has considerable grandeur of the kind Vance achieved in his early works especially. It-s pleasing to see Vance-s robust-baroque prose style captured so reliably in Faces, the addictive diction basic to his fame repeated but also modified, amplified or restrained by Coles as appropriate: there-s plenty of erudite wordplay and sensuous description in Faces, my favourite passage being the encounter between Meredon and a pair of farmers arguing over crop damage inflicted by goats- It-s very comforting to think that new authors are so well equipped to carry on his brand of picaresque entertainment, and even enrich the formula", "related": [], "rank": 2442806, "title": "The Faces of Immortality eBook", "author": "Everett Coles", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A capital ship, its nuclear weapons and thousands of hostages will be the prizes of victory. But some of the Truman 's engineers remain on their feet, and some of its planes are still aloft. Lieutenant Paul Simmons and commander Rex Hastings lead the battle to save their ship. Though its premise is interesting, this contemporary techno-thriller, a first novel, is handicapped by an unlikely love triangle involving Simmons, Hastings and Hastings's wife, and by a North Korean plan of attack altogether too dependent on luck. Campbell, a former Navy engineer, balances these shortcomings with an exciting account of the below-decks fight for control of the Truman and with several well-executed scenes of aerial combat.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 13, "rating_average": 3.9231, "rating_total": 51.0}

As Karen grows to love the ranch and the ranch manager, Dusty Stoddard, she delves into a past at odds with what she was raised to believe.

She often feels as if she has lived several lives! She has three children, two of whom are grown. Her kids are her life. She is an author of several books, short stories, essays and about 100 poems. She owns more books than she could ever read, but she keeps collecting them. She lived in Upstate New York for 10 years, and during that time she went back to school and earned her Bachelor's degree in English, as well as a Master's degree in Higher Education Administration. During that time, she wrote prolifically and has just now begun to edit and publish a lot of it. While in New York, she worked at MetLife as an accounting representative, was an assistant manager at a Domino's pizza and she freelanced for a bi-monthly newspaper (in addition to being their circulation clerk). She has wanted to be a published author since she was eight years old, when she wrote and colored a story and sent it in as a submission to Highlights Magazine for Children. This was her first rejection letter, the first of many. Her first real novel, Beginnings, was really rough and contrived, and it did not get published, although she still has every single rejection letter. Following this total rejection, she put herself back into college, determined to become a stellar writer. After her separation from her husband, she stopped writing much of anything for years and drowned her sorrows in alcohol. In 2008, while living in the Berkshires of Massachusetts, she got into recovery. The last two years have been a journey of self-discovery, which she hopes will shine through in Lost & Found, her book of poetry. She gives all the glory to Jesus Christ, her Lord and Savior. While the struggle was indeed awful, she learned so much from those years and wouldn't go back and change a thing.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Given this it his easy to see how Bob was influenced in his formative years. When Bob was 5 years old the family moved to Wilkinsburg near Pittsburgh where his athletic career started from a very young age. He was an exceptional athlete especially in aquatic sports - his favorite being canoeing. The First World War saw Bob as a hero. He gained 3 Croix de Guerres with two palms and a Silver Star from France. From Belgium he was awarded The Belgian Order of Leopold and from Italy the Italian War Cross and the Purple Heart. His business started in the 1920s, at first selling oil burners, before developing into the massive York Barbell Company. Bob Hoffman, never a great coach or great weightlifter, was a man who influenced and guided weightlifting and bodybuilding for half a century.", "related": [], "rank": 1495184, "title": "Simplified System of Dumbbell Training", "author": "Bob Hoffman", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This isn't to say that prior fans won't find it immensely satisfying to 'go back in time': just that newcomers to the series will find GULAG MOON neatly sets the place and tone for the following sagas. GULAG MOON introduces the character of Zach Murphy, the main protagonist , at a stage of his life when his military training is just beginning. It's told from the viewpoint of  freedom fighter Zep Hedgewick Zep's meeting with Zach Murphy will change his life, transforming him from an ineffective part-time black marketer to a worthy opponent of the Syndicate.  The military encounters and descriptions of high-tech battles are vivid and changing, reinforcing Zach's coming of age and also offering a satisfying contrast between Zep's abilities and Zach's growing leadership skills.  GULAG MOON is a cat-and-mouse game well played: jungle advancements and retreats, check and checkmate battles, and military strategy played out well by both sides all keep the action fast-paced and the main protagonists edgy and well-developed. Zach learns to deftly field technologically advanced weaponry despite some disasters, and grows stronger with each encounter. By novel's end Zep has been transformed from a bumbling sidekick to a military man with his own powers and passions - and Zach has moved from a soldier to a leader. The friendship that originally bound the two men deepens throughout conflicts and results in a rich connection by the conclusion of GULAG MOON, which promises further satisfying adventures in the Chronos series.", "related": ["B00LDCER4E"], "rank": 1061083, "title": "Gulag Moon - Book one of the Chronos Military Science Fiction series eBook", "author": "Tom Ciolli", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cody purposely tipped over his water bowl. The child appeared amazed when Ms. King corrected Cody appropriately. Cody would display acts of good hygiene, and the child would observe him. Cody also served as a positive reward system when the child had appropriate behavior. Ms. King was able to correlate Cody's behavior with the children's behavior and incorporate animal-assisted therapy into their treatment goals. In 2006, Ms. King and Cody obtained certification through the Animals Benefit Club of Arizona/Pet Partners Delta Society and are now a registered pet partner's team.

She's attracted to him, but her Aunt warns her that loggers just love\n'em and then leave 'em... Ms. Curry\ndoes a very nice job of describing logging life back in 1886 on the St. Croix\nRiver. I grew up in the state of Washington and visited a lot of logging camps\nand exhibits. It made it easy for me to visualize the saws they used and the pikes\nfor moving the logs. My father-in-law still had his spiked boots. Life was\ndifferent then. Everything was done by manpower or with horses. The author's\ndescription of the life and times of the loggers and how they impacted towns is\nvery accurate and authentic....The author\ntakes two wounded beings and starts their relationship with a near collision\noutside the tavern. Will gets knocked out of the tavern and almost falls on\nCarrie. From there, Ms. Curry takes them on the slow dance of courtship. It's\nfraught with potholes. They are both working and haven't much time together.\nOther people are vying for their attention. Then there is Carrie's Aunt's\nwarning ringing in her head. And he will go home and will only return for the\nfall logging again. What hope is there? This\nauthor entertains you with a good solid story that keeps you reading as you\nwait to see what happens next in the fragile relationship between the two main\ncharacters. It's a very good historical romance that I enjoyed reading. Why not\nget a copy and see what you think?", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fed up, the Queen fusses at him: \"Dents are all you seem to gather!\" One day, the Queen announces the discovery of a brand-new clover patch, dripping with golden pollen dust. She sends her minions on their way, but Mr. Bumble, as usual, lags behind. What if someone mean lives there, he wonders nervously. And someone does live in the new clover patch, but not anyone Mr. Bumble could have imagined. Charming Mr. Bumble, though different from his peers, shows that even those who have a little more difficulty in life can overcome obstacles (especially if there's a fairy or two on hand) and \"learn to fly.\" The Kennedy siblings, unlike their winged creation, never bumble. Doug Kennedy's pictures of Her Majesty's hive and lush flower-jungles glow with a golden light. The duo's lesson is clear: work hard and be patient; victory will be sweet as honey.

Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in 1804 in the city of Salem, Massachusetts to Nathaniel Hathorne and the former Elizabeth Clarke Manning. His ancestors include John Hathorne, the only judge involved in the Salem witch trials who never repented of his actions. Nathaniel later added a \"w\" to make his name \"Hawthorne\" in order to hide this relation. He entered Bowdoin College in 1821, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1824, and graduated in 1825. Hawthorne anonymously published his first work, a novel titled Fanshawe, in 1828. He published several short stories in various periodicals which he collected in 1837 as Twice-Told Tales. The next year, he became engaged to Sophia Peabody. He worked at a Custom Houseand joined Brook Farm, a transcendentalist community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem, the Berkshires, then to The Wayside in Concord. The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to The Wayside in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, and was survived by his wife and their three children. -wikipedia", "related": [], "rank": 4633851, "title": "Earth's Holocaust (From \"Mosses from an Old Manse\") eBook", "author": "Nathaniel Hawthorne", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Not science fantasy or horror, although I did develop a taste for good horror stories separately, but just good old-fashioned hard science fiction.  Sadly, it had begun to disappear over the past few decades and was getting harder and harder to find.  A friend and I were talking about this on his deck one summer day and his remark was “Well, do something about it.  Write !!”  And I did, and have been ever since.

On horseback, with the warmth of the sun on my face, I crossed the bridge over my moat. With a gentle tug on the rein, we made our way up the hill, my castle slowly disappearing in my wake...Wait, wait! That's not what happened; here's what really happened:Early one morning, as I made my way to my laundry room, there in the corner stood my big white dryer. As I filled the basket, I set aside the clothes to iron for that day. (Most of my story ideas come to me when ironing.)In a big bear hug, I grabbed up the laundry and felt the warmth of the clothes on my face as I carried them upstairs to fold and put away. Unexpectedly, I had a vision so strong it forced me to sit on the stairs.It was late night. I lay asleep in my bed, dreaming, my wife nestled at my side.Suddenly, I woke from the dream and next to me sat a man in an old brown chair, his right leg crossed over the other. His entire body was cloaked in a golden glow. He looked so peaceful; he moved not a muscle. Neither did I.He didn't speak, and yet, I knew not to be afraid. On the contrary, I never felt so at peace.In a snap, the vision ended and I sat, stunned. A few minutes later I went to put away the laundry.That night I had a dream of the exact vision I had encountered that morning, only it didn't seem like a dream. Troubled, but not frightened, I woke my wife and told her everything. Immediately we asked God what was the meaning of both the vision and the dream.He answered our prayers right away.A few days later we were donating our old and enormous television to Goodwill. The television had sat for years in a media cabinet in our bedroom. Very heavy and almost impossible to pick up, there was only an inch or so clearance between the bottom of the TV and the shelf. After we wrestled the TV out into the hall, my wife went to dust the cabinet.\"Paul, come see this!\"I rushed to see and was floored when I saw what was etched in the dust. Where the TV once sat, is the image you now see on the cover. The man in the lower right center of the picture is the man I saw in the vision and dream.For weeks we prayed and looked for an interesting picture for this book's cover. We concluded that the vision and dream was by divine intervention and the picture could only have been sketched by the hand of God. We agreed that the image should not and it hasn't been altered.Can you see the five faces etched in the dust image?", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He held Kenneth's body close to his as he attacked Kenneth's neck and collar bone with kisses and gentle bites. Chills shot up Kenneth's body. He closed his eyes and enjoyed the pleasure coming from Micah's lips and teeth.Soft moans left Kenneth's lips as Micah traveled down his body. Micah sucked at Kenneth's nipples and dragged his wet hot tongue from Kenneth's chest, down his abs down to his belly button.Kenneth took in a deep breath as he felt Micah wrap his fingers around his already straining manhood. And just that quick, Kenneth felt his dick enveloped in a wet warmth. He thrust his head back as the stimulation of Micah sucking his dick reverberated through his body. Kenneth's toes curled and he clinched at the wall behind him. Micah's oral skills were nothing to play with.His orgasm was growing. Kenneth could feel the tension in his balls spread through his groin. But he wasn't ready. An overwhelming urge to please Micah overcame Kenneth. He was ready to do anything to satisfy Micah. He reached down and stopped Micah from bopping up and down.\"Wait. Not yet.\" The words struggled to come out. \"I want to please you. I want to make you feel good.\"\"You sure you ready for all that?\" Micah asked, his eyes looking down at his swollen meat. Kenneth nodded apprehensively. His body ached for Micah. He just hoped he wasn't biting off more than he could chew. Micah took hold of Kenneth by the waist and forced him to turn around. Kenneth felt Micah's heavy hand press down on the middle of his back, urging him to bend over. He complied without protest.Micah brought his hand down on Kenneth's ass cheek, sending waves of pain and pleasure through Kenneth's body. Micah gripped each cheek with his large hands and parted them. Kenneth shivered as he felt Micah's hot, wet breath on his wanting hole.\"When I make this ass mine aint no turning back. You feel me?\"Kenneth could only moan his understanding and agreement as anticipation of the lustful pleasure coming ahead rendered him incapable of giving any other type of response. He was in the troughs of sinful rapture and his only recourse was total subjugation.Micah pressed his tongue hungrily against Kenneth's hole. He darted in and out until he broke through the tightness of Kenneth's sphincter. Kenneth yelped as Micah began his oral onslaught inside of Kenneth.Kenneth reached down and gripped his pre-cum dripping dick and began to stroke as his tongue filled ass sent undulated wave upon wave of pleasure through every sensitive and receptive nerve ending in his ass.Micah backed off with a loud audible kiss on Kenneth's ass. Kenneth took a deep breath, preparing for what was coming. He knew Micah wasn't done. The show had just begun.The heaviness of Micah's swollen prick smacking against Kenneth's now wet and open hole was mind numbing. Micah rubbed the length of his dick up and down the crack of Kenneth's ass.

I set them aside and never looked at them again. Then I grew up and had some adventures and became disillusioned about most everything except my dream of being a novelist. In 1997 at the age of 25 I started writing again. Now it’s 2011 and I am working on my eighth novel. No publisher was ever interested in me. I stopped beating my head on that door in 2004. But rejection from people who could never care about my dream only emboldened me. I began self publishing my fantasy fiction in 2005. That was before being an indie author was cool. Despite relentless obscurity and general disrespect, I was always encouraged by a steady trickle of sales and the occasional kind comment from a reader.  To be honest, being a novelist is always a struggle. I get criticized in public and don’t get called by any movie producers, but also every day someone somewhere buys my novels and that amazes me. I’m humbled by my readers. I will always do my best to craft stories worthy of them. I love the stories I write, and sometimes other people like them too. I’m having a good dream.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

New England boiled dinner, Boston baked beans and brown bread, apple pie, Irish stew (which falls here under Midwestern, not New England cuisine), cole slaw, chili con carne and peach cobbler all receive the usual treatment. To the editor's credit, the old chestnuts are prepared with real ingredients, nothing condensed or pre-packaged, and what the recipes lack in imagination is made up for in practicality. Necessary ingredients are readily available at the neighborhood grocery store, and methods and techniques are facile and straightforward. Pigs' feet stew with dumplings, avocado curry soup, fried abalone, pork with cellophane noodles will seem tame to sophisticated palates but may shake up average taste buds.

MD, PhD. My doctoral thesis was my first literary experience of note. I spent most of my married and professional years on the east coast in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Delaware. As a baby boomer and retired physician I’m devoting my time to writing medical thrillers. My life as an author of fiction began in 2003 after several individuals consistently commented that my speeches delivered at Toastmasters International always captured the audience because they were presented as captivating stories regardless of the topic. “I should write a book” they all said. My wife encouraged me because she was sick of listening to me rehearsing my speeches.  “What should I write about?” I asked of my supportive spouse.  “Write about your patient from the Navy who brought back a bottle full of human eyes from Vietnam.”  Thus began my medical thrillers starting with THE EYEMAN. The sequel, THE DUTY CREW, chronicles the last Christmas Day of the Vietnam War in a Northeast Naval hospital. Like all my novels true lifetime situations are interwoven with suspenseful and intriguing storylines. My other thrillers also have medical facts as a backdrop to the story line – THE HELIOS RAIN, THE MYOSIN FACTOR and THE ADJUSTMENT CLINIC. I live with my wife in San Antonio near my daughter and her family with four of my grandchildren. My first editor in 2003 told me to keep writing even if I’m not yet published. I devote 5-hours-a-day to my new books and promoting my completed ones. The rest of my retirement day is a balance of family, friends and spirituality", "related": ["B00C8W23P8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 27.0}

Every day felt like a waste and I could literally feel my\ntime slipping away.It hasn't been an easy road. I have read more\n books, listened to more audio books and experimented with more\ntechniques then the law should allow. But eventually, things started\nmaking more sense.Every day the world became a little clearer\nand I slowly felt that potential rising to the surface. Inch by inch, my\n life had more meaning.Over recent years I have\nlearned some amazing things that can be duplicated by anyone who is\nlooking to make a real change in their life. Everything that I have\nlearned has come from either very successful friends, world renown\nleaders or really good books.But why should you believe me?There are a lot of people running around trying to convince you that they have all the answers.Well, unfortunately for you, I don't have ALL the answers.But I do believe that I have SOME of the answers (and I think the answers I have are pretty important).Honestly, you SHOULDN'T just blindly believe me. In fact, I\nwould recommend that you approach my materials with a healthy skepticism\n and a \"scientific\" perspective.I want you to TRY what you learn\n from me. I think you will find that I am not interested in things that\ndon't work. I like stuff that gets results and makes a meaningful impact\n on your life.Only after you see that what I present is REAL...do I want you to \"believe\" me.I'm\n a person, and as a person I have my flaws.

Next, The Hybrid Series: Split Decision, Critical Moments, Devil's Dyke and Wet Daddy. Medium Rare has just been released. Although each book has a unique crime and can be read as stand-alone, the back-story in the series rolls from one book to the other where you'll see how the outrageous family of hybrids grows. Harding is also writing a spin-off hybrid thriller, online, at ahardingbooks.co.uk HWSNBN (He Who Shall Not Be Named) Ch1-17 posted and over 30K chapters read monthly. The characters in this book meet with those in Book 5, Medium Rare and in Book 6, Didymus (writing now) as they need help with their first horrendous case. Both books and HWSNBN are interlaced in places, although written from two different perspectives and a writers dream job.

I really appreciate you stopping by and taking a look. I guess in some ways I am an alternative medicine renegade. I talk about topics that, in my opinion, are critical for human health (mental, physical and spiritual). However, many people don't want to hear it because it places the responsibility for their weight and health squarely on their shoulders. I believe there is a health crisis in our country. We've all heard of the obesity epidemic and how children of grade-school age are being diagnosed with adult diseases as hypertension and Type II Diabetes. And, if the children are ill and overweight, then that means the parents are probably just as bad or worse. Indeed, there is a health crisis. But more than that, there is a crisis of personal responsibility. Giving in and 'going with the flow' is easy, at least for now. But sooner or later the piper comes around to collect with some sort of sickness, an unexpected condition that suddenly sobers the mood. And the truth can no longer be denied or escaped. That is why I have written this series of books. I want to use them to carry the message that EVERY weight loss goal CAN be reached with the proper mental artillery and physical preparation. I know what it's like to suffer with obesity and an eating disorder. Food addiction took more than 20 years of my life, and I want to prevent that from happening to anyone else. So here I am for all who care to listen. Best Regards, Rob", "related": [], "rank": 1500033, "title": "Bug Off!

I wouldn't say it's a light read, far from it, it deals with real life issues and shows that all our decisions and actions come with consequences some harder to bare than others and I believe that Ms. Ann did a beyond amazing job showing that through Trista's character.

A story of money,\ngreed, scams, revenge and love!  The book starts aboard a 300 million\nEuro superyacht with\nstate of the art equipment owned by a reclusive Venezuelan billionaire,\nRicardo Mayo. It starts with him committing a $353 million scam. A 24\nyear old PR assistant, Heather Bancroft, is one of the people caught\n up in an elaborate scam. She starts to receive strange emails\npredicting the outcomes of things she can bet on, and once these\npredictions come true she starts to bet even more money so she can save\nher mother's house from foreclosure. These bets take her around the\nworld to Japan and dealing with the Yakuza, Kyrgyztan for a sports\nevents (where she meets the love of her life Gareth, but she is already\nengaged to David) and then onto Istanbul to invest in stocks. She gets\ngreedy and loses it all and ends up in debt owing money to dangerous\nloan sharks. She has quit her job in spectacular fashion, dumped her\nboyfriend and lost her mother and has nothing let, she now wants\nrevenge! She sets out to try and find out who is responsible for the con\n which\ntakes her to Spain, Germany and France until she finds her man. With a\nnew name, new passport and new look she now has to embark on a dangerous\n plan to get back her money. A very well-written series of\nbooks where the pace does not let up from Book 1 to the final pages of\nbook 5. Filled with twists and turns that grab your attention and keep\nyou reading. The storyline is very absorbing with suspense and thrills\nand keeps you on the edge on your seat wanting more.

Several times the funding seemed to be nearly in his grasp, only to see it disappear each time into the Indie Film Makers' Twilight Zone. While the Village Sleeps is a novelized version of one of those screenplays. Jonathan believes it works very well as a novel and hopes that you will agree.

I would always be looking to learn about different animals, bugs, birds and everything else around me. The  fascination about the world (and beyond) that I enjoyed as a youth has not left me, even after many decades of learning and growing.I enjoy many varied activities in life. To me, it is hard to beat a great tent camping getaway complete with fishing and exploring the woods. I also like participating in sports such as mountain biking, football, volleyball and many others.Space - Outer Space. I just love it. I can't get enough of the vastness of the heavens that God created. I've enjoyed astronomy since around the 8th grade or so. I have a website dedicated to it at star-gazer.info. This website is also the home for myStarGazer series of books.Besides astronomy I also enjoy mathematics, chemistry, computer science and American History.So why did I start to write books and apps? The answer is children. They are our future and I believe that they need to be loved, cared for, taught and encouraged by everyone. I have tutored and mentored many young people for many years one-on-one. Now I want to reach out to a larger group of kids. With the technology we have today, we can reach kids in new and exciting ways. From interactive e-books that not only teach but also humor to smart apps that teach and encourage kids to succeed.If you are looking for some material to help your child please send me a message and let me know. I'll do my best to create something for you.I wish you and your children all the best,~G.O.", "related": ["B00BLDILKG"], "rank": 2296831, "title": "Baby Animals Fart Too!

On reflection, that is an important, but limited, perspective on me.

Sometimes that is achieved by negotiating. Sometimes it is achieved by litigating. I particularly work in the areas of insolvency, tax litigation and commercial litigation. The Writer I currently have one published e-book called \"Look Before you Leap - A Guide for Aspiring Lawyers\" in which I try to give students and recent graduates a real world look at some of the ins and outs of legal practice. There is a second book on its way which will be a more in depth look at the tools that people need to succeed as young professionals In addition to the books, however, I am committed to producing useful articles for distribution to newer professionals worldwide in an effort to help them understand some of the mental and practical challenges within their careers. Hopefully my articles (both on my blog - www.tipsforlawyers.com and elsewhere) will assist or encourage people to get the personal and professional skills necessary to succeed in their lives. The Rest Investing in the \"next generation\" of professionals is a big part of my life. Giving my time and energy to those who are going to come after me provides a fulfilling outlet for my experiences so far. I like to think that I'm old enough to offer a bit of wisdom, but young enough to remember the perspective I had as a young lawyer, and to use that combination to help out as best I can. Lots more I could say about me (husband, father, gardener, woodworker) - but I think that should do it for now!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Later she was transferred to a second orphanage in Preston in England, which was less harsh, and where, due to one special nun, she became acquainted with the magic of storytelling.  In her teenage years she moved to London to study Drama, working as a telephonist at night to pay her rent and attending Drama school in the day: after which she spent some years working full time in theatre and occasionally in television.  Her first attempts at professional writing began after her two children were born, and she became a full-time mother, writing at night when the world and her children were asleep. She began with two short stories, both of which won prizes. She then began her first novel, Tread Softly On My Dreams, based on the true story of the young Irish hero, Robert Emmet. Published by Headline and critically acclaimed by the Press, Tread Softly On My Dreams was acquired by the University of Notre Dame in the US, and The Princess Grace Irish Library in the Palace of Monaco. This was followed by her second Irish novel, Fire On The Hill and later followed by her first contemporary novel, Ghosts In Sunlight. Gretta’s writing career was interrupted in full flow when her son broke his back in an accident and needed her care for some years. Now fully recovered, her son is a successful young actor and Gretta has returned to her passion for writing. She is now an internationally published author with three of her books being published in all countries in Scandinavia, as well as Germany, Portugal, Holland and Japan. Gretta is married to a lawyer and lives in London.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I wanted my second book to be set somewhere further a field and it wasn't long before I settled on writing a piece of historical Irish fiction. I spent a significant amount of time in Ireland as a child and have many Irish relatives, which gave me something to build upon. This book covers two eras of 20th century Irish history. The first half is set in 1930 and the second half is set three decades later on in 1963, which coincides with the American president John F Kennedy's Irish tour. In both parts of the book the relationship between America and Ireland is explored. In the first half we see how the characters yearn to travel to America, the land of opportunity and in the second it comes to them in the form of President Kennedy. I wanted to explore the Irish response to Kennedy and how he represented hope and possibility to them as much as he did to many Americans. Kennedy's arrival in Ireland drives the plot of the second half, leading to Fionn's journey across the Irish countryside following Kennedy and the adventure that follows.", "related": [], "rank": 1917207, "title": "President Fionn: An Irish Historical Adventure", "author": "Christine Mary Flemming", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 20, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 96.0}

A dark, well detailed series which is choc full of references! The Holmes character is well done, as is Watson this is a Sherlock series different to what we ve seen before set somewhere where it hasn t been. The language and look may be different, but this is a good one to read! --3 million years UKWATSON AND HOLMES TPB #1: A Study In Black Written by Karl Bollers Art by Rick Leonardi, Larry Stroman, Paul Mendoza, GuruEFX, Archie Van Buren & Jay David Ramos New Paradigm Studios This will be a Spoiler Free Review What starts with a baby found on the street leads to a murder mystery that has Jon Watson sucked into the world of detectives, drugs, snipers and more alongside private investigator Sherlock Holmes. And while this may sound like the normal Sherlock Holmes stories, this is a new take where Holmes and Watson are African American and living in New York City. What does Medical Intern Jon Watson do as he gets sucked into a case involving drugs, murder and more? Why does Holmes become obsessed with having all the answers? And what happens when what seems to be street drug dealers in New York City get targeted? The Good:  Bollers gives us some solid writing for this new incarnation of Sherlock Holmes. While Holmes retains his sophistication and intellect from the novels, Bollers definitely blends him well within the confines of 21st Century New York City. Bollers makes sure that Holmes and Watson really fit into their roles in New York City through their actions, the way they talk and more. Watson was given added depth by becoming a newly single father and does a great job of updating his military history to reflect recent events. There were a lot of characters that the duo meet but Bollers does a good job of making the two the driving force of the book while making the other characters they meet along the way interesting; such as Watson s soon to be ex wife, the drug dealing Junior or, my personal favorite, Holmes brother, Mike.  Bollers does a great job of providing great dialogue, good motivations and strong characterizations of people throughout the story. Each chapter felt like an episode of a 40 minute tv show more than a comic but it really works here. The dialogue was very real and I do like that there was a resolution but enough plot threads left over to do more with it. The pacing for the book was exquisite. And there is a real authenticity for this murder/mystery urban drama that just shines through as you read. I can say with no uncertainty that this book is some of Leonardi s best work in his entire career. And considering Leonardi has drawn the X-Men in the past, that is saying a whole lot. There is a good amount of detail. The backgrounds and characters are detailed with thicker inks and some darker colors and tones. Yet, it works as the colors are very reminiscent of many of the color techniques used in the Milestone Media books from the 90s ... and it works EXTREMELY well for this book. Leonardi pours his all in each page of the main story while Stroman does the same with the epilogue.  Leonardi and Stroman do not have any problem showing you the grittiness of New York City but also its beauty as it captures it very well with different panels throughout the entire trade. Overall, this art team blew away with great visuals. The Bad: Not a single thing.  Final Verdict: This book left a strong impression. Great story. Beautiful, strong all. Rich colors. It really sucks you into the atmosphere and characters. This is a book you definitely don t want to sleep on. Definitely one of the best comics I have read all year. I give Watson and Holmes: A Study In Black trade paperback a 5 stars Out of 5! READ IT NOW!! --Herotaku.comReggie Hudlin Top 10 Comics of 2013 #4 Watson and Holmes Tasteful, smartly done book.

Amy focuses her efforts on writing Young Adult Fiction... adventure, romance, and life-lessons... woven together as imagination and escape for young readers.  Amy believes books are not only entertaining, but can also transform lives.  A book can educate.  A book can teach compassion and kindness.  A book can spark interest.  A book can be a companion.  Books can accompany and guide young readers as they navigate through the twisted, confusing roads of adolescence. Amy is a member of Kentucky Independent Writers. She lives in Kentucky, where she is a middle school teacher.  She and her husband are raising three wild, intelligent, and creative boys, giving her plenty of fodder for the love and adventure she enjoys putting in her stories!", "related": ["B00I927WZ2"], "rank": 1100121, "title": "Dusk (Young Adult Paranormal Romance)", "author": "Amy Durham", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.6, "rating_total": 23.0}

But when the don’s aged underboss learns that he is dying of cancer, he tells Joe the murderer’s identity—the current NYPD commissioner, who has just been nominated to run the FBI. He also tells Joe that Gino was the don’s hit man. Reeling from both revelations, Joe wrestles with ending the man’s career or ending his life. At the heart of this series have always been DeMarco’s bone-deep cynicism; his relationship with his boss, conniving, lecherous, alcoholic House minority leader John Mahoney; and often-hilarious portrayals of congressional chicanery. This time, though, those elements are largely abandoned. Joe is alone in New York, hunted by every cop in the city, and blinded by rage. Readers accustomed to outrageous but almost plausible political knavery may be disappointed, but House Reckoning is a fine thriller with a tense, twisting plot and a sociopathic villain worthy of a seat in the House. --Thomas Gaughan", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
