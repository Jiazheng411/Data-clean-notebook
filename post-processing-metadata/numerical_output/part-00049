The entire snow-dusted town seemed like something out of a movie.There were people walking to and fro with wrapped gifts, stores bedecked with holiday decorations, and even snow-flakes, falling at a slow and steady pace, as if some set decorator was standing in the clouds with a giant shaker.Okay, sohatedmight be a strong word. Detested, perhaps. Loathed. Either way, he didn't want to be here, especially when he'd been forced into the decision.His editor atFood Loversmagazine had assigned him this story in Riverbend, knowing Flynn, of everyone on staff, could get the job done. Write an incisive, unique piece on the little bakery—a bakery rumored to have cookies that inspired people to fall in love, his editor had said. So here he was, spending the Christmas holiday holed up in the middle of nowhere penning one more of the stories that had made him famous.Flynn scowled. He couldn't complain. Those stories had been his bread and butter forever, a very lucrative butter at that. And after that little fiasco in June, he needed to get his edge back, reestablish his position at the top of the writer pack. To do that, he'd do what he always did—suck it up, feign great joy at the festive spirit surrounding him and get to work.Then he could get back to Boston, back to Mimi, and back to civilization. This town, with its Norman Rockwell looks, had to be as far from civilization as Mars was from Earth. Not that he had anything against quaint, but he lived in a world of iPods, e-mail and high-speed Internet connections. Riverbend looked like the kind of place that thought Bluetooth was a dental disease.So, here he was, at the Joyful Creations Bakery.Oh, joy.He pushed his car to the side of the road, then grabbed his notebook and headed across the street. The crowd in front of the Joyful Creations Bakery blocked most of the plateglass window, but Flynn could see that storefront, too, had not been spared by the town's festive elves. A trio of lighted wreaths hung in the window, one of them even forming theOin the business's name.\"Nauseatingly cute,\" Flynn muttered under his breath.He circumvented the line that stretched out the door, around the bakery and all the way to the corner of Larch Street. Ignoring the snow falling from the sky, couples stood together—most of the men looking none too keen on the idea of being dragged off to a bakery purported to be a food love source, while groups of women chatted excitedly about the \"romance cookies.\"It took sheer willpower for Flynn not to roll his eyes. The airline magazine that had first broken the story had clearly created an epidemic. By the time this piece hitFood Lovers'Valentine's Day issue, the shop would be overrun with the lovelorn. He hoped the owner was prepared for the onslaught. Flynn knew, from personal experience, how a too-fast rocket to success could be as destructive as a too-quick drop to the bottom.Regardless, he was here to do a job, not offer a business consultation.He brushed by a woman holding a toddler and entered Joyful Creations. A blast of warm air and holiday music greeted him like he'd jumped into a Christmas bath. The scent of fresh-baked bread, coupled with vanilla, cinnamon and a hint of raspberry, assaulted his senses. The waiting patrons were surely impressed, but Flynn had seen all this and smelled all this before.\"Hey, no cutting,\" the woman said.\"I'm not buying anything,\" he replied, and kept going. Get in, get the story, get out. Get back to Boston. Hopefully before Mimi even noticed he was gone.IfMimi even noticed he was gone.\"Why would you battle this crowd if you weren't going to buy anything?\" the woman asked, shuffling the kid to the other hip.\"For…\" Flynn turned toward the counter where two women were busy filling orders as quickly as they were being shouted over the din. One, gray-haired and petite, the other, tall and blond, curvy, with the kind of hips that said she didn't spend her days obsessing over having two pieces of celery or one.Wow. The airline magazine hadn't run a photo of Samantha Barnett with their story, just one of the cookies. But clearly, she was the owner that the writer had described as \"energetic, friendly, youthful.\"\"Her,\" Flynn said.\"Sam? Good luck with that.\" The woman laughed, then turned back to her kid, playing with his nose. Pretending the thing was a button or something. Flynn had no experience with other people's children and had no intention of starting now, so he moved away.It took the navigational skills of a fleet admiral to wade through the crowd inside the shop, but a few minutes later, Flynn had managed to reach the glass counter. He stood to the far right, away from the line of paying customers, most of them looking like they'd come straight from placing a personal ad. \"Are you Samantha Barnett?\"The blonde looked up. Little tendrils of her hair were beginning to escape her ponytail, as if the first few strands were thinking of making a break for the border. She wore little makeup, just a dash of red lip gloss and a dusting of mascara. He suspected the slight hint of crimson in her cheeks was natural, a flush from the frantic pace of the warm bakery. A long white apron with the wordsJoyful Creationsscrolled across the middle in a curled red script hugged her frame, covering dark denim jeans and a soft green V-neck sweater. \"I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to get into the line.\"\"I'm not here to buy anything.\"That made her pause. Stop putting reindeer-shaped cookies into a white box. \"Do you have a delivery or some mail for me?\"He shook his head. Vowed to buy a new dress coat, if he looked like a mailman in this one. \"I just want to talk to you.\"\"Now is not a good time.\" She let out a little laugh. \"I'm kind of busy.\"\"Yeah, well, I'mon a deadline.\" He fished a business card out of his pocket and slid it across the glass case. \"Flynn MacGregor withFood Loversmagazine. Maybe you've heard of it?\"Her face lit up, as so many others before hers had. Everyone had heard ofFood Lovers.It wasthemagazine about the food industry, carried in every grocery store and bookstore, read by thirty million people nationwide. A print mention in its pages was the equivalent of starring in a movie.Even ifFood Loversmagazine's focus had shifted, ever since Tony Reynolds had taken over as editor a year ago. His insistence on finding the story behind the story, the dish on every chef, restaurant and food business, had given the magazine more of a tabloid feel, but also tripled readership in a matter of months.At first, Flynn hadn't minded doing what Tony wanted. But as each story became more and more invasive of people's personal lives, Flynn's job had begun to grate on him. More than once he had thought about quitting. But Flynn MacGregor hadn't gotten to where he was by turning tail just because he butted heads with an editor or ran into a roadblock ot two.\"Wow,\" Samantha said, clearly not bothered byFood Lovers'reputation. \"You want to talk to me? What about?\"\"Your bakery. Why you got into this business. What makes Joyful Creations special…\" As he ran through his usual pre-interview spiel, Flynn bit back his impatience. Reminded himself this was his four hundredth interview, but probably her first or second. Flynn could recite the questions without even needing to write them down ahead of time. Heck, he could practically write her answers for her. She got into baking because she loved people, loved food. The best part about being in business in a small town was the customers. Yada-yada-yada.As for the cookies that made people fall in love, Flynn put no stock in things like that. He'd seen soups that supposedly made women go into labor, cakes that were rumored to jump-start diets, appetizers bandied about as the next best aphrodisiac. None of which had proven to be true, but still, the magazine had run a charming piece in its pages, appealing to its vast readership.While he was here, he'd track down a few of the couples who owed their happiness to the sugar-and-flour concoctions, then put some kind of cutesy spin on the story. The art department would fancy up the headline with dancing gingerbread men or something, and they'd all walk away thinking Joyful Creations was the best thing to come along since Cupid and his trademark bow.\"That's pretty much how it works, Miss Barnett,\" Flynn finished, wrapping up his sugarcoated version of the article process.The bakery owner nodded. \"Sounds great. Relatively painless.\"\"Sam? I hate to interrupt,\" another woman cut in, just as Flynn was getting ready to ask his first question, \"but I really need to pick up my order. I have a preschool waiting. And you know preschoolers. They want their sugar.\"Samantha Barnett snapped to attention, back to her customer. \"Oh, sure, Rachel. Sorry about that. Two dozen, right?\"The other woman, a petite brunette, grinned. \"And one extra, for the teacher.\"\"Of course.\" Samantha smiled, finished putting the reindeer into the box, then tied it with a thin red ribbon and handed the white container across the counter. \"Here you go.\"\"Will you put it on my tab?\"Samantha waved off the words. \"Consider it a Christmas gift to the Bumblebees.\"Not a smart way to run a business, giving away profits like that, but Flynn kept that to himself. He wasn't her financial consultant. \"The interview, Miss Barnett?\"Behind them, the line groaned. Samantha brushed her bangs off her forehead. \"Can I meet with you later today? Maybe after the shop closes? I'm swamped right now.\"She had help, didn't she? On top of that, he had somewhere else he wanted to go before beginning that long drive back to Boston, not endless amounts of time to wait around for preschoolers to get their sugar rush. \"And I'm on deadline.\"The next person had slipped into the space vacated ...", "related": ["B00D1WWGT2"], "rank": 1569254, "title": "Marry-Me Christmas (A Bride for All Seasons)", "author": "Shirley Jump", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her poems about him have appeared both in literary quarterlies and in O: The Oprah Magazine; this consistently moving, straightforward collection of those poems seems likely to gain much attention. Richey (The Burning Point) remembers her earlier years as a single mother, living through a traumatic miscarriage, juggling work and home life, and later grappling with her son's military vocation: \"My son has brothers now,\" she writes, \"the family she wanted.\" Richey's strongest lines, however, find a sharp blend between personal emotions and public events: she writes a poem to her son's helmet, to his gun, to his \"desert camo boots,\" warning herself, \"I can't protect him.\" Richey, who comes from West Virginia but lives in New York, sees signs of the current conflict everywhere-at the planetarium, for example, or in a taxicab. More than just a book about one war, Richey's collection becomes instead a book about what military service (especially high-risk combat service, such as her son's) does to the psyches and daily lives of those who serve and those who love them. In a museum exhibit about the Civil War, Richey grows \"sick to my stomach,/ face-to-face with the gallantry/ of men young/ as my son\"; hearing that son, home on leave, boast about his regiment's destructive powers, she muses with self-conscious helplessness, \"If I could take that hat off his head,/ he wouldn't say those things.\"Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the Forbidden Doors series by bestselling author Bill Myers, teenager Rebecca 'Becka' Williams, her younger brother Scott, and her friend Ryan Riordan are swept into heart-stopping encounters with an all-too-real invisible world---a world fraught with deception and spiritual adversaries that promise goodness and enlightenment but will stop at nothing to destroy life, sanity, and human souls. Witchcraft. Reincarnation. Ouija Boards. UFOs. Shamanism. Counterfeit spiritualities are widespread and popular with spiritually searching young adults such as Becka's peers. What's the harm? Find out. Join Becka, Scott, and Ryan as they head for mind-bending clashes between the forces of darkness and the kingdom of God. Combining meticulous research, realistic settings, and masterful storytelling, the Forbidden Doors novels take you from the mountains of New Mexico to the inner workings of a secret society---and into the truth of God's Word, which exposes lies and reveals the reality of spiritual warfare. Each volume in the series contains three books that center around a particular kind of Forbidden Door. Book One: Dark Powers contains The Society, The Deceived, and The Spell; Book Two: Invisible Terror contains The Haunting, The Guardian, and The Encounter; Book Three: Deadly Loyalty contains The Curse, The Undead, and The Scream; Book Four: Ancient Forces contains The Ancients, The Wiccan, and The Cards", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

(Sallie D. Penman, director, Illinois Administrators' Academy, Chicago Public Schools)Tomal's book provides a practical and understandable approach to action research that can validate improvement strategies to foster gains in student achievement.

Lampert, chair, Research and Evaluation, Maine Community Youth Assistance Foundation, Park Ridge, Illinois)Tomal's book thoughtfully weaves the theoretical underpinnings of action research with practical step-by-step insights about a procedure model for conducting action research. It is organized in a manner to give the neophyte, novice, advanced teacher or administrator viable methods for conducting both formal and informal action research. This book is a must for every educator's bookshelf committed to inquiry and the principles of reflective research. (Gary N.

Given Devlin's penchant for sticking his nose where it doesn't belong, many people bear him murderous grudges. Devlin focuses on two suspects—Tom Gunter, a violent thug and a former client, and Aled Borth, a loner angered that the lawyer's best efforts didn't result in a charge of murder being brought against the nursing home where Borth's mother died. The addition of a serial killer who severs his victim's tongues might have proven too much for the plot to bear in a lesser writer's hands, but Edwards skillfully weaves the strands together.

It doesn't take much to pique Jackie's curiosity, and before long she's involved with tracking down information about Eugenie and the five photos on the camera's memory card. Her investigation uncovers a startling link to her own family's history as well as Eugenie's. The excellent supporting cast—Sam Acquillo, the star of the author's first four Hamptons mysteries; Jackie's boyfriend, Harry Goodlander; Southampton cop Joe Sullivan; computer guru Randall Dodge—provide valuable assistance when Jackie's efforts stir up threats. Domestic problems and Homeland Security issues enliven a plot with slick twists that should keep readers switching their bets to the very end. (Feb.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Archibald is the first book in The Chronicles of Grimm Dragonblaster. I-ve got to say I'm really looking forward to reading the next book, as well as anymore that may follow. This first book is intense and engaging, and I found myself completely immersed in the world of mages and would-be mages. The dialogue took a while to become comfortable with, as it has unusual expressions and words to it, but it didn't take long to become accustomed to the manner of speech used in this book. Grimm's journey is intriguing, as are his relationships with those around him. I especially loved the way he spoke and interacted with his grandparents. This relationship seemed natural and loving. This is a great book, one that seems to be only the beginning of what is sure to be a very interesting tale.\" 5 Angels!

Stemming from the indigenous ecospiritual concept that when we corrupt and poison the environment, we “make war against Mother Earth,” speakers address such diverse issues as the loss of Acoma shrines to coal and gas mines, the impact of mega dams, mines, and deforestation on the land belonging to the Canadian Cree, and the pollution of water sources at the Isleta Pueblo, downstream from Albuquerque. The reader becomes familiar with projects like RAFT (Renewing America’s Food Traditions), which works to protect heirloom seeds and conserve native ecosystems, and the Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN), which focuses on environmental and economic justice issues affecting indigenous peoples, who are “disproportionately impacted and burdened” by toxic contamination. These indigenous activists have much to share, and they serve as crucial voices in the worldwide effort to restore our ailing planet. --Deborah Donovan", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My grandmother, Pearl Hall, retired from the Frontier Saloon in Pendleton Oregon. This is what I am about, to the bone. I wrote this story because I want others to know what kind of a person my husband Mike was, and the only way I could do that was to put my real self in the words. As you can see from my background I am very down to earth, compassionate, sensitive, and kind to any living thing. Communication to the animal kingdom is a must in my life. If it wasn't for the animals around me, I would not be able to encompass the real true meaning of life. Thank you God for your creations.I hope you all enjoy what I have to share.

Carroll was the youngest of seven children and was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1970 where he was kept in a dresser drawer with the clean socks.  Luckily, he wasn’t kept with the dirty socks or else he might have grown up to become slightly warped. As a child, John spent most of his time wandering through the Mojave Desert in an attempt to avoid people.  He would stare at the sky, imagining what it would be like to explore different worlds.  One of his favorite memories is watching his dad build the fuselage of Evel Kneivel’s skycycle in their garage.  One of his least favorite moments was watching that skycycle fall into the Snake River.  (Not his dad’s fault and he has documentation to prove it, so nyah) As a teenager, John spends most of his time driving wherever he could in an attempt to avoid people.  He would stare at the road, imagining what it would be like to explore different worlds.  He was the captain of the chess team, lettered in golf and band while in high school, and wasn’t beaten up anywhere near as much as one might imagine. As an adult, John spends most of his time staring at a computer screen in an attempt to avoid people.  He stares at the monitor for hours, imagining what it would be like to explore different worlds.  He has been married to his wonderful wife for fifteen years and they have three obnoxio . . . wonderful children who always behave . . . when they’re asleep. Emo bunny minions surround John at most times.  He is their imaginary friend and they look to him for guidance.  At one point, they took over the world.  No one noticed because they left everything exactly as it was.  They gave the world back after a week because it was depressing. The Willden Trilogy is his first endeavor into the field of writing.  Other series and standalone works will be forthcoming.  In addition, John has written a number of short stories he publishes for free because he likes you so much.  (And it’s good marketing. Shh)  He writes in the evenings and weekends whenever possible.  Regrettably, the family mentioned in the previous paragraph desires food and shelter, requiring the author to possess a full time job until his writing makes him rich.", "related": ["B00CWVMN78"], "rank": 1028755, "title": "Kethril (Willden Trilogy Book 3)", "author": "John H.

And thanks to her habit of insanely hoarding everything from bales of cloth to old wrapping paper, she has pictures of every incarnation, which are lushly reproduced in her immensely fun scrapbook-memoir, Absolutely. EVENING STANDARD Her beauty does not fade and her unquenchable spirit for adventure seems more apparent than ever. Joanna Lumley is, for many, something of a national treasure. In this new illustrated memoir, we trot through her childhood in Kashmir...to her days of modelling in the Swinging Sixties and her move into acting. Luckily for fans, Lumley is a committed hoarder so there is a wealth of fantastic photographs and press cuttings to feast upon. DAILY EXPRESS Mischievous and measured, Joanna Lumley gives us a remarkable portrait of a groovy life...Lots of facts, little hyperbole and a pervasive sense of self effacement, a very British talent for understatement and self-deprecation and (and this, in an age of vomit-into-the-void celebrity culture is perhaps what stands out and pleases the most) restraint...that makes this such a refreshing read...she gives us the facts - and photographs - from a life astonishingly rich in experience. -- Sarah Vine THE TIMES A full-page photograph at the begining of Joanna Lumley's glossy memoir shows the nation's darling in full evening dress, wearing a glittering tiara...crimson sash and gold star...The portrait captures perfectly the mixture of poshness and larkiness that has captivated Joanna Lumley's audiences...Tempting as it is to concentrate on the wealth of photographs, it would be a pity to ignore the linking text. Joanna writes beautifully, managing to be both thoughtful and amusing. -- Jane Shilling DAILY MAIL Lumley has done it all, from sex kitten and TV star to activist for the Gurkhas. Read about it here.' - No.2 of The Independent's 'Ten Best New Memoirs THE INDEPENDENT An actress with an extraordinarily varied life that has taken her from Kashmir to kent, from Bond girl to Ab Fab. It's all here in this gloriously illustrated, entertaining memoir, that's packed with personal photos and reminiscences. WOMAN & HOME Joanna Lumley's Absolutely is what Alan Sugar would probably call \"a breath of fresh air in a world full of c***\". Like Winner and Sugar, she has published memoirs before, and so this is a picture book, with words - thousands of pictures of Lumley as a child, a model, an actress, and as her dark ego Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous...She writes beautifully, too; unlike the authors above, she does not scream into the Dictaphone but respects her readers enough to compose sentences and read back over them when she has finished. -- Tanya Gold THE DAILY TELEGRAPH She's the glamorous age-defying star of stage and screen, who is famous as Patsy from Ab Fab yet a passionate human rights campaigner.

And it turns out that everyone with an office job is disgruntled at least some of the time. In a way, Dilbert predicted the current wave of reality entertainment. I'd love to say my writing is what makes Dilbert work, but it probably has more to do with the recognizable workplace situations and the fact that people see themselves in the strip. Dilbert works best when the characters give voice to what employees in the real world are thinking.Amazon.com:The Kindle edition of Dilbert 2.0 is split into four volumes organized by business era. Are there signature characters or themes that mark the essence of each era?Scott Adams:In the early ears, volume one, Dilbert wasn't strictly about the workplace. Dilbert had a job, but the comic was more often based around his home. The next volume involves strips written during the downsizing of the early nineties, at about the same time Dilbert became a workplace strip. Next came the hardest era for any cartoonist -- the dotcom years. During the go-go days of the Internet, when employees felt well-paid and hopeful, it was hard to find humor. Humor prefers dysfunction. We now know that the dotcom era was hugely dysfunctional, but it wasn't obvious to most people who were in it. Then came the modern era, when hope and compensation took a hit, and once again it became easy to do my job.Amazon.com:How did you narrow down your selections from more than 7,000 potential strips to the nearly 2,000 included in Dilbert 2.0?Scott Adams:It wasn't easy! I tried to find the strips that were the funniest while also having some meaning, or a funny story attached. But it felt like I was a mother with triplets and someone told me I could only keep one of them.Amazon.com:What were the greatest challenges and opportunities associated with translating Dilbert 2.0 for the Kindle Fire?Scott Adams:It's a fascinating process. When you change the physical delivery system for a comic, you can also change the pacing. There's a tradeoff between what looks best and what reads most fluidly. I think we found the right balance.Amazon.com:What are you most excited about for the Dilbert of the future?Scott Adams:I'm hoping a Dilbert movie comes together soon. We're working on it, but movies are never a sure thing. A lot of elements have to fall in place. And we'll be doing a lot with Dilbert.com and with mobile phone distribution. It's an exciting time to be a cartoonist.", "related": [], "rank": 231827, "title": "Dilbert 2.0: The Early Years, 1989 to 1993: 20 Years of Dilbert", "author": "Scott Adams", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Disembodied heads, animal resurrection (\"Zombie Kitten,\" \"Franken-Monkey\") and the direct stimulation of a subject's emotions (via electric brain prod) are some of the more grim activities Boese describes (though, thankfully, he steers clear of examples from Nazi Germany). Lighter subjects include attempts to prove the myth that the bar patrons become more attractive at closing time and the effects of staying awake for 11 days straight. These and other tales will obviously appeal to armchair scientists, but the short, witty, ceaselessly amusing entries should delight anyone with a healthy sense of morbid curiosity.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Augusta Hillyard and her great-granddaughter, Zoe, share an uncommon love for the past and for their ancestral home. The novel opens in 1902, as Augusta Hillyard, who has just turned 40, begins a diary while lying \"abed\" in the mansion. Alternating between four decades of Augusta's intimate diary entries and a less engaging, third-person chronicle about Zoe set mostly in the 1980s, the narrative offers an absorbing portrait of a privileged yet dysfunctional family. Fascinated with the Victorian era ever since she and her brother, Arthur, were raised in the mansion by Augusta's disagreeable daughter, Annabelle, Zoe, who's now 40 herself, gets her big break as a production designer on a period film. She soon jeopardizes her Hollywood dream job by returning to Commonwealth Avenue to help her estranged brother, devastated by Annabelle's unexpected stroke. A part-time music teacher, Arthur has secretly squandered the family fortune caring for his aging great aunt, and he may even lose the family \"shrine.\" Despite weak male characters and lukewarm suspense over the fate of the mansion, this novel captures with color and affection the rich nuances of early 20th-century life.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The shop provided the background for her memoir About My Father's Business, a child's eye view of a 1920s family. She moved to the Isle of Skye with her husband in 1942, and began writing fiction after moving to the Isle of Man with her family twenty years later. She also completed a cookery book, Secrets from a Crofter's Kitchen (Arrow, 1976).

After 11 years, I'm finally acting upon those lessons learned. I left a comfy career in my hometown to travel the world as an enterprise consultant.

Flip through literary journals, and you find a bland sameness to much of the prose, tepid language that  avoids passion and serves no literary end.  So imagine my surprise when I encountered the pared-down prose of Dawn Promislow's first short story collection, Jewels.  It's the text equivalent of seeing straight to the bottom of a very deep lake.  Its writing is spare in the service of clarity, each sentence shaped by the effort to see truth and bring it to light. Promislow was born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa; she's lived in England and now resides in Toronto, but her subject-matter is the disfiguring quality of life as it was lived under apartheid in her homeland. While bringing the particulars of her characters' situations to life, she also illuminates universal themes: the human awakening from innocence to knowledge, the awareness that much of life is beyond our control, the truth that everything passes and nothing abides. There are fourteen brief and understated stories in this slender book, many of them told from the point of view of genteel, middle-class white women who slowly become aware of apartheid's corroding horror as it leaches into their gardens and homes. In the opening story, \"Pool,\" the author skillfully overlaps the points of view of a young girl and her family's house-servant (Ficksen) who cleans their pool. Ficksen is the centre of the story (the only one named), and he's never been in the water. The ending is no less powerful for it being expected. Likewise, in \"Secret,\" the white first-person narrator describes life in a placid rural town where she's employed in a shop; a black man, Philemon, comes looking for work. When the police chase him down, the woman awakens to the fact that her world is awash with cruel secrets that no one has ever revealed to her. Equally poignant are stories told from the point of view of black South Africans. In \"Bottle,\" a nanny, Bella, brings joy to her husband as she shares with him some ocean water collected from her first visit to the sea with her white employers.  The first-person voice of a servant, Ester, is beautifully rendered in \"Just a Job,\" when she finds a position with a kindly couple, only to witness the breakup of their marriage. Yet for a glimpse at moral catastrophe, nothing matches \"Wan,\" a story that packs a lifetime of guilt, remorse and devastating secrecy into six short pages.  It's told by an artist preoccupied with painting a canvas of pure space (a bit obvious, perhaps, that it's white); she's haunted by the fact that her husband's given shelter to a colleague on the run for political reasons. Distressed by his presence and unable to work, she embarks on a desperate course of action, bringing herself face-to-face with the reality of the police-state that was the guarantor of her lovely home and the peace of her artist's studio. \"But my canvas,\" she says at the end. \"...It's perfect, as I envisioned it... I did it, I did it, and you can see it, you can see it, you can see it...\" In her agitated words, we hear the voice of madness trying to crush the voice of a guilty conscience, and it's Promislow's gift that allows us to hear both. Jewels is a work of beauty, hard-won honesty, and the quiet unfolding of insight.  It's also, as the title suggests, a gem. - The Thoughtful Blogger, September 30 2011 Promislow's (likely) autobiographical sketch of her transitory and almost mirage-like relationship with a black student is the most compelling in a group of stories that explores the South Africa in the days of late apartheid. The realities by this South African-born Canadian will resonate with all who grew up in days of insensitivity, insecurity and sense of right. The perspectives tell of the backyard dwellers who raised the children of others while neglecting their own, and, in one instance, the white woman imprisoned by her own fears -Cape Times April 2011 Some fiction makes us work a while before words and images and meanings begin to integrate. What we seek is that longed-for subliminal collaboration between author and reader - the point at which you're not so much reading as simply seeing and knowing, impelled on by a need to know more. Pool, the opening story in Dawn Promislow's debut collection, arrives at clear seeing in the first short paragraph, then the images segue into intrigue: \"The room was spare and clean, like a jail cell, almost. ... She peeped in whenever she could. Maybe Ficksen would reveal to her some essential clue about himself.\" The story is a model of clean and uncluttered prose, tight structuring and firm control over its effects.

Thought I would read it because I know nothing about marijuana or the people involved with it. I am ecstatic that I did. Funny, Funny, Funny!!!The chapters are like short stories. Stories about unloading boats with helicopters, close encounters with law enforcement, traveling through the jungles of South America.The chapter about the author's first time smoking marijuana made me feel like I was with him...coughing.All of the characters were just a group of loveable, nice guys and girls.Not what I had been raised to believe...hysterical maniacs high on pot bent on death and mayhem. They were nothing like that.If you have ever read any of David Sedaris' books, and like them...you will love Shoulda Robbed a Bank.And the crazy things happening reminded me of Holden Caufield in 'Catcher in the Rye' and the way he staggered through life.The way the words are put together are like nothing I have ever heard.

For all of her adult summers she returned, first, working college summers, and later, her own children summered on the Cape.  After her daughter and son were gone off to their own lives, she settled permanently back on her beloved Cape. First, in Harwich and then in her hometown Brewster. There, she and her husband ran an art gallery and pottery shop, Hesperus Pottery and Folk Art Gallery at their antique sea captain’s home on Main Street (Brewster boasts more sea captain’s homes than any other Cape town-hence, The Sea Captains Town). Her Narrative Maritime Americana Primitive paintings are in private collections worldwide and in the Tokyo, Japan National Art Gallery. Her work can be seen in Osterville at the Birdsey On The Cape gallery. Besides painting she made pottery, quilts and hooked rugs that they sold in the shop. She has produced a full-color book of her paintings and another that features her hooked rugs. Both books are available from Amazon. Type in her full name for the complete list of her books from fiction to art and rugs, children's illustrated and travel.  Turning her hand to fiction writing (she worked as a free-lance journalist for a small city newspaper for eleven years while raising her children, and later, wrote cruising and boat provisioning articles for U.S. and Canada sailing magazines) she now has a number of books available on Amazon and Kindle. While on a student exchange in England, she fell in love with British mysteries. Thus, her foray into cozies began with a series featuring a Brit expat living on Cape Cod. Moving to Nantucket, she added another cozy seriesrfeaturing an island sleuth. She knows well the places of which she writes, be it London, Provence, Nantucket, Puerto Rico or Cape Cod.  She and her husband down-sized in 2004 from an antique house on three wooded acres to a 44' boat. They spend winters in Puerto Rico and summers on their boat on Cape Cod. \"Less housework, more time to write!\"     She may be contacted by email at hesperus@capecod.net.

Her other interests include painting in watercolour,  caring for her pets,  and dancing.

In handwritten journal entries that alternate with e-mail exchanges, she contemplates The Slow, Tragic Death of My Social Life at school and her own sense of alienation from her newly pubescent body, while sharing confidences both with her wise, but sometimes embarrassingly free-spirited, Granny Ed and with Iphis, kindred soul and newfound e-mail buddy. Tucked liberally into her narrative are reflections on finding and developing story ideas, creating vivid characters, getting through writer’s block and other aspects of the literary life. Iphis has a secret that temporarily throws a wisecracking, beautiful friendship on the rocks, but by the end both tempest and school report have passed. Young would-be authors will identify with Thisbe’s steady determination to be a writer and benefit from her exercises and not-quite lectures as well.

Duncan, a best-selling author and correspondent for Atlantic.com and NPR, goes beyond simplistic explanations like being able to spend more time with family and meeting great-great-great grandchildren in order to touch on the scientific, cultural and socio-economic impacts of extreme aging. Accessible and engaging explanations of breakthroughs in the fields of medicine and technology help to illustrate how each answer to the question of desired lifespan is actually plausible (yes, even the desire to live forever is plausible--to some degree). From Silicon Valley think-tanks to growing new organs in petri dishes, Duncan explores the science of anti-aging that could make very long lives possible. He also provides a balanced debate between the anti-agers who believe that longer lifespans are better and those who are concerned about what extended lifespans will do to society--not to mention the planet's economies and resources. Based on a TEDx talk given in Brussels,When I'm 164is a fascinating picture of the anti-aging technology available today, what may be on the horizon tomorrow and what that means for society as a whole.--Malissa Kent", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Divided into three sections, Prehistoric Life begins with a brief look at “Young Earth.” Two-page spreads examine topics such as plate tectonics, fossils, and the geological timescale. The bulk of the volume discusses “Life on Earth” and is divided by era from the Archean through the Quaternary. Each section introduces the plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates (as applicable) representative of that time period. The final section delves into “The Rise of the Humans” and discusses human relatives, ancestors, origins, and migration patterns.   Although a wealth of scientific information is provided, the illustrative material is the star of this volume. The collection of full-color photographs of fossils (ranging from spore to dinosaur) and skeletons show amazing detail and clarity. Visitors to a natural history museum could not explore the number of examples contained here. Where actual photographs are obviously not available, DK commissioned 3-D images, “modeled using scientific research” to bring life-forms to the page for readers. Photographs and other images are accompanied by information about the creature such as name, group, date, and location. Scaled images (of either a thumb, a hand, or a human) are used to help readers visualize actual sizes.   Geared to adults, this work will find popularity with science enthusiasts and browsers alike. Because of the relatively low cost, public libraries will likely want more than one copy. High schools with a strong science program will want to consider purchase for their library or science department. --Shauna Yusko", "related": ["B00CCTFQL0"], "rank": 884301, "title": "Dinosaurs Prehistoric Life: The Definitive Visual Guide", "author": "DK Publishing", "category": "Science & Math", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A true child of the city, she is heavily influenced by many facets of urban life.  Felicia has an extensive background in administration on the corporate level. Leaving it behind for the pursuit of her love for beauty and glamour, she says, “I had a thought. Every woman is beautiful. I feel like it is my calling in life to find it, make her see it, appreciate it and enhance it.”   Through her make-up artistry, that is exactly what she has done. In 2009, she opened DaLipstickBandit Cosmetics (DLB) and began her work freelancing all throughout the city. It was through this company that she was able to work on countless videos, photo shoots, tv shows, proms, weddings and more. She also made natural bath and body products. In 2010, she became Beauty Editor for MANIK Magazine, fashion and lifestyle publication for the plus-sized fashionista, she has built ties with the very community she calls her own.  In 2011, the doors closed on DLB but not on her dream. She began working for many prestige makeup brands on the retail level and kept hope alive that DLB would once again know glory.   A woman of many talents, Felicia is also a writer and poet. “Before I was a make-up artist, I was a writer,” she says. “In fact, I’m grateful for my literary roots. It forced me to imagine a world of my own creation that was completely in my own mind and I was forced to express to other people and have them see it too through my words. That is the same approach I apply to all facets of my life. My art is the truest expression of that principle.” Create her own world, she did with her upcoming release of fiction novel, Counter Girls. Art imitating life, Felicia drew on her experience working in many department stores to create a story about three women working at a makeup counter in NYC. The novel is set to be released in November 2012.   If the past is any indication of what is to be expected in the future, it is imperative that all eyes remain on Ms. York. For she is a dynamic individual and it is for certain that great things are to come.", "related": [], "rank": 2814224, "title": "Counter Girls eBook", "author": "Felicia C.

Butler III (Neto) has been studying ancient times for many years. From learning to read encyclopedias at the age of 3, he has always looked for the reason behind the action. Midrash allows him to do this. Midrash is a Hebrew style of writing which means interpretation\" It is meant to look at what may have motivated a person in the narrative that we know very little about. What were they living through, was there some background that is missing. He started writing this story as a free verse poem ten years ago, expecting it to be around three pages long, a short story. It grew off the page into a novella, and then a novel. Every night he listened, and it was as if Salome was speaking, filling in the very few words that were written in Josephus, or the book of Luke that spoke of an unnamed daughter of Herodias, something that wasn't there in the operas of Strauss, a vulnerable young woman who had been sheltered and then thrust into adult responsibility far too soon. She did not die young, but of old age, not mocked, but respected as a queen. This does not happen without a young person taking charge of her own life and turning a different direction, one which has not been told. In learning about her, he learned about himself. One sometimes must make decisions that are unpopular, try to find out about the backside of a culture because the front is not what it seems. Talk to the bum on the street before you go to the counselor, talk to the counselor before you go the bureaucrat, but learn that the bureaucrat may have just the information you need if you talk to them nicely. From talking to the homeless, he learned what Salome could have found out, just by watching. Charles was born in Brazil in a small town in the highlands, the son of missionary parents. Like Salome, he has lived in multiple countries. He traveled to Europe in college, and wandered Capri and the streets of Rome. He speaks English,", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I joined the Royal Navy straight from school, did four years at engineering college and then went to sea for three years in destroyers. I took a commission after that and joined the Fleet Air Arm as a helicopter pilot. I was married, had two kids and now have four grandchildren and one great grandson. I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally.

A family drives to a farm and purchases chicks, which they raise in a brooder. As the chicks grow, they graduate to an outside coop. Eventually some of them lay eggs in nest boxes, providing new chicks for the brooder. Goodell’s realistic artwork depicts cooperative parents and children working together on this venture. The illustrations carefully anticipate the succinct prose (one page depicts Dad giving the farmer a check, while the text reads, “We buy chicks”), making this ideal as a predictable text. Horning does not discuss chick anatomy or physiology, and no mention is made of selling or eating eggs or chickens; she also eschews naming both chicks and humans, almost giving this the feel of nonfiction. Readers wishing to learn more about this topic may appreciate Amy E. Sklansky’s Where Do Chicks Come From? (2005).

The book is small in dimension but has a lot of content. The book is concise with 20 different flowers to make as the title suggests, ranging from using specialist sugarcraft cutters to piping nozzles. There are diagrams for each step, which help visualise the instructions and make it easier to follow. In addition to making the flowers, there are display options for each flower type. The results are stunning if not a little intimidating, but by jumping straight in and practising, you can find that your results can be just as good.-Popular Crafts My first sugarcraft project was making a rose out of fondant icing, and this craft does lend itself to the fashioning of floral items.  Here is a whole book of different flowers and arrangements to create out of sugar to decorate cakes, tables and more. There is a recipe for royal icing in here, short and sweet (pardon the pun) but you will need to look elsewhere for recipes for other types of frosting such as gum paste.  You can buy them ready made of course, and this book gets instantly down the business of telling you exactly what you need to make the projects and then there are the projects themselves.  There are twenty of these of course, each one taking up two pages.  There are written instructions, a picture of the finished item attractively presented to inspire you, and best of all in my opinion a helpful page showing what the component parts look like before assembly.  This takes much of the mystery out of creating these beautiful flowers, and on the same page is a small inset photograph of a completed item, but not actually presented in as full a way as in the main picture.  I find this staged approach very helpful, and it is surprising how little space you need to lay out a project in this manner.  Choose from the inevitable roses, simple daisies, glorious bright gerbera, cheerful daffodils, elegant orchids, buds, leaves and even a butterfly to enhance your work.  Substitute the frostings for polymer clay and you extend the use of the book - one for the keeper shelf that shows how easy it really is to make very professional looking sugar flowers.-Myshelf.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Being a teenager when you happen to be a Shifter, when the universe is your playground, when you live with vampires or your world is under siege by demons is even more complicated. Or at least, that’s what Angela’s characters tell her; her own teenage years were fairly uneventful… and still, rather complicated at times, too. She grew up in France, the quiet, bookish, geeky older sister to an athletic younger brother, and started at fourteen to put down on paper the stories that were playing in her head. Her first story was a sci-fi short set in space... and was probably sufficiently inspired by Star Wars to trigger a lawsuit! Her next effort was a longer, also sci-fi story that earned her the first place in a novella contest in her high school. Her parents' stunned expressions upon receiving an invitation to attend the prize ceremony were interesting...although really, what did they think she was doing, typing on her electronic typewriter for hours every night? Switching to writing in English was a process, and for a time Angela focused on more adult stories, but her first loves have called her back for too long to ignore them any longer...

My family are now partially trained to accept overcooked food, slapdash housework, and the kids know to ask for pocket money when I'm writing. My books are the kind I want to read, mainly science fiction and paranormal, sometimes with a historical twist. All have a healthy dollop of 'adult themes' and occasional violence.

Christmas. EVER!” declares 11-year-old Sam Brattle. He has a swelling police record and no respect for anyone or anything. His mother left before his heart transplant at age 3 1/2. His friends are older delinquents. His father’s business is failing. On top of that, Nickel Bay Nick—the secret benefactor who leaves 45 $100 bills around his deteriorating town before Christmas—has disappeared. When Sam damages part of Herbert Wells’ house, he is blackmailed into service to help cover the repairs. The job isn’t what Sam expects because Herbert, whose leg is broken, reveals he is Nickel Bay Nick. To become Herbert’s “operative” before it’s too late, Sam has no choice but to listen, obey orders, and accept responsibility. The often-thankless execution of the distributions changes his perspective about friends, family, and community. With a genuine feel for adolescent pain and emotion, Pitchford offers a comical but forthright coming-of-age story that will make readers cheer for Sam.

About three months after penning my first words, the book was published. I have written six books since with another on the drawing board. This current edition of \"Deception\" has a few minor changes, but retains the original storyline.Unfortunately, the world lost Stephanie on February 9, 2013, at age 53.

I loved the book; it is absolutely what it is: a light adventure\nstory, which provides active recreation.The author writes very well; she has superb\nideas and good storytelling skills, and something, which is very important,\ngreat background knowledge. She researches what she would like to write about.\nI can hardly wait for more of her books to come.\" /Pupilla Reads Book Blog/\"I\nreally liked that the chapters - named after the Tarot cards - take place in\ndifferent times, revealing the past and the present almost in parallel, and\nthat the threads nicely converge at the end.

Desmond, who's filling in for the local doctor, is Scottish and charming and takes immediately to Sadie's colorful family. As far as everyone's concerned, he's the perfect summer fling. But when what starts as a casual and steamy interlude evolves into something more serious, Sadie and Des must decide whether they can open up again after heartbreak. Debuting romance novelist Brogan, who also has a historical romance coming out later this year, shows a real knack for creating believable yet quirky characters. Her contemporary romance has the usual misunderstandings and requisite happy ending, but the surprising emotional twists along the way make it a satisfying romp. --Aleksandra Walker", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She was a walking disaster in her formative years. At age eight she was hit by a car while riding her bike home and her head was cut open. Just before her ninth birthday she was running along the beach and landed on broken glass, and her foot was partially severed. The muscle had to be stitched back together, leaving some uncertainty about whether she'd walk again, and the doctor was so fed up with her screaming he told her if she didn't shut up he'd cut her foot off. She went to school with the doctor's son, and forever felt sorry for him.After her tenth birthday she fell down a waterfall and almost drowned. Her later adventures have included being in Seville when they found 4.5 tons of explosives set to blow up the Semana Santa parade and being in a car crash in the Sahara Desert. There is absolutely no explanation for how she's managed to stay alive as long as she has.

Just the act of writing it has been a personal accomplishment, submitting it to a publishing house is a personal goal and having it published would be a personal triumph. However, the story itself comes from my own personal struggles. So often we think that we are the only person going through something difficult - that our situation is worse than anyone else's. Of course that's not true, but it sure feels that way. I'm not so self-involved as to believe that mine is the only \"Secret Family\". That my mother was the only woman to sleep with and have children by a married man or that my father is the only man to have cheated on his wife and produce children with another woman. Not by any stretch of the imagination does this make me special. But the circumstances of a child's birth and upbringing do impact that child and therefore impacts society. My guess is that there are thousands born into secret families. This book represents just one prospective. It would be wonderful if by writing this book someone else struggling within a \"Secret Family\" (be it the mother, father, son or daughter) is helped. _ Arlene Fairley Marshall was born in Washington DC and raised along with her siblings in the city's Greenleaf Housing Projects. She attended DC Public Schools graduating from H.D. Woodson Senior High. To support her young son, Arlene entered the workforce immediately after high school. Her work career has largely included supervisory and management positions within the financial, insurance and tourism industries. Arlene and her husband, Kim, have three beautiful children and one granddaughter. They live in Washington, DC. Arlene accepted Jesus Christ as her Lord and Savior in 2004.

Lleva viviendo en Inglaterra más de 20 años. Es médico y ahora trabaja de psiquiatra forense (nada que ver con laboratorios y CSI y eso) en un hospital público en Sheffield, aunque también se licenció en Literatura Americana y obtuvo un Doctorado sobre las películas de David Mamet.  A Olga le ha gustado leer y escribir desde muy niña. Ha escrito en varios formatos y géneros: historias cortas, novelas, novelas cortas, e incluso obras de teatro, en Español, Catalán e Inglés.  Debido a estudios y trabajo nunca se ha dedicado de pleno al negocio de la escritura, pero después de un susto de salud (al final por suerte nada serio) decidió que era mejor no esperar más. ¡Carpe Diem! Ella siempre ha preferido la ficción y ha escrito en géneros diversos (crimen, saga familiar, paranormal, ciencia ficción, comedia...) y ahora mismo está preparando una serie de novelas juveniles en género fantasía/paranormal. Aparte de leer y escribir, le encanta el cine, el teatro (moderno, clásico, musicales...), ir al gimnasio donde prefiere las clases, pasear, el ganchillo, y los búhos. En cuanto a su escritura a lo que aspira es a no aburrir y a entretener. El primer libro que ha publicado (Octubre 2012) es 'El hombre que nunca existió' (también disponible en versión en inglés 'The Man Who Never Was'). Es una saga familiar, con mucho humor, inspirada por la novelas del género del Realismo Mágico, y donde hay un poco de todo, política, cine, deportes, amor, adulterio... En Diciembre 2012 publicó una serie de novelas cortas de momento sólo disponibles en inglés ('Escaping Psychiatry'es la serie y las novelas: 'Cannon Fodder', 'Teawork' y 'Memory'). La protagonista es una psiquiatra, Mary, que también es escritora y se ve envuelta en una serie de aventuras que ponen a prueba su profesionalidad y su estilo de vida. En Febrero 2013 publicó una novela corta juvenil 'Gemela Maldad' (también disponible en inglés, 'Twin Evils?'). La historia trata de dos gemelos que no se pueden ver, de amistad, romance y también tiene un toque de lo paranormal. En Junio 20013 publicó su primer historia puramente romántica: 'Click Me Happy! (Feliz al primer clic!) una novela corta donde el lector puede escoger entre tres finales, uno triste, uno neutral y uno feliz. La autora planea publicar la traducción de su serie Escaping Psychiatry como un solo libro en le futuro y nuevas aventuras de su protagonista Mary y...muchas otras cosas!", "related": [], "rank": 4171516, "title": "Click Me Happy!

As a writer she responds to emotions as an artist: sensations whirl\nin dizzying cartwheels; sight, sound, smell, touch and movement.Throughout an analogy is drawn between life and a marine voyage. Such a journey\nis never \"plain sailing\" as the boat and its captain must negotiate\nmany tides and whirlpools with kraken and goblins dwelling in their midst......Can this way of seeing / speaking / writing be learned or taught? I doubt it\ncan. Instead it can only be sensed by those who have been chosen, or who choose\nthemselves, to be vessels for its transmission... As Andrea is above and outside\ntraditional language with all its pedantic meanderings, she has a facility to\ncreate breath-taking neologisms. In this she is reminiscent of Nabokov.In her writing she mentions images, analogies and metaphors which have been\nimportant to others for different reasons, but which they never used, probably\nthrough laziness.A positive and optimistic peal sounds throughout her writing, Bright colours\nare indeed important for her. The prose is interspersed with poetic interludes.The fourth chaplet of this volume is dedicated to her poetry and is entitled\nThe Captain's Log, broken up into five broadly thematic sections. The border\nbetween prose and poetry may have been crossed, but there is no hiatus in the\nlanguage employed. Andrea continues to use words and images not simply for\neffect, but to express sincere feelings.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I've made lots of mistakes\nalong the way and watched other do the same. Sure, there were some successes\nbut, for the most part, I didn't like the results I was seeing for my time and\nefforts. There came a time when I was ready to give up on the whole thing. I\nwasn't seeing any significant return from the time and energy that was going\ninto using Twitter. It seemed like a colossal waste.Then\nsomething happened that began to turn my experience around. I decided to give\nit one more shot and began to experiment with different ways of using Twitter.\nI asked some of my Twitter connections about their approach to Tweeting. I read\nanything and everything I could find on how to make Twitter work - how to make\nit pay off. Over time, a new approach to using Twitter emerged. My purpose in writing\nthis book is to help you learn from my mistakes and to help you avoid them. But\nmore than that, I want to help you get real benefits out of your participation\nin one of the most useful social media platforms available.Twitter\nis one of the most powerful social media platforms. Or at least it can be. Most\npeople never come close to unlocking the incredible power that it offers. I will\nshow you how to break away from the crowd and join that tiny group of Twitter users\nwho are achieving truly amazing results. You can be stunningly successful - a\ncreative Twitter genius. And the real secret is that it's not rocket science.\nIt's just a matter of understanding how Twitter works and transforming the way\nyou use Twitter - adopting a dynamic, inventive and powerful approach.This\nbook will show you how to revolutionize your Twitter experience. It will show\nyou how to make meaningful changes to the way you currently use Twitter. The\nresults will be a metamorphosis from an unproductive experience to a genuinely\nimpressive systematic approach. You will begin to see a positive return on the\ntime and energy you spend. You are not the first to learn of this approach. I\nhave schooled others on what I have learned - passed around drafts of this\nbook. Here are some comments from those people: \"This book is a\nbrilliant and highly useful description of how to turn Twitter into an\nexcellent marketing and branding instrument. Every chapter has hints that\nhelped me improve the return on my efforts. I refer to the book constantly. It\nis a remarkable resource. I urge you to publish it.\" \"I couldn't believe\nhow badly I was at using Twitter until I read your book. But you went beyond\nshowing me how I was messing up; you showed me how to become a Twitter star. I\nam ever grateful to you for that.\" \"Reading this book\nand then applying your ideas has been an exhilarating experience. I thought\nthat I knew how to use Twitter but I realize that I was just an amateur. Now my\nTwitter accounts have become a major part of my branding and marketing efforts.\nThe results have been stunning.\" \"I can't thank you\nenough for this book. The skillful way you open opportunities for improvement\nhas made it easy to gain mastery. I now have a thriving, robust and systematic\napproach to using Twitter. It has opened exciting possibilities and a virtually\nlimitless range of possibilities.\" \"I must admit that,\nbefore I read your book, I had taken a very casual approach to Twitter and was\ngetting very little out of it. The book has revolutionized my approach. The\nchange is remarkable. Now I am a Twitter fan big time.\" \"Each chapter brought\nnew and powerful ideas. The book is easy to read - deceptively so given the\neye-opening tidbits that seem to flow one after another. I've always believed\nthat knowledge is power. This book has made me a more skillful and powerful\nTwitter user.\" \"This remarkable book\nhas helped me visualize an entirely new approach to using Twitter. Each chapter\nis full of solutions that increase my abilities to generate real benefits from\nTwitter. The language is strong and direct - easy to read and understand. Some\nof the nuggets are truly mind-blowing. Thank you for this unique and highly\nvaluable book.\" \"I never suspected\nhow powerful a 140 character message could be until I started applying the\nlessons in your book. Now I spend less time on Twitter and am getting benefits\ngalore. Thanks for a great book.\" \"I would never have\nbelieved it. I've gotten new business and new friends from Twitter. If you had told\nme a few months back that both would happen, I would have laughed in your face.\nYou showed me the way and I am forever grateful. Thanks, Doc.\" How to\nUse This Book You\nwill find useful nuggets in every chapter - at least this was my hope as I\nwrote this book. After you've read it all the way through, you might want to go\nback to individual chapters and select one or two strategies to try out. I\nsuspect that you will find the process of improving your Twitter experience will\ngo better that way rather than if you try them all out at once. Remember, you\nare working to change habits that may have grown over months or years. Like\nRome, a good Twitter presence is not built in a day. It takes developing good\nskills and then turning them into habits. And, as the saying goes, can take\nweeks before a new behavior becomes a habit.", "related": [], "rank": 2002425, "title": "Twitter Super-Charged", "author": "Earl R Smith II PhD", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She was raised in the country and has a love of rural life. When her brothers went to Vietnam, she and her husband Ken went to the Peace Corps following graduation from college. In West Africa, she taught English and African literature at a Post Secondary Teachers Training College in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana which borders the Ivory Coast. Students ranged in age from 18 to 45 years of age. Some were working to become certified after years of pupil teaching, while others wanted to gain entry into the university and were working on the ‘A’ level exams. During the vacation periods, she traveled over 16,000 miles overland in Central, East and Northern Africa by native transport, and witnessed the rapid change of governments from colonial occupation to independence. As a woman, she gained admittance into the households of young wives and mothers of all beliefs; she shared in their joy and their hardships, and listened as they poured out their dreams of a better future to her. Suzanne has returned to Africa many times, and been actively involved in the education of girls and vulnerable children, as well as building homes for those in need through work with VillageSteps, the charity founded by her family for the education of orphans and vulnerable children, especially girls,  and Global Village, the international branch of Habitat for Humanity. Suzanne is a mother, a grandmother, and an advocate for literacy and humanity in emerging countries as well as locally.  At home on her horse farm in Enumclaw, Washington, she writes, is active in the arts, and serves as Director of VillageSteps, the charity founded by her family.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He decided to communicate and to share his ideas, thoughts, feelings, and dreams with others through his first fiction book; Vicious Circles. It is a self-published book, comprised of a collection of short stories about people and their endless struggles with themselves, others, and life. He reflected his thorough analyses and deep thinking of people, situations and life, in his book; talents he has always mastered. He sprinkled the book with touches of imagination. Living in Egypt, he added flavors of the Orient culture to his book, yet the stories are about the human everywhere.

He was not educated at Goathurst, Enmore, Hemyock, or Wool primary schools, where he attended. At Wool Primary, he received frequent bashes to the head from the blackboard rubber as he sat at the back of the class; he has never been the same since, and hence this book. He made a valiant and final attempt at obtaining (for the seventh time running) that rather essential, yet elusive, qualification: O-level English language. He was trying every examination body in the land; normally, he just tried everybody. And despite occasional allegations to the contrary, for him, there was an alarming consistency in their marking. True to character, it was achieved at long last while he sat under a glazed roof in the Royal Horticultural Hall. Normally, he was just looking out of the window, but this time, he was completely under the table during a freak heat wave that cooked his noodle back then in June 1976. The next day, however, this turned out to be the last straw for his English tutor, who immediately disowned him, and not because of his noodled condition. Now a broken reed, he promptly went down the pub to drown his sorrows. Some thirty-five years later, by which time the author had sobered up, there was still to be no sign of his old English tutor, upon which he became frantic. The author pleaded with the heavens, demanding, \"Please send me a sign\" Having to admit finally (while at the same time soberly realizing) that, at long last, he was clearly on his own and wasn't going to hang around either. Subsequently, The Lulworth Triangle Trilogy, one of England's spot-on recollections of postwar pre-adolescent plots, was born; collections of some of the truest and daftest stories were drafted, some tall while others were short on acumen, but mainly short on acumen.

With the death of his step father and life falling apart, David became more desperate to lose himself. Soon, his reality was found in the hands of being a homeless alcoholic and drug addict. After several failed relationships and a short stay in jail, David found himself in a place of disparity. He knew his only way out was through professional help and his faith in Islam. With help David has begun a journey of self discovery. He found a way to release the demons and let his inner child develop through writing, art, photography, journaling, music, meditation and prayer.", "related": ["B007U7WMI4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
