It is surprising how well the authors manage to accomplish it. The goal of the book, stated in the 2nd paragraph is \"to teach anyone, amateurs or professionals, how to edit on any digital video editing system and achieve results.\" As a first primer -- not superficial but focused on the introductory basics, this book makes a very good attempt in achieving that goal. While I filled the margins with notes on what I thought was left out, or opinions I did not necessarily agree with, I was surprised at the concepts I could not stop thinking about when I finished this book. It will now have a prominent, handy place on my bookshelf -- a treatment that most professional editing books do not get. I know this will make a handy reference and will be re-read more than once.The book comes with a CD-ROM that is compatible with most editing systems, and offers step-by-step instructions using the source material when teaching basic concepts. The first chapter deals with basic concepts and defines editing, describes the hardware and software basics, and the concept of workflow. Oddly, the concept of offlining is not mentioned in describing workflows. This chapter describes why the term \"Digital Video Editing\" is used throughout the book instead of \"Nonlinear Editing\" (a distinction which I personally do not agree with) and offers six universal principles of \"digital video editing\" as part of the definition.The next chapter follows with the basics of today's digital video editing system and examines the GUI desktop design aspects. The authors do a very good job balancing the amount of content and detail for the beginner. Small things I was troubled about was that they left out a reference to SDTI connections while they included SDI and HD-SDI in their discussion on connectivity standards. They also left out pen & tablet when discussing the human interface tools, although I was pleased that they discussed the ergonomics as it related to left-handed editors. Overall, it was a complete and effective lesson.Chapter 3, \"Beginnings, Middles and Ends\" is my favorite chapter. Not only does it start with teaching editing, but it makes a very good introductory effort to communicate the aesthetic concepts involved with the craft of editing. It starts appropriately with the tradition of storytelling and goes on to discuss different editing workflows (bricklayer vs. sculptor), the concept of the montage, techniques for continuity editing, Pace and Rhythm, and offers \"Five Guidelines of Editing\". Then the book continues with a focus on polishing the program (trimming and audio -- Chapter 4) and goes on to Chapter 5 \"Styles and Workflows\" -- another excellent chapter.\"Styles and Workflows\" starts with the question \"What's Technique?\", goes on to a training component, and then analyzes different styles and workflows including Music Videos, Commercials (analyzing different types), Documentary and Nonfiction (scripted and non-scripted), and Fiction. I found myself going back and reading this chapter several times.The next chapter focused on media asset management, including ingesting, logging and both project and bin management. This is followed by another lesson in visual grammar (compositional issues, types of shots, point of view, etc.) and goes into aspect ratios and the creation of subclips. Chapter 8 discusses clip effects, color issues, rendering, and timeline effects. Chapter 9 continues by discussing graphics, titling and compositing including the various key types and DVE effects creation issues such as perspective and keyframing.Chapter 10, \"Getting It In and Out \"is the most technical chapter in the book, and the most uneven. It goes into various ways to set up a picture monitor and yet it never discusses a waveform monitor and uses the word vectorscope just once without explaining it. It does a good job with audio and defining codecs, and does an excellent job with EDLs and its evolution to the AAF metadata standard.The last chapter, Chapter 11, is an excellent cross-reference of editing terminology as used by the various manufacturers and also offers a keyboard shortcut cross reference. This could be worth the cost of the book for freelancers that need to go from system to system and for instructors that have students asking how to do something on their home editor.The book finishes off with a valuable set of appendixes. The first, is \"Films to Watch\" listing not only the films but scenes to watch for to learn editing techniques, including advanced editing, comedy editing, sound editing and documentary editing. It also lists Eddie Award nominees from 1934 to 2001. Appendix B is a list of \"Resources\" including magazines, books, and internet resources. (There is no mention of Bob Turner's THE CUT, so it is obviously an incomplete reference!) It ends with an extensive list of manufacturers with descriptions and contact information. Appendix C is a script for the CD-ROM exercise.There were small points I disagreed with and some sections that were not as strong as others, but overall I was amazed at not only how much was covered in a single book, but at how valuable the information was that was provided.With these reservations stated, I recommend this book. I can see it as a text source for video editing instructors, and for anyone that wants to get started in the craft of editing.

Golfer-turned-sportswriter-turned-detective Pete Hacker, when he's not immersed in earnest speculations about the metaphysics of golf (the book's title isn't as flippant as you think), manages to annoy the suspects into fistfights, attempted murder, and a final, plain-vanilla showdown.

But then, neither is her habit of escaping the confines of her family's castle for wild, solitary rides in the forest, nor her cool-headed, dagger-wielding rescue of a mild-mannered mystery man she finds being tortured by armed men during one of her prowls. After days alone on the run with the captive, who turns out to be the equally highborn Sir Michael St. Clair, Isobel agrees to marry him, both to avoid scandal and because the young knight promises a relationship whose almost 21st-century mutual respect comes close to crossing the border of believability. Fortunately, RITA Award–winning Scott has a flair for colorful, convincing characterization, bringing both protagonists to life in an appealing as well as credible way. The story line, which revolves around the legendary missing treasure of the Knights Templar, also rings true, thanks to a plethora of authentic historical and geographical details—plus deductions that fill in the blanks about this still unsolved puzzle with a logic few real-life detectives could fault.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The first-person narrative, which comprises some 11,000 lines, tells of the heroine's childhood and youth in Italy and England, her self-education in her father's hidden library, and her successful pursuit of a literary career. Initially resisting a marriage proposal by the philanthropist Romney Leigh, Aurora later surrenders her independence and weds her faithful suitor, whose own idealism has also since been tempered by experience. Aurora's career, Romney's social theories, and a melodramatic subplot concerning forced prostitution elicit the author's vivid observations on the importance of poetry, the individual's responsibility to society, and the victimization of women. Although it was a great popular success, Aurora Leigh was not admired by critics.   --The Merriam-Webster Encylopedia of Literature", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She argues that, if policymakers would only visit America's modern residential education facilities (or REFs, as orphanages are now called), they might be more supportive, or at least not so biased in favor of foster care. As Carr sees it, most states pass legislation favoring foster care because they believe they are offering homeless children the next best thing to the nuclear family, unaware that good foster families may be scarce. REFs, on the other hand, specialize in offering children the therapy and support they need after a lifetime of abuse and neglect. In her opening chapter, Carr introduces herself as a divorced mother with a troubled son, before segueing into a brief history of American orphanages. In subsequent chapters she visits a handful of REFs to admire their successes, which she interweaves with accounts of her own son's deepening problems. In fact, the last REF she visits, the Mercy Home in Chicago, becomes her son's home when she can no longer parent him herself.

Immediately out pours vignettes, complete down to the flavor of the ice cream.  Most of the events described in Whoppin  & Hollerin  take place in Jacksonville North Carolina in the 1950 s.  Through the author s recollections, the reader can almost see Jacksonville and its sole elementary school with the multi-pained windows, black chalk boards, and cloak rooms.  We can enter the local five and dime through the heavy doors and walk on wooden floors that creak with each step.  We can attend the church and participate in the Sunday services and then almost smell the aromas from the good things to eat at the  covered dish  social that followed.  Underlying the recollections is the sense of strong community ties, family warmth, and small town charm that no longer seems to exist in today s faster paced world.  Flash back of such ordinary things as piano lessons, family pets, kitchen tools, picnics, and early TV programs make this book a pleasant jaunt down memory lane for those who lived in this era.  For those born later, these tales provide a record of every day life before air conditioning, single party telephone lines, and two-wage earner families.  North Carolina residents and those familiar with Onslow County will love this book for the local history.  Everyone else will treasure this book both for the nostalgia and for the memories it will trigger in ones own mind. --Judy Jacobs, St, Joseph, MO", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And in my opinion, reading a book should be like taking a mini vacation, minus the expenses! The mark of a good book for me, was one where I was completely transported from my current location. Nothing is more exciting than actually getting into the mind of a character, and imagining yourself in their location, their era or just imagining that you were them, living their experiences. Good books are also impossible to put down! I remember as a child spending my summers holed up in my room reading (yes I was an introvert!) and hating when my mom called me for dinner or to go somewhere. It felt like I was being pulled away from a whole other life that; for those few brief pages I got to be a witness to. This is what I set out to recreate when I started writing my book, Mind Games.Mind Games is the brainchild of my very vivid daydreams! I've always been a dreamer at heart and the type of person who could turn a simple daydream into a soap opera quality story with complex plotlines and intense action. For the curious, it started as a very simple and random dream I had during the summer of  2008. Well, I thought the dream was fantastic and began to daydream about it, even when I was at work. Finally, in the fall of 2008 I decided to try my hand at writing a full length novel (as I was already writing articles and short pieces).Although the pace in Mind Games moves quickly, it is not your typical beach read. The story is fluid, constantly changing, and requires you to remember details that were mentioned much earlier on in the book. No one is as they appear, much like in real life. And why should they be? I enjoy simple reads, but I love a book that makes me say \"Oh my gosh...did that just happen?!\"Likewise, the situations that occur in this book could happen to anyone, making it a story with universal appeal. As an African American writer, I didn't want to create a story that could only appeal to a certain segment of people. We've all read books where the plot focuses more on the culture than the character's journey, which can alienate anyone reading that book that isn't part of that culture. I want anyone to read Mind Games and relate to Michelle, Kenji, Annellyse or Daniel (although I sincerely hope you don't relate to him!) without feeling like the character's racial background is a barrier.And finally, a good book evokes a reaction from its readers. If you find that you despise Kenji, find Annellyse annoying or actually empathize with Daniel, then I have done a good job, and written a meaningful story for the world to enjoy! Mind Games is the first in what I intend to be a series of stories all involving the lengths people will go to for love, against the backdrop of more \"intriguing\" lifestyles. So, kick back, relax and dabble your feet in a world of mayhem, intrigue and romance with the first book in my series: Mind Games!All the best,Dorian :)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I found it very refreshing to read an account of her life from Juana's point of view as I have always felt that she has been much maligned in the history books and was shut away probably because of her intellectual challenge to male authority rather than madness. Thank you very much, I shall certainly look out for any further books by you. --G. Grason<br /><br />Dear Linda, I sincerely believe this is an excellent work; a wonderful historical novel and historically accurate. Juana la Loca is a fascinating character and That Other Juana portrays her brilliantly: her life, her feelings, her people. The scene with the meeting of Juana, Charles, Leonor and Catalina is fantastic: I lived the scene as if I was there. You can be proud of your achievement. I can't wait for your next book about Juana's son, Charles V. --J. Sanmarti --J. SanmartiAs far as I am qualified to judge, That Other Juana, the sad story of Juana la Loca, has been impeccably researched for this novel, without that research weighing down the depiction of the characters or their reasons for behaving as they do. Juana herself comes over as a passionate, intelligent woman: headstrong and occasionally unable to foresee the consequences of her actions, but in no way the insane virago of tradition. Instead, Linda Carlino presents us with a sympathetic and plausible account of a great injustice, for Juana La Loca was betrayed in turn by her parents, her husband and her son. In this portrait of a shamefully neglected historical figure, That Other Juana is in the mould of Anya Seton s Katherine , and from me, there can be no higher praise. Catherine Bott (Presenter, the Early Music Show, BBC Radio 3) --Catherine Bott (Presenter, the Early Music Show, BBC Radio 3)Queen Juana I of Spain (Juana la Loca), the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella has always had a bad press, so it is refreshing to read a work that shows that the sister of Catherine of Aragon was far from a lunatic nonentity. A woman who was instrumental in creating the powerful Hapsburg houses of Spain and Austria, she defied family cruelty and betrayal to stay true to her own beliefs and principles. This is an historical novel which looks beyond the glamour of courts and crowns to the harsh realities of royal life - especially if you were a princess with a mind of your own. --J.

So i'm amazed at the forgiveness of God...I thank you for this though; it is much needed because...many keep things hidden in the closet because of our culture of shame and embarrassment and isolation.

Into this climate of hostility appears accomplished liar and thief Katie Armstrong, a runaway indentured servant. When two men observe the attractive young woman successfully plying her skills in the market, she has no choice but to do as each one bids in order to retain her precarious freedom. The ruthless Viscount Lowden forces Katie to spy on subversive colonial activity in hopes of learning the real identity of John Smith, a revolutionary leader who is constantly thwarting redcoat activities. Ethan Harding, a wealthy Tory sympathizer, forces Katie to spy for his side, and establishes her in elegant surroundings. Both men control Katie by threatening to return her to her sadistic master if she fails, but promise her freedom if she succeeds. Katie's dangerous existence becomes even more critical when she falls in love with Ethan--and discovers John Smith's true identity. Guhrke's (Breathless) cast of engaging characters, the well-researched historical background and a fast-paced plot provide a perfect context for the clever repartee and romantic tension between Katie and Ethan.

In 1818, orphaned Philip leaves Liverpool to find his uncle in New Orleans. Two years later, after living with a kindly couple and helping out in their chemist shop, he finds the man, who is a ship captain. After joining his uncle's crew, he realizes that the Captain is a slave trader who firmly believes that buying and selling human beings is part of the natural order of things. Philip, however, sees only brutality, especially after he is forced to brand a captured African. Before the ship ends its mission, illness and death have ravaged both the enslaved and the sailors. Torrey does a fine job of showing history through the eyes of a teenager who has to deal with something he knows is evil. The characterization is strong and believable, and Philip is a compelling hero. This gripping story provides readers not only with a vivid picture of a shameful past, but also with an understanding of its cruelty.—Jane G.

After four years of claiming that I was a \"writer,\" the only full-length work I'd written was a stage play I'd truly penned during college. It was then that quite by accident I stumbled upon the power of personal development and self-help. If I'd only had that knowledge when I first decided to become a writer, I would have avoided many of the mistakes that took up several years of my life.That is why I decided to create the essays that formSharpening the Pencil. Through my Build Creative Writing Ideas website, I've helped tens of thousands of visitors to become motivated, productive writers by making a few simple changes in their lives. To misquote a famous commercial, \"I'm not just the President for the motivational writing movement, I'm also a client.\"Since taking on the habits I laid out in my essays, I've written three books and I've almost completed my fourth. All of this in less than a year's time. Don't take this as a brag; take this as a challenge. Embrace some of the ideas and beliefs in this book and watch your writing life turn around.Regardless of what you do, start writing today because there is most definitely a story dying to get out.

She was born legless. No matter, they tell each other, she belongs to them, and they adore her. But when the child's savaged body is discovered buried in their garden, John immediately confesses to murder, becoming at once an object of scorn, a pariah in the small Welsh village of his birth. Only his stalwart family doctor, Tom Gordon, rallies round. Convinced of John's innocence, Tom is prepared to risk his reputation, his career, even his very life to prove it. But why, if John is innocent, has he confessed? For the noblest of reasons, Tom explains. In his first grief-stricken moments--not thinking clearly--John decided that Lucy, having found the child's deformity too much to bear, must have killed little Anne-Marie. Thus, his confession was meant to shift blame from the woman he loved to himself. Since the police have made it clear, however, that they consider the case solved, the presumed guilty party is jailed, and Tom turns sleuth. He soon discovers that strange things are going on in Caernarfon General's fertility clinic: it seems that human cloning has been dabbled in by staffers cavalier indeed about ethical behavior. And then suddenly another infant girl is in the headlines. Little Megan Griffiths is dead, and no one can find her corpse. Obviously Anne-Marie and Megan are connected somehow, argues Tom. Needless to say, he's right. Needless to say, rural Felinbach hates him for as a result. Needless to say, he cracks his case, wins his girl, and earns the heartfelt gratitude of John and Lucy.Plodding plotting, pedestrian prose: veteran British thriller writer McClure debuts inauspiciously here. --Copyright © 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

Sounds radical? Well, you're right on par! Golf enthusiast Michael Laughlin, whose day job is in the film business, reveals his proven, but completely radical strategies that average golfers can use to dramatically lower their score.In Radical Golf, Laughlin rethinks how the game of golf is traditionally played and shares his surprising and innovative ideas on how to play better golf. Unlike the usual technique-riddled golf books, Radical Golf offers practical and easy-to-use tips, and is written for the legion of average players who will never have the long, crunching power game of the professional.\"Golf is not a linear game,\" insists Laughlin, and \"Scoring is definitely not related to advancing the ball as far as possible on each shot.\"In this fun and accessible book, the radical golfer contends, for example, that players should approach the pin much like basketball players maneuver to shoot a basket by striving to shoot from their best, or \"sweet\" spot on the court. Laughlin also suggests that golf should be played as two separate games (of tee-to-green and putts) and that golfers should keep a separate scorecard for their putting game. Equally radical, Radical Golf calls for using a 2-iron for putts rather than the \"dreaded\" putter (the loft of the 2-iron matches the putter, \"Calamity Jane,\" of legendary golfer Bobby Jones).Hole by hole, sensible shot after sensible shot, Radical Golf simulates a round of golf with a pro to show how a radical golfer can stay within strokes of par play. Written in a witty and easy-to-understand style, with entertaining sidebars and line drawings, Radical Golf will revolutionize how golf is played both on and off the course. Most of all, Radical Golf will increase the enjoyment of playing this great and challenging game. Radical Golf is just the book that could become the bible of the weekend golfer.", "related": ["B007K1EFP8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Experiences recounted in this narrative are memorable for their dramatic, nearly cinematic quality. [Rugh’s] account succeeds at making visible the connection between global politics and daily existence at the local level.”“This work could easily be used in a number of different courses. It is rich with details about women’s lives and struggles, contains concrete examples of the ins and outs of government-sponsored development, and vividly paints a portrait of the Middle East through the eyes of a sympathetic outsider who came to understand so much more about her own culture because of her experiences there.”“A rich and absorbing read.”\"Simple Gestures, and indeed the rich life Andrea Rugh has made for herself, is based on her genuine interest in all that makes us different and all the many ways we are the same. Dr. Rugh's non-judgmental explanations of the cultural differences and similarities she has encountered allow her readers to come closer to understanding Middle Eastern cultural practices, including some that many Westerners find remote or alien, such as honor killings, the veil, and arranged marriages. In so doing she also helps Westerners to see their own cultural practices--which often go unexamined--in a new light. This is truly a remarkable book and thoroughly enjoyable read.”“Andrea Rugh has written a remarkably honest and insightful account of what it was like to be both a diplomat's wife and a professional anthropologist in the Muslim world.  Her avid interest in people and her respect for other cultures enabled her to build bridges and forge lasting friendships wherever she went.  One wishes that President Obama had read her chapters on Afghanistan before getting himself committed to a military strategy in that country.”“This wonderful memoir has the ring of authenticity that only someone who has lived and worked in the Middle East can provide. A trained anthropologist whose innate sensitivity has given her extraordinary access to the poor and powerful alike, Dr. Rugh has produced the rarest of all studies - the real thing.”“Dr. Rugh’s fast-paced and engaging narrative is a must read for anyone wanting reliable insight into Middle Eastern societies and how they have changed over time. Even though I’m a bit of an old hand myself when it comes to this part of the world, I couldn’t put the book down.”\"Within minutes of starting to readSimple Gestures, I was hooked. I wanted to travel everywhere Andrea Rugh had, meet everyone she did, and enjoy the small daily pleasures she brings to life so vividly. An outsider to the region, she nonetheless captures its humanity with great objectivity, sensitivity, and intelligence.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is my view that at best,  though they can be\nbrilliant gems, words are jewelry but never the  Jewel itself.\nNonetheless, I have found myself compelled to both write  and share, and\n  I hope you find some upliftment in these works.Some points:1.\n  The    pronoun \"He\" is used for poetic fluidity, but it is a neutral\nfor both   \"She\" and \"He\", as the God I know is indivisible. I share the\n  view that   it is in duality that people experience such differences\nuntil the   limited self is transcended.2. I make no claim as\nto whether or not God   is speaking through me; I believe such\nexperiences are  personal and mystical, and   as such, not available for\n dispute or  explanation.3. I have chosen to use a takhallus,\n  or pen  name, in part to honor that Eastern poetic tradition, and at\ntimes  have employed the well established technique of using the pen\nname as a  signatory. I also live a rather    private life and do not\nwish  to ask people to take on the interpretative   task to sort out why\n I  feel moved to publish, given the  other roles in   the world that\nare  mine to do, and so a pseudonym seems appropriate.Finally,\n   over the past several years, I have come to cherish the profound\nspiritual clarity that a friendship with Murshida Conner of Sufism\nReoriented has nurtured. Murshida reviewed all drafts and revisions for \"One Night's Haiku\"  and several important and\nsubtle improvements were made. For whatever touch of pure  sweetness her\n efforts imbued into this work, and for her assistance in general, I\nam most grateful.Wishing for you all the best on your unique and personal journey,Morgan Kalani MacLean", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Squires, a long-time Lawrence scholar, draws on previously unpublished letters from Frieda to craft a sensitive portrait of the dissimilar, individualistic and fiercely loyal lovers whose colorful renegade style could easily turn disagreeable (Frieda left her husband and three children to elope with Lawrence) and whose betrayals revealed the crushing insecurity that hid in each-partly revealed in Lady Chatterly's Lover, Lawrence's thinly-veiled account of the marriage. Friends (and hangers-on) were crucial to the couple, who were seldom alone; the book is graced with literary figures and exotic locales, as the couple's search for an earthly paradise (in part to relieve Lawrence's lifelong but unmentionable tuberculosis) takes them to exotic locales like Capri and Taos, New Mexico. Fans of the notorious novelist and early 20th century literature in general will find this account fresh and illuminating.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Before Falconer sets sail, Sir Humphrey Segrim, whose wife Falconer was accused of murdering in the previous book, asks the Oxford teacher to probe whether the Knights Templar were behind her murder. On reaching Paris, Falconer ends up investigating the suspicious death of a student who fell from the top of a cathedral as well as some cold cases involving the English royal family.

Sometimes they align well pre or post the masticating. Sometimes said words align humorously. Once they made someone cry. We don't know why. Most times the words get tossed in an electronic waste receptacle to be reused in a more conventional manor by someone who probably DID pay attention in seventh grade English and did learn about grammar, punctuation and run on sentences while Walter was listening to his ADHD and trying desperately to sit still. Walter used to spend a boatload of time in airplanes crossing the little pond between the North East of the new world and the old continent. Australian Shiraz fueled much of the word proliferation during that time until Walter switched to Cabernet Sauvignon. These days Walter does a little repetitive South to North travel path and dusts off some old words and tries to make sense of what ever nonsense he intended at the time. Most of his ramblings fall into silly children's books or old style Science Fiction. One SciFi book involves a fat lady and a Volvo. Walter's first Kindle offering involves a young girl that reminds him a bit of his daughter. There are three more books in the series (so far) and if Walter would stop obsessively reading web stuff about how to get his nonsense novel noticed and trying to convince people to cough up 2.99 American and instead got back to Cabernet and Microsoft Word he could release book two of the whole Corie Universe Feeder thingy. Book three takes a few odds turns and almost makes a point or two.

This background, when mixed with an early diet of Dr. Seuss, the reference section of the Oak Park Public Library, 1930s mystery stories and the Gothic novels of Victoria Holt, set her to writing her own stories at age 13. Later literary influences spilled into Donna's writing--Ambrose Bierce, Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft and Tim Powers--to give it more than a tinge of paranormal and the macabre. Her love of research led her to a Master's in Library Service, and her fascination with HTML led her to switch careers from academic librarian to web designer.

If you can comprehensively understand one degenerating factor like that you can easily tackle others easily with awareness. Having understood how to enter the dimension of divinity in this way, he encouraged others to do self-inquiry and be free from these degenerating factors which amount to the annihilation of mind and enter the dimension of no-mind which is the dimension of divinity.  He became enlightened in twenty minutes by doing self-inquiry during his death experience at the age of sixteen. It never happened to anybody before in the whole spiritual history of man kind. So he knows that self-inquiry is the direct method for self-realization and how in the fire of awareness ego mist evaporates and dissolves. He does not want to trouble the genuine truth seekers by advising other arduous spiritual disciplines.Chuang-Tzu said \"Easy is right, right is easy\". This applies to self-inquiry in which there is no need for self torture in the name of spiritual discipline.  In some methods the aspirant tries to get rid of ego by creating the opposites of degenerating factors which constitute the ego without comprehending its activity. This is a hypnotic trap of the mind. Beware of it. There is no fun of running away from these degenerating factors by cultivating their opposites, the more you try to run away from them in this way, they follow you like a ghost whatever you do. In self-inquiry we don't run away from these degenerating factors but we face them with awareness and understand them. We don't try to change them. When the light of awareness falls on them there is a change. The perception of awareness has its own action. When there are \"no\" degenerating factors there is \"no-mind\". So awareness brings the gestalt from mind to no-mind. Then the dimension of spontaneity which is the dimension of divinity opened to you.Thought is a progeny of ignorance and all religions are based on thought. So they can never transform your mind, in fact they create more hurdles for discovery of truth by their complicated rituals, and philosophies. The present status of human society is the evidence that religions failed to transform the man.Psychological insecurity starts the moment consciousness identifies with non-Self, the body-mind complex. That is why, Bhagawan gave importance to annihilation of \"I\" thought because when \"I\" thought identifies with body-mind complex a limited compound consciousness called \"ego\" is born.The ego wants to hide its psychological insecurity by belonging to some organized religion under the illusion that it provides psychological security. So religion is a psychological necessity for the ego to hide its ignorance.So there are many religions, some are predominantly ignorance based, some are fear based, some are greed based, some are logic based with combinations and permutations but all these are pseudo religions which perpetuate the ego rather than annihilating it. Ignorance based religions avoid the ultimate reality. Seeing the transiency of life and afraid of that fact, and to gain certainty at psychological level the people following such religion become madly stubborn and fanatic. They are intolerant to other religions and does not listen or read their scriptures. They feel theirs is the only real religion on earth. For an unbiased observer such religion looks stupid. It is a religion just in name. Unfortunately all of us are forcibly conditioned to this type of religion though the names vary. In the long run, belonging to such religion is harmful and destructive.In fear oriented religions, the subjectivity of the worshipper is projected neurotically on the image he worships. Because of fear, he leads a life which is not natural to him leading to too much repression and repression is not the way towards freedom. In this type of religion the devotee is always fearful of projected hell in the other world.  Greed oriented religions are based on concept that if you sacrifice the present life you will be rewarded in the heaven. It is ritualistic, formal, ambitious, desire oriented religion. The devotee is basically worldly. The other world is his projection to fulfill his desires, ambition, and power. Some invest their life in this type of religion with disastrous consequences.The religion of logic and calculation is theoretical, intellectual, scriptural, traditional, worldly, and materialistic. It is highly appealing to learned mob. They try to prove the concept of god through logic. In this type many parrots repeat the words of great people without any Self experience.All these four religions are egoistic religions and so thought based and so pseudo religions. Knowing all this Ramana Maharshi prescribed self-inquiry which is a scientific investigation into inner reality. Self-inquiry is the basis for real religions. Here, you have to travel \"alone\" on your own, because nobody can investigate your inner reality for you. In pseudo religions you are a part of mob participating  in the entertainment with them in the name of religion. Unless you go beyond the thought, unless you go beyond illusions which pseudo religions offer, you cannot discover the ultimate reality. Self-inquiry is a quantum leap from mind to no-mind, thought to thought-free   state of being, known to unknowable. So it is only for those who risk the known for unknowable, who want to know truth at any cost and in the process they wean away from responding from their ego. Their religiousness is interwoven with the existence and so these real religions are in tune with the existence.", "related": [], "rank": 1677528, "title": "Insights in self-inquiry (Self-inquiry.)", "author": "P.V.S.

When I became a widow intending not to ever remarry, my angels had other ideas. They knew my future much better than I could have even imagined. They sent my perfect mate from California to my door in Sedona, Arizona. But, then that’s another story. After we were married less than a year later, we began an odyssey across the western states. For the first time in my life, I started to write short stories and started a historical novel when staying a year in Montana. While living in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico I wrote a weekly inspiration column titled, Gods Rainbow for the newspaper. This November I participated in the NoNaWriMo writing event and decided to write about angels. This book is the result. I want to share the stories now.  I strongly believe that life can stay full, happy and exciting no matter what age or events you are experiencing. I am doing just that now at eighty-three years old. Remember to always ask your angels for assistance.

The poem invites you to remember all of the simple joys of your childhood running on green lawns and seeing the magic in nature.Many of the poems include elements of nature such as sky, grass, flowers, and trees and most of them talk about life being precious and to have hope and enjoy the beautiful world by appreciating it each and every day. Among the inspiring photos are images of the sunset over Lotus Temple in India, a beach in France, the countryside in Prague, a mountain in Spain, clouds in Poland and flowers in the Netherlands.In \"Light,\" Roy contemplates light being a flicker of hope, a true spirit, a lack of ignorance, or a thirst for knowledge.

In understanding age as also socially constructed, this book sheds much-needed light on the experiential and identity-related aspects of second language learning, while drawing attention to the centrality of factors such as social class, gender and ethnicity. It will appeal not only to second language researchers, but to all teacher educators and teachers interested in exploring the social dimensions of second language learning.John Gray, Institute of Education, UK", "related": [], "rank": 4639246, "title": "The Social Construction of Age: Adult Foreign Language Learners (Second Language Acquisition Book 63)", "author": "Patricia Andrew", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I really enjoyed the drawing by Nicola L. Robertson, who has managed to capture the mood of the story very well once again to make a very attractive book cover ... Children will grow fond of these recurring characters and the subtle interplay of the various worlds that Magnus inhabits ... A wonderful gift for any child.' -- Anna Phillips, New View.

It is written with sympathy and understanding but there is no talking down. The book is perfect for intelligent 10 year olds and is a creditable addition to the kelpies library. This is the third book in the Magnus Fin trilogy. It will be loved by existing fans and will no doubt bring Janis many more.' -- Lothian Life 'Inspired by life in the far north of Scotland, Magnus Fin and the Selkie Secret is a tale about one unusual boy's gripping adventure saving his family and the ocean from elements ... The gentle, imaginative prose of the story, especially the undersea world, carries you along and makes this a worthwhile read for kids and fanciful adults.' -- Vermont Country Sampler 'There is excitement and warmth in the stories and the strong message about celebrating differences between people means this is a very positive story and will attract children who love animals and enjoy being by the sea.' -- Sarah Mears, School Librarian 'The world of the selkie is delightfully imagined as a place of beauty and danger, community, and natural rhythms.

Introduced to Becky's fiance, Franz, and his father, Rudi, Eli recognizes the older man's voice as that of a former SS officer and mass murderer. Rudi's eventual trial in Israel lays on Franz and Becky the weight of their fathers' past sins--a burden that will never leave them, the novel's final section reveals.

The characters in the novel, many based upon the physical resemblances of actual persons, lived and breathed together within me for several years. I felt I could talk with them, and at times, longed to share in their joys and sorrows. I continued to write because I wanted to find out what happened to my characters. As a man who loves history, I present my work to the best of my ability after many travels and much research. Personal visits to Andersonville, several battlefields, numerous antebellum homes, and former plantation sites were valuable to me, being both inspring and rewarding. Based upon moral Christian beliefs and principles, while living in this great and wonderful land of opportunity, it is my utmost desire to share in a Hemingwayesque minimalist style the story of Kyzer.

Beginning with that commonly-faced conundrum of dead-end job security versus business independence,Smile tackles all those primary suspects that invoke hesitancy: I don't have enough money; I don't have the time for this; How do I know it's not a scam?

All rights reserved.Warm-ups\nGamesWarm-ups games are very important and beneficial for any\ndrama class - no matter what age:*They are fun and enjoyable.*They help the children get to know one another.*They help children focus on the drama class that follows\nthe warm-up.*They help the children limber-up.*They help shy children to get involved in the group.*They help children to use their imagination and creativity.*They promote trust among the children. Game: OrdersDifficulty rating:**Minimum number of participants:6Resources needed:Clear spaceInstructions:This warm-up game\n     helps children to learn how to work as a team. The leader tells everyone\n     to get into a straight line and not to make a sound or move their mouths\n     throughout the game; they can only communicate through the use of\n     non-verbal body language.When\n     the instructions have been given, the leader asks the group to get in a\n     straight line in some order, e.g. the leader can ask them to line-up from\n     the oldest to the youngest. If too many children were born in the same\n     month, they can progress to finding out what day they were born and\n     line-up in that order; or they can get in order according to height,\n     alphabetically by first names, or if any have the same first names, they can\n     get in line alphabetically by their surnames.They\n     have to complete the task communicating through non-verbal language such\n     as pointing, miming etc. When the line is completed the leader asks each\n     child to tell him/her their name or age. Then they can see if they managed\n     to communicate their message through non-verbal language. This can take\n     some time and a lot of concentration. It is also a good way for the leader\n     and the class to learn each other's names. Game: Crossing the\ncircleDifficulty rating:*Minimum number of participants: 6Resources needed:Clear spaceInstructions:The children stand\n     in a circle and the leader gives everyone a number from 1 to 3. Then the\n     leader tells all the 1s to exchange places by crossing the circle; and\n     then all the 2s to cross the circle and so on. When the children\n     understand what to do, the leader calls out different ways for them to\n     walk across the circle:Like a\n     toddlerLike a\n     frail old manLike a\n     lionLike a\n     mouseLike a\n     roller bladeLike a\n     ballerinaLike\n     Justin Timberlake/Justin BieberLike a\n     rock starLike a\n     princessLike\n     SupermanLike a\n     rally car Game: PrisonerDifficulty rating:*Minimum number of participants:4Resources needed:A large space,\n     chairsInstructions:Divide the group\n     into pairs. One is the prisoner and the other is the jailer. All the\n     prisoners sit in chairs in a circle while all the jailers stand behind\n     their prisoner with their backs to the chairs. The leader sits in the\n     circle with the prisoners, but does not have a jailer. When the leader shouts\n     a prisoner's name, they must change places with another prisoner as\n     quickly as possible. However, if the jailer turns around fast enough and\n     taps the prisoner on the shoulder, the prisoner is caught and can't move.\n     The leader then calls out someone else's name. This is an excellent\n     warm-up game, but it also helps with reflexes and listening skills.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

More than a collection of daily events in the life of one woman—a mother, wife, and hard worker—it is also the story of the “greatest generation” and of the city itself. The days pass in paragraphs, and church services are described, neighborhood activities noted, and a portrait of life in the WWII era emerges (entry for September 1, 1939: “Germany has invaded Poland. Went to the doctor. Good heart and lungs, but I need more iron in my blood.”).

Come in, pull up a chair, grab a glass of iced tea and let's chat.  I grew up in a small rural town in southeastern Oklahoma where our favorite entertainment on summer evenings was to sit outside under the stars and tell stories. When I went to bed at night, instead of a lullaby, I got a story. That could be due to the fact that everybody in my family has a singing voice like a bullfrog with laryngitis, but they sure could tell stories—ghost stories, funny stories, happy stories, scary stories.  For as long as I can remember I've been a storyteller. Thank goodness for computers so I can write down my stories. It's hard to make listeners sit still for the length of a book! Like my family's tales, my stories are funny, scary, dramatic, romantic, paranormal, magic.  Besides writing, my interests are reading, eating chocolate and riding my Harley.  Contact information is available on my website. I love to talk to readers! And writers. And riders. And computer programmers. And teachers. And gardeners. And dogs.

He developed an interest in the military at a young age, particularly with military aviation, likely spawned from watching the Blue Angels perform at a local air show. He spent much of his childhood assembling increasingly realistic airplanes and helicopters from his expansive collection of Lego bricks. He eventually arranged battles between opposing air forces, creating back-stories and plots in his head that he eventually had to write down to keep them all straight. This sparked two passions which he hopes will define his future career: designing and testing military aircraft and weapons systems, and writing military and espionage action/adventure fiction. He read novels by Alistair MacLean, Clive Cussler, Tom Clancy, Dale Brown and Michael Crichton, and developed his own writing style to imitate elements from each of his favorite authors. MacLean's deep, relatable characters; Cussler's globe-trotting adventure spirit and heroic protagonists; Clancy's attention to detail and unflinching approach to backroom political scenes; Brown's ripped-from-tomorrow's-headlines storylines and near-future look at military hardware; Crichton's intensely-paced plots and depth of research. He has also read countless books on military history, Middle East history, American history, current events, aircraft design and development, and reference guides on everything from handguns to Soviet experimental aircraft. Greg applied to several different engineering schools and applied to the Navy and Air Force ROTC programs to help pay for his tuition, but in 2004 he accepted a full-tuition scholarship offer from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. During his freshman year there he started writing his first book: \"Nuclear Hornet.\" In addition to his core Mechanical Engineering courses, he took several humanities courses on topics ranging from the History of the Middle East to Literature of Mass Violence to the History of Materialism. On his way to graduating in May 2009 with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering he spent three terms totaling one year as a co-op intern for several different companies, including a summer as a test engineer for the US Navy. Greg now lives in Orange, CA. He continues his career as a test engineer and is also a part-time associate with a financial planning company. He volunteers as a senior docent for a local air museum, and continues to develop his writing.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 4.2222, "rating_total": 38.0}

Froude turned to writing history, becoming one of the best known historians of his time for his History of England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Defeat of the Spanish Armada. Inspired by Thomas Carlyle, Froude's historical writings were often fiercely polemical, earning him a number of outspoken opponents. Froude continued to be controversial up until his death for his Life of Carlyle, which he published along with personal writings of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle.

Traveling alone, usually on horseback, often with no clear idea of where she will spend the night in what is mostly uninhabited wilderness, she covers over a thousand miles, most of it during the winter months. A well-educated woman who had known a comfortable life, she thinks nothing of herding cattle at a hard gallop, falling through ice, getting lost in snowstorms, and living in a cabin where the temperatures are well below zero and her ink freezes even as she writes. She befriends desperados and climbs 14,000 foot mountains, ready for any adventure that allows her to see the unparalleled beauty of nature. Her rare complaints have more to do with having to ride side-saddle while in town than with the conditions she faces. An awe-inspiring woman, she is also a talented writer who brings to life Colorado of more than one hundred years ago, when today's big cities were only a small collection of frame houses, and while and beautiful areas were still largely untouched. --Erica Bauermeister", "related": ["B00BLCKAE2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 3.6, "rating_total": 18.0}

Not every crisis is solved in 60 minutes, and not every patient\nis a medical mystery. So reading a memoir likeA Doctor's Odysseyis a\nrefreshing look at the inner workings of two different countries' medical\nsystems. Dr. Gregory\nSteinberg was born in France to American parents, and educated in Europe. He\nspent the first three years after graduating medical school working in general\nhospitals in England and Wales, before moving to New York City. There, he spent\nthe next 18 years working at St Luke's Roosevelt Hospital, a teaching affiliate of Columbia\nUniversity's College of Physicians and Surgeons.In his memoir, Steinberg provides a\nwonderful view of the differences between the English and American systems of\nmedicine, particularly useful during this political season with plenty of\ncharges of \"no European-style socialist medicine\" being thrown about. Steinberg\nis honest about his fears and feelings as he begins his career and his\ninteractions with other medical staff trying to make differences in people's\nlives and health. He writes in a humorous and personable style that is easy and\nenjoyable to read, and captures the personalities of his co-workers and\npatients. This is an excellent slice of life view of a concerned physician,\nworking his way up the ladder of a major hospital, while still focusing on\nbettering the lives of his patients. Sure it isn't St. Elsewhere, Grey's\nAnatomy, House or ER, but this is real, and that makes all the difference.Sacramento Book Review-----------------------------------------", "related": [], "rank": 1191006, "title": "A Doctor's Odyssey", "author": "Gregory Steinberg", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I spent my growing up summers in and around a small lake in northern Indiana where I developed a love of water and the outdoor life. I was and still am a part of a large, active, loving family. I enjoy all kinds of water activities. I am an avid fisherman, sailor, and water enthusiast, only giving up water skiing and competitive sailing when, in my mid-seventies, my failing balance forced me to. I raced small sailboats for more then fifty years including the fast and demanding Hobie 16. I raced sports cars for more than twenty years on many of the road courses in the country. During my racing, I had one spectacular accident where I flipped a Lotus 30, end-over-end at about 170 miles per hour and was virtually unscathed. (My fleeting claim to fame) I even raced power boats for a short time. I love music of many kinds and still sing in two choruses. My pride and joy is my family. With five fantastic and beautiful daughters and a son who is equally fantastic, an even dozen terrific grandchildren and two greats, I am supremely blessed. I have spent the last five years and as many more of the golden years as we can manage, with my marvelous and very dear lady, Daphne, who also boasts of six wonderful grown children, four ladies, two gentlemen, thirteen stupendous grandchildren and one great.” Professionally, I spent a varied career, first in research and production. Then, after being in business with my father for twenty years, I returned to engineering. I spent a year in the Philippines and several stints in Hawaii doing engineering consulting work for the US Navy and Air Force. After retiring from engineering work in 1999 I started writing and soon was pursuing writing full-time. Most recently, my non fiction book about the future of energy, Energy, Convenient Solutions, was released and is now available in bookstores. My first  novel, Blue Shift, was published in 2002 with sequels to follow. I live in St. Augustine, FL with Daphne Fox and Charlie, our friendly, furry, four legged child. We spend summers on Tippecanoe Lake in Northern Indiana, where I have spent more than 80 summers.

The information he provides paints an intriguing picture of the other side of reality most of us are unaware of consciously. Robert's background and own experiences add a great deal of believability to his work, the research behind it and the presentation as a whole. Before I read Robert's book I didn't know what soul contracts were all about. His research and details offered by the mediums he worked with gave me an entirely new perspective on the workings of the soul and how that drives our life experience. I had a personal breakthrough in my own awareness through my efforts to expand my intuition. This allowed me to open up to my guides in the spirit realm who have given me an entirely new life perspective and an endless source of divine information and guidance. Robert's work prepared me for this leap in perception. Thank you Robert for this wonderful achievement that your soul has chosen to share with the world. It has had a tremendous affect on my own awakening. --Pamela GehrigThe material Robert Schwartz covers is well organized and clearly presented, offering the viewer an entertaining and fascinating journey into the life of the soul. The information he provides paints an intriguing picture of the other side of reality most of us are unaware of consciously. Robert's background and own experiences add a great deal of believability to his work, the research behind it and the presentation as a whole. Before I read Robert's book I didn't know what soul contracts were all about. His research and details offered by the mediums he worked with gave me an entirely new perspective on the workings of the soul and how that drives our life experience. I had a personal breakthrough in my own awareness through my efforts to expand my intuition. This allowed me to open up to my guides in the spirit realm who have given me an entirely new life perspective and an endless source of divine information and guidance. Robert's work prepared me for this leap in perception. Thank you, Robert, for this wonderful achievement that your soul has chosen to share with the world.

She was born with cerebral palsy, but likes to think that is the least important aspect of her life. Nadia loves spending time with friends and family, has a never-ending craving for Mexican food and enjoys going to rock concerts. Writing has always been a passion for her and getting published has always been a dream. When asked what's most important to her about her writing, she says, \"I want to write things that matter, things that speak to people and make them listen. I hope that my writing can inspire others and maybe help save a life or two.\" What else does she have to say about herself? \"I don't really follow trends, or make much sense, and I'm usually off doing my own thing. All in all, I'm a little weird but people still tend to like me.\" You can usually find Nadia working on her blog. Her short story, \"The Saint and the Sinner\" has been published in Michigan Ave. Creative Arts Journal, as well as The Mirror News newspaper, in their \"Through the Looking Glass\" segment.", "related": ["B00C7AL3XO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Set in the town of Rock Island, Illinois, beginning in 1924, the Moore family story is told from the perspective of Lilly, a \"willful\" daughter living a more or less idyllic life in the hard-working but prosperous Moore household. As she grows up with her best friend and American Indian neighbor Lois, Lilly vacillates between a longing to see the world and a growing appreciation of the meaning of home, especially as she watches her beloved \"Aunt\" Maggie (a border taken in and employed by her family) and Uncle Pearl driven away by the Moore family's resistance to their romance. As she grows older, Lilly also slowly realizes the illicit and sometimes violent roots of the events and histories that she had taken for granted as a child, including Maggie's rise to wealth through the Prohibition-era bootleg trade; a murder that solidified her grandparents' uprooting from Pike County; and her own unsuspected origins...\"-Amazon Breakthrough Novel Awards", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While I love reading other authors of Menage romance, I have to admit I am often frustrated by the 'social aspects' in those books. It seems to me that a lot of menage romance features a female character who worries what her friends and family will think when they find out she's involved with two men at once, and this problem is quickly resolved when all of them tell her \"oh we knew all along and as long as you're happy we're happy!\" or \"I think it's great, lucky you!\" and she realizes that she was afraid for nothing.I find this pretty unrealistic, even though I tend to enjoy those books anyway, and I wanted to explore what might actually happy if someone, say, in my group of friends attempted this kind of relationship. How would people that I actually know react? How would the parents react? What issues would a strong threesome, committed to making their unusual relationship work, have to face once that decision was made?So here is the beginning of Jessica, Justin and Chris' struggles...

Hopelessly lost in the swamp, Olivia is unconscious by the time Noah finds her.What's a red-blooded hero to do but take her back home and nurse her back to health?BLUE MOON is the story of a disgraced heroine who finds freedom in forgiveness, of a reclusive hero who discovers how to stay and dare to love when running would be easier.Note: this is a re-issue of a classic \"old school\" style historical romance with explicit love scenes.

Electronics and computers fascinated him at an early age, so at the age of 12, he disassembled his first computer, studied the components and put it back together. It was an IBM PC and surprisingly it still worked afterwards. Though he maintained his focus on his primary passion, he dabbled with writing throughout the years. He won a blue ribbon in high school for a short story he submitted to the high school writing club as well as having poetry published in the high school Zephyr. Writing had to take a backseat to his career, however, which entailed working in the networking and computer consulting industry and eventually in the cable broadband field. Recently, his priorities changed and he is now writing full time. His first book was a how-to piece on podcasting, the art of broadcasting over the Internet with either audio only (as in radio) or audio/video (as in television). He currently has several ideas in the works that eventually will make their way to electronic paper. Donovan is happily married to a wonderful woman and has three fantastic children.", "related": ["B00697UYMW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hmmm, where do I start, well I was born Oct. 23, 1980, in Newark, Ohio, the same town which I still reside this very day. I have always had an over-active imagination ever since I was little, which no doubt led me down the path to be a fiction writer. My love for writing spawned at an early age. I remember absolutely loving when teachers would give us fiction writing assignments, especially when you were able to illustrate them. I read lots of fiction novels through my elementary and middle-school years, but it was not until my freshman year of high school that I decided to start writing my very first novel, “Kentucky Moon”. The very act of writing a novel was intoxicating to me. There is nothing quite like it. The characters, the settings, the heroes and the villains…the culmination of all the events you envisioned coming to life within your mind, creating an alternate reality that you feel with all five senses. And by the time the words “The End” are written upon the last page, you swear that you had lived through every breath of every character within. It is pure magic, and nothing can duplicate its enigmatic polarity upon the heart, mind, and soul.  And I must say, from the first day I laid pencil to paper on that very first book, I have been in love with novel writing ever since.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The ideas expressed in his stories about friendship, compassion, learning, respect, right-living and other subjects closely mirror those of the ancient Chinese thinkers. My purpose in writing this book has been to enable readers who have enjoyed Tolkien's marvellous works of fiction and who are familiar with his characters and settings to gain an idea of the essential notions of Taoist philosophy via Tolkien's world of Middle-earth.", "related": ["B008B649LG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The man her sister, Breanna, planned on marrying looks like any girl’s dream. But Breanna is missing, and Mary Ellen has reason to believe that Claybourne Honeycutt’s charming demeanor could conceal a criminal heart.            Clay Honeycutt knows the benefits of the early twentieth century picture-bride practice. Acquiring wives makes his workers responsible family men who are more productive in the sugarcane fields. Clay, however, has spent his life avoiding serious relationships with the many women who show interest in him—and his fortune. So when Mary Ellen arrives in Hawaii with her fantastic tale about him and her sister, he is on guard, viewing her as just another woman out to catch a husband—and he’s not taking the bait.            Will Clay and Mary Ellen find Breanna before she comes to harm? And will the picture of himself that Clay sees reflected in Mary Ellen’s eyes challenge him to become the man God wants him to be? “As the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.” Isaiah 62:5", "related": ["B00KG252XM"], "rank": 1655327, "title": "Picture Bride (Truly Yours Digital Editions)", "author": "Yvonne Lehman", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is perhaps best known as a designer of wallpaper and patterned fabrics.Born on his family's estate of Elm House in Walthamstow, he went to school at Marlborough College, but left in 1851 after a student rebellion there. He then went to Exeter College, Oxford after studying for his matriculation to the university. He became influenced by the work of art and social critic John Ruskin while there.\"(Quote from wikipedia.org)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Terry is remarkable simply for his un-remarkability.  He never went to an Ivy League university, but he did attend his local state college long enough to graduate. He was never a CEO of a major company, but he did serve as a team leader several times. He was even appointed as a supervisor for a few years. He was never the owner of a Fortune 500 company, but he did buy and operate a restaurant when he was nineteen years old. Where most people collect stamps for a hobby or go bowling for recreation or do something similar, Terry studies people and tries to discern why some succeed and others don’t. The result of that study is his book, The Million-Point Leader. Terry is married to the former Pamela Call. They have three children and six grandchildren … so far. Terry co-authored a book with his wife chronicling their experiences with the suicide of their first child, as well as a book of short humorous stories about their adventures when they left the Rocky Mountains and moved to the Central Plains. Neither book is formally published. Copies are made and given as gifts to family, friends, and those who may need an occasional shoulder to cry on or a laugh to lift their spirits.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This more relaxed environment was more to her liking, and she developed an appreciation of natural beauty, and a love of the outdoors. She joined the local swimming club in 1982, and is still competing with success. Her love of water extends to beaches, and she likes nothing more than swimming in the sea on a balmy day. Matriculating at barely eighteen years, she later studied Short Story Writing for four years, and Freelance Journalism for one year.  A regular contributor of Letter to the Editor of her local newspaper, Margaret is interested in conservation and history. She enjoys playing the piano and piano accordion, painting in watercolour, reading, and caring for her pets. Recently, she and her husband Ron have taken up rock and roll dancing, and especially like the music of the 1950's to 1980's. Her dancing experiences have inspired several stories in her earlier books. Margaret' s books are written in easy to understand English, and are free from highly offensive language. Readers from age 25 through to 93 years have expressed their enjoyment of her style. She is currently working on a book of philosophical thoughts which she expects to release later this year.", "related": [], "rank": 3170151, "title": "Reflections of Life and Love in Australia", "author": "Margaret Lynette Sharp", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For me, it arouses the desire to see what's also going to happen with Emma, not just the Viscount's son.Aderyn's wording is clean and descriptive which I like, because she gets to the point, but uses enough detail that you can clearly visualize what it is the character's are talking about as well as their setting. It's also obvious, in my opinion that either Aderyn knows a lot about museum book conserving or she did enough research on the subject to make sure you believe that Emma might actually be of that occupation. The translations of the entries are nicely worded to seem like it might be from the 16th century as well with more classical descriptions.", "related": ["B006T8G1F0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 22.0}

Creamy flesh more suited on a woman stretched smoothly along\n the young man's face.  Pouty lips in pale pink curved decadently as he\nopened his mouth slightly.  Features so blatantly aristocratic, yet soft\n and feminine as well formed his face.  He was tall and slim, not quite\nas tall as Stephan's six and a half feet, but not far off of it.  Lord\nAdam Bannister was exquisitely beautiful and in that moment, Stephan\nwanted him more than any other male he'd claimed.\"Your Grace?\" the young man asked softly as his gaze traveled over his\ndisheveled body.  Suddenly, Stephan was angered that he hadn't taken a\nmoment to change for his guest.  He no longer wanted to run the man off;\n he wanted to seduce him in to staying forever.Stephan ran a hand through his hair and pulled it off his shoulders as\nhe stepped into the room.  \"Lord Bannister, it is a pleasure to make\nyour acquaintance.  I apologize for my current state of undress, but I\nrushed down to meet you when I was told you were here.  I didn't want to\n leave you waiting.\"The young man glanced down Stephan's form and back up, his gaze locking\non Stephan's.  Stephan was fairly certain he saw desire there, but he\nwasn't positive.  Yet the hint was enough to make his xxxx swell.\"I would've waited, no doubt.  You shouldn't have rushed on my account,\" Lord Bannister said softly.\"I'm so very glad another Bannister will be taking ownership of Westmore\n once again.  It is a beautiful estate and needs the hand of a loving\nowner.\"  Stephan smiled.  Lord Bannister was a beautiful man and needed\nthe hand of a loving master, a master Stephan wanted to be.  \"I hear\ntell of an impending marriage?\"Stephan noted the slight grimace the man made.  \"Yes, in a month I shall\n wed Lady Amelia Vesta, and we will move into the estate.  I came ahead\nto inspect the renovations and make sure all was well for our arrival.\"An interesting pairing.  Stephan wondered how much the young lord knew\nabout his intended bride.  \"How long do you plan to stay?\"\"Until the wedding.\"A month.  He had a month to seduce the man into his bed and teach him\nthe ways of sexual torture. \"You'll have to come for supper sometime.

Joe has had no less than 56 jobs in 60 years, something of a record perhaps. A Job for Joe takes us into the roller-coaster ride of his attempts at a \"career\" or several. Hold on tight as Joe's coaster crawls its way to the top and then flings its readers into the most hair-raising journey of their lives. Far from being a slacker who cannot hold down a job, Joe juggles his way through a number of different jobs, each one with its own story and each one with the same eventual outcome. Readers, be prepared to be entertained in a seriously big way.A Job for Joe by Joe Paris Lee is one of the funniest and best books I have read in a long time. He is a seriously good writer, very funny and has an amazing way with words. I cannot remember ever having laughed so much at a book. This was one of those 'can't put down' books. I just wanted to see what scrapes he got into next and I wanted to see what the eventual outcome was. As well as being a humorous look at Joe's working life, it's also a lesson of sorts - well, several lessons actually. You will find yourself thinking hard in between picking yourself up off the floor from laughing. I would love to read more books from Joe, especially if they are as funny and thought-provoking as A Job for Joe.", "related": [], "rank": 3487604, "title": "A Job for Joe", "author": "Joe Paris Lee", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

An early interest in Physics, led me to minor in this subject, while also majoring in Psychology, and led to the peculiar experience of being caught between the exact nature of the Physical Sciences, and the more general, un-mathematical nature of human relations. This division of interests between the exact and the human side of things is what has led to my writing this novel IN A MIND'S EYE. The complexities of the human mind rival the complexity of the world of quantum physics, in its unpredictability, and sudden shifts in focus. The privilege of observing, and being a part of this makes life exciting, and full of the surprises, which enliven existence. IN A MIND'S EYE takes us on a trip inside the world of madness where things are not simple, accompanied by the complexity of the mind of the Psychoanalyst, also shifting in nature, and at times disconnected from his role as a respected professional. He at times flirts with death, in pursuit of the madman, and at times is beset with guilt about his enemy. Ludlow Fein is neither pure in thought and action, as is his threat, Simon Sawyer who fights the voices inside his head, and his rage at the memory of a betrayal many years ago.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Writing with Carter, who also collaborated with Ronnie Milsap and Ralph Emery on their books, Campbell recalls the grinding poverty he underwent as one of 12 children of an Arkansas sharecropper, the career he established playing backup for Frank Sinatra and Diana Ross, and his joining the Beach Boys at the height of their popularity, all before he made it on his own. As interesting as Campbell's story is, his book is disappointing, for his fundamentalism turns him to sermonizing against abortion, the banning of school prayer and the liberal press.

Along with that illustrious lineage, she was related to vaudeville performers, horse trainers, cowboys, entrepreneurs, teachers, and preachers. With such diversity surrounding her from childhood, she still managed to grow up and develop a deep love of books. It was only natural that along the way, she would write them too. The Survivors: The Time of Chaos is her first published book. More will undoubtedly follow. Today, after many incarnations along the way, Gia Scott lives in Mississippi with her husband, three dogs, and two cats in a funny little house surrounded by very big and gnarly trees. Having reached that age of privilege, she can often be found in her garden, wearing peculiar clothes and tending her plants. When she can talk her husband into it, they enjoy going for road trips, looking for the elusive town of New Hope. In between road trips and gardening, she manages to fit in an internet radio talk show called the Dawn of Shades, interviewing a variety of people, including other authors, and promoting causes dear to her heart. In addition to all of that, she does maintain blogs on general topics, cooking & food, and camping, emergency preparedness & outdoors activities. She also helps with content for websites.", "related": ["B007K09PVI"], "rank": 3418328, "title": "All Chocolate!

I had been out to conquer the world but instead met the man who was to become my lifelong companion. While he studied and did military service, I taught English and travelled.  But the settling down bug caught up with me. I returned to New Zealand, husband in tow, bought a house, started up a business in the fashion industry and had a baby.  For many years we worked, worried, renovated houses and homeschooled our son who now has a degree in architecture and is studying for a second degree in design, specialising in photography. We currently live in a house overlooking the Pacific Ocean and I work in real estate. In my free time, I am a photographer and food blogger. www.strandsofmylife.com  is a blog about my food journey towards great health. In my other free time, I write books. Writing is a channel for ideas and feelings which manifest themselves in words to create a story with the ability to make readers feel. I hope I manage to stir the emotions in readers which I experience while writing my novels. I now have eight published books.  I read all the time – anything from women’s fiction to thrillers. If I don’t have a book on the go, I feel bereft and centreless.

Immediately after leaving school her family moved again, this time to Marton in Powys where she met and married her first husband and moved to Bishops Castle in Shropshire where she lived for twenty five years and had two sons. In the mid 1980's Pam wrote a shortened version of The Seventh Rose after getting the inspiration from a cheap paperback that she bought from a jumble sale but after failing to get it published, she put it to one side and forgot about it. After her divorce in 1995 she moved back into Powys and lived near Welshpool for two years before meeting her second husband Andy and moved to Four Crosses, a small village on the Shropshire Welsh border where she has lived for the last nine years and it wasn't till Andy had a stroke in 2004 and she had to give up her working life to care for him, which had been spent mostly if factories and finally their joint mobility business that she dug out the 'Rose' again and almost totally rewrote it between her hobbies of writing poetry, reading romantic novels and autobiographies, tending her large garden or traveling round the UK or Europe in their motorhome when Andy is well enough. Pam says, 'If it wasn't for Andy giving me a back handed push the Rose would never have got into print, but it has and has given me many sleepless nights along the way, but I hope that the reader will think that the final arduous three years have been worth it'.", "related": [], "rank": 5118624, "title": "The Seventh Rose", "author": "pamela ingrey", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Most of us have read Mark Twain's stories about two young boys and their life in Hannibal, Missouri by the time we are in the sixth grade. What a rare treat it was for me to meet them again when I am old and gray. Andrew Joyce presented me with the chance of seeing two old friends and sharing their new lives.Redemption opens as Tom and Huck are joining the Civil War to fight for the South they so love. It doesn't take long for them to realize the battlefield is not where they want to be and so starts the adult adventures of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. They desert the army and head out West to see San Francisco. When they arrive, Tom makes plans to take a boat to China. Huck decides on wandering around until he finds a place to call home. Tom never makes it to China but does find a life for himself in Hawaii. Huck becomes a sheriff in several different towns before settling down in Redemption. Each have their own exciting activities before they once again meet up and share the life of the Wild West together, twelve years later.  Andrew Joyce is a genius in bringing two beloved characters back to life.  Redemption: The Further Adventures of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer is destined to be a five star top seller. I was thrilled to have the opportunity of reuniting with two well-loved characters from my youth.  I loved Tom and Huck then and I love them even more today as written about by the brilliant Andrew Joyce. All I can say is thank you, thank you, thank you for a few hours of wonderful reading.", "related": ["B00E2585XS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 25, "rating_average": 4.48, "rating_total": 112.0}

I also liked that though Rat was gay, it wasn't the main focus of the story, nor was that aspect of his character completely downplayed.\"\"In the end, as fascinating as The Wizard and the Rat is - with its elements of different races, ethereal beings, and fascinating world building - the greatest impression of this book is the characters. It is a fitting example of a fantasy fiction genre that ignores the tendency to impress based on a concept but focuses on fully fleshed characters where their relationships are excellently dealt with.\"\"The way Aaron masterfully developed Rat's character was just excellent, it was simply amazing to watch the boy's character evolution through his changing times and struggles. The book is a combination of contrasting characters that complement each other so perfectly to give a thrilling reading experience.\"Read the full reviews at readersfavorite.com/book-review/29685", "related": ["B00IZR0FI2"], "rank": 1284069, "title": "The Wizard and the Rat eBook", "author": "Aaron Engler", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Now, by popular request,Biggs on Finance, Economics, and the Stock Marketbrings together the best writing this legendary figure produced during his long tenure as Morgan Stanley’s Global Market Strategist.Between 1973 and 2003, Barton Biggs was a senior partner at financial giant Morgan Stanley. His weekly briefs to clients, made available to the general public for the first time in this book, were compilations of his investment research. They took the form of witty, intelligent, and often deeply philosophical letters. When it came to predicting the movements of markets, Biggs was oftenwayahead of the curve. He was famously “maximum bullish” on China as early as 1993. He foresaw the end of inflation in the 1980s and the collapse of the dot-com boom in the late 1990s. But Biggs had more than just keen market awareness. He had a unique brand of financial wisdom that makes his writings indispensible, even today.Thanks toBiggs on Finance, Economics, and the Stock Market, Barton Biggs’ timeless investor letters are finally collected and available to everyone. This book is a historical document, but it’s also a compendium of the insights of one of the world’s leading strategists. These insights are organized by topic for easy access. Mastering market history, economic policy, and globalization took Biggs a lifetime, and his clients were better off as a result. Thanks to this book, now anyone can learn from the master and put Biggs’ enduring strategies into practice.During the time he was partner there, Barton Biggs was one of Morgan Stanley’s brightest stars. Biggs always encouraged taking the long view on markets. That’s what made his forecasts so widely sought-after, and that’s what makes this book so essential for today’s investor. In Biggs on Finance, Economics, and the Stock Market, Biggs’ approach is available to all in the form of his renowned letters, organized by topic:Market history and cyclesEconomics and policyGlobal and emerging marketsCulture and travelBook reviews and recommendations", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I hope readers understand why the distress it may cause is necessary. Drug abuse in all its forms is disturbing, but particularly so when drugs are being given to an animal that can neither comprehend why nor object to it. So-called “trainers” abusing horses with drugs instead of doing their job of training becomes a truly heinous public threat when the potential devastating or even deadly extra effects of such laziness are considered.  Horses are by far the most drug-abused animals on the face of the earth and probably nowhere more so than in the U.S. Focally disturbing is that in certain disciplines of the horse world this misuse is so entrenched that it is viewed as \"just the way things are done,\" i.e. as a legitimate \"training\" method to attain the desired end result performance from the horse. Possibly the most twisted and pathetic aspect of all is that this is accomplished in quiet illegal conspiracy with a small segment of the veterinary profession. None of this “medical treatment” has anything to do with improving the health of horses,alleviating suffering, and certainly not protecting human health (all things veterinarians are sworn to do), much less is any legitimate “training” being accomplished.  I wrote this short story over a decade ago in an effort to spur the veterinary profession in my state to do something about this sorry situation. I had well over forty years of experience enjoying horses while riding, training, showing, driving, eventing, shoeing, competing in distance races, breeding and raising them, and working jobs where horses were required to complete the tasks. And I didn't use drugs to accomplish any of it. For years I had watched talented riders and trainers slowly abandoning the show ring because they were tired of competing against drugged animals and tired of seeing horses routinely silently brutalized by ruthless incompetents that made money and a name for themselves by cheating via pharmaceuticals. Some good people even abandoned the entire horse world, no longer willing to own or ride because they were so saddened by what was being done to horses by unskilled, uncaring, greedy people.  At the end of more than two years of effort within Pennsylvania's most prominent veterinary professional organization, I understood why I had only watched the problem grow worse throughout my lifetime. Specializing equine practitioners had been under-represented in this association for years. Most of the vets looked to those few specialists as the final authority on what was appropriate in equine practice.The reality of widespread tranquilizer abuse for both riding and handling horses was acknowledged, but then rationalized and excused by the organization's equine practitioners. One of them announced that he routinely tranq’d his young horses to ride them whenever he deemed it necessary, giving credibility to this dangerous and abusive practice with the other vets. At the same time this veterinarian was adamant that he had to supply “his people” (clients in his practice) with whatever prescription drugs they requested in order for them to run their businesses. He was adamant that no one interfere with this.  The primary effect of equine tranquilizers is to disrupt a horse's balance enough to cause him to want to stand still in order to avoid falling down. The second most dominant effect is to make the horse fairly non-responsive to pain and other stimuli in his surroundings, including the person handling him. Once this is understood it is obvious why asking a horse to move athletically carrying a rider after administering one of these substances is not only an act of stupidity on the part of the person giving it, but depending on the type of performance demanded, it can amount to barbaric cruelty for the horse. I doubled my efforts to fight this insanity after a college sophomore who rode for her university's equestrian team, called me to ask what was the appropriate dosage of Rompun to give to a hunter when ridden over fences.My suggestions to try to address the problem from the distribution side with more restrictive labeling were bullied aside. The desired end was/is preventing this malpractice from becoming the insurance liability issue that it should be.  None of this outrageous misuse of pharmaceuticals had ever been brought up much less challenged before within this veterinary association. All of them knew that dispensing tranquilizer and other prescription drugs for discretionary use by unlicensed individuals (i.e. clients that are “trainers” not veterinarians) was illegal under the Practice Act. But, sadly, most of them probably also knew that high-end equine practitioners would never be sanctioned by the State Veterinary Board for selling tranquilizers to high-powered trainers. In Pennsylvania, there is rarely any punishment when small business people choose to ignore the law if they are making money by breaking it, especially if their businesses serve the monied elite. This corrupt situation has been sustained by the legal powers for decades. It is only honest people who obey the law that are punished by it in PA. Law-abiding people can't compete fairly with the cheaters so law-abiding people go out of business in PA.  In the long run, the presiding professional association paid political lip service to the issue in public as they quietly used my story in private to tell transgressing practitioners how to avoid taking any responsibility for the problem. The state government officials that should have been intervening simply rubber stamped the professional organization’s lie that they had effectively dealt with the issue. And I would eventually learn that drug testing at horse shows was essentially more of the same—a pretense put on for the public to make it look like the sport is kept clean by monitoring that will catch and sanction offenders.  The most disheartening aspect of all is that this trend will continue to spread and expand as our society continues to buy into the delusion being fabricated by the unholy alliance between big pharma and regulatory government, sold by the “health” industry, that there is a pharmaceutical that will provide the \"safe and effective\" solution for virtually every problem. In this 21st century my medical training and years of real world experience mean nothing to a large block of society that has adopted “pop medicine” to replace legitimate healthcare. Instead of focusing on prevention and wellness, in both human and veterinary medicine doctors are expected to become drug suppliers in order to earn a living, selling the client whatever s/he wants based on their internet researched “diagnosis.” We’re cheating whole generations out of the chance to live their best life because so many people don’t even understand what true good health, both physical and emotional, is anymore—that it is NOT something that is created and maintained by way of constantly taking medication. I pray that this story will seed the storm we need to push back against this travesty. The future of this nation depends on it.  Discovering the exquisitely subtle and sensitive communication and bond that it is possible to have with a thousand plus pound animal with the strength of ten men was my path to finding and living my best life...my path to peace. Horses and riding gave me the skills and taught me what I needed to know to make it through a maze of health issues and life troubles (without chronic medication). Much of this is explored in my soon to be completed book, Watch Me Fly, that tells the life story of my stallion Wings. Watch Me Fly is ten-fold as uplifting as “Vanessa's W.R.A.T.H.” is disturbing. I hope my book can serve as the “antidote” for my necessarily disturbing short story. I hope my book can introduce a whole new generation to the idea of embracing life’s joys by facing life’s trials with truth, faith, determination, intelligence, humility and most of all real love.", "related": ["B00FZV3WW2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Danish born writer and artist based in London and Austria. He has previously written two books in Danish about two large European counter culture communities. One about Christiania in Denmark and one about the Austrian based Friedrichshof. His books investigates how innovative culture sometimes turns into ideology which in the end keep followers prisoners of their own imaginations. All his books are based on own experiences and participation. They show how enthusiasts get enchanted and captured by new promising cultural practices and discourses. In the end the participants often end up with upside-down fantasies about social reality and  self-identity. By means of historical studies and cultural sociology Børge Madsen tries to  reveal the mechanisms of this ideological deception and call for debate and self-reflection.", "related": [], "rank": 2275556, "title": "WHY YOGA?

The Coronado Islands, Long Beach Harbor, Catalina Island, and Lake Arrowhead, California were Patrick's playgrounds until he moved on to college at Portland, Oregon and the nearby salmon and steelhead rivers. Fishing was always a factor; he graduated in 1965 and for a time returned to Southern California to be near the tuna grounds south of San Diego and the expansive lakes behind the dams on the Colorado River. The Oregon coast and salmon rivers in the Pacific Northwest drew him back in 1971. Oregon was a stepping-stone to Alaska, and then the Middle East near the Red Sea, and for a time, Botswana, Africa and the Zambezi River. He returned to the Pacific Northwest in 1991. Patrick retired in 2006; he currently resides in Fort Myers, Florida. Patrick has four children, seven grandchildren, two great grandchildren, and Brandy and Duchess two yellow Labrador Retrievers.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
