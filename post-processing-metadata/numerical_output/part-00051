Kennedy, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, use the same techniques here for an oral biography of Tibet's famous spiritual leader. They begin by offering brief profiles of the 54 interviewees, ranging from Western Buddhist VIPs like Robert Thurman, Jeffrey Hopkins and Lama Surya Das (an American convert from Judaism) to Tibetan lamas and monks, including Venerable Lama Thubten Zoba Rinpoche and Lama Lobsang Thamcho Nyima. (Refreshingly, this volume doesn't pander to Hollywood celebrities; Richard Gere is the only famous entertainer interviewed, and he has some genuinely insightful things to say.) The authors arrange the interviewees' snippets thematically, beginning with the lama's basic appeal and personal character before moving through his life chronologically, starting with his recognition as the Dalai Lama at the age of three. (About this, Thurman makes the helpful analogy that it's not only that the lamas are expected to be child prodigies and \"little Mozarts,\" but also that they're believed to have \"already written a million symphonies in ten previous lives.\") The interviews then cover Chinese occupation and the exile to India, and the Dalai Lama's gradual rise to international fame. Some of the stories are humorous and light, while others are profoundly moving and personal. One of the great strengths of this book is that the interviewees are allowed to discuss the Tibetan political situation at some length, and to speculate on Tibet's evolving relationship with the Chinese government.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Nicole allowed GOD to turn even this situation around for her good, her husband s good, the good of their marriage and ultimately the many lives that will be blessed because she was transparent. Nicole, I am so proud of you for digging in deep and going to the CROSS with your questions, hurts and allowing GOD to refine NICOLE, the daughter HE CHOSE for such a time as this and with a message like this. May 'So He Cheated, Now What' deliver women from the destructive mindset that work against marriage and bless those that need to know they are not alone. May God continue to bless you because you are such a blessing to others. --Dr. Taffy Wagner, CEPF Money Talk Matters, LLC Author of Debt DilemmaFor such a time as this, God has blessed and poised you and your husband to be a testimony for so many couples who have gone through trials and tribulations, not only in their marriages, but even before saying, I do . Upon receiving your book, I grabbed a cup of coffee and started reading and literally did not stop until I had finished it completely! I remember shaking my head in agreement; I remember feeling your pain and saying, 'Thank you Jesus,' for what He had done for and with your husband. Last but surely not least, I remember saying how so many will be blessed with a real message of what couples deal with behind closed doors every single day, and how to let go and let God restore what He put together in the genesis of that relationship. As women, we have the tendency to allow our emotions to make the final decision. We allow our friends to tell us what to do with our spouses during a challenge, but some how those friends are never around when we want to share the beautiful times. Because of your steadfast and unwavering faith no matter how difficult it seemed to be, you held on to God's word; for that I say congratulations!

Accompanied by his friend Little and the blind explorer Baltinglass of Araby, Miles races the villains to the home of Nura, his mother's twin sister, who may know the secret of unlocking the Egg's power. The rousing pursuit sends the 12-year-old sailing on fantastic airships, trekking across desert sands, and even into the Realm of Angels, where he must defend himself against the Sleep Angels and the death sentence they have passed on him. The various plot threads and colorful characters fromThe Palace of Laughter(2006) andThe Tiger's Egg(2007, both HarperCollins) are pulled together for a grand, albeit chaotic, finish. The final chapters are especially hectic, as Berkeley races to make sure all the loose ends are tied up.

Grab a spatula and create the delicious, robust and spirited flavors of Santa Fe from your own kitchen!The Museum of New Mexico Foundation, a private nonprofit organization dedicated to the four museums and six historical state monuments that comprise the Museum of New Mexico, sought recipes from its membership, local chefs, artists and dignitaries to help create Santa Fe Kitchens.

She stared at her feet for a moment, thinking how far they had come from the sprawling pasturelands of her beloved Spanish Catalonia to this slushy trail in the New World. Weeks aboard a wave-tossed ship, days across the Texas prairie to Fort Belknap, miles along the Goodnight-Loving cattle trail toward Santa Fe…and for what?Sighing, she pulled her lace mantilla closer around her face, lifted her chin and walked on through the scrubby, wind-whipped trees. Her emerald hem swept across fallen, brown pine needles, the ruffle on her skirt rippling along behind.It had happened here, she thought, near this very place. A shiver of apprehension coursed through her as she looked in the twilight at the secluded forest. Five years earlier, her father—the powerful Don Alberto Matas—had been jerked from his buckboard wagon and shot.Isobel tightened her knotted fingers inside her muff and squeezed her eyes shut against the sting of tears. As a child, she had believed her father invincible.Forcing away the fear that haunted her—transforming it to the more comfortable heat of anger—she gritted her teeth. Why had the lawless Americans done nothing to find her father's murderer? Not only a murderer but a thief. The killer had stolen the packet of land-grant titles and jewels that had been her inheritance—the dowry to secure her marriage to Don Guillermo Pascal of Santa Fe.She inhaled a deep breath of crisp, pine-scented air. Five years had passed, yet the anger and betrayal still burned brightly in her heart. Despite the pain, the five years spent managing her father's vast estates in Spain had been good ones. She had overseen lands, governed workers and carved a faith that could not be shaken. And then she had traveled to America.Though at twenty-three she knew her hopes of marriage might appear dim, she still was betrothed to Don Guillermo. She would see to it that he married her. She would recover her stolen inheritance as well. Isobel Matas was not one to cower when faced with a challenge. Glancing behind, she scanned the scrub oak and twisted-pine woods. The small party of travelers who had accompanied her from Texas to New Mexico—an itinerant preacher, a missionary doctor and his family, a schoolteacher—rested from the journey. Their horses grazed, tethered a safe distance from the trail.The delay would put them in Lincoln Town after dark, too late for her to speak to the sheriff. She chose not to tarry and drink coffee. Instead she walked alone through the forest and thought about her father. If he hadn't come to the New Mexico Territory, he would still be alive, his golden hair shining in the sunlight, his deep laughter echoing over the rolling hills of Catalonia.Hoofbeats thudded across the damp snow. Her eyes darted toward the trail. Highwaymen? Banditos, like the men who had murdered her father?Alarm froze her breath. Her traveling companions were too far away to be of help, and she had left her pistol in her saddlebag. Clutching her mantilla at her throat, she melted into the shadows of a large juniper. Leaning against the rough trunk, she peered through the lace in the direction of the sound.\"Things are unhappy indeed in Lincoln Town, Noah.\" A young voice. English—not American.\"We're glad you're back from the trail. Mr. Chisum is wise to let you run his cattle. South Spring River Ranch profits under your management.\"Isobel counted three riders, one dapper in a brown tweed coat, the others roughly dressed, their faces obscured by hats and heavy beards. Livestock behind. More men at the rear.The man called Noah rode tall on his black horse. He wore a long coat of black leather and was massively built, with broad shoulders and lean, hardened legs. With skin the color of sunbaked adobe, his face was grim beneath the wide brim of his black felt hat. His blue eyes flashed back and forth…alert, missing nothing. This man—and not the dandy—knew a dangerous life.\"Do you suppose Mr. Chisum would take my side against Dolan?\" The young Englishman's voice held a note of hope. He could not be more than thirty years old.Noah shrugged. \"Chisum stays out of a fight until it reaches his own back door.\"\"Don't worry, Mr. Tunstall,\" the third rider put in. \"He'll come out of that jail fightin' mad against Dolan.\"\"I expect so—\" the Englishman began. A raucous squawk shattered the stillness in the canyon. Isobel stiffened.\"Turkeys.\" Noah Buchanan rose in his stirrups and searched the gathering dusk. \"How about it, boys? Let's bag one.\"\"Sure!\" The slender man slid his rifle from his saddle scabbard. \"Coming, Mr. Tunstall?\"\"No, thank you.\" The Englishman beckoned the three riders behind the packhorses. \"But go on—all of you. Perhaps Mrs. McSween will cook it for us when we get to Lincoln.\"The men set off toward the nearby ridge. Noah glanced to one side, and his eyes fell on Isobel. He frowned. Reining his horse, he let his companions ride on.\"What have you there, Buchanan?\" the Englishman cried out.The American looked at Isobel an instant longer, as if to confirm the strange apparition in the woods. \"Some kind of bird,\" he called back.She squared her shoulders and lifted her chin.Bird?She knew the man might do anything. Yet there was something gentle in his manner. Perhaps it was the way he held the reins…as if he were anartista. She had seen the hands of a poet and she felt sure this man's hands, though large and strong, held no malice.Glancing at her one more time, his eyes flashed with —what was it —warning? Then he flicked the reins and his horse vanished into the woods.Isobel licked her wind-parched lips. Looking up, she saw suddenly what the others had not. Forty or fifty armed horsemen guided their mounts down onto the trail from the ridge.\"Tunstall!\" A shout rang out from halfway up the slope. \"That you, Tunstall?\"The Englishman reined his horse. \"Who's there?\"\"Jesse Evans. I'm with Rattlesnake Jim Jackson and a posse Jimmie Dolan sent to round you up. He made us deputies.\" The riders advanced to within twenty yards of Tunstall, and Isobel calculated they would meet directly in front of the juniper tree.\"Come ahead, Tunstall,\" a second man commanded. The blue light of the setting sun coated his heavy jaw and wide nose. \"We ain't gonna hurt you.\"\"What is it you want, Jackson?\" Tunstall kept riding as the men facing him lifted their rifles so the stocks rested on their knees. Isobel tensed, willing the Englishman to draw his own weapon. Could he not see these men meant to harm him?Jackson urged his horse forward.\"Not yet,\" he muttered to Evans. \"Wait till he gets nearer.\"Isobel's mantilla buffeted her face, and she struggled to push it aside. She must warn the Englishman. But at that moment, his companions burst through the trees onto the trail.\"Take cover, Tunstall!\" Buchanan shouted. \"Head for the woods!\"\"Now!\"Jackson raised his rifle and fired. Tunstall jerked backward and dropped from his horse to the frozen ground.Evans dismounted and ran to where Tunstall lay face down. He pulled Tunstall's revolver from its holster and shot the fallen man in the back of the head. Then he turned the gun on the horse and pulled the trigger.Isobel swallowed in revulsion. She realized that Tunstall's friends had been too late to help him. They dispersed into the woods as the posse crowded forward, a mixture of triumph and horror written on their faces.\"With two empty chambers in Tunstall's gun,\" Evans crowed, \"the judge'll think he fired first. Let's round up the rest of his men and give 'em the same medicine!\"Trembling, Isobel watched Evans remount and ride away. Jackson and three others remained. They stretched out the Englishman's body and wrapped it in blankets. Chuckling, Jackson pillowed Tunstall's head on a folded overcoat. Then he laid the horse's head on the Englishman's hat.\"This is abominable,\" Isobel muttered, icy fear melting before crackling rage. And suddenly she saw her father—lying just as Tunstall now lay—murdered, with no one to defend him.As she stepped from behind the juniper, the wind caught her lace mantilla, tugged it from its comb and whipped it across the trail like a dancing butterfly. She caught her breath. Jackson glanced up and snatched it midair. Frowning, he spat, and stepped over Tunstall's body.\"Don't move,señorita.\" His voice dripped with contempt. \"Hey, fellers. Looks like we got us a Mexican.\"Isobel swallowed the last of her fear and remembered the raw wound of her father's death. A familiar anger flowed. If she must die, she would die bravely. Lifting her chin, she stepped onto the trail.\"You…\" She stopped before the men. Forcing herself to think in English, she spoke. \"I have seen your murder. I curse you &amdash;asesinos—assassins!\"\"You ain't seen nothing yet, honey.\" Jackson whisked his rifle to his shoulder. But before he could fire, a horse thundered across the trail. Its rider leaned down and swept Isobel from the path of a bullet.\"You're dead, you little Mexican!\" Jackson's voice rang out behind her. \"I swear I'll kill you!\"\"Keep your head down, lady.\" Noah rode through the trees, one arm around the woman's waist, the other controlling his horse. \"They got Tunstall, didn't they?\"\"The man called Rattlesnake killed him,\" she cried. \"Give me your rifle and horse. I shall make them pay.\"\"Whoa, now.\" Noah reined his horse to a halt beneath an overhanging sandstone ledge. As he lowered his bandanna, he looked the woman up and down.

Connelly affirms Madison's wisdom and in so doing gives us a better appreciation for it. (Donald R. Wolfensberger, Director of The Congress Project, The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Congress)In this outstanding book, William F. Connelly, Jr. reminds us that the Constitution continues to shape national politics. Drawing on his deep knowledge of the theory and practice of American government, he cogently explains that compromise and conflict are both part of our country's genetic code. James Madison Rules America is a timely treatment of a timeless topic. Full of unexpected insights and subtle wisdom, it asks us to look beyond Internet headlines and intellectual fads to the things that really matter: the structures that the Founders put in place more than two centuries ago. This book is a remarkable intellectual achievement, handling profound issues with clarity and erudition. It would be a valuable addition to courses on Congress and American national politics..(John J. Pitney Jr., Roy P. Crocker Professor of American Politics, Claremont McKenna College)Mandatory reading for all involved or interested in politics today so they will understand the foundations of our system.(Jerry Climer, The Congressional Institute, Inc.)No author has done more than William Connelly to show how the Constitution guides, structures, and influences the hard realities of Congressional politics. Past and present, theory and practice, and law and politics are joined in this fine volume to reveal the strategies and dilemmas that have confronted congressional party leaders from James Madison and Henry Clay to Newt Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi. (James W. Ceaser, University of Virginia)In this lively and provocative interpretation of James Madison’s political thought, Bill Connelly brings a fresh understanding to U.S. Congress today. Congress, he argues, is not broken. Despite its real and apparent imperfections, Madisonian pluralism shapes congressional politics and always has.James Madison Rules Americalowers the fever-pitch criticism of Congress and applies a skeptical intelligence to popular ideas for reform. Connelly shows that much of the current hand-wringing about Congress may stem from too little appreciation of Madison’s constitutional handiwork and of politics in general. (Catherine E. Rudder, George Mason University)InJames Madison Rules America, William F. Connelly explains the interplay of political and constitutional forces that shape politics and public policy making in the United States. Connelly finds that the underlying constitutional structure frames the possibilities our political process may contemplate. Viewed through the lens of constitutional theory, the American political system manages to channel partisan forces into public policy outcomes. Every American should read this book.

This book is a remarkable intellectual achievement, handling profound issues with clarity and erudition. It would be a valuable addition to courses on Congress and American national politics. (John J. Pitney Jr., Roy P. Crocker Professor of American Politics, Claremont McKenna College)We are hearing a great deal about the role of the Constitution and the significance of congressional parties. InJames Madison Rules America, William F. Connelly Jr. explains their connection. Drawing on his vast knowledge of contemporary politics and the Founding era, Connelly shows how Madison’s handiwork shapes congressional behavior. Under the separation of powers, he argues persuasively, neither party is ever simply the “government” or the 'opposition'.... [A] lucidly written and thoroughly documented analysis.(National Review, July 2010)Connelly offers an important new contribution to the study of congressional partisanship. The author, a well-regarded scholar of Congress, political parties, and interest groups, argues that much of the prevailing scholarship and public opinion about Congress as an institution is misinformed because it has not been properly grounded in an understanding of how the Constitution shapes the behavior of the institution. Relying on an extensive array of sources ranging from personal interviews to political theory, Connelly challenges a great deal of the conventional wisdom about Congress. Specifically, he takes exception to the belief that Congress today is defined more by dysfunction than competence and that the cause of this dysfunction stems principally from behavioralsources—namely, the self-interest of elected officials. He counters this perception by arguing that contemporary congressional politics is shaped by constitutional design and that partisanship and conflict are simply by-products of the constitutional system. The choices made by congressional leaders to pursue compromise or conflict, partisanship or pluralism, are influenced by Madisonian design and do not represent a defect of politics that requires remedy. Summing Up: Highly recommended. (CHOICE)The book is an important work of scholarship on Congress, the separation of powers, and American political parties. Connelly carefully weaves virtually all major works on Congress into his analysis and thoroughly explains to the reader why James Madison still rules America.", "related": ["B007O1143A"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the summer of 2008, while attending a convention of the International Federation of Chopin Societies in Nohant, France, Dr. Lagerberg joined the controversial debate whether to proceed with the DNA analysis of Chopin's long-preserved heart. A month earlier, a recognized expert in the field of cystic fibrosis research, Professor Wojciech Cichy, proposed to open the sealed glass container in Warsaw containing Chopin's heart. Planning to use a novel scientific approach, Cichy wished to prove that the esteemed Polish composer died from the genetic disease of cystic fibrosis, as opposed to the widely accepted belief that Chopin succumbed to the ravages of chronic tuberculosis. Being immediately interested and then later intensely involved in the international controversy following Cichy's audacious proposal, Dr. Lagerberg reserached the many medical and historical details of this subject in Poland, France, and the United States. Dr. Lagerberg is now collaborating with Professor Cichy and others of his team of investigators as they plan a second attempt in 2011 to gain access to Chopin's heart. No one other than Dr. Lagerberg has been able to gain access to all of the principals in this interesting investigation or tell the story with as much medical knowledge and familiarity with Chopin.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He began training for ministry but turned instead to teaching, law study, and increasingly literary work and studying German literature. His first considerable essay was published in 1822. He continued to write on and translate German literature during the following six years, and published a novel, Sartor Resartus, in 1833-4. In 1831 Carlyle met J. S. Mill, who introduced him to Emerson and interested him in the French Revolution, leading to his history of it, completed in 1837. From 1837 to 1840 he undertook several important lecture series, in which he developed his individualist desire to place a satisfactory model of the hero before his contemporaries. His reputation was firmly established by the mid-1840s. He proceeded to spend an immense amount of work on his history of Frederick the Great. In 1865 he was invited to become Rector of the University of Edinburgh, but published little of significance thereafter. Carlyle died in 1881. Ralph Waldo Emerson was born in Boston in 1803, the son of a Unitarian minister. He was himself ordained in 1829 but found he could not accept Unitarianist orthodoxy and in 1832, shortly after the death of his first wife, resigned his ministry and left for Europe, where he formed a lifelong friendship with Carlyle. Returning to Boston, Emerson turned from preaching to lecturing. In 1835 he remarried and settled in Concord, Massachusetts. He published his first book, Nature, in 1836, and was soon recognised as a revolutionary philosopher. In 1838 he became excluded from Harvard for claiming the priority of individual spiritual experience over any church. In 1842 he became editor of the Transcendentalist quarterly The Dial, and volumes of essays in 1841 and 1844 secured him European reputation. He also became known as a poet through two collections. In the 1850s he became an ardent supporter of the abolition of slavery. In 1866 Harvard conferred an honorary Doctorate of Law upon him. Emerson died in 1882.", "related": ["B0093M15D2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She hesitated only for a second before saying, \"Why don't you write a book about women who buy men from a jail?\" That's when the bulb went off in my head, and I wrote a summary of what \"Wards of the Women\" would entail that same evening.Creating the characters for this book was a joy.

He read Physics and Astrophysics followed by another degree in Digital Systems while trying to be an astronaut, but unfortunately there was no astronaut program in the UK. His favourite story is split between Lord of the Rings, Nine Princes in Amber and Thomas Covenant. He really cannot decide between them. KDL is still waiting to be an astronaut, and several careers later, somewhere in the darkness a story took form, a tiny piece of the truth, an echo that grabbed him by the throat. He started to write what he knew to be a six part series. In it he wanted to offer a highly conceptual image of an imperfect world and universe, while trying to make sense of it through a connection to life. The initial story is for YA, but each subsequent one is going to mature and age with the protagonists. The first novel was self-published late 2005, The Changeling. The story is about a boy, Peter Badger, who goes in search of his missing father in a land where he can become his namesake, but that is just the start of his problems. In this new world, where everything undergoes a dark transformation after the sun goes down, where your enemy has even greater powers than knowledge, where demons are trapped by their broken sources, he encounters Michelle Hawk and Paul Otter, the kind of friends who he would strangle while they are trying to save him. The second in the series, The Eternal Well, is a very dramatic rescue of a soul that could destroy the whole of existence. In this, our Changelings are asked to enter the Realm of the Dead. Released in kindle format December 2011. Currently, KDL is working on the third in the Changeling Saga. The whole series is exploring materialism against spirituality, human nature against the animal spirit, demon against mortal, while wrapping it all into a high octane fantasy adventure.", "related": [], "rank": 4381716, "title": "The Changeling (The Changeling Saga Book 1) eBook", "author": "K D Lathar", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This collection of stories is the exploration of that philosophy, philosophy of the Soul's Road. Thirteen writers telling thirteen unique stories of what it's like to travel that road. Stories that explore what it is to feel love, to be man or woman or something beyond, of the loss of family, the loss of innocence, or the loss of society as a whole. From fiction to memoir to comedic irony, these stories travel that road with grace and power and most importantly, with truth. I am so proud to be a part of this project, to have seen each story grow. I am proud too at how deeply these stories sing to the reader, how they have become a whole, together. Soul's Road is more than a simple collection of stories; it is a journey inside, through the heart, the mind, the body and, of course the soul itself. I will always remember that flash of feathers, the feeling of my mother's hand on my own. I know now that the ducks had their road to travel and that we have ours. I invite you, dear reader, to walk a while on this road, to listen to these stories and find those truths that speak to your heart. We all have our road and I hope you'll enjoy walking ours.List of Contributors to Soul's Road: A Fiction CollectionJohn SchimmelNatasha OliverIsla McKettaKaren K.

His work is often concerned with the clash between the modern and the traditional, often juxtaposing drastically different stylistic elements: it exhibits gritty modern imagery in traditional forms, for example. His book Peintres Cubistes (1913) expounded on the theory behind cubism and analyzed the work of important cubists. His play Les Mamelles de Tirésias, which was made into an opera by Francis Poulenc in 1947, is one of the earliest examples of Surrealism -- a word he is credited for coining.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As Lisa Majaj points out in her insightful introduction, this is no simplistic account of an Islamic woman rescued by the West. Nadia's family is both oppressive and supportive. Forced into an arranged marriage as a young teenager, she feels little for her husband but loves her in-laws more than her own selfish parents. Later, she is torn between passionate love for another man and loyalty to her children, and she struggles for education and a career. Most moving is the account of how her privileged family is suddenly uprooted by the Jewish takeover of their home in Haifa. Part of the Foremother Legacies series, this holds you less as literary memoir than as a candid autobiography that opens up our history.Hazel Rochman", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Then I purchased the Phonics Workbook from the same publisher and found that is was a wonderful help, I would even say a Godsend. By showing him the lesson in Alpha-Phonics first, then showing him some extra practice work on the same lesson in the Workbook, he really began to take off! We eventually finished both books, the Workbook and Alpha-Phonics. He is now an above grade level reader. I would gladly recommend the Workbook to anyone starting to teach with Alpha-Phonics. --Mrs. Gary Peeler, Carmichael CA. 2009", "related": ["B00GVM8SKK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I tried to write a story every day and then, in the evening, would read them out to my wife when she phoned up to see how I was getting on.Anyway, I'd like to tell you about the stories themselves.A good educationis a period piece and it draws on my own direct personal experience of bullying in an English public school. With its dark and sinister passageways, constant bullying, and sadistic teachers, such a place would not be somewhere I'd ever send a child (although I recognise that times have now changed).Hobson's choicecentres around my lifelong interest in how seemingly small and insignificant events can become major forks in our passage through life. It's a chilling and dark story which I personally consider to be among the strongest that I've ever written. I hope my readers find it thought-provoking.I wroteDear Johnas a cautionary account aimed at those who are busy making plans that rely upon the good intentions of others. No-one, no matter how close they are to you, will ever have exactly the same agenda as you. So, be warned.It is said the present is the key to the past and the future and I've come to subscribe to this point of view. I firmly believe that our emotions, desires and propensity to commit acts of both good and evil, are largely unchanged in tens of thousands of years, and if our species survives that long, will be the same as they are now thousands of years hence. The technology may change but the end user and all their imperfections will not.My two Sci-Fi stories -Lucky charmandThe return of the Centaurus- both reflect this reasoning and I have steered away from describing fantastical gadgetry in favour of a study of how humans might cope in the situations that the technology gives rise to.Although a staunch scientist and confirmed non-believer in such things, I do love a good ghost story, and I remember the eager anticipation I had for the BBC's 'Ghost story for Christmas'. This was always a production based on one of the eerie tales written by the talented M R James.An enduring smile, The racing line, Seeing is believingas well asA good educationall have a supernatural air about them.Spaghetti westerns were the success story of my childhood and Sergio Leone created some vile 'bad guys' who you knew would meet suitably unpleasant ends. The bad guy being the one with a black hat (in a metaphorical sense if not a literal one) has since been done to death and something more subtle is required for the modern reader. I've derived great pleasure from dreaming up some bad guys of my own and then finding alternative endings to the 'grand finale shoot out'. BothEvery one a winnerandMoving updeal with greed and what it can make people do, whileLast orders, Seeing is believingandA day at the beachlook at other dark facets of the human psyche.The logical consequences of the lynch mobs which gather outside some high profile criminal trials has always troubled me. The \"Hang 'em high\" brigade usually want to string up the defendant long before the trial has got past the preamble stage but the whole idea of a trial is to establish guilt - something which explains the 'not guilty' option for juries. Punishing the wrong person (as has occasionally been known to happen) is not just wrong in itself, it also sends a dangerous message to the real perpetrator. This is why the making of snap and ill-informed judgements bothers me.To show what I mean,The watcherand the much more gentle,Lostare warnings to those who would be hasty in forming such opinions.No walk in the parkis another chip off this block although coming at the idea from a very different angle.On a different note,The benchcould be a stage play with the whole story being centred around an ordinary park bench. It's an idea I've been throwing around in my head for sometime now and it harks back to the way in which I perceive fate as being a tangled web of probability lines.So, those are my tales and I hope that you derive as much pleasure from reading them as I have done from writing them.

It is still a source of his desire to wander.  Various summer jobs included sitting on a horse while cattle grazed on grass alongside the road, working as a grunt in an oil refinery, being a stock boy, and he even sold Christmas trees for a few weeks one winter.   Most of his energy went into college degrees in physics, computer science and electrical engineering, which landed him a job at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.  He’s been a computer programmer, a manager in computer science, information science, and cyber security, and a cynic of project management.  A lot of his technical writing involved the management of people and projects. That gave him the money and vacation time to learn how to build houses, to backpack in the Rocky Mountain high country, to climb mountains, to snowshoe and cross-country ski, to raft the rivers of the Southwest, to support Christian wilderness programs, and to see the excitement in his sons’ eyes as they enjoyed the adventures with him.  He is still given to wandering. He wishes he was a magician, but he’ll settle for writing mysteries that feature good kids, good families, great places, rich history, and clever plots.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Growing up in pre-WWII England, he watched a performer easily put his volunteer subjects under a hypnotic spell and induced each of them to do strange and outlandish things. How, the young Roy wondered, could a smiling, personable stranger cause well-dressed, educated, competent adults to forget their names? Puzzled by the mysterious power the hypnotist had exercised over his subjects, Roy distinctly remembers pondering the question: “Why can’t hypnotism be used to make people act sensibly, rather than foolishly?” Inspired by the idea of harnessing this baffling force for good, he later pursued the art of hypnotism and established a successful hypnotherapy practice. Over years of counseling as well as personal experience, Roy realized that the root of the power of negative suggestion lay in our wrong emotional response, and so he began to search for a way to help people overcome the hypnotic power of stress. After years of searching, he discovered a remarkably effective meditation method, and has been teaching it—with spectacular results—ever since. For over 50 years Roy counsels people primarily through his internationally syndicated daily radio program Advice Line, where callers discuss their most intimate problems and find genuine help and healing.  He has served as a daily voice of sanity and conscience to his listeners, with the uncanny ability to zero in quickly on core problems. As the institutional home for his counseling work, Masters’ formed the Foundation of Human Understanding in 1961. Through his daily radio broadcasts, lectures, seminars, his 18 books, countless audio and video programs—and the Internet—he has helped millions worldwide. He has also established a successful prison outreach and an innovative private K-12 school.   Beyond all this, and at a time in life when most people would have long since retired, an energetic Roy Masters is delving deeply into yet another long-time interest—physics and cosmology. He has authored “Finding God in Physics” as well as a more technical treatise, “Gravity Driven Universe” and has lectured on “Electricity from Gravity” at the American Physical Society in Denver.  Roy Masters and his wife, Ann, have been married since 1952. They have five grown children and 18 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In addition, pertinent economic, political, and social material is included, allowing readers to appreciate better the obstacles Dix overcame in her crusade. With its black-and-white photographs and reproductions and a list of further reading, this is a preferable purchase to Schlaifer and Freeman's recent Heart's Work: Civil War Heroine and Champion of the Mentally Ill, Dorothea Lynde Dix (Paragon House, 1991), which is neither well written nor well researched.

Jules Sampson, 38, is an intelligent English actress who's never had a big break. Her would-be novelist boyfriend Trevor uses her for sex and her theater connections. Jules gets the thankless job of London film-shoot stand-in for American star Lila Dune. A product of the Hollywood star system, Lila is awed by Jules's superior education and acting ability, just as Jules is entranced by the aura of fame and power surrounding Lila. Following Lila to New York, Jules serves not just as stand-in but as the neurotic, insecure actress's drama coach and confidante; able to become the star in looks and manner, Jules constructs a dream life inside that glamorous image. Meanwhile Trev and Lila have begun an afair, with Trev keeping Lila ignorant of his involvement with Jules. As her career takes off, Jules's obsessive jealousy and rage drive her to act out her fantasies of revenge. In flashbacks, Jules tells her story with eerie insights and powerfully evoked emotions; passages describing the present subtly heighten suspense.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Many of the visual cues for the dangerously foreboding urban Tartarus, including the pervasive aura of of dim, dreary lawlessness, were inspired by the movieBladerunner.In Lucid, the main character, Laec Matthews, has more than his share of issues with his fellow man. Abandoned as an infant, raised by a hell and brimstone minister, and left with a lifetime of unanswered questions about who, and perhaps more importantly, what he is after his adoptive father's death, Laec has little reason to trust anyone. Which is just as well, since most people want as little to do with him as possible.However, all that changes when a young girl goes missing. Now Laec suddenly finds himself the man of the hour, a cross between prime suspect and knight in shining armor. He'll have to overcome his inherent distrust of mankind to join in the search, because finding the girl may be his best chance to learn the truth about himself.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book should be read by all those with an interest in our energy future.\"  —Dr. Sue Wareham, Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM), member of the Management Committee in Australia, International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons\"The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown that brought Japan close to collapse in the days and weeks that followed 11 March 2011 also helped prise open a window into the way that for more than five decades high officials of state had colluded to create, cosset, and expand the nuclear industry, minimising safety concerns and evading democratic supervision. The result was a crisis of a depth and complexity hitherto unknown, from which author Broinowski doubts that the Japanese industry can recover ... His book offers a lucid guide to the events and their implications, not only for Japan but also for the world.\"  —Gavan McCormack, Emeritus Professor, Australian National University", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This is especially insightful if you feel you are called into the five fold, this will confirm your strengths and weaknesses and how to deal with others in the five fold. A little here nor there question for me ,was it appropriate to use the old testament description of the apostle function when the five fold was not revealed under the old covenant although the office of a prophet was definitely in effect.

Unlike most college guides, which are aimed at helping students make the transition from home to college, this one focuses on parents, helping them deal with issues of privacy and expectations as children make that transition. The authors offer solid advice on campus resources that are likely available, but they emphasize how parents themselves can prepare to be strong resources for their children. They detail the challenges they’ve seen students face, including abuse of drugs and alcohol, sexual harassment, and cyberbullying. They guide parents by listing warning signs for problems that may require intervention, including signs of substance abuse as well as psychological disorders, with as much emphasis on strategies for helping to reduce stress—parents’ and students’—as on those for promoting emotional well-being. Parents and counselors will find this a useful guide and resource. --Vanessa Bush", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That is unfortunate, because just as there is no other place like Death Valley, there were no other people like those who inhabited Death Valley, and that made for some astounding stories!           This little book, is based on actual events that happened during the rush for the hidden riches of the area when life was cheap and whiskey was plentiful.  In fact, if the whole truth was known, it is probable that the biggest share of the wealth that was taken from the mines of Death Valley, was spent in the Saloons, and in a few places like Diamond Lil's.  We don't know for sure what the first names of the Happy Bandits were, but the reward posters showed their last names to be Small and McDonald.  Some say their full names were Lester Small, and George McDonald.Hope you enjoy reading about them.    Joseph \"Joe\" Botts", "related": [], "rank": 2785922, "title": "Hungry Bill and the Happy Bandits eBook", "author": "Joseph Botts", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He first became interested in the legal profession after participating in his high school’s debate program. He also played a lawyer in a high school mock trial. These experiences led him to become a student in the art of persuasion and argument. With this foundation, Mr. Ortiz went on to obtain a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science from Yale University. He took two years off after college to work in Washington D.C. at the prestigious law firm Covington & Burling as a paralegal. He then went on to attend UCLA Law School in Los Angeles, California. While in law school, Mr. Ortiz participated in the moot court and trial advocacy programs. He also participated in legal aide, assisting the poor and indigent in legal matters. He clerked for plaintiffs’ law firms during the summers between academic school years. Following law school graduation in 2001, Mr. Ortiz stayed in Los Angeles. He passed the State Bar of California and worked as an insurance defense attorney. After only one year representing insurance companies, Mr. Ortiz realized he did not want to represent corporate entities. He wanted to represent individuals. He therefore joined a small law firm representing injury claimants. By 2004-2005, the cost of living in Los Angeles was becoming outrageous. In 2004 Mr. Ortiz sat for the Florida Bar and passed. In 2005, Mr. Ortiz returned to Florida with his wife and to practice law with a small plaintiffs’ law firm in Pensacola, Florida. While at this firm, Mr. Ortiz broadened his practice from representing injury victims to representing injury victims and disability claimants. He learned how to handle a Social Security disability claim from beginning to end, and he learned how to handle short-term and long-term disability insurance claims.  After seven years as an associate attorney, Mr. Ortiz decided it was time to branch out on his own as a solo attorney. On June 1, 2012, he opened The Ortiz Law Firm. Mr. Ortiz is licensed to practice in the following courts: • The Florida Supreme Court; • All Florida State Circuit Courts; • The United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida; • The United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida; and • The United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.", "related": [], "rank": 1269962, "title": "Top 10 Mistakes That Will Destroy Your Long Term Disability Claim", "author": "Nick Ortiz", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A shimmering adventure for history buffs and glamour enthusiasts alike. -- Cherie Priest A beautiful, lyrical, tightly woven meld of Jane Austen, Jane Eyre and Beauty and the Beast - I couldn't put it down! -- Lili St. Crow Shades of Milk and Honey could easily fit into Austen's canon... Kowal has captured both the style and content of an Austen novel, adding her own speculative fiction twist. Readers who enjoyed such novels as Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell will find this novel appealing as well. -- The Jane Austen Centre Kowal sets her own mark on this kind of comedy of manners and creates a low-key and witty debut novel, one that succeeds through understated humor and sprightly prose, rather than through absurd juxtapositions of the historical and the supernatural. San Francisco Chronicle If Jane Austen had written a fantasy novel, [this] would have been the result. Written with painstaking attention to detail, Kowal's prose is serenely evocative of the time period, and the fantastic elements are a seamless fit. The characterization is extremely well done and Jane is a sympathetic, strong and intelligent heroine whose devotion to her family trumps nearly every other concern.= RT Book Reviews, 4 stars, Top Pick!, Seal of Excellence winner I love these books!

She acted and directed in professional and community theatre\n for 30 years. Her\nwriting achievements are remarkable, given her lifelong battle with\ndyslexia. She couldn't read until the age of ten.  Karen's memoir, Love and Madness: My Private Years with George C. Scott,\n tells of her 30-year liaison with the international film star, which\nresulted in the birth of their out-of-wedlock love child. Karen's\nhonesty and willingness to reveal her clandestine affair makes for a\ncompelling page turner, as well as insight into the plight of unwed\nmothers in the 1950s. Watch for her play, Bad Girl, based on that experience, scheduled for publication in the Spring of 2014. Her novel, Freedom's Sins, tells the story of scandal in a fictional Indiana town, the Peyton Place of the Midwest.\n             After studying her family history and learning of the hardships and joys\nof the early 1900's, she wrote Saturday Night Dance Club. Here's what\nTrudi LoPreto, of Readers' Favorite, said about the book: \"Saturday Night\n Dance Club is about real people with a perfect touch of fiction,\npulling it all together into one great story. This is a must-read for\nthe history buff, the romantic, and the family saga fan. Male and female\n readers alike will find something appealing to them, touching them in a\n special way. Don't miss this one!\" Living for several years in\nTerre Haute, Indiana and North Conway New Hampshire, near the home of\nPeyton Place author, Grace Metalious, inspired the writing of Freedom's\nSins. Getting lost for several hours near the abandoned military\n base in Monterey, California scared her into writing The Ghosts of Fort\nOrd. More recently, she and her husband's many overnight weekend getaways on the\nfamous Queen Mary has her busily writing The Ghosts of the Queen Mary. She looks forward to publishing it in the summer of 2014.", "related": ["B00EK5T7J6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Some of the stories create a sense of claustrophobia as the characters become trapped in situations beyond their control. Each piece has its own unique style but the thread weaving through the collection is an intangible sense of anticipation. It is a delicious read and, having read some of the stories a few times, it is something I will keep going back to. A remarkable debut collection which comes highly recommended. -- F.C. Malby It should come as no surprise that The Pre-War House is a controlled and powerful piece of prose fiction, coming as it does from an author whose debut novel features on the recently released Man Booker 2012 [shortlist]. -- Dan Powell The level of accomplishment on display in this bleak narrative is remarkable. Moore is not, however, a beginner. She has been publishing short stories since 2000, and that apprenticeship shaped her first novel. Now she has published a collection of her stories, and it turns out to be just as uncompromising and unsettling as The Lighthouse … Moore's distinctive voice commands exceptional power. -- Dinah Birch The Guardian [A]lmost every story works beautifully and Moore is clearly a master of the short form writing. They are atmospheric, often sad and dark, and weighed down my memory. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the final story with gives the collection its title. This is a longer piece than most of the others, as a daughter sells the family home which stirs memories of a surprising life within the four, pre-war walls of the house.

Listening doesn t always tell me which tunes are country and which are rock or even pop. All the same, as sure as Gymnopedies is ballet, I know what is beautiful. I know what reaches me, and what changes me. Square Dancing at the Asylum is beautiful even when it turns angular and confrontative. It reaches me like fog through open windows, inescapably. And I don t even try to resist the change in myself Wright effects with these bolts of flashing literature.  Why would I expose myself to art if I were going to reject its constructive power? Kirby Wright calls his pieces flash fiction. Would any reader feel differently about them if he called them poems, prose poetry, or just very short stories? I think serious readers would not. The pieces are poetry because they are aesthetically whole and they depend on all the significant qualities of language, not just the defined meanings of the words. They are very short stories, since that only means each one can be read in basically no time. Are they prose poetry or flash fiction? Easy question. Yes!  What is far less easy is to keep yourself from being entirely consumed by the seven books in the volume. Even the names of the books recited in order suggest something more than the naming of sections in a collection: Desire, The Burbs, Confinement, Creature Comforts, Slaughterhouse Flies, Notes From the Front Line, and Nothing Ever Changes. The major characters all gunning for you include a lifelong mental patient, cannibals, an abusive father, a narcissist mother, a possessive big brother, and a helpless kid sister. There are countless other characters that will haunt and taunt you ever after too, including one who will make you think twice about any poems you ever try to write yourself: The Queen of Above Average Poetry.  Prose poems have been around for at least 150 years. Oscar Wilde was a master of the form. Flash fiction, more than anything, seems to be a newish (1990 or so) name for the same form, probably meant to place fewer demands on the writer about the intense, poetic use of those higher and more subtle qualities of language. Wright didn t need the softer definition.  Whole novels blossom in your thoughts or dreams after you read a few hundred words. The pieces do not appear as Cliff notes. Instead, each piece is clearly the crystallized result of powerfully and passionately compressing every meaningful thought and syllable into almost no space, giving meaning so concentrated it is dizzying. --Joseph W.

The theme is original and the author has shared a lot of emotional and personal feelings with readers. The author's thoughts of never finding a mate and having to stay single all her life make it an interesting theme. The book speaks about accepting what life has in store for us and if that means no knight in shining armor, then the term living 'happily ever after' applies in a different way altogether.I found the book very engaging because the theme is unusual and original. It looks at the prospect of not being able to find a mate and the possibility of remaining single forever in a good way, without being whiny or negative about it. It is an entertaining book for both married and unmarried women. The title throws you off a bit, but it is a book I would recommend to all women out there. The personal anecdotes shared by the author make it more relatable. The author conveys to readers the power of acceptance in life and embracing it instead of fighting it all the time. The author's journey will help many unmarried women come to terms with their single status.", "related": [], "rank": 1972198, "title": "Nobody Ever Told Me I Might Not Get Married! - One Woman's Journey to Acceptance", "author": "Patrice Thomas Conwell", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Of particular interest is a rare and welcome move, late in the book, to connect contemporary French philosophy of religion with work being done in the Anglo-American world. -- Jeffrey Bloechl, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Boston College 20130201 Benson and Simmons' The New Phenomenology is a timely addition to current debates in philosophy as well as theology. The book aptly shows the origins and future possibilities of the thought of these new phenomenologists in an overview which spans some of the most compelling thinkers today.

Many times erotic romance can fall somewhat short on a storyline and sometimes romance novels can tell a great story but with less steam BUT \"Quick On the Trigger\" managed to blend them effortlessly.\" The Dirty Denim Series books are being written as a series BUT also can be read as stand alone novels. Thus meaning, if you happen to read \"Steel Horse Cowboy\" and realize you'd like to read more of Sidda's work, you could just as easily go back and read \"Quick On the Trigger\"-BUT one is not necessary to understand the other. Now, remember this is EROTIC romance so there is very explicit scenes. (Hoping to get you hot and not bothered!). Many times characters are thought of as real as possible and sometimes their grammar reflects that. Yep, there is strong language but only when Sidda believes the character or moment requires it. So read at your own discretion and of course 18+. ***Note from Sidda/S.L. Rain As an author I love to hear from readers. Please check out my website for updates and information on my books and social media and my new adventure \"blogging\".

A busy work schedule currently excludes partners, pets and children, but I hope, eventually, to enjoy all three.I have been writing short stories for as long as I can remember. Over the last ten years, erotic fiction has gradually seduced and dominated my creativity. We are at our most vulnerable when naked, when giving ourselves unreservedly to another human being, and I love to explore and describe the dark and dangerous themes thus engendered. An erotic story, I believe, should say more than who did what to whom - it should say something about what it is to be human. We should learn something from it. When our physical needs are in conflict with society's constraints, a fertile fictional furrow is sown and it is surely the writer's duty to consider the resulting harvest. Written almost exclusively in first person, my stories may include references to an adulterous partner, and the protagonist often uses this as a springboard/justification for his/her own amorous adventures. Indeed, my own impetus to write has sublimated from real and often debilitating heartache. Having four older brothers and having enjoyed the diverse delights of several talented, intelligent and passionate lovers, I feel equally comfortable writing from either the male or female perspective. Such has been the importance of men in my life, it does not surprise me that the majority of my stories are told with their words and are seen through their eyes.I love stories where any sex that occurs is 'forbidden' (but not underage or incest, as they are anathema to me) and there is inner turmoil. I need to know what the characters are thinking, why they are there, what drives them. And I love the sex to be graphic, touching and honest, rather than porn mag fantasy: I try to make my characters real people with real insecurities, failings and doubts. In so doing, I believe their experiences will appear more believable while being, at the same time, even more remarkable.If you enjoy my torrid tales, my naughty shorties, or have any comments or questions whatsoever, please feel free to contact me.", "related": ["B00G8N15JS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The use of non-parametric methods may be necessary when data have a ranking but no clear numerical interpretation, such as when assessing preferences. In terms of levels of measurement, non-parametric methods result in \"ordinal\" data. As non-parametric methods make fewer assumptions, their applicability is much wider than the corresponding parametric methods. In particular, they may be applied in situations where less is known about the application in question. Also, due to the reliance on fewer assumptions, non-parametric methods are more robust. Non-parametric methods have many popular applications, and are widely used in research in the fields of the  behavioral sciences and biomedicine.This is a textbook  on non-parametric statistics for applied research. The authors propose to use a realistic yet mostly fictional situation and series of dialogues to illustrate in detail the statistical processes required to complete data analysis.  This book draws on a readers existing elementary knowledge of statistical analyses to broaden his/her research capabilities.  The material within the book is covered in such a way that someone with a very limited knowledge of statistics would be able to read and understand the concepts detailed in the text.The “real world” scenario to be presented involves a multidisciplinary team of behavioral, medical, crime analysis, and policy analysis professionals work together to answer specific empirical questions regarding real-world applied problems.  The reader is introduced to the team and the data set, and through the course of the text follows the team as they progress through the decision making process of narrowing the data and the research questions to answer the applied problem.  In this way, abstract statistical concepts are translated into concrete and specific language.This text uses one data set from which all examples are taken.  This is radically different from other statistics books which provide a varied array of examples and data sets.  Using only one data set facilitates reader-directed teaching and learning by providing multiple research questions which are integrated rather than using disparate examples and completely unrelated research questions and data.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He often took on what he considered to be the flawed philosophy of modernism found in the writings of his good friends Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. It was Shaw who once referred to Chesterton inTimemagazine as \"a man of colossal genius.\" Chesterton's writings consistently displayed wit and a sense of humor.

I’ve worked in a German, Italian, fast food and steakhouse restaurants. I cooked on Sundays when I was in college.  However, when I started working for the school system, I was hooked on teaching kids how to cook.  I created and hosted a kid’s cooking show at the k-5 school my sons attended. The show lasted for about 9 years.  I found that if you make it easy for them to learn how to prepare something they like, they can do it.  Nearly all of the recipes in this book need no cooking. However, adult supervision is very important.

Taking a very down to earth approach, her advice  is based on a dash of creative thinking and a pinch of tough love.At the end she shares with us her favorite healthy recipes-Chinese cooking with its beauty and style.

Wilhelm & her husband, a recently retired aerospace executive, live in Southern California and spend time walking on the local beaches and traveling when she is not writing or sewing. Wilhelm draws from her sometimes challenging earlier life experiences. Being a full time working mom who managed child care demands while actively supporting each of her kid's homework, sports & scouting demands gave her a unique & relevant basis for the enduring lessons, strategies & recommendations you will find in her writings. Wilhelm gave special import to the value of nightly reading and regularly ended her kids evenings with a Bath, Book and Bed; the title of one of her popular eBooks. Capturing the many actual experiences & demonstrated successful practices from the classroom, the playground & the \"principal's office\", she brings a balanced approach to the many challenges parents face as they help their kids to navigate through the elementary school years.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was rejected by every major publishing company. This caused Reilly to self-publish 1,000 copies using money borrowed from his family. Reilly went to a bookstore in Sydney and asked if he could place the copies on one of their book shelves. They accepted the offer. Very shortly after, the books had sold out and the owner of the bookstore called Reilly to order more books. One copy was read by  Pan Macmillan, who immediately signed Reilly up to write ICE STATION, which became an international bestseller. Since then, he has been published in over fifteen countries, including Norway, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, The Netherlands, South Africa, Japan and China. Reilly's main influences include Michael Crichton, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and possibly Art Bell.

However, the stranger parts of town took him places only his imagination could go further.  He used dreams, blurred real-life experiences, and a dark sense of humor to write THE GRLZ LIKE VODKA and LONG LIVE CRAZY.  His writing style is best explained by himself stating, \"I write what I wanna write, it's 99-44-100% pure, it's 'Leskocrazy'.\"  He currently resides in Ohio, closer to family and friends again.Christopher has hosted readings at independent bookstores, bars, and coffee shops and was interviewed in Encore Magazine after releasing THE GRLZ LIKE VODKA. His books are available as e-books or paperback.
