Their four \"bedrock\" principles are \"Equilibrium is a precursor to death\"; \"Living things move toward the edge of chaos\"; \"Components of living systems self-organize\" in response to turmoil; and \"Living systems cannot be directed along a linear path.\" Writing with clarity and verve, the authors illustrate these larger points by comparing the functioning of organic systems (e.g., Yellowstone National Park), the behavior of organisms (dental plaque) and of insects (fire ants) with detailed case studies of five companies (British Petroleum, Hewlett-Packard, Monsanto, Royal Dutch/Shell and Sun Microsystems) and the U.S. Army. Practical-minded readers will appreciate their nitty-gritty insights into the relative advantages of \"adaptive\" and traditional \"operational\" leadership, as well as their consistent distillation of concrete business guidelines. While the authors aver that \"there is no permanent victory in this eternal cycle of life and death,\" they make a persuasive case that \"understanding living systems does not decisively win the game but, most assuredly, it improves the odds.\" (Nov. 1)Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Nonetheless, many bereaved continue to suffer through their losses with little support or acknowledgment of their emptiness. One hundred years ago, however, this was not the case. In the past, families took care of their own and abided by specific funeral rituals, primarily because they lived closer to one another and could easily offer their support and concern. Families today, however, are more scattered, in both a physical and emotional sense. After the march to the graveside, families disperse; they return to their homes, jobs, and private lives. As a result, the bereaved are left to deal with their grief alone and their only channels of support are the professional caregivers. In the modern age, the caregivers are handed the challenge to help mourners grieve and cope with the pain, isolation, and emotional tumult experienced after the loss of a loved one. But, as every bereavement counselor knows, grief and individual responses to it are much more varied than traditional psychotherapeutic models allow. Clearly, more rigorous researchbased models that acknowledge the multitudinal nature and manifestations of grief, in addition to the psychosociobiological factors that shape it, are needed. Dr. Sanders’ book provides such a model. In this revised edition of her classic guide, Catherine Sanders develops an integrative theory of bereavement that serves as the basis for effective strategic interventions for those suffering with grief. At the heart of her approach is a model comprised of five distinct stages of bereavement—shock, awareness of loss, conservation-withdrawal, healing, and renewal. Her theory also emphasizes the need to tailor interventions so as to allow the bereaved to experience grief in a manner consistent with his or her unique personality. Dr. Sanders begins with a detailed overview of contemporary psychotherapeutic approaches to bereavement and then goes on to describe the five phases of grief and their symptoms, as well as the core biological and psychological aspects. Defining the emotional tasks that must be completed within each phase in the series of chapters that follow, Dr. Sanders then explores the ways in which pre-morbid personality traits shape responses to grief and how certain social and physiological factors can interfere with grief resolution. This section is followed by a series of chapters on especially traumatic grievances, including suicide, homicide, and AIDS-related deaths, as well as the loss of a child, spouse, or parent. The final section of the book provides practical guidelines for clinical interventions. Dr. Sanders not only explores several new and promising approaches to grief interventions, she also outlines techniques therapists can use to help themselves cope with the continual stress of treating grief. Grief: The Mourning After is a necessary working resource for psychotherapists, social workers, psychiatrists, nurses, grief counselors, and anyone who works in the health care profession.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

One\n of the few animals on Earth to use tools, and the only animal to use\ntools in non-survival activities, Man has often dedicated himself to the\n improvement of himself, and of the species.But tools aren't the only thing Man has used to this end.\nOver the years, individuals have used the power of their own minds to\ninfluence their bodies. Through methods of meditation, Yogis and\nMedicine Men have taught their bodies to alter, and even stop, their\nheartbeat, and essentially put themselves into suspended animation.\nOften their methods included mind-altering drugs which, when combined\nwith meditation, created a hypnotic state that allowed them to ignore\npain, and even to suppress the body's reactions to pain (its reflex and\nautonomic damage repair systems).Regular practice has also taken a hand in allowing\nindividuals to control their bodies in unusual ways. In the South\nPacific, island divers have learned through regular practice to suppress\n the automatic reflex that forces the body to breathe when starved of\noxygen. Through suppression of this reflex, divers can stay submerged\nfor more than 5 minutes as they harvest pearls and other objects from\nthe ocean.These are all documented facts, and they demonstrate the\namazing capability of the human body to expand its abilities past the\ntheoretical limits of human performance and control. In the past, the\nworld was content to acknowledge these unique individuals and their\nabilities, knowing that they would be the exception, not the rule, in\nhuman ability.However, today scientists are studying gene therapy... the\n process of altering the DNA in the human body in such a way as to cure\ndiseases, improve mental and physical ability, improve longetivity, and\neven to alter appearance. Cloning, the process of duplicating an\norganism at the DNA level, is making legitimate strides, and has been\ndemonstrated with animals. Suddenly, the possibility of purposely\naltering the body to a particular feature or ability seems more likely\nto be the rule, and not the exception, in the future.One of today's modern tools for accessing the mind is\nBiofeedback. Using monitors that record brain waves in real time,\nscientists can use that data to determine which parts of the brain are\nactive during certain tasks. Police lie-detector tests are biofeedback\nmachines that measure the body's physical responses to questions, to\ndetermine when a person is concealing the truth. An interesting\nside-effect of biofeedback equipment is the fact that subjects can often\n learn how to consciously alter the readings in a deliberate way.Evoguíais the story of a scientist that has\nstudied the more traditional methods of meditation, hypnosis and\ntraining to improve the body, and tries to combine those with modern\nbiofeedback techniques, to more easily create the mind-body connection\nthat allows an individual to influence the behavior of their own bodies.\n Although the biofeedback equipment in the story is slightly ahead of\nour present technology (I make reference to sophisticated 3-D monitors),\n everything else involved in the process I outline is based on\ndocumented processes of hypnosis, meditation and mental exercises, as\nwell as the demonstrated capabilities of the human mind and body to\ninfluence and retrain itself.My main intent, in writingEvoguía, was to point\nout that mucking around with DNA isn't necessarily the only way to\nimprove the species. In fact, as complex as DNA is, I believe we may be\nbetter off looking into some of the methods I describe inEvoguíato improve the mind and body. In the novel, four volunteer subjects try\n her method and show marked success at augmenting their physiologies. Of\n course, in the novel this turns out to be a springboard for some very\nunexpected developments, which ultimately have worldwide,\ngeneration-spanning consequences. But what would you expect from such a\nground-breaking achievement?Which brings me to my secondary intent in writing this\nstory: That sometimes it isn't the achievement, but the reaction to it,\nthat dictates how good or bad the achievement is.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

McGilligan, the author of several acclaimed biographies of film directors (George Cukor: A Double Life), returns again and again to the image of Micheaux as a lone wolf, churning out two or three pictures a year at his peak while barely managing to stay ahead of creditors. And it wasn't just the all-black casts that put his films outside the mainstream; the stories often ran afoul of censors and critics for their uncompromising portrayals of contemporary African-American society. McGilligan sketches a crucial portrait of his subject's life before motion pictures, including an attempt to work a South Dakota homestead and a failed marriage that would provide the impulse for much of his creative output. The story isn't always as detailed as readers might like, but that's due to the limited available historical record. McGilligan does a fine job of reaffirming Micheaux's significance beyond the appreciation of cineastes.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The first chapter grabs the reader's attention with an affecting account of a two-manned military aircraft that is tragically shot down over Iraq. The ensuing chapters focus on the pilot's brokenhearted fiancé, Maryn. Even after nine years, she is still struggling to say goodbye to the soldier she loved with all her heart. She knows that it's time to get on with her life, but in order to do that, she must first say goodbye to her past. She decides to do that by way of a vacation to Australia. As part of a group tour, Maryn meets Grant, a marine biologist from California. The two feel an instant liking to one another, but neither is sure how to proceed. What follows is a tender telling of how love can not only break a heart ... but it can also mend one as well.The cover ofWind to Waterincorporates several aspects of the story including a map of Australia, which takes center stage on the outside of the book as well within its pages. The beauty of Australia is so vividly described and incorporated into the scenes that it takes on a persona of its own.Maryn and Grant's tale is sweetly romantic and sensitive, but told with utmost practicality. The author's engaging writing style is masterfully fluid and poetic, which results in a flawless delivery of the story. His setup submerses the reader in the setting, and his realistic characterization brings Maryn and Grant to life.Although I believe that both male and female readers will enjoyWind to Water, Mr. Hamershock gives every female romance reader what she longs for most at the end of a fabulous love story--a deep, satisfying sigh and a burning desire for the leading man's phone number. --Claudia Pemberton, February 2009, author ofLove Leaves No One Behind", "related": ["B00K31USUS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 3.6, "rating_total": 18.0}

McMinn's fresh insights and clear and readable style make the book accessible on a popular level. Parents of pre-teens and teens should find it a practical tool for helping their children make wise decisions about sex, while engaged couples should find her discussion of true intimacy, and our unrealistic expectation of achieving it in this life, to be helpful in navigating their way through marriage. At the same time, her thorough research makes the book appropriate for academic use. While never straying from biblical principles, the author explores emotionally charged issues like unwanted pregnancy and masturbation with grace and compassion; her discussion of homosexuality should be required reading in ministry programs at evangelical seminaries.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although Boyne remains better at storytelling than at characterizaton, word? formula? OK as is/ pre characters familiar from the earlier books--Frank Bandfield and Hadley Roger--interact with hissable villains (a careerist officer, a racist congressman) to keep the action moving. The narrative advances 'move' in previous sent through the military's ? post-1945 retrenchment, the Korean War, McCarthyism and the years of nuclear deterrence. Technical matters, like the development of the B-47 bomber and of aerial firefighting, are handled with convincing expertise, as is the protagonists' captivity in North Korea. Black fighter ace John Marshall and his wife Saundra anchor a particularly strong civil rights subplot, whose resolution brings the novel to an emotionally satisfying conclusion. And knowledgeable readers will note the memorable cameo appearance of Gen. Benjamin O.

Improbably, coordinating the Dancing Raisins summer tour led to a stint on Wall Street  After years on a trading desk, she picked up a syndicated show with NBC Radio. In 2000, she was recruited by Upside Magazine to host a sassy little radio show, The Dawn Patrol. While the show was short-lived, Tracey gained a reputation as the \"Barbara Walters for CEOs\" – at least two CFOs cried while on the air.  At the tender age of 39, she moved to the west coast and was almost instantly in the thrall of Bikram's hot yoga and graduated from Bikram's teacher training in Los Angeles in 2005. In 2007, she published the only Bikram-authorized memoir of her yoga experience, The Mighty Cobra & The Pink Rabbit.  When she's not at the studio, she's having buckets of fun with her twin girls who turn four this year.", "related": ["B00D6UREWS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Copthorne Macdonald began his personal journey as a narrowly focused engineer who understood how \"things\" work, but not how life \"happens\". In Toward Wisdom, Macdonald shows the reader the difference between wisdom and knowledge, and in so doing explains how that understanding is critical to our survival. Drawing from a variety of spiritual sources (from Christian mystics to Maslow) and from his own real and inner-world experiences, Macdonald says that we no longer see ourselves as part of one miraculous living process. As a result, we've become need-based exploiters of our own appetites and of the natural world. To become wisdom-oriented, we must begin to see the unity behind the illusions of separateness to \"recognize\" that we were always \"waves in the ocean\". We arrive at this point, Macdonald insists, not by acquiring more information but by re-experiencing our place in the greater scheme of things. Toward Wisdom challenges us to move beyond an information-based society to a wisdom-based one. Toward Wisdom is thoughtful, insightful, provocative reading and a significant contribution to the philosophical understanding of our place in the scheme of things.  --Midwest Book Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bruce Kerr does a good job at narration, characterization, and the occasional rousing sing-along. His accent is authentic, and the voice of each character is melodious. A good twist at the end also makes this a worthwhile listen.

Divided into thematic subdivisions relating to Europeans and Native Americans, issues of family and community, and the process of becoming American, the 12 essays contributed mainly by history academics examine children's lives from the varied cultures found in Colonial North America and contain copious footnotes and a list of suggested further reading. Such topics as parenting practices, health, education, gender roles, and rites of passage are touched on. The small selection of primary documents (excerpts from letters, diaries, and autobiographies) add depth to an already well-written and researched work whose real strength is its juxtaposition of children's lives across a variety of Colonial cultures.”-Library Journal,“Providing fresh historical perspectives on key features of children's lives, this book offers compelling, new materials on childhood in colonial America, and on groups—including Native Americans and Hispanics—too often left out of conventional coverage.”-Peter Stearns,George Mason University“Children in Colonial Americais a highly original contribution to the history of childhood. The collection’s unique strength lies in its great range of regions and peoples represented: from Indian children of Mexico to young Africans in Jamaica, from Separatist Pilgrims in the Netherlands and Plymouth to Catholic girls in Germany, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania. Although ideal for the classroom, these essays offer much that will be of interest to seasoned scholars.”-Gloria L. Main,University of Colorado-Boulder“Few books can be all things to all people, but this one is an exception.”-Kenneth J. Blume,“A useful and largely impressive anthology on an under-studied topic.”-PhiloBiblos,", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Reames was born the son of a layman gardener.  Burdened with a severe speech impediment, he grew up in remote Oroville, California during the 1950’s and 60’s, where he was bullied and teased. He graduated from Oroville High School being functionally illiterate, the lowest in his class. During the Vietnam War he was drafted into the Army, where he served as a military policeman.  He then became a police officer in Northern California and later in SW Idaho, while attending bible college, where he learned to read. In 1976 he earned his BA degree in criminal justice from Boise State University. From there, he specialized in the computerization of police data, and eventually left law enforcement for a better paying career in industry.  In the 1980s, he owned and operated a computer software development company until recruited to help the Mayor of Caldwell, Idaho clean up local corruption. After that he was hired by the federal government.  He holds a master’s degree in criminal justice administration, with a thesis on organized crime, international terrorism and asymmetric war. In 2002 his formal thesis was asked for by the White House and it became reading material at West Point Military Academy. He has been professionally published in the Journal of California Law Enforcement many times, since the 1970s, and in the Police Chief Magazine.

It attracts contributions by well-known thinkers, and regular columnists include Prof. Raymond Tallis (\"Tallis in Wonderland\"), Prof. Joel Marks (\"Ethical and Other Episodes\"), Dr Tim Madigan (\"Food for Thought\") and a philosophy of science column written by Prof. Massimo Pigliucci.Since its launch in 1991, Philosophy Now has grown to become the most widely-read philosophy periodical in the English language.

The familiar litho of the young rough with open collar opens the book, and Reynold's terrific and informative afterword closes it, along with contemporary reviews (some written by Whitman himself) and Emerson's famous letter (\"I greet you at the beginning of a great career...\"). Those who know Whitman only through the beautiful but bloated 1892 \"deathbed\" edition of Leaves of Grass will find here a lean, searing celebration of self.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He successfully led his country through its greatest constitutional, military and moral crisis – the American Civil War – preserving the Union while ending slavery, and promoting economic and financial modernization. Reared in a poor family on the western frontier, Lincoln was mostly self-educated. He became a country lawyer, a Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator in the 1830s, and a one-term member of the United States House of Representatives in the 1840s. After a series of debates in 1858 that gave national visibility to his opposition to the expansion of slavery, Lincoln lost a Senate race to his arch-rival Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln, a moderate from a swing state, secured the Republican Party nomination. With almost no support in the South he swept the North and was elected president in 1860. His election was the signal for seven southern slave states to declare their secession from the Union and form the Confederate States of America. The departure of the Southerners gave Lincoln's party firm control of Congress, but no formula for compromise or reconciliation was found, and the war came.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival, and together with Lady Gregory and Edward Martyn founded the Abbey Theatre, and served as its chief during its early years. A pillar of the Irish literary establishment in his later years, Yeats was an Irish Senator for two terms. In 1923, he was awarded a Nobel Prize in Literature for what the Nobel Committee described as \"inspired poetry, which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation\". Yeats is generally considered one of the few writers whose greatest works were completed after being awarded the Nobel Prize; such works include The Tower (1928) and The Winding Stair and Other Poems (1929).Yeats was educated in Dublin, but spent his childhood in Sligo. He studied poetry in his youth, and from an early age was fascinated by both Irish legends and the occult. These topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1900, and these slowly paced and lyrical poems display debts to Edmund Spenser and Percy Bysshe Shelley, as well as to the lyricism of the Pre-Raphaelite poets. From 1900, Yeats' poetry grew more physical and realistic renouncing the transcendentalism of his youth, though he remained preoccupied with physical and spiritual masks and cyclical theories of life. Over the years Yeats adopted many different ideological positions, including, in the words of the critic Michael Valdez Moses, \"those of radical nationalist, classical liberal, reactionary conservative and Nihilists\".\"(Quote from wikipedia.org)", "related": ["B0082RFU6W"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In Touch\nof Fate, it was about learning to accept that which cannot be changed,\nand strive to improve that which can be changed. In The Immortality\nVirus, it was more complicated. I was exploring ideas related to the\ngood of the individual, vs the good of the community, as well as the\nconcept of love and forever.

Take a sexy man, make him into not only a vampire but also a werewolf, throw him in England with that killer accent and make him a nobleman? Drool. Then put him together with a woman that can handle him and sit back and watch the fireworks fly.  Chase is just the kind of female character that I love to read about. She is strong, smart and sassy. She knows what she wants and goes after it. She doesn't need a man in her life, but who is she to resist when the opportunity presents itself in the form of tall, dark, and yummy? Roman is an aloof English aristocrat that has no interest in finding a mate, much to his adoptive father's dismay. His father sets out to find him one anyway, sending Chase his way. Once he meets Chase, and realizes that she doesn't know what she is, he can't turn her away.  Chase's best friend and business partner, David (who is drooling over Roman as well), goes to England with her. David is a fun secondary character that is well developed and adds to the book. Then there is Grayson and Drake. They are part of the local were-tiger pack and both sexy in their own right. If I had to pick a secondary character that I wanted to see more of in a future book it would probably be one of these three.  Chasing Destiny is a well written book with well-developed characters and a fun new world of vampires and shape-shifters, with plenty of page turning action, fun characters and humor. The way Roman and Chase go at each other is funny and realistic. David is the friend you'll wish you could have that is loyal, caring and amusing. His reactions to situations are totally believable and amusing. The added characters from other were-packs are mysterious and sexy and will leave you wanting to see more of them.  The background that the author gave Chase adds a sort of an Anastasia mysteriousness to her, with the potential for a prequel sometime in the future, if Ms. O'Neal is so inclined. It would be a history that would add depth to not only Chase, but the entire were-tiger culture in the book.  It looks like Ms. O'Neal may plan to make this a series, based on the title but that is pure speculation (and hope) on my part. I look forward to being able to revisit some of these characters in the future if that is the case and I'll keep my fingers cross that Grayson and/or Drake are in future installments. If you enjoy paranormal romance, vampires and shape-shifters you will definitely want to check out this book. It is one that may end up on your keeper shelf. Wouldn't want to miss out on that would you? This book is also available in paperback, as well as ebook format.  - Laura McQuillen --Laura McQuillen of Kick Back and ReviewI really enjoyed reading this book! It has a great mix of paranormal beings with a twist. The storyline is very fast paced and gets you hooked into Chase's drama that is unfolding in front of her…The interactions between all the characters is relate-able and believable (if we were supernatural beings)!  Pepper O'Neal has a great book that takes you in from the first word and leaves you wanting more with the last! If you are a fan of the paranormal, then this is definitely a book to add to your TBR list!! My rating is 4 out of 5 Hearts! Really great read! - Melissa Rheinlander --Melissa Rheinlander of Keeping Up with the RheinlandersI can't tell you just how much I enjoyed this book. The main female character Chase, who is a private detective, which I find interesting enough that is her career. I haven't read too many with the females as PI's but then maybe it s the books I choose. I love that she is sassy, stubborn and kick's ass! Roman, half vampire and half lycan well now I could have the best of both worlds, definitely my kind of hero. I also loved the interesting unique take on the vampire and lycan lore. I know I have said this before but I am constantly amazed at how many different versions of the vampire myth as well as the lycan, that is being written.  This book was fun wild ride, that has you chuckling out loud, Not one part of this storyline did I find boring though towards the end I did scratch my head on one thing. Wondering how was that possible, I truly hope there is another book to follow this one. I would definitely love to read more. I am also going to be checking out Pepper's other works. - Booklover's Hideaway --Booklover's Hideaway", "related": ["B00K97O622"], "rank": 1930229, "title": "Blood Fest: Chasing Destiny", "author": "Pepper O'Neal", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 22.0}

The seed of the story was \"what could one truly deranged man with skills and resources do to New York City? Unfortunately, on 9/11, we all witnessed a real life version.    Thus, please accept this story for what it is, one New Yorker trying to deal with the dark days of 1993 by imagining the worst. While imagining the worst, I had to imagine what type of person could even contemplate the types of deeds perpetrated in the story. Again, unfortunately, these imaginings lead to a very disturbing picture of a serial rapist. Thus this story includes very graphic violence, including sexual violence, that is a function of the tension and horrors of 1993 in New York. As you read this story, please note how many times Hank is described as a coward, because any man who could hurt a woman or child in any way, let alone in the terrible ways that Hank hurts people, must be a coward.Chapter    \"The United States Army finds you guilty as charged. You are hereby ordered to surrender your commission, all uniforms and weapons, all citations, and all manners and forms of property associated with the Army. You are not to speak of this incident with anyone, at any time. Any failure to comply with these orders will result in the release of our evidence and findings to the civil authorities and your subsequent arrest, trial and conviction by civilian law of these same charges. I assure you that you will spend the rest of your days in jail if you do not adhere by this sentence.\"    The presiding General stopped his pronouncement of the sentence. He pulled his glasses form his face, wiped them slowly on a handkerchief he pulled from his dress uniform pocket, and slowly put them back on his face. He had a pained expression that revealed his inner conflict in sentencing Lieutenant Colonel Hank Adams. Respect for his service, disgust with this specific latest action, and silent shame in having been complicit in letting it go on so long.    \"It is only our personal relationship, and your long and meritorious service to the United States, in high risk, covert missions that precludes me from turning over this entire matter to the District Attorney. This hearing is adjourned.\"    The General looked down from the bench and found the Sergeant at Arms for the proceedings. He was unwilling to look the convicted officer in the eyes. Hank Adams had been one of his special projects. A killer. Trained in practically every weapon system and killing system known to man. Hank had travelled the world carrying out assignments that other men could not even imagine. He was a fine tuned assassin who could kill at any range, including at zero range, hand to hand, face to face.    \"Sergeant-Major!\" The General called the ranking non-commissioned officer to bring the court-martial proceedings to a close.    \"ATTENTION,\" the Sergeant-Major barked. His voice sounded like an 1812 overture cannon in the confined spaces of the cramped private room that had served as the secret court for the tribunal's proceedings. The few attendees stiffened to attention while the General and his hand-picked staff of two tight lipped officers left the room. One by one they filed past Hank Adams, turning their backs on him and on a dark part of themselves. None took his hand, not one had a word to say.    \"DISMISSED,\" the Sergeant Major barked, the word coming out hard and sharp. He looked at Hank Adams, now the retired Lt. Col. Hank Adams, and his eyes narrowed to slits. Hatred was evident in his face, his stance, in the very way he breathed when he looked at the disgraced officer. The Sergeant-Major walked over to the wiry, bronzed killer who was holding his hat in his hand.    \"Your rank,\" he demanded of the defrocked officer. None of the previous formality. No sir. No please. Just a simple, rough, hard-edged demand for his rank and insignia. Fighting words between fighting men. The edge in his voice signaled the Sergeant-Major's intent to personally make good on the tribunal's ruling as soon as possible. Hank Adams made no move to remove his epaulets or his collar dogs, or to do much of anything for that matter. He stood there seemingly rooted to the floor, his free hand balled into a tight fist, his teeth clenched together, jaw muscles standing stiff and hard against his weather-beaten face.    Kate. Kate. Kate. Kate.    \"Go to hell,\" Hank said in a low, even voice. He turned on his heel and spun away from the Sergeant-Major. His long athletic strides carried him quickly, defiantly out of the courtroom into the blazing late summer heat. The world seemed to shimmer and flow in waves before him. The shock of the heat, the sentence of the tribunal. His memory of the quick violence of the most recent act just a few days prior. It all conspired up against him now.    \"They're all against me,\" he whispered hoarsely to himself. \"I've given them everything I had. I'm a soldier goddamn it. They can't do this to me. They owe me.\" Hank stood there looking out over the nearly deserted army base. The regiment was still in the field, where he'd been, only days previous, until the incident. Until his beast had crawled up out of him and taken control of him yet again.    Kate. Kate. Kate. Kate.", "related": [], "rank": 2640928, "title": "Obsession For Vengeance", "author": "jt kalnay", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So to beat her to the punch and, in essence, to turn chagrin into pride, I'll share it myself.  In my wee tender years, prior to kindergarten, my mother sat on the living room floor playing a game with one of my brothers. The game required reading and this was a talent I had yet to master. When told I couldn't play I threw myself back against the wall in a fit of despair, slid down to the floor and said, \"See what wonderful things you can do when you know how to read?\"  Seriously. In all honesty, I do vaguely remember this, so I know she's not making it up.  As a five-year-old I already recognized the value of such knowledge, and every day since I gained the precious ability to read I've done so with avid hunger. When other kids played that silly mash game (you know the one, with the spiral and the cars and the boys) and declared their future professions would be as a lawyer, doctor, teacher or firefighter, I wanted to be an author. Forget needles and numbers. Forget corporate America.

My middle child is off on a mysterious adventure, the like of which I can only guess...and tried to do so in my first book, Gone. I love to read and am looking for ways to double time so to indulge in the mysterious and wonderful and delicious and strange...my favourite kind of story. Writing is my passion, though I enjoy creating handcrafted cards, jewellery making, scrapbooking and dabbling in encaustic art whenever I can. Oh yes, I used to teach or mark exam papers but now concentrate on writing and enjoying my new life, which materialised, as if by a miracle. Though still dislike all those necessary domestic chores that would, for me, be included in the Rings of Hell! That's it.

Also included is a discussion of how these plans affect educational policy in both the K12 and higher education arenas.(District Administration)Bridging organizational change theory and the gritty brass tacks of school turnaround,The Turnaround Mindsetprovides rare insight into how leaders can and have reversed the historical decline and decay of ineffective schools on behalf of students and their academic success. Anyone invested in the future of public schools and the enormous numbers of students whose life opportunities count on them will find pearls of wisdom and practical guidance in this important new book. (Sandra J. Stein, chief executive officer, NYC Leadership Academy )Our 'Turnaround Challenge' report suggests that changed conditions and new capacity linked to clusters of schools are essential components for turnaround at scale. The vivid, ground-level profiles in Fairchild and DeMary's book make it clear that 'new capacity' requires specialized experience and school leaders who devote their careers to turnarounds. (William H. Guenther, president and founder, Mass Insight Education )I’ve devoted my career to education and turning around nonprofit organizations, so I know that tackling the challenges of underperforming schools requires an extraordinary and sustained investment in identifying and developing the best principals and teachers.The Turnaround Mindsetis a must-read for educators, community and business leaders, and any stakeholder committed to changing the impediments to student success. With academic insights and practitioner perspectives, Fairchild and DeMary demonstrate the urgency for turnaround leadership. (Janet M. Knupp, founding president and CEO of The Chicago Public Education Fund )A valuable resource,The Turnaround Mindsetis not just for educators and academics focusing on chronically underperforming schools. This thought-provoking book will help you to understand that turnaround is a specialized skill set for school leaders in many settings and contexts.

And holding the entire 75-minute production together\nis a brilliant performance by Ellen McLaughlin as Mink.This is one of those rare instances where the long-sought new \"voice\"\nis apparent. Harrington's use of language is original - Mink primps for \"the\nshine of the street,\" her boyfriend Sharkey complains that when people see his\nscarred face they \"read ugly.\" The author's ability to create emotion-charged\nscenes with a minimum of words is remarkable...McLaughlin's Mink is done superbly, making the viewer want to know more about both the character and the actress - no mean feat.  Mink has a silky-smooth voice that barely emerges from the clenched jaws of a confirmed cynic. Mink herself hardly can believe that she's falling in love, and she's ready to \"go deep\" with Joey, until her own problems get in the way. (McLaughlin also created the bluesy, jazzy tunes the characters sing from time to time.)No doubt, this play will make its\nway into that full production later. For those who want to see it at an early\nstage, still red-hot from the playwright's forge, it has two more performances\nat the festival.-Bernard Weiner of the San Francisco Chronicle", "related": [], "rank": 502270, "title": "Night Luster", "author": "Laura Harrington", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When photographer Kali Wallace and her father arrive at Montana's Blackfeet Reservation to chronicle the customs of the native people, they run up against Soaring Eagle, who distrusts whites but can't help feeling attracted to Kali. It's obvious from their first encounter atop Chief Mountain-a mystical site where the legendary Star Bride goddess and her mortal lover first met-that more than mere attraction is pulling them together, but first they must come to trust one another. Kay's by-the-numbers tale holds few surprises, and her characterizations are inconsistent. Still, those who enjoy fast-moving, fireside fables may find this a passing diversion.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00ECYVVQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 24.0}

In high school, she had her own column in the school newspaper, and one of her atricles took third place in a national editorial writing contest. She began college with a minor in journalism. When an instructor slashed her writing up one side and down the othere, she decideed she wasn't cut out to be a writer--even thought the teacher gave her an A, and told her that his harsh critiques were meant to prepare her for the world of writing. In 2006, as a participant in her neighborhood book club, she read a novel that bothered her immensely by its content. She thought she could write a better story than that. Her passion for writing was reawakened after twenty-five years of dormancy, and she immediately began her first novel. Carolyn currently lives in Utah with her husband and youngest daughter, where she continues to write and love life.

I must have heard the ocean roar and heard it pounding on the shore. My eyes first opened up to see a giant of a wave that soared right up to the tower door; and I had yet to see the floor. Eight summer's came and with it a big three mast schooner came also. It was anchored outside of the twelve mile limit zone; Prohibition was the name of the game. The liquor was off loaded to the motor boats that were to get it to the land. I was at the tiller, far at sea and my father was out from sampling the tea. I was the youngest rum runner of them all. At fifteen and sixteen the summers just flew. My father took me with him for his crew as a sailor on a yawl sailing yacht. I decided that I would follow in my father's footsteps and be a seafaring man. I was Captain Kelley at seventeen; on a New York Club thirty foot, sail sloop. There was no power other than sail; \"BLACK PHANTOM\" was her name. My 2nd World War, I worked as a rigger at the Boston Navy Yard during the attack on Pearl Harbor; December 7, 1941. My first three days were spent replacing a stay on the foremast of \"OLD IRONSIDES\" the U. S. S. Constitution. Now I needed all that I could earn to support a pretty nineteen year old wife and home. October 27, 1931 we married and bought some property in Milbridge, Maine. Vera Alley Kelley and I had three children and were married for sixty five wonderful and memorable years. A Liberty Ship yard was built at South Portland, Maine. I managed to get my release from the Navy Yard. At South Portland's West yard as a \"pusher rigger\" I helped build the ships and I was on board every launching as they slid into the bay. I bought an older sixty foot yacht, with screens and soft bunks for our beds. I renamed her \"EASTERN STAR\" and ran charter parties up and down the Connecticut River. Combustion Engineering was a fine company to work for until the Union spoiled it al", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For starters, it's my attempt to show the same level of respect to the craft and business of writing, as a self-published author, that authors who are not self-published are required to show. To that end, it's an on-going project, and this is only an Early Edition of the book. Once it's been vetted by a professional editor, and has been primped and pressed by a graphic designer, then it can finally be something that we will all be proud of.My whole idea with releasing an Early Edition is that, being a self-publisher, the book should help pay for itself. Authors with major publishing houses get a large forward to cover their expenses while they work on their books. We, the self-publishers, do not. But that doesn't mean we should be held to lower standards. The Early Edition helps garner support and show a real interest in the content being presented. Through the magic of digital publishing, fans can support the early work while still getting rewarded with the polished masterpiece at the end of the day.Also, this book is just fun to write. I have a real passion for the kinds of relationships I've written about in Ligature Marks, and I especially fancy rope bondage. It's a pleasure to titillate people, especially with ideas or concepts that they may not have been titillated with before.I like to think that I write for sapiosexuals--individuals who are attracted to intelligence--and though that may be delusion, it's a delusion that I hope I do some justice.", "related": ["B005FG17T2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That virus never left me again, so from the mid 1970s I started collecting vintage cars myself. Naturally my first such car was a Mercedes, a rather neglected prewar 170V Cabriolet B. Later additions were from a 200D fintail, 250SE, 350SL, 300d Adenauer and a 280SE 3.5 Coupe. Mercedes cars became a passion I have kept and further developed throughout the years.", "related": [], "rank": 3333519, "title": "ebook,Bernd S.

Help is on the way!Activating Your Inner Championprovides you with a positive and powerful way of dealing with attacks from your inner critic. The concept of the Inner Champion is a brilliant way of handling this difficult psychological issue by developing an ideal inner voice to support you throughout all aspects of your life. I loved following the hyperlinks to web-based support for exploring your Critic and activating your Champion. This book will help many people feel good about themselves and move through the world with confidence. Bravo, Jay Earley and Bonnie Weiss!-- Matt Weinstein, Inspirational speaker, author,Managing To Have FunI foundActivating\nYour Inner Championand the associated Workbook to be a very smart,\nengaging way to help me get to know my Inner Critic parts. I was delighted to notice myself looking\nforward to doing this practice during the day. The \"Profiling\" process helped\nme to identify and map each Critic. The\nsimple guided diary formats showed me my Inner Critics' patterns of thinking,\nfeeling and behavior after a few days time. Additionally, I learned how to set\ncompassionate limits with punitive Critics that wanted the best for me but were\noften destructive to my self-worth. -- Kathy F. Grace, MA, LPC, Chapel Hill, North CarolinaActivating Your Inner\nChampion Instead of Your Inner Critic, along with associated online tools,\nhelped raise my awareness of Inner critic types and the common messages I\nreceive from them. More importantly, I\ngained resources for not only noticing these habitual patterns but responding\nto them in new ways. The suggested\nstatements from the Inner Champion respect the Inner critic's original\nmotivation and offer interpretations that are more current, instead of based in\nthe past. The writing is accessible and\nfocuses on application to everyday experience.I recommend this book for anyone seeking a positive approach to personal\ndevelopment.--Sally DurganChapter 1 - IntroductionChapter 2 - The PerfectionistChapter 3 - The TaskmasterChapter 4 - The Inner ControllerChapter 5 - The DestroyerChapter 6 - The Guilt-TripperChapter 7 - The MolderChapter 8 - The UnderminerChapter 9 - Awakening Your Inner ChampionChapter 10 - Activating Your Inner Champion", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tales range from using a blow-dryer in an unsuccessful attempt to defrost a 13-pound turkey before a dinner party, suffering from a poorly timed bout of food poisoning during class, and learning how to embrace the dreaded b-word: budget. Some of the stories are amusing, especially those that adopt the revealing style of sharp-tongued comic Chelsea Handler. A passage about the importance of refraining from bringing credit cards to bars and late-night binges at Taco Bell is reminiscent of Handler’s stories. However, other stories fall flat thanks to unfunny punch lines. Miller uses part of her book to offer advice to young readers about how to survive college-dorm life. These golden tidbits include never shop on an empty stomach, don’t leave expensive jewelry in your suitcase and learn how to read road maps in case your GPS is on the fritz. Many of the tips, namely, don’t share personal info on the Internet, are obvious to most people. Miller’s work will not appeal to everyone. Those over age 30 will likely find the book to be a bit self-indulgent. But that doesn’t mean that the author can’t find an audience. The book’s amusing stories may attract college students who can relate to the shenanigans or teenagers looking for a preview of university life.A lighthearted primer for college freshmen out on their own for the first time.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A photo of another corpse, a one-way ticket to New York City and a warning note--\"Don't get involved\"--draw Shayne into a case he knows nothing about, at first. He determines that the two dead men once assisted a deceased stunt artist named Zorak, who was rumored to be associated with Los Halcones, a secret government paramilitary organization responsible for many deaths during a demonstration of university students in l970. Aided by his office mates, an upholsterer, a plumber and a sewer engineer, and by his lover, \"the woman with the pony tail,\" Shayne hews to his investigative line even as he is relentlessly pursued himself. The body count mounts as the one-eyed detective, in a continuing course of car chases, shootings and close escapes (even in a commandeered bus), closes in on the politics behind the puzzle of who is after whom and why. Originally published in 1981 and seamlessly translated by Neuman, this existential tale shows off Taibo's ruminative and melancholy detective at his rawest and most surprising. Other Shayne books available in the U.S. are Some Clouds , Shadow of the Shadow and An Easy Thing .

Urbanik reviews the geographic research that deals with humans' relationships with animals and provides an effective framework to understand how geographic thought has developed on this topic. She provides a historical overview of thinking about animals in the human world and analyzes recent geographic studies of animals as beasts of burden, on farms as food, and as wildlife in human spaces. Urbanik ‘places’ animals in societies' historical, economic, cultural, ethical, and political landscapes, and engages students to employ geographical approaches to think about animals in their lives. This introductory text would provide an appropriate foundation for courses designed to consider the geography of human-animal relations. However, it is more than that. It also reveals the evolution of the scholarship that is, of course, valuable to researchers, and captures a snapshot of contemporary attitudes toward and feelings about animals in mainstream cultures. Though rather brief, the book is very readable and deals with rather complex conceptualizations. It is a library-worthy volume, for certain. Summing Up: Essential. All academic levels/libraries.(CHOICE)Animals interact with us on a daily basis as wildlife, food, clothing, companions, entertainment, and therapy. But although they are everywhere and connected to geographies of everyday human experience, some geographers still refuse to see them. Julie Urbanik’sPlacing Animalsis a remedy for such short-sightedness. As the first book to provide an overview of new animal geography, it clearly shows how human-animal relations have moved from the margins to have a greater disciplinary presence. . . . The style and structure make this an accessible and engaging read for undergraduates. Throughout the book, Urbanik challenges readers to think about the way we understand human-animal relations. . . . The discussion questions and general approach also make this a useful and original guide for teaching. This is an excellent introduction to the subject. It clearly outlines the relevance of human-animal relations to geography, while showing how a geographical approach ‘opens plenty of doors in a multitude of directions.' . . .Placing Animalsshould be regarded as the new foundation for the future of animal geography.(Geographical Review)Urbanik provides us with an excellent book for teaching animal geographies. Always an innovative and eclectic thinker, Urbanik takes us to the multiple places we inhabit with other animals, encouraging us to think more deeply about these relationships with the help of her imaginative and penetrating vision. I am excited to use this inspiring book for my first animal geographies course.(Jody Emel, Clark University)Geography plays a pivotal role in shaping the everyday lives and deaths of non-human animals, and conversely, the ways in which animals influence people, economies, and societies. Animals are variously intimate companions, food and clothes, modes of transportation, spare body parts, symbols of wilderness, spiritual guides, and victims of rampant development and climate change. At the same time, they have always been agents of change, altering human ecologies, cultures, histories, and the evolution of our moral compass.Placing Animalsseeks to understand these complex relationships in time and space.Arguing that only by pursing a decidedly more-than-human geography can the discipline adequately address nature-society relations, Julie Urbanik has delivered an extraordinarily clear, accessible book that will be welcomed by geographers everywhere who have wondered: Where in the world are all the animals?(Jennifer Wolch, University of California, Berkeley)", "related": [], "rank": 1864662, "title": "Placing Animals: An Introduction to the Geography of Human-Animal Relations (Human Geography in the Twenty-First Century: Issues and Applications)", "author": "Julie Urbanik", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This facing-page translation—inspired, the translators say, by 9/11—preserves the oddities and the angers in Lorca's metaphor-loaded free verse. The famous Ode to Walt Whitman salutes the Fairies of North America,/ Pajaros of Havana, hoping against hope to resist self-hate. Interludes in Vermont and a coda in Cuba suggest the mystical ties with nature that Lorca could not find in Manhattan. Yet the dominant note is a brilliant hostility: at Dawn in New York, furious swarms of coins/ drill and devour the abandoned children. The Chrysler Building suggests a million iron workers/ forging chains for the children to come. Lorca's power, and the translators' fidelity, make this a worthy new version of a 20th-century classic.(Jan.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The teacher of this class was the one who encouraged her to write freely. She wrote her first story in high school. Her short story \"Autumn's Love\" was written some years ago.  Life and work postponed writing books until the present. Self publishing gave her the venue to share her literary offerings.  She has traveled to many countries. She lived in Ireland, Scotland and Israel. With her family she immigrated to America, settling for a time in New York, Hawaii and at the present Central California. She has been married for forty-seven years to Manor who is an artist. They have three sons. She has published the following e-books on Amazon.com Poet&Painter;: an anthology of original poetry by Geraldine Shadian with the original art of Manor Shadian Autumn's Love   Branded by Betrayal.

What inspired you to start writing about natural methods of stress relief?Women everywhere are experiencing severe amounts of stress in all aspects of their lives, on the job and at home. I see it all around me every day, and I know from personal experience that coping with stress is a difficult prospect. Unfortunately many turn to \"solutions\" that often do little to improve things and may even make their situation worse--drinking too much, using narcotics, or giving in to fits of anger; these things only hurt you and those around you and rarely do anything to actually address the situation that is causing stress.I discovered from my own personal experience that there are many positive and beneficial things that can be done to address stressful situations naturally. First of all, facing the situation and doing what you can to change it is vitally important, even if it means making long-term plans, long-term goals, and long-term lifestyle changes. That's why I decided to write about natural methods of stress relief, identify and expose the core causes and detrimental effects of stress for women, and share the high-performance strategies and techniques that women can use immediately to improve their lives. Natural methods work to relieve stress effectively and naturally.2. What are your best sources for coming up with tips to share with your readers (your own experience, research, suggestions from other people...)?My best resource is by far my own personal experience, as well as the experiences of the many women whom I have worked with in my professional life during the last 20 years. Women coping with divorce, family conflict, parenting challenges, financial tragedy, job burn-out and frustration; women who are overwhelmed by the pressures and anxieties of modern-day living. Really, who isn't stressed these days?But in addition to my own experiences, I also do a lot of research and reading on healthy living and wellness, not only focusing on physical wellness, but also on emotional and spiritual wellness. For women, emotional and spiritual wellness is supremely important for inner-peace, joy, and happiness.But more than just reading about healthy living, emotional wellness, and spiritual wellness, I work hard to apply what I learn.I used to be a stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed woman, but I learned how to slow down, re-organize my focus and priorities, and bring balance into my life. I discovered that there is a lot I can do to manage my stress levels and keep them within acceptable standards. When I see how natural stress relief methods work in my life, such as gardening, walking, juicing, proper time management and money management, camping, nutrition, aromatherapy, etc, I write about it so that other women can learn to implement these natural stress relief methods too. They really do work!3. In addition to your books, articles, and stress management for women ezine, what services do you offer in terms of personal support?I offer one-on-one support via email. I always answer emails personally.Most of the time when we are stressed, having someone to talk to goes a long way in helping to soothe frazzled nerves or just to help regain perspective and direction. Some women may not always feel comfortable opening up to family members, and others may live far away and isolated from family and friends, like I was for many years. Yet, via cyberspace, with the click of a button, you can connect with someone in a meaningful way that brings some perspective and peace to your life.Developing a meaningful support network is by far the single most important natural stress management strategy for women. The support network does not have to be big and extensive. It can be as strong as one person you can confide in, one pair of shoulders to cry on, and one pair of trustworthy listening ears.", "related": [], "rank": 3287016, "title": "Walking For Stress Relief (Self-Help Stress Solutions Book 3)", "author": "D.C.

Educator, best-selling author, boulevardier, concert pianist, and first president of The Juilliard School of Music, Erskine was a driving force in highbrow, lowbrow, and middlebrow culture in an era that reveled in all three. The multi-talented Chaddock has done a superb job weaving together the many threads of Erskine's diverse life into a fascinating biographical tapestry. I'm glad this book got written, and got written so well.' - Alex Beam, author ofA Great Idea at the Time: The Rise, Fall, and Curious Afterlife of the Great Books'This lively and absorbing biography succeeds in uncovering the energetic and controversial man beneath the movement, while reminding us of this country's continuing need for well-read and broadly educated citizens, able to search for and recover their roots in these masterpieces of learning.' - Christopher B. Nelson, president, St. John's College, Annapolis, MD'Chaddock's book is an elegant and cogent volume on the life of John Erskine, one of the most important American cultural leaders of the first half of the twentieth century, whose legacy is now sadly neglected. Happily, the author brings to life Erskine's many accomplishments as a teacher, poet, essayist, educational visionary, and concert pianist. Erskine's focused vision regarding the important role that the art of music plays within the fabric of American society strongly resonates for twenty-first-century readers. This book is a must read for those interested in America's cultural history from World War I to the end of World War II.' - Joseph W. Polisi, president, The Juilliard School'Never losing sight of the man at the center of her story, Chaddock has at the same time skillfully placed her subject firmly in his own unique time and place in the history of American educational, musical, and literary culture. Among its many useful services, this book should once and for all dispel the misconception that Great Books programs, which Erskine originated, are fundamentally elitist and exclusionary rather what they are in fact: an expression of the democratization of learning for all citizens.' - Donald H.

What inspired you to start writing about natural methods of stress relief?Women everywhere are experiencing severe amounts of stress in all aspects of their lives, on the job and at home. I see it all around me every day, and I know from personal experience that coping with stress is a difficult prospect. Unfortunately many turn to \"solutions\" that often do little to improve things and may even make their situation worse--drinking too much, using narcotics, or giving in to fits of anger; these things only hurt you and those around you and rarely do anything to actually address the situation that is causing stress.I discovered from my own personal experience that there are many positive and beneficial things that can be done to address stressful situations naturally. First of all, facing the situation and doing what you can to change it is vitally important, even if it means making long-term plans, long-term goals, and long-term lifestyle changes. That's why I decided to write about natural methods of stress relief, identify and expose the core causes and detrimental effects of stress for women, and share the high-performance strategies and techniques that women can use immediately to improve their lives. Natural methods work to relieve stress effectively and naturally.2. What are your best sources for coming up with tips to share with your readers (your own experience, research, suggestions from other people...)?My best resource is by far my own personal experience, as well as the experiences of the many women whom I have worked with in my professional life during the last 20 years. Women coping with divorce, family conflict, parenting challenges, financial tragedy, job burn-out and frustration; women who are overwhelmed by the pressures and anxieties of modern-day living. Really, who isn't stressed these days?But in addition to my own experiences, I also do a lot of research and reading on healthy living and wellness, not only focusing on physical wellness, but also on emotional and spiritual wellness. For women, emotional and spiritual wellness is supremely important for inner-peace, joy, and happiness.But more than just reading about healthy living, emotional wellness, and spiritual wellness, I work hard to apply what I learn.I used to be a stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed woman, but I learned how to slow down, re-organize my focus and priorities, and bring balance into my life. I discovered that there is a lot I can do to manage my stress levels and keep them within acceptable standards. When I see how natural stress relief methods work in my life, such as gardening, walking, juicing, proper time management and money management, camping, nutrition, aromatherapy, etc, I write about it so that other women can learn to implement these natural stress relief methods too. They really do work!3. In addition to your books, articles, and stress management for women ezine, what services do you offer in terms of personal support?I offer one-on-one support via email. I always answer emails personally.Most of the time when we are stressed, having someone to talk to goes a long way in helping to soothe frazzled nerves or just to help regain perspective and direction. Some women may not always feel comfortable opening up to family members, and others may live far away and isolated from family and friends, like I was for many years. Yet, via cyberspace, with the click of a button, you can connect with someone in a meaningful way that brings some perspective and peace to your life.Developing a meaningful support network is by far the single most important natural stress management strategy for women. The support network does not have to be big and extensive. It can be as strong as one person you can confide in, one pair of shoulders to cry on, and one pair of trustworthy listening ears.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 1983 Oreste returned to school for a post-doctoral degree in Marriage and Family Therapy. Subsequently, he directed two Marriage and Family Centers, Allegra Counseling Centers that were successful. He continued to teach for about ten years during this time. However, Oreste began to experience a great hunger and desire to write and retired as a professor- psychotherapist to write full time. He has completed three books: Sin Is Necessary, Illusion vs. Reality---Sounds Within and Without, and is completing Intrigue in Rome. Dr. Rondinella has traveled extensively in the last twenty-five years and conducted research and interviews that contributed to his books.

Legend says that as a small child, she would banish her mother from her room, insisting that she wanted to ‘play by myself,’ and proceed to create elaborate tales with her toys. As a third-grader, she wrote her first story The Conny Twins and the Lost Gold Mine and immediately followed it with its sequel, The Conny Twins and the Case of the Butterfly, complete with illustrations. Fortunately, by the time she reached junior high, she’d abandoned the artist portion of story-telling and began on the first draft of what would eventually become her first novel, Reeves’s Island. Published by iUniverse in 2005, it was removed from the market in 2010 and re-released in 2010 under the more grammatically acceptable title of Reeves’ Island and contains several short stories for a new ending. In 2007, Perkins released her first novel with PublishAmerica, The Last Summer and it was followed in 2009 by Three, Two, One. In 2011, she released the paranormal romance My Immortal, 'm Cara which was made available through Amazon Kindle in 2012. Currently working as a freelance writer, Perkins has released several short stories via Kindle including “The Spaces Between” and a new fantasy series “The Teuer Chronicles.” She hopes to be releasing her fifth novel, The Dragon Three, in 2013. Perkins makes her home in northeastern Ohio near her family, including most of her nieces and nephews who are, in her un-biased opinion, the cutest kids ever. When she isn’t writing, she enjoys spending time with said family, watching tv / movies with her cats and, of course, mass quantities of reading.", "related": [], "rank": 2284312, "title": "My Immortal, 'm Cara", "author": "Victoria Perkins", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In particular, Van der Kiste's portrait of Alexander II is especially affecting. The Czar Liberator emancipated the serfs and hoped to reform and re-energize local government, but his liberal policies unleashed pent-up frustrations and revolutionary ardor, culminating in his assassination. Some of the more obscure family members are quite fascinating, including those who lived quiet lives of exile in England and France. The illustrations, many of them rarely published, supplement a well-written and often emotionally moving family chronicle.Jay Freeman", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Avery has lived within the sealed walls of Naperville for over 30\nyears, subsisting on fabricated food earned with fun bucks and the\noccasional powdered beer. Like his coworkers, he was taught that the\nOutside is a dangerous mix of toxic air and savages and he is content\nwith visiting the WaltMart Real Nature Park in the Recreation Unit. He\nis the best customer service rep possible in a department the motto of\nwhich is to never help customers, but he has exceeded his allotment of\ntwo chairs per decade, and Corporate Services refuses to replace his\ntrash-can-strapped-to-roller-blades with a real piece of furniture. A\nmysteriously well-connected man leaves a new chair in his office, but\nwhen it accidentally explodes, it sets off a chain of events that\nreshapes the country. Avery and his bookish girlfriend -- who he assumes\nhe loves, since she is planning their wedding -- are sent to separate\nwork sites while construction continues on the Transcontinental\nCorridor, a self-contained office complex that will stretch coast to\ncoast. The multi-firm structure's grand opening is imminent, assuming it\n can withstand sabotage from rivals and accelerating attacks from the\nOutsiders whose trade routes are threatened. Endearing aliens and\npolitical satire make this a fun read, even if the final chapter seems\nirrelevant. Avery's evolution and chair quest is clever, but a\nprotagonist with more depth would inspire greater sympathy among\nreaders.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Being the baby of the family and quite a bit younger than her brothers and sister, Mary had plenty of time to entertain herself. Making up stories seem to come natural to her. As a pre-teen, Mary discovered romance novels and knew instinctively that was what she wanted to do with her over-active imagination. She wrote her first novel as a teen, (it’s tucked away somewhere never to see the light of day), but never really pursued her writing career seriously until a few years later, when she wrote her first romantic comedy and was hooked. Today, Mary still lives in Texas, and still writes about romance. In fact, she can’t think of anything else she’d rather do. Learn more about Mary Eason at www.maryeason.com.

The idea of a woman torn between wanting to please her dying mother and being forced into a role that ran counter to her true nature germinated and then when I was ready to write, the idea of a catalyst in the form of a soul searing attraction, one that could rewrite history came into being. And the story was born. What it takes to alter destiny or perhaps, live a life that one is born to and what it takes to move from one's comfort zone. A promise to a dying parent, the birth of a child, heartbreak that must be survived.All that and more came together in Book #2 of the Bad Boys series.

He is a gifted proclamation evangelist, artist, dynamic speaker and visionary. In the early 1980s, at the height of the European punk rock movement, David Pierce started a Bible study on a barge (called Steiger 14) behind Central Station in Amsterdam, Holland reaching disenfranchised young people of that city. It was there that David started a band called \"No Longer Music\" (NLM) to use as a tool to communicate the Gospel of Jesus to these young people who would never step foot into a church. Since then, David has taken the message of Jesus to some of the darkest corners of society, including closed Islamic countries, terrorist clubs, squatter villages, anarchy festivals, brothels, junkie joints, punk & goth music festivals, Satanist clubs and New Age gatherings. David has seen many thousands find Jesus and his efforts have served as a catalyst for a wave of new ministries, churches and missionaries that have grown into a global, interconnected missions organization called “Steiger International”. Steiger is called to reach and disciple the \"secularized global youth culture\" for Jesus. In recent years, David has been able to penetrate and effectively reach \"globalized Middle Eastern youth\", a demographic of millions of young (17-35 years of age), educated and highly influential people across the Middle East who have become increasingly influenced by globalization and engaged in the global network of communication, music, art and media. In addition, David is committed to bringing powerful teaching to those inside the church. Each year, David preaches in churches, conferences, and colleges all around the world sharing about this bold and cutting-edge ministry and opening opportunities for Christians to more seriously commit their lives to reaching the lost at home and around the world. David’s story is a strong catalyst for action in the Christian community and for the work that God wants to do in the hearts of young people everywhere. Other books by David Pierce: • Rock Priest, Kingsway Publication (1993)  • Dancing with Skinheads and Bible Study Topics, Steiger Press (1998) • Ratcage, Steiger Press (2004) David’s books have been translated into Dutch, German, Polish, Croatian, Portuguese, Bulgarian, Russian and Spanish.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I have no medals on my walls, no trophies in my cases, save a moment of recognition in 1999. I am flotsam in life's stream, nonetheless appreciating my bountiful blessings—superb health, plentiful energy and buoyant humor, to mention a few. I married Mary Elspeth in 1948, the most fortuitous act of our lives.   We were both born in Montreal, Quebec in 1924; I, the youngest of five children, Elspeth, an only child. Elspeth obtained a Bachelor of Arts, McGil University, 1944, while I served in Europe in the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry. After he war, I earned a Civil Engineer degree, McGill University, 1949. My lifetime work was construction management, participating in a variety of projects in Canada. In 1972, we relocated to Kansas City, where I worked as Construction Manager on several prominent commercial developments in Missouri. The active theatrical community throughout Kansas City presented us with recreational opportunities we never would have found in Montreal. Elspeth became a seamstress in a professional theater company and volunteer costumer for a summer theater group; I participated as both actor and director with several companies, my most notable venture portraying Clarence Darrow, a one-man two-hour tour-de-force of the same name. In 1988, we retired to Arkansas where I embarked on a storytelling and creative writing career, serving ten years as the president of the Tellers of Tales, the storytelling guild of the Shiloh Museum of Ozark History. In recognition of many contributions to the museum, I received the prestigious Arkansas Museums Association “Friend of the Museums Award,” March 11, 1999, followed the same year by the Volunteer Excellence Award from Governor Mike Huckabee. Despite a colon cancer incident (2002) and a heart attack (2011), I continue my active writing career, combined with daily physical exercise. Currently, most observers, estimating our ages to be around 75, are surprised to learn the truth, a fact we judge to be a testament to a joyous union and lives well-lived. Meanwhile, as I write these notes, Elspeth is busy on her sewing machines, about ten feet from my computer, making her new clothes for the coming summer months. So here we are, in a retirement community in Rogers, Arkansas, living in eager anticipation of each and every visit from our four children, six grandchildren and four—oops, four and a half—great-grandchildren.", "related": [], "rank": 2943412, "title": "Beginning Creative Writing", "author": "Stephen P.

Oh gawd, this is not the\nright moment to start to react to this beautiful girl.I'm going to explode. His hand stops on her sweet\nsmooth ass, grasping it softly. He moans with need. He's fully aroused and his\ncrown is peeking out of his soft black leather pants.Omg, I'm so heavy, I'm hurting him. He's moaning, thinks Katherine.\"Are you ok? I'm so heavy!\nLet me get up,\" squeals Katherine.She moves her head, trying to\nsee him, and bumps into his jaw. She moves and straddles Bulldog.Without thought Bulldog turns\nhis head, landing directly on her sweet mouth.Oh my lord,she tastes\ntotally like sugar, he thinks. He waits for her to open her mouth, dying to\nsavor her taste.Hmmm, he's so delicious, she thinks.I\nwant his kiss. Oh, wow, I feel him. I feel his soul reach out to me. He's\nsearing my soul and making me ache. My body is reacting to his touch.Sweet hot sugar, she's driving me crazy,thinks Bulldog. He kisses her slowly, exploring every\ninch of her sweet mouth.Damn, this is\npure sweet heaven and I can feel her hot wet pussy on my throbbing cock.

By far the most widely used Logic Programming language is Prolog. Prolog is a good choice for developing complex applications, especially in the field of Artificial Intelligence.Logic Programming with Prologdoes not assume that the reader is an experienced programmer or has a background in Mathematics, Logic or Artificial Intelligence. It starts from scratch and aims to arrive at the point where quite powerful programs can be written in the language. It is intended both as a textbook for an introductory course and as a self-study book. On completion readers will know enough to use Prolog in their own research or practical projects.Each chapter has self-assessment exercises so that readers may check their own progress. A glossary of the technical terms used completes the book.This second edition has been revised to be fully compatible with SWI-Prolog, a popular multi-platform public domain implementation of the language. Additional chapters have been added covering the use of Prolog to analyse English sentences and to illustrate how Prolog can be used to implement applications of an 'Artificial Intelligence' kind.Max Brameris Emeritus Professor of Information Technology at the University of Portsmouth, England.

The\nGrid by Carlton Winnfield is an extraordinary tale of international intrigue\nand subversion, narrated by an unnamed agent of The Grid. With highly advanced\nnanotechnology, a super computer to guide him, and a multitude of satellites to\nbe his eye in the sky at all times, we follow him on a mission to uncover and\nthen stop the plans of Khan, a radical Jihadist leader from Pakistan. As he\nuncovers the plans, piece by piece, a horrific picture unfolds of an alliance\nwith Gomez Soares, a Mexican drug cartel leader, and the smuggling of an atomic\nbomb to Mexico City. Soares and Khan are both certain that detonating this bomb\nwill effectively upset the balance of power in the countries they both wish to\ntake over. But The Grid has other plans. The Grid by\nCarlton Winnfield is exciting and riveting. The narrator is never named so I\nfelt as if I were following a shadowy figure through the whole story. Rather\nappropriate considering that's exactly how he was supposed to be. He leads you\non an international romp through three continents to complete his mission, and\nauthor Carlton Winnfield did a superb job bringing every location to life in\nvivid detail. His character building is equally impressive. From the beautiful\nController of The Grid to the other exotic beauties and evil men we encounter,\nthey are perfectly visualized through his writing. I highly recommend this book\nfor better-than-Bond thrills and intrigue.", "related": [], "rank": 2658020, "title": "The Grid: An International Thriller", "author": "Carlton Winnfield", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Books that I wrote or compiled contain things that I have learned from my experience to be useful for education and teaching of children, and also for those grown-ups who have kept the child in itself.One of the important things about the education and upbringing that I found so far is that everyone understands and interprets what he/she have read individually according to his/her logos. Logos (mind) of the person begins to form since birth and is constantly changing while alive. The more the man is involved in real events and real events happen to him, the more he builds a real and stable logos. So my friendly advice to all who read these lines is this: live for real, try and do things and thus learn. Use the books written by others to update and exchange of experience, rather than a basic learning tool.Best wishes!", "related": ["B00J9ULYDY"], "rank": 3755427, "title": "Game with words and pictures for 100 associations for children age 4+ years (English edition) eBook", "author": "Angel D.

Kerkhoff, however, has discovered a new way to slim down, not by cutting out a particular food or exercising until you drop, but by listening to the real emotional needs beneath the cravings. Diagnosed with multiple sclerosis as a young woman, Kerkhoff became motivated to take care of herself by drawing emotional strength from the love of others and, eventually, her love for herself. The wisdom she's gleaned from her own experience may be useful to many, regardless of whether they're looking to lose weight. The first step in Kerkhoff's program is to become your \"authentic\" self by truly engaging with the world and your feelings at any given moment. Once you participate in the present moment, she says, you can form meaningful relationships. She recommends cultivating at least eight such relationships, which show you that you're worthy of love and have a right to be valued for who you are; they also teach you how to interpret others' behavior in new, less harmful ways. Other steps include retraining your brain to frame setbacks in a positive light, taking responsibility for your circumstances and setting a course of action to improve them, managing the fear of failure, and exercising your mind. What sets Kerkhoff's approach apart from others is her philosophy that the self responds best to love and gentleness, not criticism and hatred: \"I don't want you to feel deprived; I want you to feel fulfilled. I don't want you to feel scared; I want you to feel confident. I don't want you to feel alone; I want you to always feel good in your own company. Because it matters.

A carefully developed and beautifully written storyline never fails to pull me into a tale of adventure or a world of fantasy. Give me a gripping story with a captivating and thought-provoking message, and I am hooked.I was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1978. Throughout my childhood, I drove everyone around me insane with constant writings, poems, stories, and plays. My friends and family were forced to watch-- and often take part in-- a plethora of theatrical performances written or adapted by yours truly. This passion for writing won me the very notable and prestigious Fourth Grade Writing Award for the writing fair at my elementary school that year. I was very proud.Sometime during high school, I lost faith in myself and my abilities and chose to walk the pragmatic path after graduation. Because teaching was a career that I had also been interested in since childhood, I chose that as my path. Attending Kennesaw State University, I earned a B.S. in English Education and went on to a career in teaching high school English and Literature courses. Most days I'm fairly certain I'm the only one in the room enjoying the material. While I know that we cannot all fall in love with English classes, I still believe that reading for pleasure is vital to our own personal happiness and wholeness.When I am not reading, writing, or teaching, I am pursuing one of my other two passions: cooking and traveling. So far, the only places I have visited outside of the U.S. are Mexico, England, France, and Italy. However, my husband and I visit England on an annual basis to visit his family, and I hope to add many more countries to our repertoire over the coming years. My thirteen-year-old daughter has recently been able to share in these wonderful adventures with us as well. Traveling is an eye-opening experience that can enrich the lives and minds of everyone, regardless of age. Recently, inspiration caught me up in a whirlwind of my mind's own creation. Through a complex set of mental twists and turns, I found my muse. I found my story.I found my self-confidence. And now I have found the missing pieces of myself again. My hope is that my story touches others in ways they can't even imagine yet.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's an unpretentious, leisurely western about a callow young rancher's first cattle drive. Though discursive and overlong, Duster creeps up on the reader's affections, and the story ends in a violent, gripping climax. Especially effective are Duster's encounters with bandits, traders and farmers, and his droll accounts of his many foolish predicaments. The author's sympathies for Mexicans and \"gringos,\" as well as for both experience and youth, are gracefully balanced; but it's his knowledge of the country and ranching life that distinguish the book. Scratchy drawings highlight a few of the livelier moments (such as when a pack mule bucks its load), and a glossary defines some, but not all, unusual terms.

Her family moved to Missouri in 1990 when her parents realized that the answer to the riddle, “What’s green and goes backward?” was their current state and the state of her birth, Vermont. Now that she’s out of her religious bubble and in her right mind (eh, questionable), Kaleesha is considering that Vermont is actually one of the few states thinking and acting progressively. Regardless, she anticipates calling Fredericktown, Missouri home for a good long while.      Though Kaleesha is a homeschool dropout, since high school she has worked as a teacher, nurse, accountant, CEO, mechanic, plumber, electrician, carpenter, landscaper, gardener, photographer, veterinarian, goat breeder, counselor, dietician, chef, baker, dishwasher, laundress, seamstress, event coordinator, chauffeur, diplomat, painter, decorator, fitness coach, masseuse, astronomer, and nanny, all within her own home and among her family, often performing many of these roles in the course of a single day.

He finds work as a farmhand with a dairy farming family who, in their own stalwart, beholden-to-no-one way, help him find the 'way back' to wellness and a happy life. The narrative is a kind of historical/poetic frame story, weaving together the lives of three generations of characters through the central prism of Chapman's journal, found in a barn being torn down in present day Wisconsin and lovingly shared by the author as a tribute to Chapman. Chapman's poetry alternates with historical and cultural references from World War I through the Great Depression to the dawning of World War II,  and colloquial Wisconsin dialogue that is as heartwarming and educational as it is funny in that particularly wry Midwestern way that can only be depicted accurately by a native. S.K. Carnes is a gifted writer at the top of her game, capturing the images and episodes of an era and a heartland lifestyle that is rapidly vanishing from the American consciousness with a clarity and poetic vision that render the narrative unique and compelling. In an early glimpse of Chapman, Carnes describes her quiet hero as having \"Muckelty-dun eyes rimmed in blue ... eyes of that color could steal your heart away.\" Prose like that does not come along every day!The Way Back has romance, history, adventure, drama, poetry, a quietly epic feel, a magnificently rendered landscape, and eclectic characters unlike any of the 'ho-hum' heroes of lesser fiction. Having once entered John Chapman's world, readers will want to linger, holding close one of the most pure-of-heart and earnestly crafted narratives in recent memory.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
