He wakes to find himself a thousand years in the future, in a space station on the far side of the sun. Or so he is told by the mysterious, sexless human who greets him. Madoc assures himself that he's still in his own time, trapped in advanced virtual reality by one of his foes, because if he isn't, he has no idea why he was cryogenically frozen--which would mean that he was a dangerous criminal. And he doesn't remember that either! Plus, the notorious serial killer Christine Caine has been defrosted to join him, and they, along with their strange rescuer, have just been captured in an impossible space battle by an unknown enemy.The Omega Expeditionis the sixth and concluding volume of Brian Stableford's grand future history, which explores the possibilities and perils of emortality  (near-immortality). This is one of the most thoughtful, complex, and ambitious series ever produced in science fiction, and its final novel, a standalone work, masterfully orchestrates the numerous characters, themes, plot lines, and ideas to a bold conclusion. But newcomers to the series really shouldn't start withThe Omega Expedition. Read the novels of this future history in the author's intended order, detailed in his informative introduction toThe Omega Expedition.

Savage was born in Norridgewock, Maine in 1841. He graduated from the Bangor Theological Seminary in 1864, and for nine years was in the Congregational ministry, being a home missionary at San Mateo and Grass Valley, California, until 1867. He held pastorates at Framingham, Massachusetts from 1867 to 1869, and at Hannibal, Missouri from 1869 to 1873. Savage then became a Unitarian, and was pastor of the Third Unitarian Church of Chicago from 1873 to 1874, of the Church of the Unity in Boston from 1874 to 1896, and of the Church of the Messiah (now renamed the Community Church) in New York City from 1896 to 1906. He was an active advocate of Darwinian evolutionistic optimism and social reform, and he also preached a spiritualistic faith in personal survival after death. His sermons were distributed in the pamphlets Unity Pulpit and Messiah Pulpit.  He wrote many books, including Christianity, the Science of Manhood (1873), The Religion of Evolution (1876), The Morals of Evolution (1880), The Religious Life (1885), My Creed (1887), Religious Reconstruction (1888), The Evolution of Christianity (1892), Our Unitarian Gospel (1898), The Passing and the Permanent in Religion (1901), Life Beyond Death (1901), Can Telepathy Explain? (1902), Life's Dark Problems (1905), Immortality (1906), and, in addition to other volumes in verse, America to England (1905). He was a director of the American Unitarian Association, and served on several councils and conferences. In 1896 he was granted an honorary doctor of divinity degree from Harvard University in 1896", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She didn't bother looking up from her math book. \"I've got it.\"\"I'm serious.\" Jennifer stressed each word.Lizzie shut her book and pulled her pink T-shirt collar up to cover the lower half of her face, mocking her sister's intensity. She glanced in all directions. \"Have no fear, Agent Double oh six, Double oh seven is on the job.\"\"Don't be a smart aleck.\"Dropping the fabric, Lizzie opened her book again. \"Fine. Then stop acting like a wimp. If I seeAvery,which is who you're really trying to avoid, I'll honk three times so you'll know your ex-boyfriend is coming.\"\"Very funny.\" Jennifer gave her sister a dour look, but knew in her heart that Lizzie was right. Private Avery Barnes was exactly who she wanted to avoid.\"Why do we have to do this now?\" Lizzie demanded. \"It's Saturday.\"\"Because Dr. Cutter needs the follow-up films on Dakota's leg done today.\"And because Avery should be away from the stable for at least another hour.Sighing with teenage impatience, Lizzie focused on her homework once more. \"Is it going to take long? I don't want to be late and neither should you.\"\"It'll take ten minutes, tops. I can get you to your chess meeting, drop the films off at the Large Animal Clinic and still get to my horse show on time.\"Jennifer was used to making the most of the limited hours in her day. To save time, she was already dressed in her tan riding breeches and white shirt beneath her pale blue lab coat. Her black show jacket hung in a garment bag behind the driver's seat. Her knee-high riding boots, polished to a high shine, sat ready to be pulled on before she took the field.After she stepped out of the truck, Jennifer pulled a large yellow case from the front seat and glanced around. The narrow strip of white gravel between the close, single-story stone buildings reflected the heat of the warm September morning. The parking area contained only a few cars, but one was the sleek lapis-blue Jaguar she knew belonged to Avery.Glancing into the horse trailer hitched behind her truck, she saw McCloud, her gray ten-year-old gelding, standing quietly, his head up and eyes alert. It was a sign he was ready to get down to business. Both of them needed to be on their game today or she would have wasted an entry fee.Money was tight in the Grant household, and the possibility that she could earn an extra five hundred dollars in prize money wasn't to be taken lightly. Her riding, plus her work for Dr. Cutter, were paying her way though vet school. This semester's fees were due in the next few weeks and she didn't yet have the full amount she needed.She walked quickly to the wide doorway of the old limestone and timber stable, pausing to check down the dim, cobblestone paved corridor. It was empty. She glanced over her shoulder at a small building a dozen yards away. It housed the offices of the Commanding General's Mounted Color Guard at Fort Riley, Kansas.No one stepped out to greet her. She relaxed and blew out the breath she had been holding. She had permission to be here, she just didn't want to encounter a certain soldier.The men who made up Fort Riley's unique cavalry living history unit should be at their training corrals now. When the unit wasn't performing around the country they practiced daily to hone their exceptional equestrian skills and train their horses. She didn't expect anyone back for at least another hour.Part of her was glad that the maddening Avery Barnes was nowhere in sight. Another part of her half-hoped she'd be able to show him exactly how little she cared if he was. Grasping her equipment case tightly, she walked down the corridor to the last stall on the left.Inside the old building, the air was cool and laced with the smell of horses, hay and oiled leather. All scents she loved. Opening the upper half of the Dutch door, she spoke softly to the brown horse dozing with his head lowered near the back wall. \"Hey, Dakota. What're ya doing?\"When his head came up and she was sure he wasn't startled by her presence, she opened the lower half of the door, stepped inside and held out her hand. Dakota whinnied and came to collect the slice of apple resting in her palm.She patted his neck as she checked behind her. There was still no one in sight.\"Okay, fella, let's make this quick. I want to get done before you-know-who shows up.\"Dropping to her knees, she felt along Dakota's leg, checking for any tenderness or swelling. To her satisfaction she didn't find anything but a nicely healed scar on the big bay's pasturn. She popped open the fasteners on the cumbersome yellow case and removed the new portable X-ray machine her boss and mentor, equine surgeon Dr. Brian Cutter, had entrusted her with.It only took a few minutes to set up and position the machine, and get Dakota to stand with his foot on the X-ray cassette. Taking the series of shots Brian needed to monitor the healing progress of Dakota's fractured leg took only a couple minutes more. She propped one used cassette against the side of the stall behind her so she wouldn't accidentally take two exposures on it, and set up for one final shot.\"Well, well, look who's here. If it isn't my darling Jenny.\"As always, the broad New England accent in his deep voice did funny things to the pit of her stomach. Apparently just telling herself she was over him wasn't enough.When Avery had asked her out the previous winter, Jenny had been flattered but cautious. His playboy reputation was no secret. She'd accepted because she'd sensed that beneath that smooth charm was a lonely man who needed her, and God, in his life.Getting Avery to open up proved more difficult than she had imagined, but because she cared about him, she hadn't been willing to give up. Jennifer Grant never walked away from a challenge.In the end, she'd turned to a mutual friend, Lindsey Cutter, for help. Avery and Lindsey had served together in the CGMCG. Lindsey told her that Avery had joined the army after a falling-out with his only remaining family member, his grandfather.Sensing she had found the key to understanding him, Jennifer had tried repeatedly to talk to Avery about his family, but he shut her out. After wrestling with her conscience, she'd made the decision to contact his grandfather herself. Her good intentions blew up in her face. Avery had found out and had been furious.Their breakup that day at her clinic was both public and humiliating. Then, as if to prove he'd never really cared about her, Avery spent the next several weeks dating a series of Jenny's classmates.Which only confirmed that he didn't care about me.Choosing to ignore her reaction to the sound of his voice, Jennifer snapped the last shot, braced herself, then rose to face him.Lizzie was in so much trouble. A heads-up really would have been nice.Leaning with his tan forearms resting on the half door, he grinned at her with a cocky smile that had probably melted more female hearts than she could count. It had certainly softened hers the first time she saw it. Fortunately, she knew him better now.Unfortu-nately, the lesson had been an emotionally painful one to learn.He wore the unit's standard issue red T-shirt. His matching red ball cap was pushed back on his head revealing his military-cut dark brown hair above his deep-set hazel eyes.Eyes that a woman could get lost in—if she didn't have the good sense to see Avery Barnes for what he was—a playboy who broke hearts without a second thought.\"I'm notyouranything, Private Barnes, and you know that I don't like being called Jenny.\"It had taken months, but she had patched her heart back together with will power and hard work. She wasn't about to let him think she still cared. She didn't. She wassoover him.\"It's Corporal Barnes now. I've been promoted since we last met and now that you mention it, Jenny, I do recall that you don't like being called Jenny.\"\"I'm busy. Go away if you can't be nice.\" She imbued her voice with as much toughness as she could muster.A second soldier came up to stand beside Avery. Jennifer recognized another member of the mounted color guard. Private Lee Gillis was dressed in the same red shirt with the unit's logo embroidered on it. His smile, unlike Avery's, showed genuine warmth.\"Hi, Jennifer,\" Lee said brightly. \"What are you doing here? I thought you'd be riding in the Deerfield Open today.\"Lee, like many soldiers assigned to the CGMCG, had never been on a horse before his transfer into the special unit a year ago. Everyone who came into the unit trained in cavalry tactic from manuals the U.S. Army had used during the Civil War. Once exposed to the world of equestrian sports, Lee had quickly become a fan of all things horse related, particularly show jumping and dressage. Jennifer often saw him at the local events when she was competing.\"Yes, Jenny, what are you doing here?\" Avery interjected with mock interest. \"Besides looking for me.\"\"I have absolutely no interest in seeing you. Dr. Cutter sent me to take Dakota's follow up films this month and if you call me Jenny one more time, I'm going to make you regret it.\"Avery shook his head as he gave her a reproachful look. \"Shame on you—threatening a member of the U.S. military.

It's the only one on this road.\"Finding the house wasn't the part she was worried about. It was what would happen when she got there. \"Thank you for your help. You've been very kind.\"\"Mommy?\"She looked down at her three-year-old. \"Yes, Brady?\"\"Where is my grandpa?\"\"Just a little farther and we'll meet him.\" As the bus pulled away, she looked around at the tall weeds growing alongside the drive. \"First we're going to stow our luggage here where no one can see them.\" She put the two suitcases behind the weeds, hoping that her son wouldn't ask why. She didn't have the heart to tell him they might not be staying.She said a private prayer that her father-in-law would at least offer hospitality for a few days. She prayed too that Tom Ransom had heard of his son's death; she didn't want to break the news that his son had recently been killed in a car accident.Forcing a smile at her child, she took his hand. \"Let's walk to Grandpa's house, okay, Brady?\"\"Is it very far, Mommy?\"\"I don't know, honey, but the bus driver said it was at the end of this road.\"\"I'm cold, Mommy.\"Early December in Oklahoma could be a lot worse, she knew; still, there was a biting wind. \"If we walk faster, we'll get warm.\" She led her son down the road. After a few minutes he noticeably tired. \"Keep walking, sweetheart.\"As they picked up the pace, she heard the baby awakening and soothed her with her voice. Poor Jenny. She would never know her daddy.On second thought, perhaps that was for the best, seeing as how Reggie Ransom was far from a model father. He'd walked out on them one afternoon, and she hadn't seen him since. Only when she managed to reach him and remind him of their existence did he bother sending any money for rent and food.She always knew Reggie wasn't the type to be tied down by a wife and kids. He wanted a carefree life, wining and dining on the rodeo circuit where he was a star.But Elizabeth had wanted a family to belong to so badly that she ignored her intuition and married him anyway, right after college. Especially after she found herself pregnant. She remembered thinking she was going to have everything she'd ever wanted.Too bad Reggie hadn't felt the same.As soon as they were married he told her he had to go back on the circuit.Elizabeth kept them afloat with her teaching job, paying the rent and Brady's day care bills. But when she got pregnant with Jenny and took ill, she couldn't work. Money was tight. Now Jenny was six weeks old, but with the school year started, Elizabeth had to wait for the next semester to be hired.She needed help now.Tom Ransom was her only hope. She hoped her father-in-law could offer just a little to help them along.\"Mommy?\" Brady grabbed her hand and tugged on it. \"Mommy? Is that his house?\"She looked up, surprised to see a white clapboard house and several outbuildings in front of her. \"Yes, I think so, Brady. It's very nice, isn't it?\"\"Yeah!\" After a moment Brady asked, \"Do you think Grandpa will like me?\"\"I'm sure he will. You look a lot like your daddy.\"\"Is that good?\"\"Your daddy was a handsome man.\" She didn't mention her husband's deficits, his abandonment of his family, spending all the money he made on other women and booze. No child needed to hear that.\"Mommy, I see Grandpa! Can I go tell him it's us coming to visit?\"She shaded her eyes and looked up at a tall, rugged man standing by a pickup. \"Honey, I don't think that's your grandpa. That man's too young. You'd better stay with me.\"She refused to give credence to the fear that clawed at her throat. Had this man bought the land from her husband's father?The man must have seen them, because he got in the pickup and drove down the drive to them.\"Are you coming to the ranch?\"The man looked to be in his early thirties, with dark-brown hair under a Stetson. A typical rancher, she thought. But was he an owner? \"Yes, if… if it still belongs to Tom Ransom.\"\"It does.\"Her sigh of relief was audible. \"If you don't mind, we'd appreciate a ride to the house.\"He nodded toward the passenger seat. \"Get in.\"She helped Brady climb into the truck and then pulled herself and her baby up, feeling old beyond her years.\"I'm Elizabeth Ransom. I've come to visit my father-in-law.\"\"You're Reggie Ransom's wife?\" There was shock in his voice.\"He told his father about us?\" she asked, feeling pleased.\"No, ma'am. If Tom had known you'd existed, he'd have brought you out here a long time ago.\"So much for her good feelings. \"I… I hope he'll at least let us stay a few days.\"The man only grunted.He said nothing until they'd pulled up in front of the house. A large house, huge in comparison to the tiny one-bedroom apartment in which they'd lived.\"I'll come get you down,\" the man said gruffly. He hopped down and then came around to her door. \"Hey, little guy, you want to come over here and let me help you down?\"\"Okay,\" Brady said, climbing over his mother's knees. \"Will you catch me?\"\"Sure I will.\" When he took the boy to the porch, Brady looked at his mother.In spite of her tiredness, Elizabeth scooted down off the high seat.\"I'll go tell Tom you're here.\" He turned back. \"Just a minute. Where are your bags?\"\"W-we left the bags in the grass by the front gate.\"She followed him inside the back door, into the kitchen. Looking around the room, recently updated and spacious, she hungered for such a lovely working environment.The man came back to the kitchen. \"Tom's waiting.\"\"Thank you. Brady, let's go meet your grandfather.\" She took the boy's hand as he moved closer to her.She followed the man down a long hallway, realizing for the first time that she never got his name. He stopped at the last door and opened it.Elizabeth stepped into a large bedroom, where a man sat in a wing back chair in front of a glowing fireplace. He looked to be in his sixties, with a receding hairline pushing back his graying brown hair.\"Mr. Ransom,\" she whispered. \"I'm Elizabeth Ransom, your son's widow. This is my…our son, Brady, and our daughter, Jennifer.\"\"Come in, Elizabeth,\" he said in a small voice. \"I'm glad to meet you.\"\"Thank you, sir. I'm pleased to meet you.\"Tom shifted his gaze to the boy. \"Brady? Come here, boy. You look like your daddy when he was your age.\"\"Really?\"\"Yeah. And the little one?\" he asked Elizabeth. \"How old is she?\"\"She was born six weeks ago.\"\"You doing all right? It's tough to make a trip when your baby is that young.\"\"Yes, she came a little early because of… of the news I received.\"\"Tom, I hate to interrupt but I need to go get their bags.\" She'd almost forgotten that the man she'd met out on the driveway was in the room. \"They left them in the grass by the gate.\"\"Okay, Jack, thanks.\"At least now she knew his name. Jack.When the door closed behind him, she knew the time had come to make her plea.\"Mr. Ransom, I'm here because…\" She ducked her head, unable to make eye contact. \"Because I need help. I'll be able to get a teaching job for the next semester but… but I don't know how we'll make it until then. I wondered if the kids and I could stay here.\"\"But he was doing well, wasn't he?\" There was such sadness in the man's voice.\"I don't know. He sent me money every once in a while, but not often.\"\"So he left you broke?\"She pressed her lips together and dug in her purse. \"Here's my copy of our marriage certificate. Yes, he left me broke.\"\"I'm sorry.\" Did she detect a note of anger in his tone? \"I know he made a lot of money. He shouldn't have left you broke.\"\"I can get a job when the new semester starts, sir. It won't be forever that we'll hang on to your sleeve. I promise—\"Tom held up a hand. \"Don't worry about it. I've got lots of room here. Stay as long as you want.\"Elizabeth blinked away the tears. \"Thank you. I can keep the kitchen clean and do the housework while we're here.\"\"We usually have a lady come in to clean once a week.\"\"Who does your cooking?\"\"Me and Jack just manage. We take turns, and sometimes we eat in the bunkhouse.\"\"I don't want to intrude, but I could cook for you.\"\"Don't feel you have to.\"She smiled. \"I'd be pleased to cook for you, Mr. Ransom.\"\"Let's make it first names, Elizabeth.\"\"Thank you, Tom.\"He stood up and held out his hand. \"Welcome home.\"Jack Crawford revved the engine of the pickup as he wended down the driveway from the house. He'd seen the look on Tom's face when he laid eyes on his grandson. His old friend had been hooked like a fish at sunrise.He shut the engine at the gate and got out to search for the woman's bags. Why would she hide them in the weeds? Probably so she wouldn't look too needy when she came to the door.Instead she stood there, looking maternal, holding her son's hand and her daughter against her chest. The firelight had cast highlights on her light-brown hair and illuminated her tall, thin frame.Not that Tom would notice those things about her. He'd been too focused on the kids.His grandkids.Jack knew Tom Ransom too well. Beneath that crusty cowboy exterior beat the heart of the most righteous, kind and honorable man he knew.Tom would do the right thing.Starting today, the Ransom Ranch would have three new boarders.Maybe the kids were just what Tom needed to come out of the funk he'd fallen into since his wife's death and his son's departure. He'd lost interest in the ranch years ago, then lost interest in most everything. If it hadn't been for Jack, he would've sold the ranch long ago. Jack had been making it viable, turning a profit on the 2500-acre cattle ranch, and keeping Tom going at the same time.But now…?No, Jack couldn't blame Tom. The woman and her kids were family, after all.But where did that leave him?\"I've got your bags. Where do they go?\"Elizabet...", "related": [], "rank": 757075, "title": "Cinderella and the Cowboy", "author": "Judy Christenberry", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Readers initially make her acquaintance through entries in a fill-in book entitled \"My Book About Me.\" Her revelations are by turn caustic, funny and heartbreaking. Living in a group home for children after two unsuccessful stints in foster homes, Tracy repeatedly expresses her fervent hope and pitiable conviction that her roaming, much-idolized mother will appear to take her away. \"There's not much point making friends because I expect to be moving on soon,\" resolves the heroine, whose tough-kid veneer is wrenchingly transparent. An aspiring author, Tracy takes solace in her autobiographical writing and her new friendship with Cam, a writer who visits the home while researching an article. Despite Tracy's passionate attempts to persuade Cam to take her in as a foster child, her fate is uncertain at the close of the novel. Yet her indomitable spirit and grit leaves little doubt that she will end up on top. Sharratt's drawings help to keep the mood light, as Wilson again shapes a convincing and memorable heroine with a snappy, fresh voice.

While the sex between Gertie and Kevin is intense and fiery hot, what I appreciated most was the vivid descriptions Ms. Garza used to show the pain and fear which Gertie experienced after Kevin left her to fight a fire. These few scenes brought to mind what family members of a firefighter must go through every day when their loved one leaves for work. The placement of the secondary characters was perfect, lending needed support while never overpowering the story, but always letting the romance between Gertie and Kevin shine through.\"--Mystical Nymph, Literary Nymphs Reviews", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

How that decisive battle came about is the subject of Crisis, in which Hornblower accepts a dangerous espionage mission that helps draw the French into battle. Although the manuscript ends before the character actually begins his mission, it provides some fine naval action. This book also contains two previously uncollected storiesAone set in the naval hero's midshipman days, the other in 1848, when Hornblower is admiral of the navy. It's an indispensable part of any Hornblower collection, and most listeners will find Christian Rodska's reading preferable to that of Books on Tape's Gary Martin.AR.

Now, Clay Schmit tells us how to let our mission form our worship and how our worship can empower our mission. This manual unites the two so long disjoined--worship and mission. A wonderful book that will be gratefully received by the church.\"--Will Willimon, North Alabama Conference of the United Methodist Church\"For too long many of us have been content with utilitarian models of worship that attract worshipers but ultimately undermine the profound redemptive transformation that the gospel of Jesus Christ offers. This book points in another direction, inviting us to imagine how our public worship services express and participate in the fullness of God's redemptive mission in the world. May many congregational leaders pause to ponder the insights that Schmit develops here.\"--John D. Witvliet, Calvin Institute of Christian Worship, Calvin College and Calvin Theological Seminary\"Schmit is a beacon to churches navigating the seas of change. With a scholar's eye, a musician's ear, and a pastor's heart, he points to the church of the future, where worship is mission and deep unity is found in the midst of broad diversity.\"--Kimberly Bracken Long, Columbia Theological Seminary; editor,Call to Worship\"Embracing an ecumenical worship form is a particularly thorny issue in contemporary liturgical debates. Nevertheless, Schmit offers clarity on the central questions. The author's reach is wide; his understanding of liturgical principles, deep. This book will help ministers, laity, and students in every denomination to see beyond the tired rhetoric of the 'worship wars,' which the author believes to be on the wane. This is an important and much-needed book for anyone concerned about worship practices today.\"--Melinda A. Quivik, Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia\"An important work for those who desire thoughtful reflection on the theology and context of worship. Schmit's engaging style combines the mind of a scholar with the practical concerns of a minister. He goes beyond traditions to help the reader understand the role of worship in the mission of God. This book is a unique resource for anyone interested in helping churches to become missional.\"--Doug McConnell, Fuller Theological Seminary", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is amazing that the dynamic pattern calculus is syntactically almost as simple as the pure lambda-calculus, yet it is much more expressive.\"(Eugenio Moggi, University of Genoa)“More than anyone else, he has systematically explored both the theory and practice of pattern matching. More importantly, the knowledge thus gained has been largely transcribed into this book. Carefully written, it concisely explains the concepts surrounding the integration of pattern matching into both the operational semantics and the type system of two programming paradigms--functional and object-oriented. … The audience for this book is researchers in programming language design; for them, I highly recommend this book.” (Jacques Carette, ACM Computing Reviews, January, 2010)“This work brings a new perspective for a theory that would unify the driving forces behind the main sub-groups of programming languages … . The book addresses final year undergraduates, graduates from a research-oriented master and a broader range of specialists, experts in fields related to the foundation of computation. … the perspective exposed here can be of great use for specialists working in the design of programming languages or in the design of tools and Web services … .” (Mirel Cosulschi, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1215, 2011)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hall's captivating study of American Puritanism between 1630 and 1650 challenges this view and offers instead a portrait of a group of people deeply engaged in fostering vital alliances between civil government and ecclesial government. Drawing deeply on colonial records, the Harvard historian demonstrates that the Puritan colonists asked questions about who should have the vote and what kind of rulers they wanted, how the inheritance of property should be arranged, what role the civil state should play in religion, and how land should be distributed. He shows that the colonists, in contrast to their contemporaries in England, were ambitious to restore the religious practice of the earliest Christian communities, the Congregational Way. Hall's first-rate book offers a glimpse of a small slice of American religious history, challenging prevailing ideas about the nature of reform in Puritan New England.

Many aspects of this novel are based on first-hand stories told to him by relatives and family friends returning from WWII. At age 17, the author enlisted in the Naval Air Reserve at Port Columbus Ohio. In the late 1950s, he returned to Oklahoma to attend OU and OCU. Arnold's military experience included Air Force ROTC, tour of duty as an ASW aircrew instructor in a P2V patrol squadron, as a pilot with the National Guard and as an officer in the State Guard.

But psychiatric drugs may have serious side effects for children, and the benefits do not always outweigh the potential for harm. Wedge reveals how family therapists approach such symptoms as unhappiness, moodiness, or jumpiness, not as signs of a \"psychiatric disorder\" but as evidence of something wrong in a family that can be remedied with the right interventions. Without blaming parents, Wedge describes how she helps the family system as a whole, treating it as a living organism with an amazing capacity for self-healing. In her \"strategic therapy toolbox\" are such methods as getting parents not to fight or discuss financial matters in front of kids (children may have a tendency to exaggerate their parents' problems in their own minds), encouraging parents to speak positively about their lives, and learning to identify significant events in a child's life that may be related to when a problem behavior began. Like a clever detective, the author allows the child to guide her to the heart of a family's problems. Interweaving a range of fascinating case studies, Wedge proves that the road to a child's healing can often be successfully navigated without the use of labels and potentially harmful meds.

He grew up in the city of Wellington, renown for its high winds and the almost magical ability of rain and sleet to be lifted off the street and blasted into one's face. After eighteen years of suffering the cold and wet, he was finally blown away in a particularly bad storm to settle far away as a student, for more years then most would ever admit to. Then finally when the universities pronounced him done he became an overqualified and underpaid worker in the health sector, (aren't we all). He has lived in the city of Rotorua, one of the very few places in the world where people have actually chosen to reside beside active geysers and breath air that reeks of sulphur, for the past fifteen years. He works by day for his daily bread by speaking to people about their various diarrhoeal illnesses. While at night he toils away on his books. When not engaged in his great passions of reading and writing science fiction and fantasy, drinking strong black coffee (some call it tar), and consuming copious amounts of chocolate (dark naturally), he lives a quiet life of contemplation as the high priest to his two cats. His duties include worshipping them with regular gifts of food, the occasional grooming and providing them with a warm dry place to sleep. They in turn look down upon him with typical feline disdain, but occasionally deign to bring him gifts of headless vermin, - as a warning. In a desperate bid to understand the meaning of his life, he has recently started studying philosophy, particularly metaphysics, and come to a startling conclusion. God is a cat!

Jake Morrison is a bright, young and ambitious attorney\nhell-bent on achieving his vision of success. But his vision is about to become\na nightmare. Zara Jane is a real-live Angel, sent from Heaven above to guide\nJake through these pivotal changes in Jake's life. She ends up working at\nJake's firm and dating him, so that she can watch over him. They fall in love.\nBut Jake rejects the message and her love and his life spirals out of control.\nAs an Angel Zara Jane imparts wisdom and insight for his life and world, and\nexpresses her insight on the road that lies ahead, not only for Jake, but also\nfor humankind as a whole. After Zara Jane has been given\npermission by the Angel Oversight Committee that she would be allowed to live\nwith Jake and experience human emotions, like love, first hand.

While they stake out the doctor, they stumble into a hit on his wife. The hired assassins are Fat Boy and Cobra Man, both major-league psycho killers. The wife is butchered, as are Bill's companions; he escapes and turns to his Uncle Hank for help. Reluctantly, Hank gets involved, recruiting his long-estranged brother Arnold and going up against the gruesome twosome. This launches The Lost Lansdale, Subterranean's issue of older, unpublished work from the much-admired noir crime writer (Bad Chili, Freezer Burn, etc.). The author's longtime readers will note his trademark deluge of salty profanity, stark East Texas settings, casual violence and graphic excess. They will also encounter an uncharacteristic lack of humor and a tedious predictability: the characters that wise readers expect to survive generally do, the remainder are far less fortunate. Of the many violent scenes, only one featuring a rape manages to truly shock. While not without raw power and some stylistic flourishes, this novel, written in 1991, is inferior to Lansdale's more recent work and will appeal mostly to collectors and the most dedicated fans.Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All Truth and False answers follow each myth.Of the 101 items listed in the book the author has come up with the brilliant idea of testing each true or false myth with the reader, where prior to reading you are asked to deliberate as to whether or not the research could prove to be true or false.A couple of favourites of mine have to be ‘Having babies listen to Mozart will make them smarter’ ,’Women talk three times as much as men’ and ‘Consistently attending religious services increases life expectancy’.You’ll be fascinated by many of the answers in this publication and if I dare mention that we’re heading for Christmas, it will be a great stocking filler for someone who thinks they know it all.Just to give you a taster, you will not catch cold quicker if you go out with wet hair and ‘starving fevers and feeding colds’ is also a myth.Uncover some of the truths …it’s fascination personnified!.EuVue\"101 Common Myths and Misconceptions\"By Brian Clough", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I don't outline a story on paper because I don't want to ruin the finish for me. The few plots I've laid out ahead of time have never made it to print. I get bored because I know how the story is going to end ahead of time.I make notes as I go and \"fly by the seat of my pants\" from there. I have a basic mental idea of what I'm going to do but nothing is written in stone. My first book was an expansion of a short story I wrote many moons ago. (That short story is in my free book at Smashwords \"Strange Short Tales\" and titled \"Diary of a Grave Mistake.\" There's a stark contrast in how the short ends compared to the book.. but it's a good stand alone short story that will not ruin the ending of \"The Beginning. (Whispering Pines Book One.)\"My second book in the Whispering Pines series (The Revenge) was a pure spin off of the first.. but while writing Revenge, I started a sub plot that kept growing until it was distracting from the main plot. I ripped it out and that became my third book, \"Rebel Gold.\" While writing Rebel Gold, another sub plot grew too large and that became my fourth book, \"Cotton Tears.\" (etc etc on down to book six, \"The Garden Patch\" which started me down the yellow brick road to book seven that is under construction, tentatively titled \"Permuda Grass.\" (An intentional misspelling of Bermuda grass, but it's how southern children pronounce it.)As for my forte.. I've never been comfortable writing mystery/fiction.. or horror.. or humor.. although all three genres I've used in print with good success. If readers are looking for something under \"Wells Brand\" then it would be plain, rated PG, fun to read books and stories and a rather wide berth for genre.

How many books a year do you typically write?James Reasoner:Recently I've been averaging 14 books a year.Question: My God, that's amazing. How do you pull it off? What's the secret to being so prolific?James Reasoner:I once heard a writer described as someone who sat in a room and typed for 30 years. That's me. I don't do much else. Don't get me wrong -- I read, I watch movies, I do things with my family -- but when I go on vacation, the computer comes along and the work continues. I don't take time off between books. Often I've finished one book in the morning and started another that afternoon. But I think the real secret is that I enjoy writing. I have fun, and that's good since I spend so much time doing it. I've also been very lucky to have as many opportunities as I've had.It helps, too, to be married to an award-winning author in her own right (Livia J. Washburn), who helps immensely with plotting and editing.Question: Although you've written in many genres, most of your work seems to be westerns. What attracts you to the genre?James Reasoner:I didn't set out to be a Western writer. My goal was to be a mystery writer, and I wrote and sold more than a million words of mystery fiction before I ever wrote a Western. But I'd always been a reader and fan of Western novels, and when the chance to write one came up, I was more than happy to give it a try. My motto has always been, \"Sure, I can write that.\" I was working for a book packager at the time, and the company produced several different Western series. I really enjoyed writing that first one and found that I was good at it. My editor liked what I'd done and wanted more, so I became a Western writer. I love the genre because the Western is the classic American story. Also, it provides an opportunity to write many different kinds of yarns. I've done quite a few Westerns that are really mystery novels, I've done horror Westerns, I've done family sagas . . . There's just no end to what you can do with a Western.Question: Writing books in a series you didn't create obviously isn't new for you....how many different series have you contributed to over the years?James Reasoner:At least 30. Maybe a few more.Question: What appealed to you about The Dead Man series?James Reasoner:The Dead Manwas my first chance to write a really strong supernatural thriller. I mentioned that I've done horror Westerns, but these were novels that wound up having largely rational explanations for seemingly supernatural elements (what I call the Scooby-Doo Ending).The Dead Manis much closer to true horror, which is something I've always wanted to write. That, combined with the really fast-paced thriller element, was just an irresistible opportunity for me.Question: How did your experience writing all those western series prepare you for The Dead Man? And what were some of the unique challenges?James Reasoner:My Dead Man story is set in the American Southwest, so having written a great deal about that area allowed me to get the geography and the physical setting as right as I possibly could. Plus Westerns usually have a lot of action (mine certainly do, anyway), so I have plenty of experience in writing those sorts of scenes. Actually, that ties in with the challenge of writingThe Blood Mesa. This is a horror novel, so I had to ask myself just how graphic to make the violence. It wound up being, well, pretty graphic.Question: What did you enjoy most about writingThe Blood Mesa?James Reasoner:The pace, the action, the chance to write something where the reader (and by extension, the writer) almost never has a chance to take a breath. That was great fun. Plus the character of Matt Cahill and the situation in which he finds himself is very compelling. I was a big fan of the series before I ever wrote a word of my entry.Question: What was it like working with the originators of the Dead Man series, Lee Goldberg and William Rabkin? Is it the same as working with the editors on a western series?James Reasoner:Lee and Bill were great. They know Matt Cahill better than anyone else, of course, and were very helpful in making sure that I captured the character. We were on the same page as far as the pace and structure of the story was concerned, too. I've been lucky to have many fine editors over the years, and those two guys certainly fit that description as well.Question: What other books do you have coming up?Right now I haveTractor Girl,a hardboiled crime novel set in the Texas during the 1950s, available on Amazon for the Kindle and as a trade paperback from CreateSpace. I'm very fond of this one. It's a story I've wanted to write for a while. Later this fall my next book in the Rancho Diablo series will be available as well. This is a Western series I co-created with Mel Odom and Bill Crider, which we're writing under the house-name Colby Jackson. It's the on-going saga of a family establishing a ranch in Texas during the 1870s. Plus I'm continuing to write other Westerns and the occasional thriller under various pseudonyms.

Successively acquired by Ace, Berkley and Silver Saddle, the book was left in limbo when all three publishers went out of business. Now in print at last, the tale begins in 1875 as Jim Melgrhue and his partner, Bob Bucklaw, ex-cowpunchers and gold miners, are forced into joining a ragtag gang of train robbers led by Major Beau Carson, a former Confederate officer who rode with the guerrilla cutthroat Quantrill. On their first major job, Melgrhue and Bucklaw see that Carson means to eliminate all the train passenger witnesses. In their attempt to prevent the slaughter, Bucklaw is killed and the badly wounded Melgrhue is left for dead. Nursed back to health by a giant mountain man, Liver-Eating Johnston--known as the legendary Crow Killer--Melgrhue is befriended by an outcast Crow warrior, Dead Thing, and sets out to find Carson and avenge his partner's murder. The trail leads to the notorious mining town of Deadwood Gulch, where Melgrhue hunts down the bad guys, one by one. After the obligatory purifying sun dance with Dead Thing, he wins another ally when he saves Wild Bill Hickok's life. The hunt for Carson finally ends at Little Bighorn, where Crazy Horse helps settle the villain's fate. Embellished with historical references and characters, this quaint shoot-'em-up is a near-perfect model of the time-honored, much-cherished Zane Grey/Louis L'Amour classic western.

At 13, Hyde ran away from home, hopping a train from Wisconsin to his uncle's ranch in Oregon. Like countless other American kids in the 1930s, he wanted to be a cowboy. Hyde became that, and much more: rodeo clown,Lifephotographer, WWII soldier, author, historian and driving force behind the campaign to save the country's few remaining herds of wild horses. It's a dramatic life story, and Hyde has a raconteur's gift for telling it well. He vividly describes his initiations into the trade of cowboy, enduring the ridicule of grizzled ranch hands with little patience for a gangly teenager. Hyde earns their respect by risking his life to herd cattle through a blizzard; he earns some more by breaking horses no one else is able to tame. After he fights the Nazis, he organizes a rodeo inside a Roman coliseum in liberated France. His adventures over the years are populated with a colorful collection of friends. Some are towering figures who embody the Old West, like the septuagenarian cowboy who thinks nothing of tracking, capturing and taming a wild mustang in a single afternoon. Others seem like characters from a saloon act, like the two drunks who, attempting to dig a grave with dynamite, accidentally blast the surrounding coffins above ground. One especially captivating personality is rodeo clown Slim Pickens, whose lopsided grin would eventually enliven films likeDr. StrangeloveandBlazing Saddles. Hyde mourns these figures' passing along with the West he loved. As wistful as it is humorous, this salty memoir is also an elegy for a bygone era.

A new book suggests that historical battlefields have been littered with the corpses of thousands of Scots who died needlessly because they refused to walk away from a fight they had little chance of winning. It claims that had common sense prevailed, famous battles such as Culloden, where the heavily outnumbered Jacobites were defeated by King George II's army in 1746, would not have happened. Paul Cowan, the author of Scottish Military Disasters, said history was filled with accounts of Scots troops suffering casualties because theyrefused to back down against seemingly insurmountable odds. He claims the heroic but sometimes reckless spirit has endured and that modern Scots will rarely back away from a fight. Last year, Smeaton was among a number of Scots who received bravery awards after tackling two men who tried to bomb Glasgow airport. One member of the public suffered a broken leg and lost two teeth after being knocked to the ground by one of the terrorists, and anothertore a tendon in his foot. 'The problem is that the Scots just don't know when to call it quits', said Cowan, who was born and raised in Scotland, but now lives in Saskatchewan, Canada. 'My own experience growing up in central Scotland suggests that the \"fight or flight\" switch in the brains of most young Scots males is more likely to flip to \"fight\". I guess that's down to living in a macho culture where any signs of weakness or cowardice are despised. 'After the attack on Glasgow airport, I think people around the world were surprised that some onlookers stood their ground.' Cowan cites the bravery of the Sutherland Highlanders at the battle of New Orleans in 1815.While soldiers from other nations turned and ran in the face of the American army, the Scots regiment stood firmand was mown down by cannons and muskets. In 1940, members of the 51st Highland Division refused to believe they had been ordered to surrender to the Germans under General Erwin Rommel at the French town of St Valery-en-Caux. They wanted to fight on. Historians believe the charge of the Jacobites on Drumossie Moor in Inverness in 1746 cemented the Scots' reputation as formidable opponents on the battlefield. It meant Scottish regiments were often placed on the front line to intimidate the enemy. 'From the 18th century onwards, the Scottish regiments were the military cutting edge of the British empire and were always used in a spearhead role, and that meant huge casualties,' said Professor Tom Devine, the historian and director of the Centre for Irish and Scottish Studies at Aberdeen University. 'This is where, in a sense, Scotland is hoisted by its own petard, because by 1914 the Scottish soldier had an international reputation for valour and was used as shock troops in those horrendous battles on the western front.' Mark Macaskill, The Times, May 10, 2008  We are renowned for being a nation talented in snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Cheap as this statement is, it is no truer than when applied to Scotland's military history. Here former war correspondent Paul Cowan has compiled a blitzkrieg history of famous defeats, revealing an inauspicious part of our past. It spans a 2000-year period, beginning with Agricola's campaign in Caledonia at the battle of Mons Graupius in 83AD where, according to Tacitus, the Celtic leader Calgacus uttered the chillingly contemporary riposte to Rome's so-called civilizing:'They give the lying name of empire; they make a desolation and call it peace.'Well-known accounts of events like Edward Hammer of the Scots' defeat of Wallace at Falkirk in 1298 dominate but perhaps the most interesting touches are vignettes such as the 211 young troops who died in a train crash at Gretna en route to Gallipoli in 1915. Perhaps too cursory for the scholar, this pacy, lucidly written history is extremely readable and highly informative. MARTIN TIERNEY, Sunday Herald, 17th August 2008  Wha Killed The Braw Lads? When Scottish soldiers ended up on the losing side. 'THERE is something unnerving about a screaming man charging head on at you with the sole intent of impaling you on a piece of sharpened steel.' I'm in total agreement with that observation. The steel in question is a bayonet, firmly clamped to the business end of a rifle barrel, but the key word is unnerving as countless troops in numerous battles have discovered for themselves. For the opposition it was time to turn and run and they always did, despite the fact that very few battlefield injuries were actually caused by bayonets. The sharpened length of steel was (and still is) a psychological weapon rather than a physical one. This observation comes from journalist Paul Cowan in his paperback about Scottish regiments at war. But this is no elongated paean to the glory of our victorious lads surmounting the odds in various parts of the Empire and Europe.This work is very different, for its title is Scottish Military Disasters. There were plenty of those - nearly 2000 years' worth, from Calgacus and his hordes losing out to the Roman legions at Mons Graupius right through to the first Gulf War in 1991 and the needless deaths of three Highlanders at the hands of gung-ho US reservist pilots. The author doesn't mince his words when it comes to leadership, though the officers at regimental level come out fairly well. He reserves his true vitriol for the high-ups. I don't recall his use of the word 'numptie', but you will know what I mean. High on the latter list must surely be Lt General Aylmer Hunter-Weston, a Scotsman whom Cowan describes as the Clown Prince of the Gallipoli campaign. His incompetence cost the lives of hundreds of young Scots in the 8th Scottish Rifles, part of the 52nd Lowland Division's 156th Infantry Brigade.Told of the slaughter, his unfeeling response was: 'That will blood the pups.' One of the pups was the author's great-grandfather. History, of course, is full of 'what ifs'? While not a military disaster in the accepted sense, the death of King Alexander III in 1286 when he rode over a cliff during a storm dramatically altered Scotland's history. Had he lived we might never have heard of Wallace or Bruce and Paul Cowan is right to include this. He includes so much more that changes our view of great historical events. Remember that famous painting of the Gordon Highlanders hanging on to the Scots Greys' stirrups as they charged the French at Waterloo? Dramatic stuff, but who recalls that later in that same charge the over-enthusiastic Greys were cut to pieces by French Cuirassiers, losing 100 dead and another 100 wounded out of their total strength of 350 troopers? One of Scotland's greatest military disasters was Flodden in 1513. But what went wrong, especially as the Scots outnumbered the English army two to one? How did the Cameronians come by their name? And why is the White House painted white? Lots of questions. Paul Cowan answers all of them and many more. A fascinating and highly recommended read.

Its emotional resonance and narrative sweep fascinate to the end.\" Alan Bissett, author of Boyracers, Death of a Ladies Man, The Moira Monologues and Pack Men.    \"an accomplished debut novel ... The Incomers is a comment on the universality of prejudice as well as an emotive work of fiction.\"  Alastair Mabbott, The Herald.    In 1966 Ellie and her baby son Nat arrive in Scotland from west Africa to set up home with Ellie's Scottish estate factor husband. The only black faces most of the population of the small Fife village of Hollyburn have seen outside of the TV up to that point, their arrival causes something of a stir. The Killearn author was taking something of a risk with the subject matter of her debut novel, taking on something that could so easily have gone so wrong in so many ways.  Thankfully McPartlin manages to avoid the booby traps, creating in Ellie a character who is engaging, sympathetic and above all very real.  The same goes for the villagers themselves, where ideas about the newest face in town are divided in ways that feel perfectly convincing.  Some you might say are more bigoted than others, but nowhere among them is there the torch-wielding, foaming at the mouth racist that might have stirred the reader's blood, but would otherwise have brought a cartoon quality to proceedings.  Ellie is never entirely friendless, getting on fine with cook and housekeeper Maggie Watson and forging something of a bond with fellow outsider, 10 year old English girl Mary - though this friendship will soon prove more difficulty than blessing.  Most of the racism as such is understated, even unconscious on the part of the perpetrators, and it's interesting to see how easy it is to follow Ellie's husband James's line of just \"giving it time\", before realising these are the words of a well-meaning but ultimately weak individual.  McPartlin's master stroke is the inclusion between chapters of phone conversations between two unnamed villagers.  Under the heading \"The Pairty Line\" they show how attitudes towards Ellie change over time as well as illustrating how she's hardly the only one subject to local gossip  -  and adding a hint of gloriously venomous humour to proceedings.  The way several strands are left unresolved at the novel's close might leave some readers dissatisfied, but again I found it entirely believable.  Ellie's journey is not over by the final page. At most she is at the end of the beginning.  Graceful, delicate stuff that masterfully builds as it goes, painting a picture of a time, place and people that is never less than engrossing.

In the persona of Hannah Rafferty, a child of the late '50s, brought up in a socialistic ethos, madness explodes with special ferocity. Hannah seems fated to be a Trotskyite; indeed, she becomes one when she takes a lover after her student days in London. Earlier, with Jack Rafferty, her idolized, idealistic father, she had been a schoolgirl marcher in Liverpool worker demonstrations. At home with Jack as ally, she battled the smothering Catholicism of her stepmother. Hannah's edging into dementia--the breaking point being the death of her unwanted baby--is almost foreordained. Yet it is in a mental hospital (where she is writing her memoirs on a toilet-paper roll in a lavatory cubicle) that she begins to piece her life together. Rejecting a turncoat lover and an earth mother, the controlling head of her extended bohemian family, Hannah is a militant survivor. At its best in evoking the relationship between father and daughter, this ironically humorous, compelling novel traces the fading away of young revolutionaries into lives dimmed by harsh realities.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B005QBHAGU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Filled with drama and danger that lead to a happy ending, A KISS AT KIHALI will appeal to readers who love tender romance and who have personally experienced the intense, mystical bond between humans and animals. I hope A KISS AT KIHALI will draw attention to the danger faced by these majestic animals who are now at the edge of extinction and I have donated to organizations dedicated to this effort.", "related": [], "rank": 1305232, "title": "A Kiss At Kihali: A Clean Love Story (Strong, Savvy Women...And The Men Who Love Them Book 1)", "author": "Ruth Harris", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.8571, "rating_total": 34.0}

Journey's End, inspired by Sherriff's own experience of fighting, was his sixth play but the first to be given a professional production. It was an immediate, outstanding and phenomenal success. Thirty one separate productions ran concurrently around the world and it was translated into twenty six languages. Its success, however, was both a boon and a burden -- while it allowed him to give up the day job and devote himself full-time to writing, it often overshadowed his later work or was used as the yardstick against which it was measured unfavourably. Fortunately for Sherriff he was not only a playwright but also a novelist and a screenwriter. He wrote a best-selling novel, A Fortnight In September in 1931, and the screenplays for The Invisible Man (1933), The Four Feathers (1939) and classic films such as Goodbye Mr Chips (1939), for which he received an Oscar nomination, and The Dambusters (1955). Although Sherriff was occupied as a playwright and screenwriter he did not lose his urge to write novels and he followed the success of his first novel with The Hopkins Manuscript, Chedworth, Another Year and others. Now, while Journey's End continues to define Sherriff's reputation, much of his work remains ripe for rediscovery.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Instead of a high-spirited and affectionate tale of rock-and-roll radio, however, Keith (The Forever Season) gives us the cautionary fable of Jimmy Gill, an orphan whose early love of radio in 1950s Birmingham changes his life. Indeed, he loses his soul as he grows from a disk jockey to the head of a satellite network. With his childhood friend Detroit Simmons, who has an intuitive aptitude for engineering, Gill parlays a radio station in Nashville into a satellite-uplinked national network of radio and cable-TV programming. But the money Gill uses to make the initial purchase comes from the drug-dealing of the dangerous George twins, and it comes back to haunt him at the height of his power and fame. All the ingredients are here for a great story, but Keith shows us far too much of Gill's corporate fall and not enough of the joy in his radio rise. As Gill becomes more interested in corporate power, his appeal plummets. Moreover, too many chapters read too often like print versions of a 1930s Hollywood biopic (Jimmy discovers the untapped power of FM; Jimmy discovers the untapped power of cable TV), and the ending is hokey and preachy.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As the title implies, this segment of Islena's journey will be fraught with no small measure of suffering and deprivation.Daughter of the Tempest...Champion of Light...Mother of Iniquity; these three ascendant souls stand as sides of an equilateral triangle that has spun endlessly through the eternal river of time...the physical manifestations of a conflict that has been fought at different junctures through the history of a thousand worlds...a thousands realities. With each tragic resolution these three adversaries are set adrift in the current of time until the inevitable moment of confluence when they will fight their battle again.InAbjection along the road to Apotheosis, Islena (Daughter of the Tempest) slowly begins to acquire a deeper understanding of her nature and the possible purpose she has been born to serve. As she struggles to accept that her current life is merely a subscript of a far-reaching existence, Islena's revelatory moment comes in her willing submission to an excruciating ordeal at the conclusion of which she will find genuine epiphany. The novel explores the process of rejection and acceptance as Islena makes the progression from struggling against the role she seems destined to play in this eternal conflict, to a kind of grudging acceptance of the burden of obligation. This concept of duality is only a small aspect of the underlying truth that awaits Islena, but within the scope of this novel, Islena discovers that her self-perceptions have been mere delusions and the life she's lived has been a distraction...a biding of time while awaiting the inevitable moment of fateful interaction with the other two ascendant beings mentioned above.In the course of this dark piece of fantasy, Islena begins to suspect that, in order to obtain the mantle of godhood necessary to vanquish her relentless enemy, she might first be required to sacrifice her own humanity. She then discovers that only through abjection and suffering on behalf of others, can she hope to cling to that humanity after this transformation is complete.Interwoven into this central theme of pain and epiphany are the tangential themes of attraction/revulsion to power and the desperate actions that are inspired by exigent need. Like all fantasy novels, Abjection explores the eternal conflict between good and evil, while shedding light on the morally grey territory that exist between these two extremes.As I mentioned earlier, this gaining of deeper awareness is an integral aspect of Abjection's central theme. As a bit of a spoiler, I'll let it drop that many of the conclusions that Islena will draw as a consequence of this epiphany will be proven false or at least, woefully incomplete in the concluding volume of this trilogy. Depending on your perspective, Islena Doraux may prove to be greater than the sum of her multi-faceted natures...or something considerably less.Islena's part of theJourney through the Land of Shadesseries will conclude with the forthcomingA Fallible Goddess and the enduring Sorrow.", "related": ["B005CASCSK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Chased from its habitat among California's giant redwoods, a mammoth grizzly worshipped as a bear god by the local Indians goes on a rampage. When the son of the Indians' chief is killed by the animal, the tribe seeks out Clint Ryan to hunt it down. Although he demurs at first, circumstances force him to join both Indians and other hunters and to go after the bear. Martin alternates between the point of view of the humans and that of the bear as it kills its pursuers one by one. Dialogue is often stilted and fails to ring true. The casual evil of Ryan's competitors in the hunt, never explained, seems largely unmotivated. Still, with tight plotting, Martin manages to keep the reader's attention, and series fans should not be disappointed.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 4.5833, "rating_total": 55.0}

Any level of home cook can find doable and appetizing recipes. For the\nhealthy-eating gourmand, there is Gazpacho as well as crab cakes with homemade\nmustard sauce. For the less experienced, Cherry offers a healthier pimento\ncheese spread and flavorful tomato soup. The cookbook primarily features common\nhousehold ingredients, but in some cases Cherry offers substitutes for less\nhealthy options. Soy flour is substituted for standard flour in her fried\nchicken recipe, and regular sugar is frequently exchanged in favor of Splenda. I really enjoyed \"50 Ways to Change the Way You Think\nabout Healthy Eating\" and I am excited to find healthier versions of\nthings I already cook. I already have a favorite recipe for hummus and homemade\npizza crust (both featured in the book), but Cherry's versions are healthier\nand more innovative. The only thing some readers might find frustrating about\nthis book is that it is not quite clear how many servings each recipe makes.\nSome are clearly meant for a single person, while others appear to be able to\nfeed a family. The greatest feature of this book is the dessert section.\nCherry's ideas for truly healthy and delicious desserts are as unexpected as\nthey are appetizing. She presents a lemon lime slush as well as oatmeal chocolate\nchip cookies that are cooked on a griddle (think cookie-pancakes!). Still not\nsold?

He cursed when his head hit\nmetal. Ignoring the pain shooting through his head, he started the car and\nquickly pulled out of the parking lot. Renny put the pedal to the metal. His\ncar shot forward, taking him away from the danger that had steadily escalated\nin the bar. He glanced at the rearview mirror and saw nothing but blackness. Whew, that had felt like a close\none, but maybe it hadn't been that bad after all. Renny hoped Hale was all\nright. The crashing sound was hopefully nothing more than a chair being thrown.\nThat was a normal occurrence in a bar, right? He wasn't sure what had caused\nHale to send him away, but he figured he'd ask his boss later today. Headlights appeared ahead of him,\nand he tensed for a second and then laughed at himself. The car was coming from\nthe way he was going, not where he was coming from. The car passed him, and\nwithin a minute its taillights disappeared. He was just about to breathe a sigh\nof relief when he saw a vehicle speeding up behind him. Fear gripped him in a brutally\nstrong hold. Needing to get away, he sped up. His four-cylinder engine didn't\nhave enough power to escape the vehicle closing in on him. His optimistic side\ntold him the vehicle bearing down on him could be someone in a hurry and that\nthey would soon be passing him up. He pictured a man rushing his\nin-labor wife to the hospital so their precious baby could be born with the\nhelp of her doctor. He hoped they lived happily ever after. Speaking of happily ever after...The\ndriver could also be a horny male rushing his man home to tie him down and fuck\nhim. Renny felt his cheeks heating up. He'd never been tied down by a lover,\nbut he'd seen it done on some porn sites. The scenes with dominating males that\ntruly cared about their lovers' needs always gave him a hard-on. Once he was\nthat hard it didn't take much effort on his part to have him blowing his load\nand sighing with relief. He looked into his rearview mirror\nagain and noted that the speeding vehicle was closer. His pessimistic side drew\na mental picture of a hungry wolf passing its prey up then turning quickly and\neating it. Renny groaned and tried to clear his\nmind. Glancing into his rearview mirror again, he saw that the vehicle was just\na few feet from him.Please pass me and keep on going. Adrenaline spiked in his veins as\nthe vehicle behind him lunged forward and rammed into the back of his slow-ass\ncar. He had a death grip on the steering wheel as his car spun around and\nskidded off the road. His car crashed into the bottom of the four-foot-deep\nbar-ditch, and his head hit the steering wheel with stunning force. Fuck! Flood waters be damned. The city\nshould never have created these deep-ass things. He made a mental note to\ncomplain about them if he lived to do it. His door was forced open, and his\nseatbelt was released before he could even try to get away. He was roughly\npulled from the car and held at arm's length by one of the men from the bar\nthat had wanted him to dance. Trepidation burned fiercely in his stomach. In a\nflash the guy's buddy from the bar was standing next to Renny's captor. He\nopened his senses and shuddered when he was touched by evil. This was bad, real\nbad. Renny had never encountered anyone with this level of darkness before. The greasy-haired newcomer rubbed\nhis hands and licked his fat lips. \"I see you've caught our supper. Let me be\nthe first to taste him.\" \"No, Marvin.\" His captor's voice was\nso loud and sharp that he cringed. Marvin's eyes narrowed and he fisted\nhis beefy hands. \"It's my turn. You got first taste last night. I want it\ntonight. Give him to me, Karl.\" \"No. He smells better than the guy\nlast night. His blood is special. It smells magical. I want him, and I'm going\nto have him first. Get back in the truck if you don't want to watch.\" Karl's\nwords sent a shiver snaking up Renny's spine. A loud growl was the last thing\nRenny heard before he was dropped. He hit the ground hard. Ignoring the pain in\nhis feet and hands, he inched his way around his car. Peeking through the window\nhe saw Marvin hiss as his incisors extended into dangerous-looking fangs. Renny\ncovered his mouth with his hands in an effort to silence the scream that\ndesperately wanted out. Marvin suddenly lurched forward and\ndragged Karl to the ground, and all hell broke loose. They were each showing\ntheir fangs as they hissed and struggled to defeat the other. The forceful\nblows they were striking each other with would have killed Renny in no time,\nyet they seemed to barely feel them. Making an effort to live, Renny got\nup and started running through the woods. His mind repeatedly replayed the way\ntheir sharp fangs had descended and how deadly they'd looked. Vampires must\nreally exist. He'd always thought they might. His mom had raised him to believe\nthat other beings shared the earth with humans. Until tonight, he'd never\nencountered anything but humans. As far as he knew, that is. If all vampires\nwere evil like the ones he was running from, he hoped he never saw one again.", "related": ["B00LMMBYMS"], "rank": 1167677, "title": "Vampire's Mate [Vamp Mates] (Siren Publishing Classic ManLove)", "author": "Dakota Dawn", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is someone who cares about the people around him, who wants to improve the society we all live in, who hopes on a daily basis to leave the planet a little better than it was the previous day and who is cognizant that the impact he has on the world is minimal. Tilting at windmills is a major part of his character as is a deep love for all those who need to be loved. In his own mind he is a complex, multi-layered, unique character in the kaleidoscoping drama of life. Most of my writing deals with social issues that I feel need addressed.   My feelings are generally worn boldly on my sleeves and that is how I address social issues.   Parents that travel or are deployed, domestic abuse, feelings of alienation, bullies, blindness, stepmothers, the demise of pets are all things that I have addressed or plan on addressing in my books.    My target market is children.   This is most likely due to my personal unwillingness to accept all aspects of maturity.    What kids feel and understand is often grossly underestimated.   I have hopes of providing kids with some help in dealing with social issues that many of them face.    Most of all I hope to write things that kids will want to read.   As our society becomes more and more technical there is one old skill that is increasing in demand, the ability to read and to comprehend what you read.   The ability to read a book certainly provides you with the ability to read a technical manual or to read the text on a LCD screen whether it is on your computer or your cellular phone.   Reading for enjoyment not only broadens the mind, it can decrease stress and make life more enjoyable.   Success is measured in many ways.   I felt successful in my working life whether it was slinging baloney, teaching or fixing computers.   When I had a 7 year old approach me and tell me she loved my book I truly felt I was an author.  My goal as an author isn’t selling a lot of books.  My goal is to touch children’s lives and help them live life a little better.    Education: B.S.

It is an admiring biography constructed from long stretches of personal experience with Farmer, international health specialist and infectious disease expert, whose focus was always the Haitian poor. Farmer has spent his life taking modern medicine (as well as schools, houses, sanitation, and water systems) to a poverty-stricken area of Haiti and to underdogs around the world. Lending \"a voice to the voiceless,\" and working as a clinician as well as an organizer, he developed Partners in Health, funded first by a Boston philanthropist and later by the Gates Foundation and now internationally active. While French's adaptation follows the same sequencing, his compression removes much of the detail that made the original so readable and interesting. Omissions make episodes difficult to understand and, at least in one case, a description of one character is applied to another. Still, books showing how one person can make a difference are always welcome in young adult literature and this one will be appreciated where the young readers' edition of Greg Mortensen and David Oliver Relin's Three Cups of Tea (Dial, 2009) has been popular. But for the full flavor of the man's life and his impact on the author, older readers should seek out the original.-Kathleen Isaacs, Children's Literature Specialist, Pasadena, MDα(c) Copyright 2011.

It wasn’t long before he realised that he much preferred working behind-the-scenes in marketing and publicity, and eventually in producing musicals. For the next ten years, he produced shows, established theatre groups and had a finger in all aspects of production, including the occasional onstage cameo when a silent walk-on part beckoned. At age 22, he commissioned and professionally staged the full-length concert musical version of Mike Batt’s The Hunting Of The Snark and launched the first show by Australian comedy duo The Umbilical Brothers. He toured a series of one man shows and helped to develop several new musicals. In 1994/5 he was a co-producer of one of the world’s first amateur productions of Les Miserables which ran for 42 performances with over 40,000 people attending the show. Based in London, Douglas is now Editor of Amateur Stage Magazine where he continues to stimulate interest in amateur theatre and encourages development of modern theatre practice.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A complete, total retirement is out of the question when Andrew is concerned. There are just too many exciting developments going on in the world today. His first date with the publishing industry came when Andrew was barely in his mid-twenties and published a specialty book in his field. Two more professional books (one co-authored) followed much later. The books and numerous short publications as well as presentations at various conferences gave Andrew a broad exposure within the Fortune 500 companies and allowed to build up serious international consulting contacts. His professional life saw him working as an academic teacher, an engineer in several industries, and lately as a private consultant. His work took him across Europe, North and Central America, Australia and the parts of Asia.

Sweet praise songs to her musical, handy, salt-of-the-earth lover are matched by warm, incisive tributes to Gloria Steinem, Oprah, Gabrielle Giffords, Cornel West, and Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. In verse and photographs, Walker tells the story of her “adoption” of an orphanage in Kenya for children who lost their parents to AIDS, a project bolstered by her receiving the Lennon Ono Grant for Peace. In her nimble poems of celebration, Walker distills struggles, crises, and tragedies down to bright, singing lessons in living with awareness and joy. --Donna Seaman", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While walking along the beach in Florida, she saw a gopher tortoise on an empty lot.  What would a land turtle think if he met a sea turtle?   Being able to try out her work on her own class has also given her some great ideas and suggestions from the “real experts” in children’s literature.  “Children are all about fun --- if it isn’t fun, they will not engage in the book or activity,” she suggests.  “Teachers often make the best writers and illustrators for children’s books because of their unique insight.

However, the resident phantom turns out to be Sir Percival, a harmless teenager who smells like strawberries. Before long, the girls discover that the real ogres are the landlords, miserable and selfish busybodies who hate anything doubled. They want to take back the castle, now a bed-and-breakfast and the only home Daphne has ever known. Quicker than you can say \"sitcom resolution,\" the three witches call up an army of ghosts led by Sir Percival to scare the landlords into never interfering again. Although the plot is slight, the twins' personalities offer a nice contrast; Luna is more careful and cautious while Claire dives into every situation with gusto and doesn't sweat details. She and Daphne compete about almost everything, leaving poor Luna to break their ties. Charming black-and-white drawings head every chapter. This quick and winsome book will satisfy reluctant readers and fans of series such as Barbara Park's \"Junie B. Jones\" (Random), Paula Danziger's \"Amber Brown\" (Putnam), or Megan McDonald's \"Judy Moody\" (Candlewick).–Tina Zubak, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, PACopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I live outside of Tampa, Florida with my fabulous wife Anita, and one remaining son at home, Montana. I have three older boys, Mark, Gary, and Anthony, all of whom have married and presented us with terrific grandchildren. I read hundreds of books by the science fiction greats growing up, and thousands of fair to not so greats in dual novel paperbacks and magazines. My education gravitated to science, starting out as a physics major and my depression era folks told me I'd never make a living as a theoretical physicist (probably right, and Cosmology wasn't a career field then), so I moved to Electronics Engineering. I did most of that in the aerospace field for MacDonnell Douglas Corp, in St. Louis, Mo. I worked on the F4 Phantom project, and briefly on Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL), before the fickle fates of government finance forced contract cancelations. I devoted (read: I was drafted into) two years' service for the US Army from 1965 to 1967. A great two years, and the Army, caring not a whit for my electronics background, offered this draftee a job as an Air Traffic Controller. Cool! After discharge I spent a short time back at MacDonnell Douglas before the contract reductions laid me off, and was hired by Emerson Electric (1968), working on the design of a neat heads-up fire control system for the Army's new Cheyenne Helicopter (to be a 270-knot hybrid fixed wing/rotor craft). Never heard of it? The fickle fates of Army finance is why this time, plus Lockheed didn't keep the airframe part from crashing and burning at a crucial point in development. I taught Electronics for about eighteen months (near starvation wages after the high pay), and finally decided to try my hand at actually supporting my family again. I hired on with the Federal Aviation Administration as an Air Traffic Controller in 1970. Thanks Army! I spent exactly forty years in federal service, deciding in 1979 to use my technical background to work on writing features for the software of the FAA's Terminal Automation Systems (for 28 of those 40 years). Retired, I now work as a consultant/contractor for the FAA, supporting a software feature I helped create. I finally decided to try my hand at writing what I love to read, Science Fiction. My Koban series is doing very well. I hope you enjoy the books.

Being called a\n'schizo' by many people, due to her imaginary friend Anna Nigma, she\ndidn't think there was anything wrong. She loved having Anna to talk to,\n especially when she had a father that was too busy for her. But, when\nher mother dies tragically, Anna disappears and Sarah is left to fend\nfor herself. She learns that she can only rely on herself and throws\nherself into her job working with the LAPD. After she\nis shot, her friend Anna returns, and it might be just in time to help\nher break the killing spree by serial killer Raithe.When I first started reading this book I wasn't sure what to expect.\nWhat I didn't expect was an extremely unique plot, interwoven with\ncharacter development that you don't see too often. At first I wasn't\nsure how I would feel about the relationship between Anna and Sarah, but\n to see how these two friends got reacquainted and how their friendship\nblossomed after so many years, was wonderful. Without Anna's help, Sarah\n would not have been able to open up her mind to the fact that Anna\nwasn't imaginary at all, but a spirit searching for what happened to her\n in her short life here. Not only did she need Sarah's help, but Sarah\nneeded hers.I highly recommend this book to anyone that loves a good plot, some\nparanormal twists, and characters that will leave you wanting more.

He decided to utilize his knowledge and passion in teaching to satisfy a long time desire to disprove the axiom “those who can’t do, teach!” He wanted to make a statement that this wasn’t true for those dedicated to the teaching profession. In 1983 Oreste returned to school for a post-doctoral degree in Marriage and Family Therapy. Subsequently, he directed two Marriage and Family Centers, Allegra Counseling Centers that were successful. He continued to teach for about ten years during this time. However, Oreste began to experience a great hunger and desire to write and retired as a professor- psychotherapist to write full time. He has completed three books: Sin Is Necessary, Illusion vs. Reality---Sounds Within and Without, and is completing Intrigue in Rome. Dr. Rondinella has traveled extensively in the last twenty-five years and conducted research and interviews that contributed to his books. As of October 1, 2003, Dr. Rondinella has resumed his independent practice of marriage and family therapy including individual psychotherapy.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

On Valentine’s Day 2012 her second novel, Sleeping Beauty, catapulted to Amazon’s Top 100 List for Romantic Suspense. In March of 2012, she published an alternate ending version called Sleeping Beauty Wakes Up in response to fan feedback. In December 2012, both versions were named to Kindles & Wine “Best Reads of 2012.” In October of 2012, she wrote Alice in Wonderland in 35 days and e-published it seven days later.  Elle’s appearance on Digital Book World’s (DBW) “Successful Self-Published Authors” panel in January 2012 was noted in Publisher’s Weekly. In February 2012, she was named to Expert Messaging Group’s “25 Self-Published Authors to Watch.\" She is considered a “reluctant expert” on the topic of self-publishing and is well-known for taking advantage of her full creative control by pushing the envelope—and advising other self-published authors to do the same. Elle has contributed to articles on self-publishing for both TIME Magazine and Writers Digest. She’s been interviewed by USA Today’s Happy Ever After with Joyce Lamb, GoodEReader.com with Mercy Pilkington, “The Trash Talk Show” with Barb Tobias and “Your Book Is Your Hook” with Jennifer Wilkov.  In April 2012, Elle was invited to be a regular contributor to DBWs Expert Publishing Blog, an industry blog with 20,000 subscribers. She almost immediately created a firestorm of controversy by blogging that authors should respond to negative reader reviews—a blog that was later named one of the “Top 10 Digital Publishing Stories of 2012” for its “importance.” She was one of 93 authors—including over 50 New York Times bestsellers—invited to blog for National Read-a-Romance Month in August 2013. In January, 2014, Elle and co-host Isobel Irons, launched a self-publishing consulting company, The Book Escorts, as well as “The S&M; (Self-Publishing and Marketing) Podcast with Maven and Minx” on the Authors on the Air Global Radio Network. Beginning in 2014, this dynamic duo will present self-publishing workshops at conferences nationwide.  Elle lives in Denver, Colorado and keeps a miniature dachshund named Bacon around the house to provide comic relief.

Author Lilley Light draws her readers in deep with her fun and educational book on the naturally intriguing subjects of speed and transport. With 20 different types of transport being discussed, from a simple tricycle to a space shuttle, readers will pay full attention.Society is often attracted to the finer things in life, such as transport. Historically, human beings have only set the bar higher for themselves with the amazing inventions and top speeds that have been achieved and exceeded throughout the years. The author offers readers a brief history of each form of transport, an array of records and speed information to go along with a vivid photograph. For example, did you know that the bicycle was invented in 1817, but wasn't commercially recognized until 1863, 46 years later! The bicycle in those days was made of wood and had a very large front wheel and a tiny back wheel. The operator sat very high in the air, going 10 to 20 miles per hour when momentum was gained.Lilley Light offers readers a fun and intellectual book to read individually or share with others. The book is a wonderful read, offering facts, history, records, and photographs. The book is said to be for children, but an older reader is sure to enjoy it just the same.", "related": ["B00GHSVB0C"], "rank": 1974256, "title": "How Fast Does It Go?: The Speed of 20 Types of Transport From Tricycles to Cars to Space Ships", "author": "Lilley Light", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 50.0}

Danny spent almost all of his time playing on his computer until one day it needed to go to the shop for repair. Danny was very discouraged and wondered what he would do with his free time now that he would be without the computer for about a week. His mother encourages Danny to draw and read. He spends some time drawing anything he could think of and enjoyed this new hobby. One day, some of his neighbors came over and asked him to go out with them. This was the beginning of a fun-filled adventure, as he learned how to play with other children, play board games, enjoy the outdoors, etc. When Danny is told that his computer had been repaired and he could go pick it up, he is undecided about the computer as he had found so many other fun things to do.Uncle Amos engages young readers, making this a wonderful book to enjoy. The illustrations are done beautifully and the text is well written. This book captivates a young audience and would be a fun read for a parent and child, or a story time at a local library, or school. This would be a good book for a child that is only focused on one particular thing in their life and an excellent way to help them to open their mind to the additional possibility of fun and engaging things they could enjoy doing with others.", "related": [], "rank": 4009345, "title": "\" Danny's Computer \"Children's Book+eVideo(Bedtime Dreaming, adventure&education series for ages 3-10)(Beginner reader): Short story(Children's books early ... preschool)Bedtime stories collection", "author": "uncle Amos", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Christopher Martin writes with tested wisdom our need for restoration if we are to become what we already are. He is as conversant with Benedict of Nursia and Bernard of Clairvaux as he is about abuse, addiction, and the tedium of making mistakes. Christopher is a master weaver of poetry and art, ancient and new. He gives very shrewd spiritual direction when we stumble because of the fear or aggression we are loath to face. Some of his compelling stories will make your eyes twinkle; others will lance a wound, your wound. How countercultural his writing about the steps toward humility, admittedly a long climb, yet something so helpful and hopeful, and which he models. Christopher helps us settle into stillness so that we can really and finally listen to God.< --Br. Curtis Almquist, The Society of Saint John the EvangelistIn The Restoration Project, Father Christopher Martin has applied ancient Benedictine wisdom to the twenty-first-century spiritual journey and embattled post-modern Church. He has rediscovered (maybe re-presented) habits for living that are radically changing the character of Christian community and wonderfully enriching the lives of the people of God. Reader be forewarned: the ideas in this book may change your life. They have changed mine! --The Rt. Rev. J.

Avent is an erotic romance story about two\npeople so completely in love but their pasts always keep getting in the way.\nAbigail and Zach had just started dating, but they were completely in love;\nthey did not need more time to know that their love for each other was true.\nEach of them, however, has a past that just won't stay in the past. Abigail\nsuffered sexual abuse and this messed her up, but what messed her up even more\nwas the fact that her family did not believe her. Zach, on the other hand, has\na few dark secrets of his own, plus an ex that just won't get out of his life.\nThey are barely two months into the relationship, with exes still roaming in\nthe background, and dark and twisted pasts. As if that is not enough, more\ndrama just keeps flowing into their lives, plus a surprise they both did not\nsee coming.What's Lost in the Dark is a beautiful, erotic romance story about a couple struggling\nto reconcile their pasts so they can have a chance at a happy ever after. The\nmain character of the story, Abigail, is a sweet girl who I could not help but\nfall in love with, sympathize with, and relate with throughout the story as she\nstruggled to deal with all that had happened to her and the betrayal of her\nfamily when they refused to believe her. V.R. Avent created courageous and\nadmirable characters that were willing to do their best to reconcile the past\nso they could move on with their future. The book strikes just the right\nbalance between erotic romance and drama to create an enticing and captivating\nstory.", "related": ["B00DP5OA1W"], "rank": 2856693, "title": "What's Lost in the Dark (Dark Paradise, #2)", "author": "V.

He is a twenty-six year veteran of law enforcement and still currently works full time. (And no, not for the Alaska State Troopers.) Dave's entire family has always encouraged him to publish his writings through a book company, but with Alaska being so separated from the rest of the United States, that proves difficult at times. Create Space has opened up a new avenue for many people like Dave who live \"out in the boonies\". Those who don't have access to a publishing company's doorstep without a twelve hour plane ride. Dave lives with his wife, Sherry, and their two dogs; Daisy (a Golden Retriever) and Sasha (a Yorkshire Terrier). Their boys have long since grown up and moved to Texas. Dave loves Alaska spending as much time in the outdoors as possible. Both he and his wife, ride their Harleys around as much as possible through the summer months. SURVIVE is the first official novel that Dave has written. The second novel is on the way. It is still in the completion stages. SURVIVE was literally conceived and the first draft written in a hunting camp. It just took Dave the remaining time to complete the final extended draft and edit the novel. You could say that Dave's \"first novel\" in reality was written in high school. He submitted a twenty page paper to his English teacher, which went well over the allowed \"two hundred words or less\" quota. She still gave him an A and put him in for an English scholarship. Since that time, his dream has been to write on the side. But when a cop spends all day writing at work, it's a tough dream to follow. So bear with him and his next novel will be coming soon.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Writing From Your Own ExperienceOne of my beta-readers forEarly Dazeasked if it was my\nstory. Well, yes and no. It isn't a memoir, but it certainly draws more\non my life than any of my previous works.Jess' baby, Samantha, is essentially my daughter. The book follows\nher progress, with very minor adjustments. The Facebook posts which Jess\n makes are actually adapted from the ones I wrote at the time. I also\nhad the diary I kept to draw on. A lot of Jess' thoughts and feelings\nare ones that I had. It isn't a book based on research; it's based on\nexperience.That said, I didn't go through everything that Jess did. I didn't -\nfortunately - share her struggles to make enough milk for her baby. I\nwas very much a Gwen in that respect. However, I wanted to include that\npart of story because I know so many women go through that.\nBreastfeeding may be natural, but it's difficult for so many mothers.\nPumping full-time is not natural and so is harder still. Also, I know\nthat being good at making milk comforted me for my \"failure\" (and it\ndoes feel like that) to carry my baby to term. It must be doubly painful\n when milk production is slow too.Jess' relationships with her fiancé, friends and family are\nfictional. My husband supported me all the way. Likewise, although I\nwent through a lot of the things Jess did, we're not the same person.\nShe has plenty of attitudes I don't share. I always like to give my\ncharacters significant differences from me, if only to remind myself\nthat we're separate!But I did share her feelings of being cut off from the \"real world\".\nYou can't help it. When you're staying at the hospital, your life\nrevolves around the NICU. The flats Jess stays in were based on the ones\n I stayed in. So was the hospital, although my daughter actually\ntransferred to a different one once she moved into Special Care. For the\n purposes of the story, I needed them both in the same location. The doctors and nurses, however, are fictional.InEarly Daze, Jess develops a crush on one of the other\nparents. You may think this is a strange thing to happen at such an\nemotional time, but it isn't. It's actually common, for exactly that\nreason. You've just given birth, so your hormones are all mixed up.\nYou're suffering sleep deprivation, because you're pumping round the\nclock. You've suffered a big shock from giving birth early and you're\ncut off from your normal life. The result of all this is that you go a\nbit bonkers. While your brain struggles to sort itself out, you think\nand feel all sorts of strange things. The fact is: human beings are odd\ncreatures.They say you should write what you know. The trouble with writing\nabout a hard experience you've been through is that it's very hard to\nstep back from your work. When you write, you can do it for yourself.\nWhen you publish, you have to be able to put emotional distance between\nyou and your work, because otherwise you will be devastated when people\ndon't like it. And not everyone will - that's just inevitable. That's\nwhy I tried to make Jess a lot different from me, to make sure I could\nthink of it as her story rather than mine.", "related": ["B00EBZADES"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 4.1111, "rating_total": 37.0}
