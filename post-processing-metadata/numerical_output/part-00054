Against the advice of her gay best friend Geoffrey, she drags her protesting teenager, Cosette, to Glenhaven Park, N.Y., where shockingly high real estate prices leave her with only one option: a haunted house. Fortunately, the real estate comes with not just a ghost but also a hunky next-door neighbor from Meg's past: widower Sam Rooney, for whom she suffered an unrequited high school crush. Thrown together by their kids (he's a high school teacher as well as a soccer coach), their mutual attraction and things that go bump in the night, the pair are soon waging a futile battle against their romantic instincts. Rita Award–winning author Markham (If Only in My Dreams), a pseudonym for Wendi Corsi Staub (Don't Scream), provides a fast-moving, ultralight take on single parenthood, suburban sex and keeping up with the soccer moms that should please chick lit fans; anyone seeking depth should look elsewhere.(July)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The resulting endeavor, described in alternating chapters by Mr. Collins and four of the students, builds more than geometry as readers come to see them as individuals and as a developing unit. They include artistic tough guy James Harris III, who insists that the individual tetrahedrons color coordinate; Marcel the Magnificent, who works vigorously at his fathers barbecue grill; veteran foster child Sharice; and quietly ambitious Rhondell. Marcels dads recipes are sprinkled throughout. This novel is based on the true story of a Cleveland middle school tetrahedron built in 2002. Pearsall has a knack for creating strong narratives and characters that eschew predictability. While this solid, multivoiced offering is a hopeful one, the action is realistically gritty and true to its inner-city setting. The book may take a little hand-selling, but, like E. L.

Also, as stated, the book introduces methods of data analysis in geosciences using MATLAB. I purchased the book for the \"applications in geosciences\" part and not the \"MATLAB\" part. I have nothing, in particular, against using MATLAB, but I choose to use Python. Python is free, and I (and many, many others) believe it to provide more manageable and powerful numerical analysis capabilities as well as better overall peripheral integration (integrating with other programming languages, applications, OS systems, or other platform specifics). The nice thing about the book is that the MATLAB code snippets and brief implementation explanations, can be easily translated into python implementation. If you are tied to MATLAB, I don't think you will be disappointed. If you have some familiarity with python then you will also be able to glean allot from the content. Another reason that I enjoy this book, is that while it relies on quite a bit of advanced math and its application, it uses the math as an 'engineering type' book should - as a tool to use to solve a problem. The mathematical element flows nicely with the subject matter and I suspect that even an individual without a mathematics background could gain an appreciation for the math based on the context and would not necessarily need to know or learn every underlying aspect of theory that generated the mathematics used. This is refreshing to see in an advanced book - here is what you might be up against, here is what you need to get the job done.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Traxel looks at labor organizers like Mary \"Mother\" Jones, suffragists and prohibitionists (whom he simplistically dismisses as \"small-town, self-righteous bluenoses\"). Woodrow Wilson, whose presidency threads through this book, oversaw business and banking regulation. Victorian sexual mores gave way, divorce became more commonplace. Traxel suggests that America's crusading impulses were partially responsible for the country's entry into WWI, and ironically, the war quenched the nation's reforming zeal. Soldiers returned disillusioned and unable to find jobs: \"[l]ike the rest of the country, they increasingly felt that they owed only themselves.\" And so began an optimism about business and a determination to kick back and have fun that would carry America through the next decade. Traxel's approach is not especially original, and he overlooks the experience of African-Americans. Nonetheless, the book reads seamlessly, and it will serve a scholarly and general audience as a summary of an important era in U.S. history. 19 b&w photos.(Jan. 30)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Bazna, whose code name was Cicero, sold the film to the Germans for an estimated $1.2 million. Unfortunately for Bazna, however, the Germans paid him in counterfeit British notes, and he ended up with very little for his efforts.

And just like any other Monday morning her business partner and best friend, Roxanne Hartley, handed her a double-strength latte on her way in the door and asked her how her weekend had been.'Don't ask,' Scarlett said wearily, and took a reviving sip of the creamy latte.'So I take it the blind date your sister set up for you wasn't a success?' Roxanne said as she perched on the edge of Scarlett's desk.Scarlett rolled her eyes expressively. 'Depends what you mean by a blind date. Clearly this guy's idea was to turn up blinddrunk. He slurred his way through his sob story about his ex-wife for an hour and a half, until I finally managed to escape.''Poor you,' Roxanne said in empathy. 'But don't give up yet. There's got to be someone decent out there for you.''Decent would be good,' Scarlett said, booting up her computer. 'A good father-figure for Matthew would be good, too, but as soon as men hear I have a three-year-old son they seem to lose interest.''Yes, well, men today can be so shallow,' Roxanne agreed. 'They won't commit, and they want sex on tap.''Tell me about it,' Scarlett said as she clicked on her computer mouse to activate the screen to check her list of appointments. She put her glasses on and blinked, once, twice, three times, her heart giving a quick, hard thud when she sawthatname staring back at her.'What's wrong?' Roxanne asked in a guileless tone.Scarlett swivelled her chair to look up at her business partner, her face going pale with shock. 'You made an appointment formeto meet with Alessandro Marciano?' she choked.Roxanne grinned at her excitedly. 'Yes. I wanted it to be a surprise, otherwise I would have called you over the weekend to tell you about it. He phoned on Friday afternoon just after you'd left. It's a huge contract, Scarlett. He's worth zillions, and if we get the deal think of what it will do for us. We'll be featured in every interior-design magazine across the globe. We won't have to pay rent any more, we'll be able to buy the building, no—' She clasped her hands together in glee and added, '—we'll be able to buy the whole street!'Scarlett sprang to her feet, almost spilling her latte over her keyboard in the process. 'I'm not seeing him,' she said through tight lips. 'I don't want the contract. I want nothing to do with it.'Roxanne slapped the side of her head as if she couldn't believe what she had just heard. 'Have you happened to look at our financial statements recently?' she asked as she slipped down off the desk. 'Come on, Scarlett, our business loan is stretched to the limit, you know it is. I know things are often a bit slow in January, while everyone is still on summer holidays, but this is a chance in a lifetime. This is just what we need right now. Alessandro Marciano has bought the old Arlington Hotel building in the city. He's going to turn it into a luxury hotel, with three floors of penthouse apartments for the super rich. And he wants us to do the interior design.Us!Can you believe it? It's like winning the lottery.''I can't see him, Roxanne,' Scarlett insisted. 'Please don't ask it of me.'A light bulb seemed to come on in Roxanne's head as she peered at Scarlett. 'Hang on a minute, what… Have you dated him in the past or something?''More than dated,' Scarlett answered with a dark frown.Roxanne gave her a probing look. 'What do you mean \"more than dated?\"'Scarlett drew in an unsteady breath. 'He's Matthew's father.'Roxanne's jaw dropped open, and her eyes went saucer-wide.'He's what?'she gasped.Scarlett's expression became rigid with tension. 'I'm not going to see him, Roxanne. No way. I hate him for what he did to me, and I am not going to—'The unmistakable throaty roar of a Maserati suddenly sounded on the street outside. Both girls looked out of the front window of the studio, and watched as the car's black, sleek body was expertly manoeuvred in between their tiny fuel-efficient vehicles parked outside.Roxanne met her friend's startled grey-blue gaze. 'Looks like you're not going to have a choice,' she said, and added, with a little sheepish grimace as the front door opened with a cheery tinkle of the bell hanging on the back, 'Er…did I forget to mention the meeting was here, at nine-fifteen?'Scarlett felt every pore of her skin and every hair on her body stand to attention as that imposing, darkly handsome figure stooped as he came in through the door. Her heart started going like a jackhammer, the pressure building in her chest so overwhelming she wondered if the heavy thumping would be visible through the lightweight white linen of her blouse.His hazel eyes met hers, the brown-and-green flecks reminding her all over again of the myriad colours of a rainforest. But this time she felt as if there were mysterious shadows lurking in the depths of his gaze, as he stood looking at her in a watchful silence for what seemed like endless seconds.'Hello, Scarlett,' he finally said in that stomach-tilting velvet drawl that had been her downfall close to four years ago.Scarlett lifted her chin and turned to Roxanne, who was standing with her mouth opening and closing like a recently landed fish. 'Roxanne, would you please inform Mr…er…' She glanced down at her diary as if to remind herself of his name, before looking back up and continuing in the same haughty tone, '…Mr Marciano that I am not taking on any new clients as I am booked up until the end of the year.''But—' Roxanne spluttered, but was cut off by Alessandro who had stepped forward to smile at her with lethal charm.'Miss Hartley, would you be so kind as to leave Miss Fitzpatrick and I to conduct out meeting in private?' he asked.'No! Don't you dare leave,' Scarlett bit out hastily.Please, oh please, don't leave me with him;she silently begged the rest of the sentence with her eyes.Roxanne pursed her mouth, and after a moment's hesitation scooped up her bag and half-finished latte. 'Sure, I can do that,' she said, smiling girlishly at Alessandro. 'I have to see a man about some tiles anyway. I'll be back at eleven.'Scarlett sent her an 'I'm going to kill you for this' glare, before taking her place behind her desk in case her legs followed through on their current threat to fold beneath her.The studio door opened and closed with another tinkle on Roxanne's exit, but to Scarlett it felt more like the sound of a vault locking down for good.The silence thrummed in her ears, the air becoming so thick with it she felt as if a pair of hands was around the slim column of her throat, gradually increasing the pressure until she was sure she was going to choke.'So you are not interested in doing business with me, Scarlett?' Alessandro asked with a coolly impersonal smile.'No.' Her one-word response came out of her mouth like a hard pellet.'Why ever not?' he asked with an ironic arch of one dark brow. 'I thought you would be jumping at this chance to get your hands on my money.'She tightened her mouth even further, and forced her gaze to meet his. 'I am surprised you are interested in engaging the services of a filthy little slut—those were your words for me back then, were they not?'There was no sign of anger in his expression, but Scarlett could sense it all the same. She had known and loved that face so well in the three months they had been together. Every nuance of it was imprinted indelibly on her brain. The smile that could melt stone, the gaze that could heat blood, the mouth that could kiss like a teasing feather, or with such hungry passion her lips had tingled and been swollen for hours afterwards. Even now, after all this time, she could still taste the salt and musk of his lips and tongue, and her lower body began to pulse with the memory of how if had felt with him plunging between her legs.She crossed her legs under her desk, fighting the sensations brewing there. But it was almost impossible to control the hit-and-miss beat of her heart every time she encountered that brown-and-green flecked gaze.'Your sexual proclivities, I would imagine, have no bearing on your talent at interior design,' he said with an enigmatic look. 'You have a good reputation professionally. That is why I am keen to have you wholly responsible for the project I am about to commence.'Her chin went even higher. 'I told you, I'm not available.'His mouth tilted slightly. 'Perhaps before you throw away this chance, Scarlett, you should at least look at what I am offering.''No amount of money you could dangle in front of me will induce me to conduct any sort of relationship with you again, business or otherwise,' she stated implacably.A flicker of male interest darkened the brown in his eyes as they moved over her appraisingly. 'I was not going to suggest anything other than a business agreement between us, however…' He left the sentence suspended between them in the pulsing silence.'Forget it, Alessandro,' she said. 'In any case, I'm already seeing someone.''Is it the same man you were involved with in Italy?' he asked, piercing her gaze with his. 'Dylan Kirby was his name, was it not?'Scarlett felt her blood begin to simmer in her veins. 'I was travelling with him, not sleeping with him.'Cynicism burned in his gaze. 'Ah, yes, that old story. I remember it well.''It's not a story, it's the truth,' she insisted. 'I met Dylan, Joe and Jessica on a bus tour. I told you all this four years ago. How many times do I have to repeat myself?''I am not interested in your lies, but I am interested in what you can do for me,' he said. 'Your business is in need of a contract as big as this, Scarlett. You would be a fool to throw it away as if it was worth nothing.'She clenched her jaw. 'I hate to be the one to point out the irony in all th...", "related": ["B00186Z0XW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 3.2, "rating_total": 16.0}

Nearly three already. In preparation to leave his desk, he blotted the numbers he'd just tallied, then rubbed his ink-stained fingers on his denim trousers. There was something he did every afternoon at this time.\"Gonna be trouble at the North Star!\" The tall stoop-shouldered man who tended bar rapped on Jonas's open office door at the same time as he shouted.The North Star was the three-story hotel a few doors down, where Jonas and most of his employees lived. Jonas owned the hotel as well as the Silver Star Saloon.\"Tall fella, but not beefy,\" Quay told him. \"He's hollerin' for Mrs. Holmes.\"Jonas didn't bother to grab his jacket. He might talk this man into leaving peaceably, but experience had taught him it might take more than a simplepleaseto appeal to an abuser. No call to ruin a perfectly good coat.He glanced at the holstered Colt hanging on a peg just inside the door, but deliberately walked past and locked the door behind him.With the shutters open to the warm afternoon sun, the saloon was warm and bright. The freshly scrubbed floors, the two patrons and the woman polishing the top of the mahogany bar barely registered as he strode for the door and out onto the shaded boardwalk.\"Madeline, come out here now! Don't make me come in and get you.\"The stranger stood in the street, a sweaty bay tethered to the post in front of the hotel. His tailored black suit was coated with a layer of dust as though he'd been pushing the mare for the better part of a day. In Jonas's book, men who abused horses ranked right up there with men who mistreated women. Jonas had heard Madeline Holmes's story and drew the easy conclusion that this was the man she'd run from before finding refuge in Silver Bend.\"Don't make me come in there and drag you out!\" the man shouted.\"Looking for someone?\" Jonas called easily.\"Stay outta this, mister. Ain't none of your concern.\"Jonas walked several yards toward the hotel. \"Well, seems it is my concern since you're standing there hollerin' at the front windows of my establishment. State your business, Mister…\"\"Baslow. This your hotel?\"\"That it is. Jonas Black's the name. And you are?\"\"I'm lookin' to take a woman back with me. I want Madeline Holmes.\"\"Is she your wife?\"The angry man deepened the scowl on his already craggy face, and his complexion reddened. \"Ain't none of your damned business what she is. All you need to know is that she's comin' with me.\"\"I guess we can leave that up to Maddie, now, can't we?\"At Jonas's familiar use of her name, Baslow turned his whole body toward Jonas and squinted. \"What's she to you?\"\"A good employee. I'll go tell her you're here and you can ask her directly what she'd like to do.\"The man jerked his head toward the saloon Jonas had exited. Quay still stood just outside the doors.\"She's in there?\" Baslow shouted. \"Whoring?\"Jonas gestured to a brightly painted wooden sign that hung on the outside of the building. \"No sportin' women in my establishment. Maddie's one of my housekeepers.\"\"The hell you say. Madeline!\" he roared, stalking toward the saloon.Jonas frowned at Baslow's belligerent tone and aggressive stance. Eagerness for the man to try to push past him so he'd have reason to restrain him made his fingers tingle and his blood pump.Instead, Baslow gave him a wide berth, striding to face the open saloon doors.Casually, Jonas turned and stepped past Quay into the dim interior. This time his gaze sought and found the dark-haired woman who'd stopped polishing the bar and stood in rigid fear, her eyes as wide as saucers, her face pale. \"Frank,\" she said on a dry rasp.Jonas thought she might have been pretty once, before abuse and fear had added the appearance of more years to her narrow face. Using intimidation, the man had held her in his home and his bed for eight years. Breaking away had taken courage. Following through with her decision to escape would take even more.\"You don't have to be afraid,\" Jonas assured her. \"Quay and I are right here. The whole of Silver Bend would see if he tried to force you away in plain sight. You don't have to go back with him. He can't make you. Tell him you don't want to leave. Make it loud 'n clear so there are witnesses.\"Her frightened gaze moved from Jonas to the doorway. He'd seen the same bleak dread on too many faces, and it made his blood boil. \"You're free, Maddie. You have a job and can take care of yourself. You don't need him. He has no control over you except what you give him. From here on out you can live your life any way you see fit. It's up to you.\"His words took effect, and her expression changed. Madeline Holmes placed the cloth she'd been holding on the bar and, with precise movements, removed her apron, folded it neatly and set it down. She ran her palms over her skirt in a nervous gesture, then straightened and raised her chin. \"He can't make me do anything I don't want to, can he?\"\"No, he can't.\"She walked toward the doors. Jonas followed.As she stepped out onto the boardwalk, Baslow's severe gaze narrowed on her. His attention sidled over Jonas and Quay before fixing back on her as though the men were irritating flies he intended to swat later. \"If you want to bring anything with you, get it now.\"Her hands trembled, but with obvious deliberation she hid them in the folds of her skirts. Jonas cheered silently for her brave front.\"I have a job now. And my own room at the hotel,\" she said, her voice louder than he'd expected, though a slight tremble betrayed her nervousness. \"I'm content to stay right here.\"Baslow's thunderous expression darkened even more noticeably.A few citizens had gathered on the boardwalk across the street and were watching the goings-on with interest. Wouldn't be the first time a fight had erupted in front of his place, Jonas thought, his blood pounding with keen awareness, and it wouldn't be the last. He had never minded a good fight to clear the air.\"You choosing a life of whoring over comin' with me?\" Baslow bit out between clenched teeth.Jonas kept his mouth shut. He'd already told the man there weren't any sporting women at his place, and everyone in town knew it. This was Maddie's chance to speak her piece.\"That's what I felt like when I was with you,\" she said, coming straight to the heart of the matter. \"I don't want to live that way anymore. I'm not your wife.\" Her voice and demeanor showed renewed strength in her decision. \"Nobody hits me,\" she declared. \"And I get a fair wage for a day's work. I can take care of myself just fine.\"Baslow headed toward Maddie. \"I don't know who fed you that hogwash,\" he said, \"but you belong to me, and you'll do as I say.\"She backed away.Jonas met him before he could reach the shade of the boardwalk. \"Remember the brother's war, Baslow? It's against the law to keep slaves.\"They stood three feet apart. Baslow's right eye twitched with anger. Jonas's palms tingled.\"Get outta my way, mister, before you regret it.\"\"Can't do that. Maddie's my employee, and I take care of my people.\"Baslow lunged toward Jonas. Jonas dodged his first attempt to reach him, spinning with hands locked together to land a blow on the back of the man's neck.Caught off guard, Baslow fell to his hands and knees in the dirt, losing his hat. Slowly, he shook his head, and then scrambled to his feet to come after Jonas. The fight was on.The growing crowd pushed forward for a better look.Energized now, Jonas raised both fists and bent his knees in readiness. Baslow faced him and they squared off, circling in avid concentration. The man's eyes bored into Jonas's with contempt. Jonas studied his stance, his movements, waited to see how he hit. Faster than Jonas anticipated, Baslow landed a blow to Jonas's shoulder that forced him to catch his balance and got him mad. He retaliated with a quick right that landed on the man's jaw with a crack and drew a grunt from his opponent and a murmur from the crowd.Jonas didn't feel the hits that came next, though he knew one landed against his ribs and another at his temple. Adrenaline lent him strength and numbed the pain. In the minutes that followed he used the reprieve to his advantage, skillfully finding opportunities to put down punches.Half-a-dozen solid hits later Baslow's lip was bleeding. He had a cut over his left eye, and he was breathing hard. Jonas watched for and found an opportunity, hit his eye again, then positioned all his muscle into landing a blow to his gut.The man moaned and doubled over, dropping to his knees in the dirt. He glared up at Jonas, one eye red from streaming blood. \"You got no right to keep Madeline.\"\"You're finally right,\" Jonas answered. \"Nobody's got a right to hold her. She's free to leave, she's free to stay.\" He turned to Maddie, who'd been watching with both hands clasped under her chin. \"You want to go?\"She shook her head and released a pent-up breath. \"No.\"\"You sure? 'Cause we don't want any misunder-standin's. You're free to leave any time you want.\"\"I want to stay.\"\"There you have it.\" Jonas's knuckles were stinging now. \"Need any more convincing?\"Marshal Haglar parted the crowd and made his way to stand on the brick street a few feet away. He took in both men's appearances. \"What in blazes is goin' on here?\"Maddie immediately ran forward to explain what had taken place. When she'd finished, the marshal turned to the spectators. \"That how it happened? Anyone see the whole thing?\"Jonas couldn't remember if anyone had been there during the initial exchange of words. He scanned the faces nearby. People had an aversion to getting involved, especially when a dangerous-looking fellow like Baslow glared at them as though daring someone to speak against him.The marshal eyed the crowd, and one after another, the bystanders glanced at the person beside them and then away. Jonas figured his reputation and position on the town council would have enough sway. He wasn't a troublemaker, but he neve...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For instance, he begins by explaining that squash, known primarily as an elitist endeavor reserved for prep schoolers and yuppies, developed in London's Fleet Prison in the early 1800s. But Zug makes squash relevant by capturing an interesting parallel between the game and American social movements as he details squash's evolution from the pastime of America's most exclusive universities and clubs to the emergence of women on the American squash scene in the 1920s and America's fitness obsession in the late 1970s and '80s, which made the game accessible to the middle class and brought squash courts to every neighborhood YMCA from coast to coast. Furthermore, realizing that a sport is only as compelling as its champions, Zug presents colorful bios of the game's best and most eccentric players, including college dropout and Deadhead Mark Talbot, John McEnroe-like Victor Niedhoffer (who retired in his prime to protest the sport's anti-Semitic stance in the 1960s) and Roshan Khan (from a famous squash family, his \"lusty\" lifestyle led Ted Kennedy to say he came from the \"Irish part of Pakistan\"). While only squash fanatics will find this detailed work a must read, Zug's passion for and knowledge of the game make this a unique addition to the library of sports histories.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Thoughtful, married-mom Georgie Peachy Archer and big-city-girl Beth, her older sister, grow up on a Canadian farm with their hairdressing, Vietnam draft–dodging dad, Lou, and share the pain of their mom's suicide. But that's where the similarities end—until the sisters swap lives for a weekend. Walking in Beth's shoes around New York City, Peachy meets Beth's discreet doorman, snarky friends and disapproving ex-boyfriend, and gets a crash course in understanding what her brash sister's really about. Here is a charming, smart and honest story of two sisters who learn to embrace the lives they have. Gabriele's writing is sharp and her heart is pure gold. This honest tale of passionate, mixed-up and forgiving families is hard to put down.(Oct.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Toby, a London boy who was paralyzed at birth and is unable to talk, and Emma, a girl from the Sudan who has witnessed death and cruelty all of her young life, have been transported to Langjoskull to stop the current leader, a bully and potential tyrant, from turning this fantasy land into a horror movie. Treachery, insights into friendship, philosophical discussions, and epic battles ensue, but the end is a return to his useless body for Toby. Was it all a dream?

I wondered why I was still writing about sex, why I spent so much time and energy on it. Was it purely for the shock value, the admittedly sometimes fun role of the black sheep?\"My sex writing may have started that way, a little, but I believe that there's more to it -- that the real reasons I keep writing about sex are intimately tied to the power of the material. Sex writing, perhaps because of its taboo nature, has the power to reveal aspects of human nature that are otherwise inaccessible. Writing about sex can be scary -- when I'm writing revelatory memoir pieces like \"Silence and the Word\" and \"Under the Skin,\" it can be downright terrifying. But that only underlines its importance, and its interest.\"After ten years, I still find that writing about sex is the most interesting writing I've done -- not sex as simple titillation, or for shock value, but sex as it relates to and reveals the intricacies of the human heart. In passion, we are stripped bare, we reveal our fragile and vulnerable selves. We can only hope that the world will value us for what we are, will see us clearly and with generous eyes...\"", "related": [], "rank": 1796753, "title": "Silence and the Word eBook", "author": "Mary Anne Mohanraj", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bauer has given the magnificent palomino stallion a distinct personality, in contrast to the Anygirl, Jennifer. Moonseeker may look like the perfect horse, but at first he scares Jennifer with his size and bossy attitude. Despite her trepidation, she copes admirably with Moonseeker's faults. Her exploits should captivate readersin this slim book, the pair gallop recklessly, attempt to jump a river, swim to safety, become trapped in a cave, and escape homeward. Moonseeker's transformation and the night's action are believable. The plot's sole problem is its directionthe only motivation for the adventure seems to be an hour's escape from reality. The writing is adequate, purposely creating an other-wordly feel with time and place. Berenzy's dark drawings glow with moonlight and sustain the tone of the book. Readers who enjoy Lynd Ward's wordless The Silver Pony (Houghton, 1973) can graduate to this similar child-horse fantasy.

At that terrible hour no other clergyman, whatever his office, could so aptly bring the Word of God to America—and a watching world.At eighty-four, Billy Graham remains one of the most respected people in the world today. He has addressed over eighty-two million people face to face and at least one billion people through television, radio, and satellite. Yet he is far more than an evangelist of integrity and vision; he is a Christian statesman whose profound influence on the growth and depth of Christianity across the world cannot be overestimated.This official biography of Dr. Graham is based on his private files, correspondence, and interviews, as well as the author’s widespread research.• Written by John Pollock, Dr. Graham’s official biographer • Parts one and two (1918 to 1978), based on Pollock’s authorized biographies, have been abridged and contain new material • Part three (1978 to 1983) deals at length with Dr. Graham’s controversial visit to Moscow, which can now be seen as a factor in the fall of communism • Part four (1984 to 2003) updates the story to recent events, including the horrors of September 11 and the honorary knighthood Dr. Graham received from the Queen of England in December 2001 • 8-page section of black-and-white photos new to this book", "related": ["B00DDHE1BG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The narrative opens with a moment of transgression and tragedy when Hari, who's a Brahmin and a vegetarian, eats forbidden fish and inadvertently causes the death of his grandmother. This propels Hari to question the arbitrary rules and divisions that govern his life and the rest of Indian society.For the most part, Toronto author Mahadevan effectively uses his child narrator to survey and critique the hypocrisy and viciousness of his birth country's economic, social, and political structures. While the adults take most of these things for granted, Hari wants reasoned logic where so often there is none. Hari's desire for truth unmasks societal lies in a convincing way, although his constant demands that his elders explain their actions and assumptions are a little heavy-handed. Hari takes on more complexity as a character when the loss of his innocence leads to a much more ambivalent and fraught understanding of both personal and societal conflict.The novel thus charts the turmoil within both the nation and Hari himself. The plot is straightforward but compelling, especially in the railway scenes, in which Hari finds himself in the centre of a tumultuous political strike. There, in the heightened atmosphere of the train, Hari must confront his unknowing complicity in the violence and corruption that accompany his privilege. The changes within Hari take on an urgency through the careful use of language that gives not only the sensory aspects of his journey, but also the emotional ones.In the end, resolution eludes Hari. Instead, he must leave the societal tangles as they are and strike out on a new path for himself.- Tara Lee", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Readers must decide if they are being shown a true representation of the past or a facsimile created by the passage of time that taints the memoirist s observations with the jaded wisdom of life experience. Thus one never knows the truth and must take the memoirist s words at face value even while questioning their validity, like James Frey s discredited memoir, A Million Little Pieces.Sid Baron's memoir,The Way It Was: Growing Up in Wartime Holland,is in the same vein as such books as The Diary of Anne Frank (new revised version, The Diary of a Young Girl) and Corrie ten Boom's The Hiding Place. Like the aforementioned memoirs, Baron paints a picture of a semi-idyllic time of simple and undisturbed innocence in contrast to the sheer immensity of the evils committed in the name of the The Final Solution in Nazi-occupied Europe.Baron boyhood was a simple agrarian existence on the cusp of industrialization in rural Holland. Baron writes, When I was seven years old, sitting at the kitchen table and drawing on a piece of paper with a pencil was a favorite activity of mine. I could stare out the window and watch the wind. I could lazily dream about all the things little boys dream about.The idea of daydreaming during Nazi occupation seems ludicrous and any semblances of child-like wonder must have been buried down deep in the heart of survival. Such trivialities as maintaining the family farm, shopping, and going to school became more of a need to keep up the appearance of an accepted norm. Remaining inconspicuous to nosy neighbors as well as the enemy weighed heavily in importance. Baron continued to try to be a child even while his parents were part of the Holland resistance. Thrust into an insane situation, he was guilty by association. His chores became surreal: Hiding an unregistered illegal radio, carrying a pistol and barely avoiding being searched, denying to a known Nazi sympathizer that an ally soldier and his family were living in his home, and dodging machine gun bullets. Baron writes, My few remaining steps to the house were interrupted by the sound of screaming fighter plane engines. Instantly, I dropped face down on the ground, clasping my hands around the back of my head to protect myself. Empty heavy-caliber machine gun shells rained down from the sky all around me and on the ribbed aluminum roof covering the pump house.While reading Baron's lyrical prose, one cannot help but think how lucky he was to have come out World War II unscathed and able to tell his story. Some sixty years later, in 2007 there are countries on our planet where children must deal with enemy occupation and the stench of degradation and death everyday. How lucky our children are not to have to experience ethnic cleansing and war zones in their front and back yards.Sid Baron is a successful business entrepreneur, sought-after public speaker, and author of the novel, Dawning of a New Day. --By Lee Gooden, Foreword magazine", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The wide range of critical theorists, Japanese scholars, and films brought to bear on the investigation are evidence enough of Freedman's thorough engagement with the subject.\"—Robert Goree,Social Science Japan Journal\"Freedman has produced an engaging literary ethnography, using the vast writings of the times centered on transportation and its effects on social mores during Tokyo's dizzying jazz age.

Sometimes, help comes from sources we might not have expected. Rock and Roll is one of those unexpected sources of wisdom because it has lyrics to address every problem life sends us. For example, you've probably realized by now that, \"You can't always get what you want.\" The Rolling Stones made this line famous but I have distinct memories of my dad telling my brother and me the same thing, lots and lots of times. I got the message and there were plenty of other good ones on the radio that I heard but didn't quite understand until years later. Like me, you might have missed out on some good advice because the words didn't sink in. For example, maybe you heard: \"Another one rides the bus.\" What Queen really sang is: \"Another one bites the dust.\" Maybe you thought Stevie Wonder told you: \"Science healed the liver, I'm yours.\" No way! He said: \"Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours.\" Okay, you got the message: you should have listened more closely because Rock and Roll has some cool messages. The wisdom found in Rock and Roll is the reason I wrote a book combining great lyrics with some wisdom I picked up through the years by way of raising children, leading people and growing older. In my book, the words of some of the best song writers in the world, like Billy Joel and James Taylor, teach us to: reject greed, safeguard marriages, pay attention to our children, be better friends, help one another, take better care of ourselves, appreciate work, love each other, chase dreams, remember that life is short, count our blessings and savor the time we've been given. There's plenty of help available in these areas of life because Rock and Roll lyrics contain countless nuggets of wisdom, sage counsel and the opportunity to consider the experiences of others.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Mitchell has enjoyed often-simultaneous careers as a mechanic, pilot, professor, artist and sculptor, musician and composer, computer scientist, consultant, real estate investor, inventor, author and business leader. He holds two degrees in mathematics and an MBA (summa cum laude.) He has founded numerous successful businesses and has been on the boards of others.

I understood the difference between needs, wants and wishes and even though I messed up a lot along the way, I got pretty good at managing my own money.  I never learned about it in school – it just wasn’t taught for some reason.  When I went off to college, I learned a lot about how to keep track of money.  I learned all about basic Accounting principles and setting up business budgets, and I even learned a little about managing personal finances.  But there was still very little to be learned about setting up the household finances. Then I went to work for the credit card division of one of the world’s largest financial institutions in the world.  As a debt collector for this company, I quickly discovered that a huge number of people had no clue how to manage their money. They would share these heart-wrenching stories that would make excellent fodder for a classic country song and my job was to convince them to give me some of their money anyway. It wasn’t long before I realized I was talking to literally thousands of people who had never been taught how to handle money.  When I would suggest to someone to use a calendar to help track their finances or to always live within their means they would respond as though I was crazy!  Eventually I was promoted and given the opportunity to train new debt collectors who were hired.  I learned then that I needed to not only train these folks, but also to help them pick up some tips on gaining control of their money too.  Thus, my career as a financial counselor was born.  I value the years I spent in the credit card industry because I learned so much about what people simply aren’t taught. Here’s the problem: Our society expects adults to somehow magically “get it” when it comes to handling their finances, but if I made it through six years of college and three degrees – all focused on Business and Accounting – and had learned no more than what I had about personal finance, this was a huge miss in our education system.  There are so many people who need help understanding how to handle their money.  God gave me the gift of understanding that finance has very little (dare I say virtually nothing) to do with money.  It is all about behavior.  It is all about setting priorities and really understanding what is important.  As a financial counselor, I have the privilege of helping people take on the monster of debt they’ve built and gain victory over it.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story opens as Petunia Joy (P.J., unless you want to get yelled at) is having one of her tantrums. She demands a dragon from her parents, King Winston and Queen Elsie, and she soon gets it. Quickly bored of it, she demands the Moon Hare, who takes a break from polishing the moon to give her a very roundabout lesson in good manners. Monroe keeps the action moving swiftly and has the adults behave as unreasonably as P.J.—she is aghast when her father would rather be beheaded than admit to stealing a chess piece during a heated game. Aided by Sandra the dragon, the Moon Hare saves the day with one of the many objects he has hidden away in his stripy tights. There will doubtless be further monkey business in store in Monroe’s future installments.

All of Carrara's books are based in her home town, her favorite city, Manhattan.  As a child she loved reading and used her writing of poetry as a way to escape her troubled childhood. Life got in the way, and her reading took a back seat to raising her kids. After her children became self sufficient, and she had more time on her hands, her sister told her about a \"hot new paranormal romance\" she had to read. Celeste jumped in and returned to her love of reading. Always fascinated by all things paranormal, and a lover of romance, Celeste devoured every paranormal romance she could find. She has always liked her books with some spice so it came as no surprise she found erotic romance intoxicating.  All this reading sparked the writer within. An idea for a story came to her one day and she decided to put it on paper. Soon, the ideas were flowing and she couldn't stop writing. With encouragement from her husband, and best friend, Celeste completed her first novel, Give Me Forever, and hasn't looked back.

H. Edgar. As an infant he wasadopted by George Freeman, a porter at Billingsgate fish market. Aged eleven, Wallace sold newspapers at Ludgate Circus and upon leaving school took a job with a printer. He later enlisted in the Royal West Kent Regiment, beforetransferring to the Medical Staff Corps, and was sent to South Africa. In 1898 he published a collection of poems called The Mission that Failed, and subsequently left the army to become acorrespondent for Reuters.South African war correspondent for The Daily Mail followed and hisarticles were later published as Unofficial Dispatches. His outspokenness infuriated Lord Kitchener, who removed his credentialsas a war correspondent. He thenedited the Rand Daily Mail, but gambled disastrously on the South African Stock Market. Returning to England, he at first reportedon crimes and hanging trials, before becomingeditor of The Evening News. It was in 1905 that he founded the Tallis Press, publishing Smithy, a collection of soldier stories, and The Four Just Men. The latter waspublished with the ending removed as anadvertising stunt and he offered £500 to readers who could successfully guess the ending. Unfortunately, many did and he was almost bankrupted. At various times Wallacealso worked as a journalist on The Standard, The Star, The Week-End Racing Supplement and The Story Journal. In 1917, he became a Special Constable at Lincoln's Inn and also a special interrogator for the War Office. The Daily Mail sent Wallace to investigate atrocities in the Belgian Congo, a trip that provided material for his Sanders of the River books. In 1923 he became Chairman of the Press Club and in 1931 stood as a Liberal Parliamentary candidatefor Blackpool. mHis first marriage in 1901 to Ivy Caldecott, daughter of a missionary, ended in divorce in 1918 and he later married his much younger secretary, Violet King. Along with countlessarticles, some 23 screenplays and many short stories,Wallacewrote more than 170 books, which have been translated into 28 languages and sales of which have exceeded 50 million copies.

Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in 1804 in the city of Salem, Massachusetts to Nathaniel Hathorne and the former Elizabeth Clarke Manning. His ancestors include John Hathorne, the only judge involved in the Salem witch trials who never repented of his actions. Nathaniel later added a \"w\" to make his name \"Hawthorne\" in order to hide this relation. He entered Bowdoin College in 1821, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1824, and graduated in 1825. Hawthorne anonymously published his first work, a novel titled Fanshawe, in 1828. He published several short stories in various periodicals which he collected in 1837 as Twice-Told Tales. The next year, he became engaged to Sophia Peabody. He worked at a Custom Houseand joined Brook Farm, a transcendentalist community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem, the Berkshires, then to The Wayside in Concord. The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to The Wayside in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, and was survived by his wife and their three children. -wikipedia", "related": ["B004RZGUBM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I was there once, as were millions of others. But you can take heart from the knowledge that other people that have gone before you have learned the art of singing while playing guitar. Myself included -but why is that such a big thing?Well I set out on my goal of learning toplay guitar and sing at the same time, from the starting point of being completely uncoordinated and devoid of timing. Rubbish at any kind of sport, terrible at doing two things at once, and even unable to pat my head and rub my stomach at the same time.There really was no hope for me.I had seen my idol's at concerts and on television, effortlessly playing their guitars while singing their hearts out. And I wanted to be able to do it.How hard could it be?So, like most people, I picked up a guitar, started playing a song, and attempted to sing over the top of it. What a disaster - what little timing I had completely screwed up, and I just created an awful mish-mash of noise. It wasn't pretty.After weeks of getting nowhere, I decided to break down the process and try to 'reverse engineer' the steps to learning this elusive art. It quickly became clear to me that the only way to get there was to separate out the singing and playing guitar, and get them to the point of automation, then gradually intertwine them back together through structured exercises, and of course, a little patience.Unbelievably, within a fortnight I had started to make progress. After a month, I was playing and singing without even thinking about what I was doing.

Chinese anthropologist Zhang Li has a grand-daughter, Emily, who lives and works in London. The romantic novel is set in 2012-2014 and tackles many of today's issues such as the banking crisis, climate change and nature conservation but there are some very pleasant - and unpleasant - surprises along the way. Violation of planning regulations on the Cornish Coast brings a young barrister into Emily's life with delightful consequences leading to a completely new life for both of them. This book was a pleasure to write, although it required quite a bit of research many questions to friends and colleagues. My editor, Jane Harrington, to whom many thanks, insisted I revise the whole book and make heavy cuts to allow the story to flow faster: that reduced the book by some 10,000 words, but still leaving 135,000 - there were so many different twists and turns to relate! My thanks to my mother, too, Joan Murrell, an artist who spent much time painting in Cornwall - and to the artists of East Cornwall whose work was an inspiration. To Hilary Northcott, who read the manuscript to help reduce the typing errors and mental aberrations - many thanks. The trouble with writing a contemporary book is that 'things keep changing'. What's scary, is that things have been changing since I finished - fulfilling many of the concerns that are expressed by the fictional characters and real people described in the book. Most thanks to another Jane - my wife - for her tolerance of being a 'writer's widow' when I've been unavailable. She did say, however, that this is her favourite of my books so far, which was a great relief!", "related": ["B003UV8NB4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But once the state legislature, Alabama's Marine\nResources Division and the charter-boat captains and fishermen discovered they\ncould put-out artificial reefs to increase the number and size of the saltwater\nfish they caught, Alabama's offshore fishing boomed. There are currently\nseveral-thousand public reefs with GPS coordinates available to the fishing\npublic atoutdooralabama.com/fishing/saltwater/tides-weather/. Alabama has\nthe largest artificial-reef program in the nation, and one of the largest\ninshore programs. Another reason is that regardless of the time of year, you\ncan always catch hard-fighting, good-eating fish offshore in Alabama. The state\nhas a mild climate that is frost-free from February to December. Many days from\nThanksgiving to Christmas I've fished in shorts and T-shirts for part of the\nday and only needed a light jacket in the morning.Question: John, do you\nhave any suggestions that will help make our fishing trips more enjoyable?Phillips: I sure do. Go\nback and read \"Chapter 1: How to Pick a Charter Boat Captain.\" Use that form\nand those questions to talk to the captains you're considering hiring. Then the\ncaptain knows what your expectations are, the type of fish you want to catch,\nand the type of trip you hope to have. All the captains try to customize their\ntrips to fit their fishermen, and I believe this form can be a very-helpful\ntool for individuals and captains to make sure they each get the kind of\nfishing experience want.", "related": ["B007PK9B2G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Blue, her\nmother, her sister, and her aunt--all have suffered and are deeply scarred,\nalthough they deal with their problems in far different ways.

While the overt narrative concentrates on\nher desperate attempts to balance her wounds with her need to solve the\nkidnappings, the underlying story--and perhaps the more important one--follows\nBlue's conscious and unconscious attempts at punishing and ultimately forgiving\nherself for her own sins. Her path is dangerous and dark, regardless of which\nstory we follow, but it is her only possibility of redemption. Recommended.Michael R.

In addition to movement, Bala’s poetry contains a musicality . . . Most of the poems combine into a fairly cohesive chronological story. The book begins with its best work, \"A Mountain’s Sojourn,\" a beautifully descriptive nature poem. Memories, Thoughts, and Dreams present some of the visceral, unprocessed emotions generated by a passionate romance. Bala's talent lies in his ability to reveal these emotions openly and make the feelings highly accessible to the reader. Memories, Thoughts, and Dreams is a testament to selfhood confronting nearly engulfing pain, yet with few regrets for having braved the encounter.--BlueInk ReviewsGuy Bala’sMemories, Thoughts, and Dreamsfeature poems celebrating common aspects of nature and grieving the end of a romantic relationship. Using symbolic elements . . . seasons, flowers, beauty, and the ephemeral— a falling snowflake . . . winds passage—the author recalls love and loss in plainspoken terms. Arranged in an order that charts a transition from tranquility, in \"A Mountain’s Sojourn,\" . . . to love and then estrangement, in “Alone,” each poem . . . offers such direct revelation. Enthusiasm for poetry as self-expression emerges in the author’s introductory note contextualizes an aesthetic that favors transparency over gradations and employs emotive abstraction. Here, souls embrace and are immortal. Existence is questioned in the absence of the loved one.--Karen Rigby Clarion ForeWord Reviews", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

S. Tipton, who took them in years ago as teenagers and has become more of a father than a boss. Then a third man Tipton raised, Zeke Tanner, comes into their lives while they're driving a herd to market. Tanner, a Union officer, has hijacked a load of Confederate gold and is posing, along with his men, as Confederate soldiers. Tipton recognizes Tanner, and Tanner inadvertently kills him. When Miles and Strauss find out who killed their surrogate father, they take off in pursuit, hell-bent on revenge. Before they can administer frontier justice, they'll have to survive hostile Comanche territory. This is a solid, well-told western tale with nicely drawn characters and plenty of action.Wes LukowskyCopyright © American Library Association.

In gentle, matter-of-fact prose, Rubin, now 77 and one of the great lights of Southern letters, tells the stories of Hyman and Fannie Rubin, his grandparents, and their seven children. \"What happened to them and to their parents must have been so distressing, so painful to remember, perhaps so deeply humiliating, that doubtless there was little incentive on their part to relive the memories of that time,\" he writes. \"What happened\" was that in 1902, 16 years after settling in Charleston, S.C., Hyman suffered a heart attack and became unable to support his family. Harry, the eldest child, was old enough to work. But Dan, Manning and Louis, 10, eight and seven, were sent to the Hebrew Orphans' Home in Atlanta for several years. Dora, Esther and Ruth stayed home. Eventually, Hyman was able to reunite the family. \"[T]hey were a brave band, and what they did with their lives deserves to be recorded.\" Daniel became a successful playwright, Manning a newspaper editor. Years after illness robbed Louis of his ability to make a living in business, he became celebrated for his ability to predict the weather. Rubin's descriptions are affectionate, yet he doesn't gloss over their flaws, and as a result, those he knows best come alive for readers. 18 b&w; photos.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 2532613, "title": "My Father's People", "author": "Louis D.

At first, there is frustratingly little progress, but when two competitive journalists get involved, the case starts to open up. Meanwhile, Rutter and Paniatowski pay the price for their illicit love affair when one of the journalists threatens to expose them if they don't give her an exclusive scoop. Although Spencer treats her readers to an engaging cast of characters and plenty of fascinating procedural detail, the solution to the case seems to come out of left field--even given the fact that the story is set in the paranoid 1960s. But, all in all, this is an entertaining procedural from a veteran hand.Emily MeltonCopyright © American Library Association.

She was the oldest of five children. She enjoyed traveling as a child, but never went outside of the USA. Most of the adventure in her childood came from books or her own imagination. For fun growing up her mom, and step dad would sit at the table with her and they would take turns creating paragraphs in a story. This built a great love of writing. Growing up she filled notebook after notebook with stories and ideas. Those notebooks would become lost, but the ideas stuck with her. Currently Dawn lives in Leesburg, Georgia with her husband and children. After a failed marriage Dawn lost the urge to write. She wouldn't start writing again for ten years. After her second marriage she found that all she wanted to do was write. Her five beautiful children read all of her manuscripts before anyone else. They always share their ideas and feedback. So I guess all my books are child approved. Dawn spends her days as a stay at home mom. She enjoys spendin her days helping her children learn and grow and just hanging out giving them someone to talk to and having fun. She spends her nights on the computer writing and creating and building the magic and adventure. Her hope is that you will enjoy reading her books as much as she enjoyed writing them.", "related": [], "rank": 3690596, "title": "Jack the Jungle Explorer eBook", "author": "Dawn Warren", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fromcourse work and healers, as well as my own ongoing journaling practice, I started to understand and release mysubconscious negative patterns, raise my self-awareness, and startto heal on all levels. When I started to release repressed emotionsand unconscious reactions, I was able to change my habitsand behaviors that had been contributing to an imbalanced,toxic, parasitic health condition. Thus, I embarked on a 7-yeartransformational journey that has changed how I feel, look andlive from the inside out.My journey has involved releasing: toxic food, drinks,pills and \"beauty products\"; toxic relationships, jobs andenvironments; my parents' pain and patterns; society's conditioning and ideas of success; my ego's attachments tomaterial proving and physical approving; my past life/soulwounds; stuck energetic patterns; and many negative thoughts,habits, and behaviors.Supporting a physical cleanse with journaling is powerful; stuckand repressed emotions will come up to be released that you havebeen numbing with substances and food. It also helps connect youdeeper to yourself where you are able to reflect and get clear withwhat you want and don't want in your life.What I've learned from my 20-year personal detox journey,coaching and supporting others is, like Deepak Chopra says, \"Ifyou want to change anything, you must change your awarenessfirst.\" Be inspired to join me in your own adventure in self-discovery! Discover and release the root causes of what you don'twant in your life. Dis-ease and depression is caused by toxins inthe body, mind and emotions; the only way to heal is to de-toxify!Neither the doctor nor detox program can heal you --only you canheal yourself with awareness and support.My mission is to inspire and empower you to be responsible foryour health, happiness, and joy and to free the toxins in your mind,body, and emotions in order to be your true self and enjoy life!With Love & Joy,Elicia", "related": ["B004TNHEOO"], "rank": 1932916, "title": "Detox 101: 5 Steps to Design Your Personal Detox Plan (Detox for Smarties Course Series Book 1)", "author": "Elicia Miller", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.1667, "rating_total": 19.0}

Both explore society and human psyche through architectural descriptions of imaginary cities, but Sasarman's masterfully crafted prose poems feel more immediate, serving as spellbinding descriptions of architectural impossibilities as well as slyly subversive social commentary. The equality of all citizens is an enshrining principle of the ziggurat Vavylon, with steep ramps oiled every day to prevent ascent, though descent is very rapid. The elite of Musaeum create immortal artworks that remain unknown, for they are too busy with their own works to look at one another's. The intrepid explorers of Selenia vainly hunt for a building site uncontaminated by the psychic refuse of Earth's poets, lovers, and dreamers, which litters most of the lunar surface. --Publishers Weekly March 11, 2013And there is then, of course, the tiny but beautiful mind-bending chaser that is 'Squaring the Circle: A Pseudotreatise of Urbogony' by Gheorgie Sasarman, and translated by no less than Ursula K. Le Guin. If you are reminded of Italo Calvino, then you are on the right track, but Sasarman has his own smart visions to offer readers. The brief excursions into the fantastic cities described here will trip anyone's sense of wonder even as they cause readers to glance at the world we find at our doorsteps with new eyes. These cities are really enjoyable to read and re-read about as Sasarman spins off allegory and innuendo to imagination with remarkably clean language as translated by Le Guin. <p? Any one of these stories will craft in the reader's mind an entire world, a society, a country and then slowly but surely transform that imaginary way station into a refracted aspect of what is happening here and now, and ever and forever. This is the sort of book that is well worth seeking out, as are the cities of the imagination it creates for us. Of course all books create the world for us anew in our imaginations. But only when we help, when we take the time to sit down and read. --Rick Kleffel, The Agony Column Jan 30, 2013", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A small city was built to house the Japanese company harvesting the pearls, but an erupting volcano wiped out the city and all its occupants in 1973. Decades later, Russian mining conglomerate Bashnev/Sevmash, sometime business partner of shipping magnate Richard Mariner, has discovered that the black-pearl site contains vast reserves of coltan, a substance used in computer and electronics equipment. Eager to harvest the coltan and the fortune it will yield, Bashnev/Sevmash asks Mariner to lead a team to claim the remote lake. To get there means a difficult and dangerous march through a nearly impenetrable jungle rumored to be held by an African guerrilla army led by a fearsome witch doctor. Worse, both the Chinese mining company Hu Wuhan and the government of nearby Congo Libre have their own plans to take over the lake. Ingeniously plotted and packed with nail-biting suspense, fierce rivalries, clever skulduggery, and nightmarish violence, this is a thought-provoking, edge-of-the-seat read for all fans of adventure tales. --Emily Melton", "related": [], "rank": 3898429, "title": "Black Pearl (A Richard Mariner Adventure Book 27)", "author": "Peter Tonkin", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

During his Vision Quest, which lead him to Egypt, Australia, the Canary Islands, Belize and most of the United States, he reevaluated and examined everything he believed in.Having always had an interest in things of a spiritual and esoteric nature this was without question  a predetermined path.

Touching the blocks of Khufu's pyramid connected me to the builders of that pyramid over 3000 years ago.We traveled the length of Egypt twice by train. I could talk for hours of the magnificent monuments we explored: the temple at Abu Simbel, Luxor and Karnak temples, the Colossi of Memnon, the Valley of the Kings and of the Queens.

Medvic provides an excellent review of the many contradictory expectations imposed on them. Should they lead or respond? Should they be typical or more accomplished? Should they be principled or pragmatic? He then provides insightful examples of how these conflicting expectations play out within a system of government that seeks to limit power. This book is invaluable for those trying to understand the behavior of American politicians.—Jeffrey M. Stonecash,Syracuse University\"Stephen Medvic's engaging defense of politicians argues convincingly that current political dysfunction is far more a consequence of the public's contradictory preferences, expectations, and choices, and of our cherished constitutional system, than of the leaders we elect to represent and govern us. The more widely recognized this reality, the better.\" —Gary C. Jacobson,UC San Diego\"This is a very accessible book that makes a compelling and timely statement about the state of our politics and what we should do about it. I can't help but think that every undergraduate in America would be well-served to read it, and have the opportunity to debate the arguments within it.\"—Quentin Kidd,Christopher Newport University", "related": [], "rank": 1489665, "title": "In Defense of Politicians: The Expectations Trap and Its Threat to Democracy (Controversies in Electoral Democracy and Representation)", "author": "Stephen K.

He moves from nothing--with hopes and dreams; he shifts to the big town, Fez, to get an education. This book reads like a diary and yet it is a travel novel. It is a magnificent read. Each page will hold you in its clutches and squeeze from you so much emotion and the need to keep turning pages. How on earth will this little boy endure the obstacles? Moroccan culture is seen from the inside, both the positive and the negative. The story overflows with tragedies, courage and triumphs. Those on the fringe of society are powerless. The main character, Jusef, shows the reader the power of hope and the strength to believe in a positive future. I absolutely loved this book and wished it had carried on further. This book deserves the 4 1/2 stars. A wonderful book. I loved every minute. I wanted more.' F. Gibson  'I stumbled across 'A Riffian's Tune' while looking for travel books on my kindle app and I was blown away! This book is wonderful. I'd been to Morocco many years ago, and had always kept up an interest in the country, but this book showed me a whole new side; a snapshot of the Morocco on the cusp of independence. The protagonist of the story is Jusef, a shepherding Berber boy from the far north of the country. What follows is his journey as he struggles to leave shepherding behind and make a new life for himself away from the mountains. But it's really about a lot more than that; every page contains a different little tale, all woven into one big inspirational journey, full of vivid details and unbelievable situations. Joseph Labaki's writing reminded me of a cross between Hemmingway and Paulo Coelho, having the same simple but elegant style, and the succinct clarity which is so effective in transporting the reader to places and times they would never otherwise see.  I thoroughly enjoyed 'A Riffian's Tune'. It made me laugh, cry and think and above all is a beautiful book.' - A Poupalou   'A Riffian's Tune is now one of my favourite books and I really would recommend anyone to give it a try.' Yul from GoodReads 'FANTASTIC READ , I found this true life story a brilliant book that took you on a journey through one young boys struggles to educate himself in a world that threw every difficult situation you could imagine. Thoroughly recommend 'A Riffian's Tune' gives you a real taste of life in another world .'  -G Murdoch   '\"A Riffian's tune\" is a beautiful, inspiring story. It brings up the authentic atmosphere of poverty and foreign occupation in Northern Morocco. This story reminds us that unfortunate circumstances do not always dictate the course of an individual.'  -Fouad 'It's a wonderful experience to get lost in a book...I could not put the book down, it pulled me in deep...I did not see the end coming until the final pages, and I think that must be very good writing indeed!...the story still runs through my mind. I won't forget it.' A Clifford 'This book was so rich with culture and history.'

The bonding between a\ngrandchild and a grandfather is expressed so beautifully that it actually makes\nyou cry. The illustrations are bright, large, and very expressive. They give\nlife to the characters in the story and to the story itself.The theme of the book\nis educational and it makes the child aware of illnesses that can happen. It is\na kind of exposure to a child and the author has done it in a subtle manner. I\nwould recommend all school libraries to have a copy of this book so that it can\nbe read out to children during their story-telling hour, opening their eyes to\na different world.

Through the reflections of Members of Parliament, who have devoted themselves to public life, Loat and MacMillan give us insight into how far we have to travel, and how urgent is the cause.”                — Amanda Lang, co-host of The Lang & O’Leary Exchange and author ofThe Power of Why “In every tragedy there is hope. Members of Parliament go to Ottawa hoping and promising to make a difference; but as these riveting revelations show, high priorities get lost too easily in the widening chasm between constituents, party leaders and good conscience. Is it any wonder Canadians feel disengaged from their hard-won democracy? Loat and MacMillan hope that pulling back the curtain will re-engage Canadians enough to keep our House of Commons from becoming a ‘House of Cards.’”  —Isabel Bassett, former Member of Provincial Parliament “Tragedy in the Commonsis a thoughtful analysis of what is broken in our democracy and a must-read for anyone concerned about Canada’s politics.

Educated privately, she left school aged fifteen having never taken an exam. With the outbreak of the Second World War, she became first a land girl and then worked in naval intelligence. In 1954, she married the historian and schoolmaster, Alan Barker, who subsequently became headmaster of the Leys School in Cambridge. Their only son, Adam, was born in 1955. Jean Barker, as she then was, began her political career as a Cambridge City councillor in the early 1960s, rising to become Mayor of Cambridge in 1971. In 1980 she was made a life peer, choosing the title of Baroness Trumpington of Sandwich. She has served in two Conservative governments, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department of Health and Social Security from 1985 to 1988 and as Minister of State in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from 1989 to 1992, which, at the age of sixty-nine, made her the oldest female minister ever. Today, she is still an active member of the government front bench in the House of Lords and, in November 2012, aged ninety, was the oldest-ever guest to have appeared on Have I Got News for You. Widowed in 1988, Baroness Trumpington lives in Battersea.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her son Nicholas is a college student and her two stepdaughters, Adrienne and Amanda, are grown.  They have an English Cocker Spaniel named Miles Oliver and a cat, Tabitha.   Lisa has three sisters, and two brothers.  She spent part of her childhood growing up on a northern Minnesota farm and has many happy memories from that time in her life.  She also grew up in the Ohio Valley near her grandparents.  Their ministry greatly impacted her life.   She is very active in her church and loves working with the children and youth.  She can often be found assisting, directing or writing a Christmas Program or attempting to choreograph a human video with the youth.   Some of her favorite activities include:  family time, sewing, crochet, cross stitching, reading, sketching, scrapbooking, cooking, gardening, walking, swimming and working out-- when she is not writing.   She loves all things old fashioned and serving Christ through her writing.

His experiences in Taiwan were documented in his first book, \"An American Teacher in Taiwan.\" Ken moved his family to Austin, Texas in 2008, and his struggles and successes were documented in his second book, \"From Taiwan to Texas: Life in Mid-America.\" His third book, \"The Reluctant Austinite,\" is the third and final book in a trilogy of memoirs & anecdotes about life in America and Taiwan. His first fiction book, \"Interstate 10\", was released in January of 2013 to very positive reviews. He followed up that book with another fiction book, \"Small Town Evil\", in February 2013. \"Small Town Evil\" became a massive hit and went on to become a best-seller in the Horror genre, selling thousands of copies and staying in the top 50 for well over a year, and reaching as high as #3, at one point only being outsold by veteran horror writers Stephen King and Anne Rice. \"The Dead Ones\" was released in April of 2013. Ken described it as \"sort of a companion piece to 'Interstate 10.' If people liked that one, they will probably like this one too.\" \"Four Bites\", an anthology of 4 horror stories both new and old, was released in November, 2013. \"Small Town Evil 2\", the highly anticipated sequel to Ken's biggest seller, was finally released in March 2014.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.1333, "rating_total": 62.0}

She was also a dangerously sugar-addicted child, eventually stealing from her parents to support her habit, and was in Weight Watchers by age 11. At 19 Dana read her first book on nutrition, and recognized herself in a list of symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia. She ditched sugar and white flour, and was dazzled by the near-instantaneous improvement in her physical and mental health. A lifetime nutrition buff was born. Unfortunately, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Dana got sucked into low-fat/high carb mania, and whole-grain-and-beaned her way up to a size 20, with nasty energy swings, constant hunger, and borderline high blood pressure. In 1995, she read a nutrition book from the 1950s that stated that obesity had nothing to do with how much one ate, but was rather a carbohydrate intolerance disease. She thought, “What the heck, might as well give it a try.” Three days later her clothes were loose, her hunger was gone, and her energy level was through the roof. She never looked back, and has now been low-carb for 19 years and counting– 1/3 of her life. Realizing that this change was permanent, and being a cook at heart, Dana set about creating as varied and satisfying a cuisine as she could with a minimal carb load. And being an enthusiastic, gregarious sort, she started sharing her experience. By 1997 she was writing about it. The upshot is over 2,500 recipes published, and more than a million books sold–and she still has ideas left to try! Dana lives in Bloomington, Indiana with her husband, three dogs, and a cat, all of whom are well and healthily fed.
