It covers the typology of metric spaces, continuity, connectedness, compactness and product spaces … . The material is developed at a leisurely pace and applications of the theory are discussed throughout, making this book ideal as a classroom text for third- and fourth-year undergraduates or as a self-study resource for graduate students and researchers.\" (L’Enseignement Mathematique, Vol. 51 (3-4), 2005)\"This book on metric spaces was written by authors whose main field is analysis. Therefore its focus lies on those parts of the theory of metric spaces which are mainly used in (functional) analysis. … Altogether this is an interesting book for those who will continue their studies in analysis.\" (H. Brandenburg, Zentralblatt Math, Vol. 1095 (21), 2006)\"This book introduces the fundamentals of analysis in metric spaces. It’s written in a very spare theorem-proof-example style; has illustrative examples and exercises; spends little time on discussion, development of intuition, or substantial applications; begins by stating that the abstract postulational method has a vital role in modern mathematics; implicitly assumes this is the way to teach mathematics.

The ending was very satisfying, romantic, and realistic. I really enjoyed this story and think you will too.\"--Matthew, Rainbow Reviews\"4.5 Stars!...This is another excellent book by KC Kendricks, who continues to write stories that are different from the norm in that at least one of the protagonists is much older and has a lot of life experience behind him. In this case there is a May/December flavour to the story and Levi is delightful as he pursues Stacy. The sex is very sensual as well as hot and the difference in their experience is evident when they make love. The characters are three dimensional and their relationship is complex, with everything stacked against it succeeding...I really like this book and KC Kendricks has written another story that I think readers will appreciate. The reason I love this writer is the realism in the way her stories end and she doesn't insult the reader's intelligence. For those readers who love their HEA, there is a very good ending to this story.\"--Jessewave, Reviews By Jessewave\"5 Angels!...Stacy and Levi are perfect for each other in every way.

A unified model-building strategy for both linear and nonlinear models is presented and applied to the analysis of over 20 real datasets from a wide variety of areas, including pharmacokinetics, agriculture, and manufacturing. A strong emphasis is placed on the use of graphical displays at the various phases of the model-building process, starting with exploratory plots of the data and concluding with diagnostic plots to assess the adequacy of a fitted model. Over 170 figures areincluded in the book.The NLME package for analyzing mixed-effects models in R and S-PLUS, developed by the authors, provides the underlying software for implementing the methods presented in the text, being described and illustrated in detail throughout the book.The balanced mix of real data examples, modeling software, and theory makes this book a useful reference for practitioners using mixed-effects models in their data analyses. It can also be used as a text for a one-semester graduate-level applied course in mixed-effects models. Researchers in statistical computing will also find this book appealing for its presentation of novel and efficient computational methods for fitting linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models.José C. Pinheiro is a Senior Biometrical Fellow at Novartis Pharmaceuticals, having worked at Bell Labs during the time this book was produced. He has published extensively in mixed-effects models, dose finding methods in clinical development, and other areas of biostatistics.Douglas M.

Desperately hoping to atone for her batting prowess, Gen volunteers to baby-sit Jack's young daughter, Elizabeth, while he recuperates, but as she gets to know the quiet, serious girl, she begins to suspect that something is troubling her. The more time Gen spends with Jack, the more attracted she becomes, but any possibility of a relationship with him seems futile at best since not only is Jack in charge of her professional career, but Gen must also find some way to tell him that his daughter is slowly starving herself. RITA award-winning Korbel, who also writes as Eileen Dreyer, has written yet another emotionally satisfying, beautifully poignant romance in which she doesn't shy away from serious topics, but instead subtly integrates them into a superbly fashioned, wickedly clever and witty love story. With its exquisitely crafted characters and delectably sharp prose, this is a romance to treasure.John CharlesCopyright © American Library Association.

His family was rooted in local history: his great-grandfather, a Confederate colonel and state politician, was assassinated by a former partner in 1889, and his grandfather was a wealth lawyer who owned a railroad. When Faulkner was five his parents moved to Oxford, Mississippi, where he received a desultory education in local schools, dropping out of high school in 1915. Rejected for pilot training in the U.S. Army, he passed himself off as British and joined the Canadian Royal Air Force in 1918, but the war ended before he saw any service. After the war, he took some classes at the University of Mississippi and worked for a time at the university post office. Mostly, however, he educated himself by reading promiscuously.Faulkner had begun writing poems when he was a schoolboy, and in 1924 he published a poetry collection,The Marble Faun, at his own expense. His literary aspirations were fueled by his close friendship with Sherwood Anderson, whom he met during a stay in New Orleans. Faulkner's first novel,Soldier’s Pay, was published in 1926, followed a year later byMosquitoes, a literary satire. His next book,Flags in the Dust, was heavily cut and rearranged at the publisher’s insistence and appeared finally asSartorisin 1929. In the meantime he had completedThe Sound and the Fury, and when it appeared at the end of 1929 he had finishedSanctuaryand was ready to begin writingAs I Lay Dying. That same year he married Estelle Oldham, whom he had courted a decade earlier.Although Faulkner gained literary acclaim from these and subsequent novels—Light in August(1932),Pylon(1935),Absalom, Absalom!(1936),The Unvanquished(1938),The Wild Palms(1939),The Hamlet(1940), andGo Down, Moses(1942)—and continued to publish stories regularly in magazines, he was unable to support himself solely by writing fiction. he worked as a screenwriter for MGM, Twentieth Century-Fox, and Warner Brothers, forming a close relationship with director Howard Hawks, with whom he worked onTo Have and Have Not,The Big Sleep, andLand of the Pharaohs, among other films. In 1944 all but one of Faulkner's novels were out of print, and his personal life was at low ebb due in part to his chronic heavy drinking. During the war he had been discovered by Sartre and Camus and others in the French literary world. In the postwar period his reputation rebounded, as Malcolm Cowley's anthologyThe Portable Faulknerbrought him fresh attention in America, and the immense esteem in which he was held in Europe consolidated his worldwide stature.Faulkner wrote seventeen books set in the mythical Yoknapatawpha County, home of the Compson family inThe Sound and the Fury. “No land in all fiction lives more vividly in its physical presence than this county of Faulkner’s imagination,” Robert Penn Warren wrote in an essay on Cowley’s anthology. “The descendants of the old families, the descendants of bushwhackers and carpetbaggers, the swamp rats, the Negro cooks and farm hands, the bootleggers and gangsters, tenant farmers, college boys, county-seat lawyers, country storekeepers, peddlers—all are here in their fullness of life and their complicated interrelations.” In 1950, Faulkner traveled to Sweden to accept the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature. In later books—Intruder in the Dust(1948),Requiem for a Nun(1951),A Fable(1954),The Town(1957),The Mansion(1959), andThe Reivers(1962)—he continued to explore what he had called “the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself,” but did so in the context of Yoknapatawpha’s increasing connection with the modern world. He died of a heart attack on July 6, 1962.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She writes a free-lance sex advice column found in various lesbian magazines and dating websites. Her short story collections and novels can be found on her website. Two of her greatest prides are being a true California girl and author of some truly naughty things. She is a dutiful partially-Asian daughter who is beloved by her fairly traditional Korean father who thinks having a gay daughter is just fine as long as she keeps playing coed flag football. She is a stereotypical younger sister, and an adoring aunt of a hilarious little boy. Being a modern techno-freak, gamer-girl, she spent most of her childhood dreaming of being a video game designer, but changed her mind and brought her dreams of world building and story-weaving to writing unique romance novels. Cassandra is a gleefully monogamous girlfriend to an earthbound goddess who was once her high school bully, but has done a magnificent job of making up for all the school girl nastiness ever since. When she isn’t being an avid fang girl (vampire fan girl) or tormenting people in online gaming, she lives and writes in Winter Park, Florida with her partner and soul mate Nichole and their two cats: Dragon and Josephine.", "related": ["B00KIVZMSQ"], "rank": 1428587, "title": "Demons of Paradise: Lesbian Paranormal Erotica", "author": "Cassandra Duffy", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a rewrite of Harris recent book, Planning and Scheduling Using Microsoft® Project 2007. This new book addresses the latest features and carry-over functions of Microsoft s latest release to the project management public with a PMI/PMBOK® Guide spin. Sustaining his clear and concise manner of writing, Harris explains the basic and intermediate functions, both new and carry-over, of using Microsoft® Project. The book covers most available functions and features, and adds complexity gradually and palatably as the users work their way through the book s 24 detailed chapters of content and reference information. Like the MS Project 2003, 2002, and 2000 books, Harris takes some pretty complicated topics like how duration, work, resources, and units trade-off with each other and makes it seem like anybody can learn to use the software. Harris books continue to be functionally organized, not by menu item. So, if you are using the book as a reference manual or help guide, it s easy to find a particular topic since you don t have to know which menu the function is called up from you just need to know the subject that you are looking for. The detailed index at the back is thorough and handy. Harris also provides a list of menus and related submenus at the beginning of most chapters for people who cannot remember how to find or use a particular function. Paul Harris has succeeded in explaining how to plan, schedule and track projects using Microsoft® Project 2007 within the practices prescribed by PMI s PMBOK® Guide. I recommend reading and using it. --A. Larry Aaron CCE President, T&M; Concepts Las Vegas, NVAn accurate and maintainable project plan is critical for project success. Paul Harris has created a book that not only introduces a very powerful Project Management tool, Microsoft® Project 2010, and he also provides PMBOK® Guide process context and the steps to ensure that a plan is created that is accurate and maintainable!!. The guidance in the book stresses the importance of setting up Microsoft® Project first before entering a plan by explaining how some of the subtle and critical settings influence the use of the product. In addition, Paul has provided a single example project that is developed through a series of workshops in the context of the PMBOK® Guide processes. Each workshop includes a set of correct answers and screen shots to confirm the correct use and understanding of the way Microsoft® Project helps project managers manage their planning data. The screen shots are carefully crafted to communicate each step of the way supported by text that is clear and written for the project manager in their language. I highly recommend the basis for learning Microsoft Project in a workshop training or individual study environment. --Bruce McNaughton Director, Customer Driven Solutions Limited", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But wherever their travels have taken them, they’ve always loved returning to New England for its mix of natural beauty and enlightened culture. Michael and Alex pride themselves on having driven, hiked, canoed, or sailed every corner of the six-state region, ferreting out under-rated restaurants, backwoods museums, and hidden villages along the way.Alex grew up on Boston’s South Shore and studied at Wheaton College and Le Cordon Bleu Institute in Paris. After years as a senior editor for DailyCandy and editor forFashion Boston,she is now back atBoston Magazineas executive editor for lifestyle. Michael grew up west of Boston, attended Williams College, and was a staff writer and editor atBoston Magazinefor five years. Now a freelance magazine writer, he has also taught journalism at Emerson College, Northeastern University, and Tufts University. His first book of investigative journalism,The Coke Machine: The Dirty Truth Behind the World's Favorite Soft Drink,was recently published.Together, Alex and Michael have written for publications includingCondé Nast Traveler, Bon Appétit, Town & Country Travel, New England Travel, Yankee, Boston Magazine, Elle Decor, Continental, Business Traveler, The Nation, The New Republic, The New York Times, The Boston Globe,and AlterNet. They were married on the rustic shores of Maine's Moosehead Lake, where Michael wore a kilt and Alex donned red heels and white feathers.

It was there that his cartooning hobby flowered and drew the attention of his peers - which resulted in the appearance of a nameless little monk in college flyers and posters.  In 1942, he dubbed this cheery, pint-sized creation, \"Brother Juniper.\" McCarthy was a member of the Secular Franciscan Order for seventy-one years.  He served as art director of the national Franciscan magazine, Friar.  He also taught classes about the art of comics and humor at numerous universities and colleges; and networked with fellow comic artists by playing street football out in front of New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.  Rumor has it that, at eighty-four, he could still punt a football forty yards. Father McCarthy retired to southern Florida with his wife Lilly and continued to create new material for the well-traveled Brother Juniper.  In a 2004 interview he is quoted as saying: I hope that my 'little sunbeam in burlap' will serve as an exemplar of Catholic good humor while providing us with a chuckle a week.", "related": [], "rank": 3228013, "title": "More Brother Juniper - Empty-Grave Extended Edition", "author": "Fr Justin McCarthy", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's sure to add fans to Mr. Magson's ever expanding fan base on this side of the Atlantic.\"--Sam Millar - New York Journal of Books\"... if you enjoy a well-written, uncomplicated plot free of foul language and gratuitous sex, this is for you. Snog Marry Avoid? Definitely snog. (Harry's) a man I'd like to get to know better.\"  --The SunFollowing enthusiastic reviews for Red Station (2010), the first in the Harry Tate espionage series, Magson keeps the quality high with this outstanding follow-up. Retired from MI5 after a deadly betrayal by his boss, Harry, along with his pal Rik, also a former MI5 employee, have gone freelance and now \"finds people\" for anyone willing to pay for their services. When Harry and Rik are hired to track down a Libyan banker who's fled to England with millions of his employer's money, they figure it'll be an easy case. But once they locate the banker, things start to get complicated, and the bounty hunters find themselves involved in a frantic race to save an Iraqi man targeted by a trio of assassins intent on finishing their lethal mission. In a double-dealing game where it's nearly impossible to separate the good guys from the bad, Harry and Rik have to use every skill from their MI5 days to unravel the tangled story. With high-octane action, steadily building tension, and a plot packed with twists, Magson's second Harry Tate novel suggests the best of Ken Follett or Robert Ludlum but with a touch more substance. --Booklist, May 1, 2011Spies spying on spies. Harry Tate, last seen escaping a Georgian death plot hatched by MI5 agents supposedly on his side (Red Station, 2010, etc.), returns to Blimey and takes up work as an independent contractor tracking the missing. Jennings, a tight-lipped lawyer who may have secret-service connections, pays him to find an Israeli professor, Samuel Silverman, gone to ground. That task hits several roadblocks, including the assassinations of Matqu, a Libyan, and Param, an embezzler and duped philanderer. Even worse, Tate and his pal Ferris, an electronics whiz, pick up two tails, Dog and Carlisle, neither of whom wishes them well. An ill-hidden clue leads to a woman who knows Silverman, knows his real identity and nationality, and indeed was placed in his entourage in Baghdad as a mole for security purposes--a plan that failed when he apparently died in a bombing of his compound. So the chase is on. Cars cut in and out. Buildings are watched and entered. Bullets whiz by. Collateral damage mounts. But by the time Tate realizes Jennings has set in motion unlimited double crosses, the puppet-master has disappeared and there's one more major gun battle and plot twist to be overcome. Convoluted derring-do best enjoyed by the conspiracy crowd.  --Kirkus Reviews, June 1, 2011", "related": ["B00HD93V1G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With notorious cases such as The Alphabet Murders, The Genesee River Killer (Arthur Shawcross), The Murder of Kali Ann Poulton by Mark Christi, and the case of funeral homes stealing body parts from corpses awaiting cremation, Jen became fascinated by the darker side of human nature. She brings this fascination to her romances, creating dark villains who wreak havoc on the hero and heroine, and producing page-turning suspense. Cool Gus Publishing was formed as a vehicle to launch Bob Mayer's backlist into digital publication. It was built on the notion that writers produce the product, readers consume the product and everything else is in between. The 21st century has brought the rise of the digital author. It is time to take control. Write It Forward, a division of Cool Gus Publishing was formed because both Bob Mayer and Jen Talty believe the two most important people in the publishing business are the writer and the reader. The key to being successful in a business where 99% of what is submitted or self-published is rejected or fails is education and understanding.

Gordon,Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews\"Ernst Cassirer was a pivotal figure for a generation of philosophers, and his evolving application of Kant to the problems of philosophy is overdue for a serious revival of interest. Skidelsky does yeoman's work here in sifting through Cassirer's work in relation to the conflicting tensions of positivism and the phenomenological turn in Continental philosophy. This volume is an apt presentation of the impact of theoretical differences upon a whole host of philosophical stances. Further, Skidelsky's self-proclaimed skepticism of the extent to which Cassirer was able to eventually defend his metaphysical and political positions is refreshing.\"--R. E. Kraft,Choice\"Skidelsky's book is a must read for those interested in the history of ideas in general and for academic philosophers in particular. Indeed, philosophers, particularly of the Anglo-American variety, will find this book especially enlightening.\"--Kevin Aho,European Legacy", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

En 1852 ingresó en el Colegio de San Agustín, que aplicaba una pedagogía muy avanzada para la época. Obtuvo el título de bachiller en Artes en 1862, en el Instituto de La Laguna, y empezó a publicar poemas satíricos, ensayos y cuentos en la prensa local. También se destacó por su interés por el dibujo y la pintura. En septiembre de 1862 Galdós se fue a vivir a Madrid y se matriculó en la universidad. Allí conoció al fundador de la Institución Libre de Enseñanza, Francisco Giner de los Ríos, que le alentó a escribir y le hizo conocer el krausismo. Por entonces frecuentó los teatros de Madrid y organizó la «Tertulia Canaria». En 1865 empezó a escribir en los periódicos La Nación y El Debate, y en la Revista del Movimiento Intelectual de Europa. Hacia 1867 hizo su primer viaje al extranjero, como corresponsal en París en la Exposición Universal.  Galdós publicó en 1870 La Fontana de Oro, su primera novela. La Sombra fue publicada en noviembre de 1870 por entregas en La Revista de España. Y en 1873 comenzó a publicar la que se puede considerar su obra maestra, los Episodios nacionales, donde refleja la vida íntima de los españoles del siglo XIX y los acontecimientos de la historia nacional que marcaron el destino de España. La obra tiene cuarenta y seis episodios en cinco series de diez novelas cada una, salvo la última, inconclusa. Empiezan con la batalla de Trafalgar y terminan con la Restauración borbónica en España. Tuvo una hija natural en 1891 de una madre que se suicidó, Lorenza Cobián. Y se relacionó con la actriz Concha Morell y la novelista Emilia Pardo Bazán. Galdós murió en su casa de la calle Hilarión Eslava de Madrid el 4 de enero de 1920.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Surgical Management of Pain is well organized, with broad coverage not only of surgical approaches to pain management but also of nonsurgical and pharmacologic methods of pain control. In fact, the general evaluation of pain and the nonsurgical management of pain are so well presented that the title of the book perhaps does it some injustice. There is also an unusual emphasis on the role of allied-health professionals in the management of pain. The list of well-known contributors to the book reads like a Who's Who in the field of pain management. They join in presenting a comprehensive approach, a variety and divergence of opinions, and actual experiences from situations encountered in practice. Each chapter is punctuated by boxes highlighting pearls that effectively emphasize the essence of each topic and includes a commentary by another authority, who not only provides another opinion or perspective on the topic but also expands on it and sometimes offers a divergent opinion or frank disagreement, making it plain that in many aspects of pain management, consensus is lacking or opinions are unequivocal. The chapters are also generally well documented, with up-to-date citations of works that are essential for a multidisciplinary study of the management of pain. The complications and aftereffects of surgery for pain are well presented, with coverage of the incidence of treatment failure or recurrence of the original pain. The resulting discomfort in such cases is emphasized, especially in the case of patients with prolonged or permanent neurologic deficits. It is extremely important for patients to have reversible pain control so that they will experience the sequelae of the surgical treatment. The book is not perfect. Several authors make an insufficient distinction between the pain due to cancer and chronic pain of non-neoplastic origin. I would also have appreciated a discussion of the timing of therapy: When should practitioners stop a nonsurgical method of pain control and resort to surgery, especially in cases involving cancer and other causes of intractable pain? The chapter on the use of controlled substances should have covered after-care procedures and the potential for drug abuse and misuse. This excellent book will interest anyone treating pain and pain syndromes, regardless of their specialty and regardless of whether they see patients whose primary symptom is pain or other patients. The material will be of value to those of all levels of expertise, from students to generalists, surgeons, and anesthesiologists and those who specialize in the day-to-day management of difficult, recurrent, and intractable pain.Benjamin M.

In the magical world of Cassaforte, his dreary life of indentured servitude seems cursed by misfortune. Traveling with a Dickensian theater troupe by sea, he ends up fending off pirates, losing his fellow thespians, and ending up on a deserted island. There he meets a charming Gurgi-like reformed pirate named Maxl a girl named Darcy and an old man, Jacopo. This motley band takes over the pirate ship, determined to sail it to Cassaforte so Jacopo can warn the city of an impending attack. In the process, Nic pieces together clues regarding his identity and the curse attached to him. Even if teens haven't readThe Glass Maker's Daughter(Flux, 2009), they can immerse themselves in this title as it is more of a companion novel than a strict sequel. The setting suggests a pseudo-European world similar to those found in Kai Meyer'sThe Water Mirror(S &amp S, 2005) or Cornelia Funke'sThe Thief Lord(Scholastic, 2002) complete with fake French, Italian, and Dutch language constructs. Some may enjoy the oddly familiar settings while other fantasy readers might wish for something more unique. Teens who read pirate novels or adventure-driven fantasy will identify with Nic's courageous attempts to help his friends and turn his misfortunes around. The dialogue can be disconnected, but the humor, friendship, and sword fighting make this title worth recommending.Caitlin Augusta, Stratford Library Association, CTCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There is no Johnny Blue, only a Johnny MacClough, a former cop who owns the bar. The woman departs. Klein finds a diamond necklace on the floor and traces high-heel marks in the snow to the woman's still-warm corpse, its mouth stuffed with a yellow bird. Coleman ( Life Goes Sleeping ) uses up his store of literary pretensions and opaque stylistic techniques at the start, but patient readers are rewarded with a somber and gripping crime story: Klein tracks down the dead woman's identity and her relationship with the tight-lipped MacClough; he unearths a few more stiffs, and he gets sordid and horizontal with a boozed-up woman journalist whose career is on its way down despite her fancy credentials. The graphic conclusion, as mob thugs surface with guns blazing, features the brief, memorable appearance of a gardening implement.

This time, she starts nosing around because her old school friend Joanna Lund, who was so hot to be introduced to much-married cattle baron Jack Hollister at a convention at Lake Tahoe, looks like the most prominent suspect when Jack's shot to death on the heels of their first dinner together. And when she hears that apart from the ranch he's left to the state as parkland, Jack's will divides his estate up among his three ex-wives, Gail--already angry at the bile the most recent of them, cruelly incompetent horse-trainer Tara Hollister, has been spitting at her--just can't keep herself from bending the ear of the detectives back home in Santa Cruz about how suspicious Tara's been acting, or from driving around to talk to Jack's hands, possible alibi witnesses, and of course exes one and two (who conveniently turn out to have connections to the case they wouldn't want anybody to know about). In fact, between unauthorized cross-examinations of the subjects--whom Gail quizzes with all the finesse of Raymond Burr at his most acerbic--and more pleasant interludes for her trademark veterinary calls, Gail's such a busy bee that even the obligatory death threats have to be squeezed in toward the end. Gail's third (Hoofprints, 1996, etc.) features transparent mystery-mongering, wafer-thin characters, and some of the nicest horses you'll ever meet. --Copyright ©1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The plot hinges on a gimmick, namely, the manuscript of a mystery penned by Glick, who has disappeared while working on a case in Sunburst, Colo., where 19-year-old college dropout Dani Kaplan was last seen; he has been hired by the young woman's mother to find her. Having talked his network into letting him cover the World Cup ski races in Sunburst, Andy and Susie pick up the trail where the manuscript leaves off. Dani's last known companion, ski in- structor Casey Wright, is embroiled in plans to develop the national forest as ski slopes. Forest Service rangers oppose the plan, and one of them, linked to Dani, has been killed, supposedly in an avalanche. Andy and Susie must discover who would have the most to lose if the development is halted. Before long, some ski bunnies try to murder Susie, and both Murray and Dani reappear. The identity of the evil developer comes as no surprise, but Katz's deadpan humor helps to redeem a less than riveting plot.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B007PJ1MHY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The work breathes a love for God, a deep understanding of Biblical theology, and a warmly poignant grasp of human nature—with its failings and its potentials. His applications of Deuteronomy’s teaching are both perceptive and relevant. While showing an awareness of scholarly treatments, the work is very accessible to those who do not have scholarly training. It is highly recommended.”—John Oswalt, Distinguished Professor of Old Testament, Asbury Theological Seminary“Vintage Fernando. Like all of his preaching, this book is a model of the wonderful gift that God has given to Ajith Fernando for simple, clear, and challenging exposition of the Word of God. Without evading the more difficult questions and problems that scholars have wrestled with in the book of Deuteronomy, he does not allow them to dominate but stays close to the thrust of the text, patiently explaining and applying it step by step. The rich infusion of illustrations that are mostly drawn from the challenges and stresses, joys and sorrows of his own experience in ministry add a wonderful earthy texture to the whole book as we constantly weave between the Biblical world and today’s world in a way that listens to and engages with both. This book is a deep well of Biblical study, ethical challenge, practical advice, pastoral wisdom, and spiritual warmth. It breathes love for God, God’s Word, God’s world, and God’s people.”—Christopher J. H.

This collection has something in it for everyone. The people who have read my Holiday Letters for the past 14 years (which were more like blogs) encouraged me to write more, and to share my writing with a wider audience. You should read this book if: you have ever had a child die; if you know someone who has faced serious adversity; if you have ever had your heart broken in a relationship; if you have or are connected to a special needs child; if you have ever doubted whether you are good enough; if you have ever wondered if what you do makes a difference; if you are facinated by family dynamics; or if you have any interest in observations, sermons, poetry, short stories and motivational speeches. It is all weaved together from a son's point of view, so there is actually a story being told. My hope is that anyone who reads this book will be changed somehow in a way that they have dreamed about.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Wimpy-virgin-heroine always making bad choices and getting herself in trouble, cue the macho hero, yadda yadda yadda. Those books are what inspired me to write my own stories, not because I loved them, but because I constantly found myself tossing them aside and fuming. I would think of all the ways the story would have been better: if she had just picked up the sword and stabbed the bad guy when she had the chance...I LOVE writing, and I love the new direction that fiction has taken over the last decade. So many amazing, strong female leads now! And so many new writers that finally have a voice in the indie publishing community.I was blessed with a wonderful husband who supports my passion for writing and reading, and who really helped me focus my desire to publish my work. When I'm not busy enjoying my daughter and husband, I'm usually developing a new story idea, or sneaking in a bit of free time with my favorite authors.I'm a bit of a hermit, they called it being \"shy\" when I was a kid, but I love hearing from fans. I also love ferrets, hiking, chili dark chocolate, strong coffee, nursing mamas, and rain.​", "related": ["B00K5ZC0OY"], "rank": 1603736, "title": "Vanik", "author": "Aimee Roseland", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.8333, "rating_total": 29.0}

Life was good until the bubble burst and I found myself unemployed with credit card debt, a brand new car (with payments) and a brand new mortgage. After a brief period of self pity I started searching for gainful employment. Unfortunately, Las Vegas was at the epicenter of a crumbling real estate market, evaporating new construction projects and double digit unemployment...not prime for a college educated guy with a strong construction background. At the bottom, looking up, I began feeling around for a new professional direction. Familiarizing myself with progressive minded entrepreneurs like Gary Vaynerchuck and Tim Ferriss, allowed me to change my outlook and give me some needed optimism and nerve to begin developing my own entrepreneurial skill set. I built an online marketing company that helps small businesses with their online efforts back in 2010. I just recently started a new company, Social Sinergy. We specialize in Brand Management and helping businesses improve thier customer service efforts. I have also coached 800+ like minded entrepreneurs in growing their online businesses.

We\nwere in our regular weekly meeting with Eloheim and all of a sudden no one--not\nthe group, not me, and not Eloheim--could remember what we had been discussing. It\nwas as if we had jumped into another time stream. I wish I had a less woo-woo\nway of describing it, but I don't. We could feel \"other versions\" of ourselves\nsitting in a circle on the other side of the room. As Eloheim and I explored\nthis energetic, The Visionaries were allowed to come in and I channeled their\nfirst message.That was just the beginning. Over the next 12 months, six\nadditional groups joined what has become known as The Council. TheBirth of The Councilseries of seven\nbooks documents the 56 weekly sessions held during that time.Volume twoincludes two more messages from The Visionaries. Revisiting these meetings\nreminds me of howintenseThe\nVisionaries were in the beginning. They've mellowed some as our relationship\nhas evolved. They speak their truth with NO hesitation! There is also a very\npowerful \"preview of The Council\" in this book.Even though I was hesitant to connect with anyone other than\nEloheim, I am sure glad that I did. The amazing energy, information, love, and\nfun that have come from getting to know The Visionaries, The Guardians, The\nGirls, The Warrior, The Matriarch, and Fred have brought so much to my life.

Susan is trying to heal after a heartbreaking breakup with her boyfriend, so she decides to return to her hometown in Winston Springs and open a flower shop, and hopefully start to mend her broken heart. And like in all small towns, everyone knows all about everyone else, and that includes Susan, so the matchmaking begins to find her a new beau. And who else would be a perfect match but the single preacher at the church in the community? But what does the preacher say about that?Wow, I really enjoyed this heartwarming Easter story. I love the community and its residents because they never cease to show how much they care for each other. But maybe they show their care just a little too much for Susan and preacher Ben because they are both nursing past heart wounds and neither is interested in romance. But this is what makes the story so enjoyable. Being able to watch the two deal with their past hurts and begin to heal keeps you reading the story to see what the outcome will be. This is a very short story, with only forty one pages, so you can read it in one setting. I encourage you to purchase a copy, sit down and enjoy a delightful, springtime romance in the pages of \"Like a Lily\" by Victoria Pitts-Caine. I think you will be very happy that you chose this entertaining book.", "related": ["B00KG252XM"], "rank": 1852869, "title": "Like a Lily", "author": "Victoria Pitts-Caine", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.9, "rating_total": 49.0}

Readers be VERY wary of reviews of Buddhist material on Amazon, most of my negative reviews are amazon members who have not bought the book and want to compete for some reason.  Check next to the rating for \"verified  amazon purchase\" before you rely on any review on amazon.Bad reviews, I don't care, it won't stop me from publishing nor will it stop me from translating. Those writing because of spite will face Karmic retribution in time.  I worry for them.  I'm the second generation of American translators here in the USA.  I've joined in several Fo Guang Shan and Dharma Realm Buddhist Association efforts as a Sangha contributor, and when I have time I will continue to do so.  I want you to understand that translators are bus boys, nail salon technicians, travel agents, business owners, CEOs, doctors, nurses, mail carriers, volunteers, devotees, Sangha of all traditions who are interested, very few are academics.  But the scholarship of these wonderful people often exceeds the academic world, and what it's capable of being.  Some are so devoted to the Surangama Mantra that they make it their life practice as Buddhists.  It's stunning how much a retiree can tell you of their own scholarship that spans a lifetime!  They do it for their beloved, their children and their own selves.  Think about this they grab 5 minutes to work with me, at it aides me so much that I can continue my translation without hesitation.  Sangha members do in this way, we do anything to complete our task but we do not belittle each other or other's efforts in making the time to do translations, because many of these lovely people stayed up all night to teach me words the next day. They put in 12 hour work days and come to the temple to help me.  That's awesome!", "related": [], "rank": 938617, "title": "Heroes Spell (Mahayana Chinese Buddhism Book 1)", "author": "Ven.

This is a book that scholars of 20th century American literature, filmmaking, Jewish identity, and women's studies must read. --Alison Piepmeir, author of Girl Zines: Making Media, Doing FeminismEliza McGraw s insightful analysis introduces a new generation to the Pulitzer Prize winning American novelist and playwright Edna Ferber, whose evocative works captured a country grappling with modernity and mythology through the lens of race, class, ethnicity, gender, and region. In her beautifully written, deep readings of twelve of Ferber s novels, McGraw unveils the author s complex identity, from her turn-of-the-century working-class, midwestern Jewish roots to her contested position in New York s glittering literary scene of the early twentieth century. --Marcie Cohen Ferris, coeditor of Jewish Roots in Southern Soil: A New History", "related": ["B003X27SH0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I was crying with laughter at parts, which I rarely do.The story focuses on Scott (someone who believes he can not do commitments or families) who meets Cathy and her children when they appear next door whilst babysitting triplets. The two end up on the road together with the 6 children to try and find the triplets mother.

Hoy existe una proliferación de libros que aducen ser sobre el Sonido (particularmente a través del Mantra) y Terapia. Estos son a menudo vagos y de pobre investigación previa, en particular los que tratan acerca de la pronunciación de mantras en sánscrito y que generan estados emotivos más que una verdadera transformación. Es por lo tanto un estimulante placer haber conocido el libro de Levy, que trata sobre la esencia del Sonido, la acústica del Yo, la relación entre Sonido y Espacio, Resonancia, Vibración, Armonía y la experiencia del Ser sea en el sonido, y quizás más importantemente aún, en el Silencio. Daniel Levy ha realizado una considerable serie de grabaciones, incluidas las de “Syntony” sobre la Terapia Pitagórica a través del sonido armónico. Habiendo penetrado la esencia de la Tradición Occidental Músico-Terapéutica / Armónica (que en Sócrates gobernaba el entero campo de la cuestión Humanística – Artística), así como también la Tradición Védica del sonido – Chandas (ritmo) y de la expresión musical, uno puede reconocer la devoción de Levy, su amplitud de respiro y comprensión de esta expresión vital de nuestro Ser y recomendar sin reservas este libro a todos los genuinos buscadores del Conocimiento del Ser a través del Sonido y del Silencio.” PETER HARRISON – DIRECTOR DE WATKINS BOOKS – LONDRES, REINO UNIDO Co-autor de Dhatu Patha – un estudio sobre las raíces del Lenguaje, autor de “Sonidos de Shiva – un comentario sobre el Mahesvara Sutra”“En éste excelente libro, verdadero himno al sentido del oído se recorren todos los caminos que conducen a la experiencia profunda del Ser individual y universal a través del Sonido. Sonido como vibración acústica, como inspiración musical, como lenguaje y como escuchar, como armonía y salud del cuerpo y de la mente, como espacio y como arquetipo de las formas. El cuerpo es un amplificador, es un instrumento musical. Si se bloquea es porque nosotros bloqueamos. Conocer nuestra nota interior, afinarse en relación a ella equivale a conocer el nombre secreto de los antiguos egipcios. Cualquier forma es un conjunto de vibraciones y reconocer esto quiere decir aprender el lenguaje universal de la Naturaleza. Un texto, este de Daniel Levy, rico de indicios para reflexionar y crecer a nivel interior.” REVISTA HERA, ITALIA“… Levy trata el extremadamente poderoso tema del Arquetipo Central del Ser, el espacio desde donde el sonido esférico es irradiado, inclusivo y completo, que no excluye mas sintetiza. Un acto muy significativo si se piensa que el autor es un músico y, como tal, puede imaginarse el esfuerzo que debe de haber hecho para emerger de la experiencia de concertista y entrar, como a menudo él lo declara, a la Música/Vida. La Eufonía está centrada en una serie de prácticas para abordar el mundo interior y sus símbolos de totalidad, para descubrir la posibilidad enteramente humana para contactarse con el concierto de la filogénesis, buscando el puente entre el Macrocosmos y el Microcosmos. Aquí comprendemos cuánto Daniel Levy ha elaborado el pensamiento de Alan Daniélou y cómo llevó a cabo el trabajo que éste había dejado intuir. La Eufonía, como lugar de encuentro con los orígenes de la música-vida obra para reunirnos con la función natural de la música que los recientes años de tecnicismo han interrumpido. La Eufonía pone en relieve una ecología del inconsciente, un intento de encontrar nuevamente la consciencia de las funciones naturales, de la cual depende el símbolo de los arquetipos.” PROF. RAFFAELE MORELLI, REVISTA RIZA PSICOSOMATICA, ITALIA“… Todos encontramos en el transcurso de nuestras vidas libros que nos dejan profundas y perdurables impresiones, libros que nos han enseñado, por la forma que enfocan distintos temas, algo nuevo, algo que tiene resonancia dentro de nuestro ser más profundo. Bien, entonces, cualquiera que tenga la fortuna de leer ‘Eufonía El Sonido de la Vida’ de Daniel Levy, encontrará en el libro la llave que al abrir nuestra puerta interior, nos lleva a conocernos armónicamente y nos enseña, a través de los movimientos musicales del Yo cómo usar lo mejor de nuestra personalidad, siguiendo ritmos biológicos y las relaciones que existen entre el sonido y el organismo psicofísico en cada uno de nosotros. Levy nos ofrece, en nuevas formas, algunos significados y aspectos del sonido y de la función de la música en todas las manifestaciones de la existencia. El sonido físico es una reverberación del Sonido inaudible. Todos los cuerpos, ya sean animados o no, tienen su propia y especifica resonancia. Aprendemos que en cada individuo existe un núcleo eufónico que puede ser descubierto, expandido y utilizado. Penetrar en la esencia de la Eufonía significa redescubrir nuestra propia realidad resonante. Cuando hallemos la sintonía entre nuestro ritmo interior, el ritmo del mundo y el ambiente en el cual vivimos, lograremos evolucionar y darle sentido a la vida. El libro de Levy es agradable y fácil para leer, no obstante trate temas profundos y específicos. Aquellos a los cuales este libro está destinado reconocerán el mensaje y la enseñanza y después de haberlo leído y comprendido no serán más los mismos de antes.” PROF. G.

On the same day that Victor Linz is shot during an early morning jog, reports filter in that an out-of-orbit satellite may land on Kauai. A reporter tailing an intelligence officer from the mainland is found near the remote site of the satellite crash; he is comatose and suffering from severe skin and internal ailments. Panic follows when a rumor spreads that the satellite carried a deadly toxin. In his usual phlegmatic style, Cobb conducts the murder investigation and helps maintain calm on the island. While he negotiates with one of the murder suspects who is hijacking a commercial airliner, Chazz tries to determine the origin and nature of the toxin. Peace returns to Kauai after the murder and the mystery of the poison are neatly connected, but by then a surfeit of extraneous dialogue and diversionary action has dulled the reader's interest.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00DANV74C"], "rank": 1174036, "title": "Toxin: A Thriller in Paradise (The Thriller in Paradise Series Book 2)", "author": "Rob Swigart", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.1429, "rating_total": 29.0}

They were convinced he was a mantequero because he was so pale and\nthin, and were about to murder him on the spot, but decided, to be on the safe\nside, to take him to the mayor. Luckily the mayor was not so superstitious and\ntold them he was not a mantequero but an Englishman. I was very intrigued by this and did some research. There isn't a\ngreat deal written down about the supernatural being but, as with other kinds\nof vampire, real live people have been accused of imitating the mantequero, the\nmost notorious beingJuan\nDíaz de Garayo, who confessed to six murders but was probably responsible for\nmany more. He was, however, only given the title 'mantequero' because a child\nhe attacked was so horrified by his ugly face that she thought he was the\nsacamantecas. A more viable candidate is Manuel Blanco Romasanta, born in 1809,\nwho was a travelling vendor of fats used for greasing wheels. He was accused of\nusing human fat in his products, but escaped justice and went on to murder a\nfurther nine people, inflicting horrible wounds and partially eating their\ncorpses.As\nrecently asthe summer of 1910, Francisco Leone, a healer, kidnapped\nand killed a seven year old boy with the sole purpose of extracting his blood\nand fat, for use in the cure of a third man suffering from tuberculosis. But\nof the legend there is very little, so I felt justified in inventing my own\nmantequero. I hope you liked him. Mantequero\n2 will be released later this year.", "related": ["B00BZODJZS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 19, "rating_average": 4.4211, "rating_total": 84.0}

At 22, she has lost her mother and just about everyone else in her life. In this book written by Forbes Arnone, the story starts after her loss.   After their falling out and before her death, her mother had arranged a trip to Hawaii for her. The letter explains that she now has the chance to experience Hawaii, just as her mother did, and also to reconnect with the father she thought was dead. After a month, she takes the trip and follows in her mom's footsteps. In Hawaii, her life takes a different turn, just when she thought she had accepted all her losses. What's not to love about In My Mother's Footsteps? There are no reasons on my list because I totally love the book. Forbes Arnone was able to capture my attention with this love story which is fresh and honest to the core. The story was also realistic and believable. I had no trouble imagining it happen at present time. There were some emotions at play and they mixed pretty well. I really felt each character's emotion and I sympathized with them or I'd feel just about the opposite. Anela was such a lovely character. I really felt her loss and I was teary-eyed when things took a surprise turn for her. Yet, I look up to her for being independent and strong. Her chemistry with Christian is undeniable and I cannot help but get sucked in, too. However, the very best chemistry came from the unconditional love and new found life demonstrated in this book. In My Mother's Footsteps has a very good plot and the story was woven quite well. It's such a lovely read. I believe nobody should miss reading this.", "related": ["B00EBW1ZQG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 19, "rating_average": 4.4211, "rating_total": 84.0}

May finds an unlikely champion in Travis Worth, the railroad foreman who's come to the bank to collect the money to pay his men. But Travis, a former physician disillusioned by his stint as a Civil War battlefield surgeon, doesn't want to be anyone's hero--he's saving his money until he can escape to a tropical island and finish the rest of his life in peace. Things get ugly as Edwin spreads the rumor that May actually stole the missing funds, and soon, even Travis can't protect her from the unruly mobs of railroad workers who want their pay. Readers who like romances about Civil War doctors, such as Anita Mills'Bittersweet(1997) and Laurel Collins'Patchwork Angel(1998), will enjoy DeGroot's.Shelley MosleyCopyright © American Library Association.

As the creator of almost all supernatural creatures, Lilith is the preeminent\n building block for my Traversing Eternity world of books. Since the beginning of time, she has been a part of history, playing important roles while hiding her true face.I created the Diary of Lilith series to let people see the complexities behind a magical woman who has been alive since the beginning of man. Her power and her darkness might only be matched by her strength and heart. Eternity is a long time to live with an evil inside that could outweigh the good. Lilith's world is on the brink of chaos. Her enemies are coming at her from different angles and in each series you will meet new characters with their own forces of evil to conquer.There will be several different series: The Road to Ruin Series, which begins with Acelynn's story of sacrificing herself for the people she loves; A New Breed Series, the story of Unique, a formervampire'sslave, who went on to become a rogue vampire hunter and found herself forced to work with her enemy for justice; And The Wolven Naguales Chronicles, the story of creatures created by an evil sorceress by fusing the spirit of a wolf and a human into a magical, shape-shifting body.While each series can be read individually, as a whole, you will see a much bigger story unfold. Characters will bounce between series and become part of a story that will lead you even further into the world I have created. I hope you enjoy these little short reads about Lilith's past and continue to follow her future in all the books that will come out of the world of Traversing Eternity.~Reyna", "related": [], "rank": 37750, "title": "Dracula (Diary Of Lilith Book 1) eBook", "author": "Reyna Pryde", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Many of the events involving the soldiers in training, Vietnam and as POWs are also based on true stories of those who were really there. The rest is mostly fiction designed to encapsulate the lessons learned in a dramatic and touching way. Mark has spent much of his finance and accounting career writing technically for his corporate audiences. Even though he has been a prolific writer of reports, analysis and strategic business plans, this is his first attempt at a novel. However, because he is such a natural story teller, he has plans for many more. Mark currently lives on the side of a mountain in a small town high in the Rockies. He is married to SherLynne, whom he adores and is the father of eleven children and grandfather to five.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Eileen read English at Oxford, and afterwards spent some unmemorable years in 'Admin' before breaking free and dividing her life in two: winters in London doing temporary jobs to earn money and experience, summers at home as a freelance journalist,spinning 'think pieces' for the Liverpool Daily Post and any other publications that would take them, and reporting on food and fashion for the long defunct Illustrated Liverpool News, as well as writing a few plays.   Her first sustained piece of writing was a fantasy for children which was never published but secured an agent.Her Great Autobiographical Novel was never published either, although damned with faint praise and leading to an attempt at crime writing that worked: over the next thirty years she produced almost a book a year and also published some short stories in anthologies and Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine.   Eileen has always written from an ironic stance, never allowing her favourite characters to take themselves too seriously: a banana skin is ever lurking.", "related": ["B00BVC1SSE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The first reason is a result of listening to her grandson, who at 6 years of age started telling her numerous stories that were pretty hard to believe. He is now 10 years old, has an adventurous spirit and is quite the story teller. He and the author have documented several other stories. Most of his stories revolve around being outside, playing in the woods, observing nature, and doing other outdoor activities. The author has 10 grandchildren with 6 of them being between the ages of 17 months and 11years. She wants them to have a \"love of reading, writing, and imagination\" She envisions this story capturing their attention, wanting them to excel in their reading and writing skills. The second reason for writing this story was the recently established education rules in Indiana where third grade students must pass a reading test before they are promoted to the next grade level. Therefore, the story is written on a third grade reading level. The author hopes this story will be an added spark for young children to read during their leisure reading time at the library or at home. The third reason for writing the book is the author's love of kids. She is a retired teacher and school administrator with 31 years of experience. She holds a B.S. and an M.S. in Business Education, and received her Ph.D. in School Administration. All degrees were obtained at Indiana State University, Terre Haute, IN. In the 2007-2008 school year she was named, \"Indiana's Middle School Principal of the Year\" She has had numerous speaking engagements. The author believed that her experiences and training would assist in the writing of a children's book.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I found myself wanting to know\nmore about the community and its secrets as I turned the pages. To learn about\nthe strong bond that exists between our protagonists Steven and Caitlin.\nVanessa's writing is very readable and easy. She draws you into the subjects\nand the overriding story of people like you and me, who maybe different and\nfictional, but are yet totally believable as people with hopes and dreams.Steven Thorn and Caitlin Chance were born to be\ntogether even though they come from different worlds. Even though love is\nstrong, sometimes it is not enough. Can they remain together? When they first\nfell in love it seemed inevitable, but how will it end when they return to the\ncommunity of super humans.This book, with its Sci-Fi vampire elements is about\nfamily loyalty and friendship, the choices one has to make on life's journey,\nand about what the future will bring. This is a family saga and how one person\ncan affect the lives of everyone is something most of us can relate to.Vanessa recognises she has found inspiration in\nGibraltar and in her experiences growing up as a child in a closed border\nsituation. A deep understanding of this unique community in the Amazon is also\nreminiscent of the tight knit community of ours.This is not the kind of book I normally read but I\nfound myself immersed in the story, caring for the central characters and\nfascinated by the doings in the Community.For\nteenagers and older... a fun and exciting read.\"Alice\nMascarenhas, Gibraltar Chronicle", "related": ["B00CWG91QE"], "rank": 1010263, "title": "Return", "author": "Vanessa Wester", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After many \"meetings\" and tests, it was proven that the voices were simply her over active imagination and odd sense of humor. Not mental illness. BJ worked as a zookeeper for ten years and some of those experiences, with the changing of names to protect those who do not wish to be named, find their way into her work. Blame It on Elvis is her first complete published novel. Currently BJ is working on a paranormal series. The first, entitled Vargulf: Blood Ties, is scheduled for release this summer.

He created some of the world's most memorable fictional characters and is generally regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian period. During his life, his works enjoyed unprecedented fame, and by the twentieth century his literary genius was broadly acknowledged by critics and scholars. His novels and short stories continue to be widely popular.Born in Portsmouth, England, Dickens was forced to leave school to work in a factory when his father was thrown into debtors' prison. Although he had little formal education, his early impoverishment drove him to succeed. Over his career he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas and hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.Dickens sprang to fame with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. His plots were carefully constructed, and Dickens often wove in elements from topical events into his narratives. Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha'pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age. His 1843 novella, A Christmas Carol, is one of the most influential works ever written, and it remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. Set in London and Paris, his 1859 novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is the best selling novel of all time.  The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The target, a portly Canadian defense contractor with a heart\ncondition, was selling his country's missile launch codes--not only to an\ninternational terrorist group, but to the Chinese as well. A traitor was one\nthing. A traitor who double-dipped on what was supposed to be exclusive intel\nwas an accident waiting to happen. Fat Ass's life\ninsurance policy was about to be cancelled. The man's medical\ncharts showed that his enlarged prostate sent him to the john at least twice an\nhour. And since he was a stickler for getting to his departure gate at least an\nhour before wheels-up, all Carl had to do was wait until Fat Ass was hit with\nthe urge to take one more bathroom break. After the extermination, Carl would\nhop his own flight home to Los Angeles, which was scheduled out of YVR around\nthe same time as Fat Ass's flight. He didn't have to wait\nlong. Five minutes after Fat Ass checked in with the gate attendant, he went in\nsearch of the nearest men's room. Carl was a step ahead\nof him. He was dressed in a janitor's uniform, so no one questioned him as he\nrolled a mop and bucket in front of the door and placed an OUT OF ORDER sign on\nthe handle. After he rousted the two guys zipping up in front of the urinal, he\nwent back outside so that he could greet Fat Ass with the assurance that \"the\nfloor should be dry by now, so go on in.\" Fat Ass barely\nacknowledged him with a nod, let alone a thank you. Carl left the sign on\nthe doorknob and followed Fat Ass into the restroom with the mop and rolling\nbucket, locking the door behind them. Fat Ass was mid-whiz\nwhen Carl pricked him in the back of his thigh with the needle filled with\nsuccinylcholine--probably not the best time to do so, because Fat Ass's response\nwas to turn around, dick in hand. \"What the hell!\" they\nshouted in unison--Carl because Fat Ass sprayed his very expensive John Lobb\nbrogues with urine, and Fat Ass because, let's face it, that needle hurt like\nhell. Fat Ass was shocked,\nbut Carl was angry. The shoes were a thou a pair! Still, he resisted the urge\nto punch the guy in the throat, which would cause him to double over, at which\npoint Carl would bash his head against the wall and toss him onto the tile\nfloor to stomp to a bloody pulp-- But only because that\nwould defeat the purpose of making the hit look like an accidental death, as\nper his client's instructions. By now, Fat Ass was\nonto the fact that Carl was there to kill him. Having no lethal weapon, but\nfully aware that Carl was concerned about the condition of his shoes, he\nbrandished his spraying organ in his assailant's direction. In the best of all\npossible worlds, by now the guy would have fallen backward into Carl's arms so\nthat he could drag him into one of the stalls and heave him up on a toilet for\nsome harried traveler to find. An autopsy would reveal he'd had a heart attack\nwhen he sat down for a grunt. \"Die already, you son\nof a bitch,\" Carl hissed at the man as he dodged the spray as best as he\ncould. If his fancy footwork couldn't save his shoes, maybe it would wear out\nFat Ass, who seemed to have the constitution--not to mention the pissing\npower--of a rhino. Carl's\nlight-footedness seemed to do the trick. Fat Ass's chest must have started\ntightening up on him because one hand dropped limply to his side. Finally, thought Carl. Noting that the\nCanadian was leaning back, he positioned himself to catch the slumping hulk-- Only to have to leap\nin front of the man in time to cradle him before he fell to his knees or\ncracked his head on the tile. Metaphorically\nspeaking, with death comes relief. But in this case, Fat Ass also relieved what\nwas left in his bladder all over Carl's shoes. \"Damn it,\"\nCarl swore again. His damp shoes\nsqueaked as he hauled the body into the nearest stall and shoved it up onto the\njohn. By bending Fat Ass's knees and positioning them far enough apart, the\nbody might just resist the gravitational pull to fall to the floor long enough\nfor Carl's plane to be wheels up. He had just mopped up\nthe puddles of piss when he heard the sob. He froze. Was it coming from Fat\nAss's stall? How the hell could that be? He stayed perfectly\nstill. Minutes went by that seemed like hours. A flushing sound came\nfrom one of the next stalls. Shit, Carl thought. He\nslowly removed the knife concealed in his trouser leg and flicked it open. His\nsteps toward the stall were slow and silent. The door creaked open. Out popped a head. It belonged to a boy.\nHe couldn't be any more than nine years old. Still, the boy had\nheard everything. Maybe he'd even seen what happened through the crack between\nthe door and the stall. Having a witness to\none of his hits was a first for Carl. The boy shook while\nCarl thought through his options. In this case, a knife wasn't necessary. He\ncould pinch the boy's nostrils and suffocate him in less than two minutes. But\nif he killed the kid, it would be too much of a coincidence that two people had\ndied in the same restroom on the same day. I'm no monster, Carl\ntold himself. For the first time\nsince he'd become a hard man, he had a chance to prove it. No one had jiggled the\nrestroom door's lock, so the sign was certainly keeping everyone away. But surely\nthe kid's parents were looking for him by now and beginning to panic as well.\nCarl knew he'd be freaking out if it were one of his children. He had two kids\nof his own: his daughter, Mary, was seven. His son, Jeff, would be five\ntomorrow. This was one of the reasons he had to make it home tonight. He wondered what Jeff\nwould do in the same situation. Just at that moment,\nthe boy raised his head. His eyes sought out Carl's.  Then the boy reached\nout to him. He held something in his hand--a Wolverine action figure. \"You...can\nhave it, if you want.\" Carl stared down at\nit. Finally he muttered, \"Thanks.\" He kneeled down so that he was eye level\nwith the boy. \"What did you see?\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 55.0}
