As the story progresses, the characters to which you are introduced have individual character, but not all can be trusted.The story starts off a little slowly, setting the atmosphere and character development, but as the adventure begins the story quickly unfolds and the challenges that our adventurers face are many. They need to rely on their whit, cunning, and courage to take on characters with vast unyielding powers.The conclusion of the story leaves you grasping for more. I have book two on order and can not wait for it to arrive. It is my opinion that this book is a must read for the young and old alike.--Don LewisDragon's Bloodby MJ AllaireDenicalis Dragon ChroniclesReviewed by Heather PayeWhen Tonia, Diam, Nicho, and Micah discover a cave near the village of Uncava they decide to go exploring and see what secrets such a strange cave might hold. Upon entering, they find creatures unknown and known--some life threatening! They even discover some kind of strange stones, they aren't normal, but what do they do?Muscala, a huge cave snake... a loyal cave snake... wants something, and is determined to get it. Will his conniving words, violent ways, and murderous thoughts get him what he wants?Dragon's Bloodis definitely a great read! I recommend this to the middle grade readers. It's a clean book, but not to the point of sacrificing the high-adrenaline scenes. It's one of those books you read, you put down, contemplate getting up and taking care of the basic human needs, then pick the book back up and continue reading. It's quite addicting. The letters are larger than most paperback books making it an easy read for those new novel readers. The length is perfect, and I can't wait to read the next installment. Readers, if you're a fan of adventure, unknown, and magical creatures - grab a copy ofDragon's Bloodtoday!--Heather PayeWhen Tonia, Diam, Nicho, and Micah go to explore the hidden cave that Tonia and her best friend Diam discovered the day before, they would literally discover a whole new world. A world filled with wonder, mythical creatures, glowing stones as well as skeleton bones.The explorers are faced with many decisions and find stones along the way that will lead to a portal. The portal will only open when all of the glowing stones are combined, and only one person can make this happen. When Muscala, the giant cave snake is right behind them, getting ready to make them his meal... it vanishes. Muscala is vexed with the group after they tricked him into believing they actually did possess the Dragon's Blood.A world of dragons as the story is told lies in wait... don't miss out on book II of the Denicalis Dragon Chronicles.MJ Allaire pens an interestingly inventive young adult read with her bookDragon's Blood, book One in the Denicalis Dragon Chronicles. The children at times come face to face with their fears as well as discovering what lays in wait inside each new cavern the group explores. A fun frolic in the land of fantasy, Allaire paints a vivid picture with her words that I am sure most young adults will love. 4 Hearts--Crystal Adkins", "related": [], "rank": 3427405, "title": "Dragon's Blood: Denicalis Dragon Chronicles - Book One", "author": "MJ Allaire", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

'She'd do.''I beg your pardon, sir?'There was no emotion in the question. The man sitting next to the Prince on the top table at the lavish Midsummer ball wore the carefully controlled expression of a career diplomat, and had a voice to match. Thin and lugubrious, with sun-starved features, it would have been impossible for Marco Romagnoli to provide a sharper contrast to his employer, and Crown Prince Alessandro's blistering good looks were supported by one of the brightest minds in Europe, as well as all the presence and easy charm that was his by right of birth.'I said she'd do,' the Prince repeated impatiently, turning a compelling gaze on his aide-de-camp. 'You've paraded every woman of marriageable age before me, Marco, and failed to tempt me once. I like the look of this girl—'And it was a lot more than just her stunning appearance, Alessandro acknowledged silently as his glance went back to the stage. The girl possessed an incredible energy not dissimilar to his own—an energy that seemed to leap out from the gaudily dressed performance area and thump him straight in the chest.All he had to offer her was a cold-blooded business deal, but…His sensuous mouth curved in a thoughtful smile. In this instance mixing business with pleasure might not be such a bad thing.'Are you serious, Your Royal Highness?' Marco Romagnoli murmured, taking care not to alert their fellow diners.'Would I joke about so serious a matter as my future wife?' Alessandro demanded in a fierce whisper. 'She looks like fun.''Fun, sir?' Marco Romagnoli leaned forward to follow his employer's eyeline. 'You are talking about the singer with the band?''You find something wrong with that?' the Prince demanded, swivelling round to level a challenging gaze on his aide's face.'No, sir,' Marco returned in a monotone, knowing the Prince would brook no prejudice based on flimsy face-value evidence. 'But if I may ask an impertinent question…?''Ask away,' Alessandro encouraged, his firm mouth showing the first hint of amusement as he guessed the way Marco's mind was working.'She'd do for what, exactly, sir…? Only she's rather—''Luscious? Bold? Striking? In your face? What?' the Prince prompted adjusting his long legs as if the enforced inactivity was starting to irk him.All of those,' Marco suggested uncomfortably, his glance flashing back to the stage, where Emily Weston was well into her third number and clearly had the affluent, well-oiled crowd eating out of her hand. 'I can see that a young lady like that holds a certain attraction for—' Marco Romagnoli eased his fingers under a starched white collar that seemed to be on the point of choking him.'Go on. Don't stop now,' Prince Alessandro encouraged, reining in his amusement.Taking a few moments to rethink his approach, the usually unflappable courtier replied carefully, 'Well, sir, I can see she's a beauty, and undoubtedly perfect for certain activities. But you surely can't be thinking—''You mean I should bed her, not wed her?' Alessandro suggested dryly, as he looked back to where Emily had the microphone clutched between both hands for a slow number, looking as if she was about to devour it.'I couldn't have put it better myself, sir. In my opinion such an ill-judged match would only create more problems than it would solve.''I disagree,' the Crown Prince of Ferara countered, 'and nothing you can say will persuade me that the girls you have paraded before me would fill the role any better—or vacate it without causing problems.'He paused, and took another long look at the stage. 'As it is not my intention to break any hearts, Marco, this is the perfect solution. I want a straightforward business deal and a short-term bride—''Short-term, sir?'Alessandro turned to answer the disquiet so clearly painted across the other man's face.'I know,' he said, leaning closer to ensure they were not overheard. 'You're thinking of all the other implications such an arrangement would entail—I would expect nothing less of you, my old friend.'The Prince's companion grew ever more troubled. Even if he could have shed the role of cautious professional advisor, Marco Romagnoli had known Alessandro from the day of his birth, and was considered an honorary member of the royal family.'I wouldn't wish to see anyone take advantage of you, sir,' he said now, with concern.'I shall take good care to ensure that none of the parties involved in my plan is taken advantage of,' Alessandro assured him. 'Thanks to our country's archaic legislation I can think of no other way to solve the problem of succession.If my father is to have his wish and retire I must marry immediately. It's obvious to me that this young woman has spirit. When I put my proposition to her I think she will have an instant grasp of the advantages that such a match can bring to both of us.''Yes, sir,' Marco agreed reluctantly, flinching visibly as Emily launched into a raunchy upbeat number.'I have seen enough, Marco,' the Prince said, reclaiming his aide's attention. 'And I like what I see. Please advise the young lady that Alessandro Bussoni wishes to talk with her after the performance tonight. No titles,' he warned. 'And if she asks, just say I have a proposition to put to her. And don't forget to ask her name,' he added as, without another word, Marco Romagnoli rose to his feet.After the show, Emily Weston, the singer with the band, was having a tense debate over the phone with her twin sister Miranda.'Well, howdoyou deal with them?' she demanded, shouldering the receiver to scoop up another huge blob of cleansing cream from her twin's industrial-sized pot.'Who do you mean?' Miranda snuffled between ear-splitting sneezes.'Stage Door Johnnies—'Miranda's summer cold symptoms dissolved into laughter. 'Stage Door Whosies?''Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about,' Emily insisted, flashing another concerned glance towards the dressing room door.'I didn't think there was such a thing as Stage Door Johnnies nowadays,' Miranda said doubtfully.'Well, I can assure you there is,' Emily insisted. 'What else would you call uninvited gentleman callers who won't take no for an answer?''Depends on who's doing the calling, I suppose,' Miranda conceded, blasting out another sneeze. 'Why don't you just take a look at him first, before you decide?''No way! That's never been part of our agreement.''But if he looks like Herman Munster you can send him packing… and if he's a babe, pass him on to me. He'd never know the difference. If Mum and Dad can't tell us apart, what chance does this man stand? What have you got to lose?''Look, I'll have to go,' Emily said as another rap, far more insistent than the last, bounced off the walls around her head. 'I told his messenger I couldn't see anyone I didn't know immediately after a show—pleading artistic temperament. He still hasn't taken the hint.''He sent someone round first?' Miranda cut in, her voice taut with excitement. 'He sounds interesting. He might be a VIP.''I doubt it,' Emily said as she peered into the mirror to peel off her false eyelashes. 'Though when I said I wouldn't see him I thought his representative muttered something about Prince being disappointed—''Emily, you dope,' Miranda exclaimed through another bout of sneezing. 'Prince Records is the recording company my band's been hoping to sign with. And you've just turned away their scout.''Can't I get one of the boys to see him?' Emily suggested hopefully. After all, there were five male members in Miranda's band.Are you kidding?' Miranda exclaimed. 'First of all they'll be in the pub by now… and secondly, do you seriously think I'd trust them to discuss business without my being there?'Remembering the dreamy idealism of Miranda's fellow musicians, Emily could only respond in the negative. 'It might have helped if you had warned me this might happen,' she protested reasonably. 'Have to go,' she finished in a rush, wiping her hands on the towel across her lap as another flurry of raps hit the door. 'Whoever this is, he's not about to give up.'Cutting the connection, Emily grabbed a handful of tissues as she shot up from her seat in front of the brilliantly lit mirror. Then, scooting behind a conveniently placed screen, she called out, 'Come in.'This was the craziest thing she had ever done, Emily thought nervously as she swiped off the last of her make-up and stuffed the used tissues into the pocket of her robe. She tensed as the door swung open.'Hello? Miss Weston? Miss Weston, are you there?'She had heard male voices likened to anything from gravel to bitter chocolate, but this one slammed straight into her senses. Italian, she guessed, and with just the hint of a sexy mid-Atlantic drawl. She pictured him scanning the cluttered space, hunting for her hiding place, and felt her whole being responding to some imperative and extremely erotic wake-up call.'Make yourself comfortable,' she sang out, relieved she was hidden away. 'I'm getting changed.''Thank you, Miss Weston,' the voice replied evenly. 'Please don't hurry on my account.'Just the authority in the man's voice made the hairs stand on the back of her neck. And there was a stillness about it that made her think of a jungle cat, lithe, impossibly strong—and deadly.It was in her nature to confront threats, not hide from them. So why was she skulking behind a screen? Emily asked herself impatiently. Could it be that the force of this man's personality had taken possession of what, in Miranda's absence, was her territory?'Can I help you?' she said, struggling to see through a tiny crack in the woodwork.'I certainly hope so.'There was supreme confidence and not a little amusementin the response, as well as the type of worldliness that had Emily mentally rocking back on her heels. It was almost as if the man had caught her out doing somet...", "related": [], "rank": 865017, "title": "The Prince's Arranged Bride (Married by Christmas Book 1) eBook", "author": "Susan Stephens", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

British ecology professor Silvertown (Demons in Eden: The Paradox of Plant Diversity) begins with a discussion of how seeds evolved to adapt plants to a fully terrestrial life when they emerged from the sea. In the process, he covers many relevant topics, including sexual and asexual reproduction, plant genetics, plant self-defense and seed dispersal, plant poisons, and seeds as food. The author also explains the coevolution of plants and animals, as in using and perceiving color. He covers some plant products humans use, such as sunflower oil, grain for beer, and coffee. Like Michael Pollan inThe Botany of Desire, Silvertown cites historical attitudes and quotations about particular plants. But he focuses primarily on the science of plant evolution rather than human history or anecdote. Endnotes suggest further reading. Silvertown writes both elegantly and clearly, and the book is as pleasurable to read as it is informative. For academic and public library botany and natural history collections.—Marit S.

Their plan, at first, is to cast a spell on an infant, allow the human parents to raise her, then take over her witchy education when she becomes older. Humans cannot see most of their spells, or so they predict. But the witches do not foresee that Baby Daisy MacRae's sister was born under a blue moon; she can see their magic, and knows that her sister is a witch even if no one believes her. And so begins this quirky series about a family who leaves the city for the Scottish highlands where they plan to carry on quiet, normal lives. Daisy finds a ghost dog, appropriately called WayWoof (because she cannot say Werewolf) that only she and Lily can see at first, but everyone smells. Gliori imaginatively dreams up spells that a toddler witch can perform, leaving hilarious consequences for her big sister to explain or fix. In After Dark, Lily and her friend Vivaldi take Daisy out for Halloween only to divert their attention from trick-or-treating to searching for lost WayWoof. Readers will laugh at Lily's imagination and her attempts to keep people from finding out that her sister is really a spell-casting witch-in-training. Entertaining line drawings complement the texts.

She has to see strength from a different perspective. . . . God is going to use the woman who delights in her weakness but walks in the strength of the Lord and the power of his might. This book will surely be the talk of the every urban beauty shop--especially for those women who find themselves looking in the mirror and getting a revelation that 'it's not about me--but up to me.'

I wholeheartedly endorse this wonderful book that will encourage Christians to believe God more and understand that the battle is not ours but the Lord's.

Every Christian woman needs this book in her hands to read and implement these truths in her life.\" (Jeanne L.

With a family history of breast cancer, journalist Gessen (Dead Again: The Russian Intelligentsia After Communism) was not surprised to learn she had inherited a deleterious mutation in the BRCA1 gene, one of two genes known to be linked to breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 mutation was first discovered in Jewish women, a compact population with a higher-than-average breast cancer rate. Gessen describes her narrow options, with nondirective counseling steering her toward prophylactic removal of her breasts and ovaries. Then she jumps the track to talk about Dr. Henry Lynch, who, in 1966, first suggested that predisposition to cancer might be hereditary. Gessen also covers Huntington's disease, maple syrup disease among Old Order Mennonites, eugenics and how a genetic testing program is affecting marital choices for some Orthodox Jews. Gessen covers a fair amount of ground, but in a haphazard fashion. The book's strongest parts are on genetics and heredity in the Jewish community.(Apr.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lewis, who is recovering from an operation to remove a benign but puzzling tumor, a result of his participation in a Department of Defense experiment in Nevada (recounted in Dead Sand), is trying to trace the ownership of the tanker that spilled the oil. He also agrees to help a lesbian cop pal who has a new guy on the force interested in her and to advise, for a fee, his neighbor Felix, a onetime criminal who knows the whereabouts of three famous purloined paintings. Teasing us with Cole's agency history and the incident that ended his employment, DuBois spins a convoluted narrative that embraces the theft of the paintings from an art gallery, the financial woes of the gallery owner and a security guard, the amorous cop, the owner of the leaky ship and the floater. Successfully untangling this surfeit of plot lines, DuBois paints a vivid picture of Cole's life in controlled, seductive prose.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Buckley Jr. Today some of the best spokesmen for liberty continue this tradition (Walter Williams, Israel Kirzner, Thomas Szasz, Richard Ebeling, Burton Folsom, Robert Higgs, and Sheldon Richman, among others).Kindle Magazines are fully downloaded onto your Kindle so you can read them even when you're not wirelessly connected.This magazine does not necessarily reflect the full print content of the publication.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cassandra O'Rourke is a police officer of a very special kind. She is attractive to look upon, petite, yet strong willed, determined and very intelligent.In her investigation, Cassie enters a chatroom dedicated to the mysteries of Dominance and submission, since her search fore the murderer has led her to seek out and incarcerate an evil sadist. In this setting Cassandra meets Brandon Williamson, a proponent of the Dominant - submissive lifestyle. For a times she thinks she might have found her killer. In stead, Cassie finds a romantic partner who introduces her to his world, and she finds she enjoys it.I would certainly recommend reading this book as an example of excellent writing ability and a medium in which some fascinating and frequently avoided topics are bravely aired.

Other portions of this book cover topics such as mashups in library Web sites, mashups of catalog data, and mashups and media (e.g., photos). Technical details should not overwhelm non-techies. Plenty of screenshots aid in comprehension, although a few seem too small to read easily. One strength of this title is the emphasis on experiences in actual libraries, for example, mashup integration at the Manchester City (NH) Library. One weakness is that little attention is given to mashup accessibility for people with disabilities.

A series of mysterious and deadly events, including minor acts of vandalism, a dangerous wildfire, and a missing scientist, all seem to lead back to the Tamarind Tree developer, Rudolph Mueller. Never one to sit back when there's a problem to be solved, Hannah soon finds herself involved in supporting the locals in their fight to block the resort's plan.

On board the ship, Blackstone meets a young New York policeman named Alex Meade. Later Blackstone learns that this very junior policeman is assigned to investigate the murder of another cop, Inspector Patrick O’Brien. All Blackstone wants to do is leave New York as soon as possible with his prisoner, but he finds himself drawn against his will into the investigation of O’Brien’s death. No one but Meade, who idolized O’Brien, seems to care whether the murder is solved or not. That’s like waving a red flag in front of the bullish Blackstone's eyes. This engaging procedural offers an entertaining look at policing in New York at the end of the nineteenth century. --Emily Melton", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A simple stroll will showcase the city's beautiful architecture and comforting atmosphere.Portuguese food is a huge aspect of the city, with the national culture and flair reverberating throughout the flavor and texture of the food. The restaurants were all amazing. O Paparico was memorable for its traditional \"no sauce\" rule. Yuko Tavern is a great place to learn how locals drink traditional Super Bock beer and how a real Francesinha is prepared. O Pai Ramiro had the best clam pasta that was accompanied by a green wine. At Café Guayany, visitors can sample several types of Francesinha that each have their own special touch. Foz Velha features an extensive selection of Port wines.One unique feature of the city is the hills upon which it is located that help make the city a great place to explore by foot.One often overlooked but unforgettable location is the ancient wall of Porto. The surrounding cities also offer great getaways. Vila Nova de Gaia contains numerous wineries, where visitors can learn about the bottling process and sample the wine.Porto also has the most picturesque Riveria in Europe. Only two blocks away is Vinologia bar, where you can sample some smaller independent Porto wine producers. The owner of the bar is well versed in wine and can give the pallet a real lesson on Port wines.This is a city that is full of surprises and worth several visits.David Hoffmann, Davidsbeenhere.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Throughout his childhood, his family moved with his father's career, from one railroad line to another. In 1937, Japan invaded China, shattering the life of this family. His mother, with four children in tow, ran for their lives, keeping barely one step ahead of the advancing enemy forces. With WWII on the doorsteps, Chow quit high school to join the Allied Forces in Burma to fight the Japanese, which by that time had occupied most of Southeast Asia. After the war, he took up fishing. But after spending nine years at sea, fisherman’s life offered little challenge to him. In 1955, he bought a junk and sailed across the Pacific Ocean with five of his friends. At the age of 29, having been through fourteen different schools and no high school diploma to speak of, he enrolled in a junior college in San Francisco. After a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Berkeley he went on to obtain a PhD from Northwestern University. For the next 29 years he taught physics and astronomy in universities and did consulting in computer industry. Since retirement from California State University at Northridge in 1994, Chow has devoted full time to writing.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Holly Finn's journey toward hopeful parenthood is one of disappointment, loneliness, and regret. Through the long, extensive treatments that ultimately end in failure, the schedule of injections and drugs she must follow religiously, and the openness with which she explains her past and the decisions that led her to this point, the reader is given a real sense of who Holly is. She becomes more than just words on a page, but a person who has experienced heartbreak again and again, and will probably continue to do so. For women--and men--who find themselves in situations similar to Holly's,The Baby Chasemay provide a small comfort in knowing they are not alone in their grief. Parents who read her story will be more grateful for their own children. The rest of us can consider it fair warning: \"I didn't want to settle at 25. I wanted adventures. I just didn't imagine their cost, and how I would struggle to keep paying it.\" We are left to wonder if we really can have it all, and if we try, will we regret it or be among the lucky ones?

This time, she's\nusing her skills to keep the reader on their toes, while still honing\nher craft at the same time.IN THE HUNTED- Doerfler showcases her\ninnate skills at fleshing out great scenes through detailed descriptions\n and character interaction. She doesn't shy away from the gore in this\ntale, making known her love of body horror and hinting at a more extreme\n side of her writing that wasn't all too present before. This is a great\n kickoff story, and a hell of a lot of fun.IN PAPARAZZI- this story\n is fast paced, interesting, and well laid out, and the characters are\nintriguing. While not the best in the collection, it still serves as\nproof that the author is on top of her game, and capable of switching\nstyles at the drop of a hat, without losing her flow.IN THE LONGEST\nDAY OF THE YEAR- a tale that, in my opinion, is laid out beautifully,\nand sits as one of the strongest that I've read by this author. It's\nshort, quick, and feels a bit claustrophobic at times...in a good way.\nThis one reminded me of Brian Keene, Richard Laymon, and Max Brooks, in\nthat the author is able to create a space in time where nothing else\nmatters but the situation at hand. Doerfler has a great ability to\nactually take the reader out of where they are, plunk them right down in\n the middle of the story, and completely throw reality out the window.\nThe darkness she describes is palpable, the fear in the characters'\nlives is real, and the style in which she writes is incredibly\neffective.

At 18, she began a hairdressing course at a local beauty school. After completing the 2,000 hour course, she realized her true passion lay in the skin/nail industry, where she then embarked on a beauty therapy course NVQ1 for a year. In 2001, circumstances brought her and her children to California, U.S.A, where she began an aesthetics course to help her focus on how the American beauty industry differed from the U.K industry as well as to certify/license her to take on clientele. Claire's enthusiastic, bubbly and approachable personality and love of people has led her to work in a diverse range of environments-from low-end salons to chic and trendy spas to mobile spa environments and high-end resort beauty and spa experiences. Her true desire to help others succeed has enabled Claire to develop an empathic nature when training new hires. Her years of experience led her to developing and publishing this book. Her down-to-earth sassy sense of humour and her ability to make people feel comfortable made the writing of this book very fun but also challenging as her key focus was to transmit her high level of professionalism successfully to her readers. Claire is also the founder of Premier Beauty Solutions, where her mission is to help all in the beauty industry find employment, Spa Uniforms and further education classes.

It was a drastic change, not to mention a drastic pay cut! I've been writing 25+ years and have been published in a variety of media: book, newspaper, photography, and magazine. I love to write, it seems to be a passion I can't ever seem to satisfy. I've been publishing a series of books in the Dragonslayers Saga. The first book, Project: Dragonslayers is an MWSA award winning novel about an unlikely Special Forces team who are thrown headlong into the world of counterterrorism. The second book, Dragonslayers: Mind Games continues the saga where the team enters the twisted world of al-Qaeda. They must find the source of a mystery explosive, or risk losing more innocent civilians to attacks. This book was selected for the MWSA summer 2011 reading list. Due out soon is the third book in the series: Dragonslayers: Battle Rhythm. This time it's Yemen, and the team finds out they're not invincible. Also I've expanded my work in other genres. Out now is the best-selling contemporary romance, Cowboys and Olympians. You'll meet and fall in love with Leo Richards, a champion reining horse trainer as he tries to convince himself that he can love again after his wife and unborn child were killed in a fiery car crash. He falls for Katie Shulman, a rich, stubborn woman who just doesn't like cowboys. A supernatural thriller titled The Hall is complete and in editing stage. Projected release will be 2012 sometime. You'll meet Marcus Bishop, wealthy Memphis book publisher; his new and terrifically eccentric best friend, Prince Mongo; along with a ghost and demons that haunt the old castle Marcus buys. I'm also working on a sci-fi trilogy: Space Crazy introduces you to Dar Meltom, a half breed alien who's had a rough life. He longs for a life in the stars, and as difficult as it is, his mother manages to give that to him. Space Junk, the second book in the \"Dar's adventures in space\" series is also completed. The final book in the series, Space Available, is in the works.

Whilst gifted   academically and musically, she was not encouraged to  further her   talents by attending university, and instead joined the  civil service   in Scotland as an assistant press officer. In 1946, she  married   Alastair Dunnett, who was at the time the chief press officer to  the   Secretary of State for Scotland. He went on to become editor of The    Scotsman newspaper, whilst she later worked on a statistics handbook    for the Board of Trade. After a brief spell in Glasgow, the couple    settled in Edinburgh where their home became a centre for hospitality    and entertaining, mostly in support of Scottish art and culture. Dunnett    had also taken evening classes at the Edinburgh College of Art and  the   Glasgow School of Art, and from 1950 onwards she established a   prominent  career as a portrait painter, being exhibited at both the   Royal  Scottish Academy and the Royal Academy. She was also an   accomplished  sculptress. Her interest in writing developed during the   1950's. Her own  tastes took her to historical novels and it was her   husband who  eventually suggested she write one of her own, after she   had complained  of running out of reading material. The result was The   Game of Kings, an  account of political and military turmoil in   sixteenth-century  Scotland. Whilst turned down for publication in the   UK, it was  eventually published in the USA where it became an instant   best seller.  Other titles, such as the Lymond Chronicles and House of   Niccolo series  followed and which established her international   reputation. She also  successfully turned her hand to crime, with the   Johnson Johnson series.  He is an eccentric artist, famous for bifocals,   and of course amateur  detective. All of the titles in the series   somehow also feature the  yacht 'Dolly', despite ranging widely in   location from Scotland, to  Ibiza, Rome, Marrakesh, Canada, Yugoslavia,   Madeira and The Bahamas.  There is plenty of sailing lore for the   enthusiast, but not so much it  detracts from the stories genre; crime.   Each of them is told by a woman  whose profession explains her role in   the mystery and we learn very  little about Johnson himself, save for   the fact he is somewhat  dishevelled in appearance.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Leaving the cozy room behind, she steps through the looking glass and into a world depicted in warm watercolors, sepia-toned illustrations, and line drawings. Not a word of the original tale has been altered. The artwork echoes the whimsy of the language, clearly showing Alice's amusement at the antics of Tweedledum and Tweedledee, her frustration at the impossibility of slicing a Looking-glass cake, her affection for the gentle White Knight, and her exasperation when both the White and the Red Queen fall asleep snuggled against her. The large font and numerous illustrations, including many single- and double-page paintings, make this edition inviting for reading aloud or alone. The artwork has an engaging openness to it, and Alice comes across as a real child, making it easy for readers to imagine themselves exploring the wonders of this make-believe realm.–Joy Fleishhacker,School Library JournalCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He was tall and handsome, quite distinguished-looking with threads of silver running through his neatly trimmed black hair and eyebrows, silver sideburns, and patches of silver at his temples. He wore black leather wingtips, a tailored dark pinstripe suit with vest, dark gray shirt, and black silk tie. Plain silver cufflinks and tie clip were his only jewelry. His attire looked to be of good quality, none of it flashy or in-your-face expensive.\"Miserable weather,\" he commented, his voice resonating with a deep, sensual timbre.She nodded. \"One of the few days I come into the city and it has to be storming.\"\"I know what you mean.\"\"You don't work here, then?\" She usually wasn't one to chat up strangers, but she liked the sound of his voice.He shrugged. \"I...freelance. I come into the city more often than I care to.\"The elevator stopped at the sixth floor, several people coming aboard. Donna and the man moved to the back of the car. It stopped at the seventh floor, and more people squeezed in. She inched farther toward the corner and then was pushed into the man. He caught her, holding her steady.\"Oh, I'm sorry. Lost my balance.\"His arm eased around her back, giving them both a little more room. \"No problem.\"She caught a whiff of his cologne. She had spritzed her pulse points with gardenia perfume, but having become accustomed to it all morning, she could no longer smell it. The fresh scent of his, something lemony and spicy and completely masculine, made her feel things she hadn't experienced in a long time.\"Donna Blakely.\" She spoke quietly so only he could hear and looked down at her hands, at the gold band still on the ring finger of her left hand. She looked back up into his dark eyes. \"Widow.\"He nodded. \"I'm sorry.\"\"Thank you. It's been five years, so I'm finally getting used to it.\"\"I understand.\"And looking into his eyes, she could tell he truly empathized with her pain and knew all too well how it felt to lose a loved one. Although he didn't open up with any experiences, she sensed he had his own sad story of loss. Of course, anyone would have gone through losing loved ones at their age, but the solemn expression in his eyes suggested he knew it more intimately than most.\"I'm Michael Chance,\" he said.EXCERPT from \"Subscribe Now and Save\":I greeted my friend as he joined me at the bar.\"Whiskey sour.\"I ordered another vodka martini.\"Glad you could meet me. I'm going out of my mind. I can't sleep and I can't eat. I can't work and I can't make love to my wife. I can't get rid of the stupid thing. It's haunting me.\"I told him to try to relax, to take a deep breath and let it out slowly.\"Look at me. I'm shaking so bad I spilled my drink. No matter where I put it, it's always in my pocket the next morning.\"I asked him exactly what wasit.\"Itis this. I picked up a copy ofMidnight Talesabout a month ago. Y'know, it's a magazine of horror stories, the kind with twist endings that leave you wondering. I used to read it when I was in high school. Thought I'd see what they're writing these days. Well, you know those annoying little subscription cards they always stick in the middle? They fall out while you're trying to read and get in the way when you turn the pages.\"I said I knew all too well.\"This,itfell out into my lap that evening. I thought I'd get a couple of stories read before dinner. I settled down in my favorite chair and started one story.Itfell out--no, it floated down and landed gently in my lap. I laid it on the table by the chair and thought, 'Ha-ha, gotcha!' When I was halfway through the next story, my wife called me to dinner. I put the magazine in the chair. When I came back later to finish the story,itfloated out of the magazine and into my lap again.\"", "related": ["B00JMUQJ5O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Progress on The Project, however, is more difficult to measure, in spite of the several men in Willy?s new life. It is only after a romantic trip for two that Willy makes real progress on The Project ? and comes to know true loneliness.Told with a wry, self-deprecatory humour that can describe sexual disasters with elegance and affection, this book is part comedy and part tragedy.

From New Orleans, Louisiana, Jesse is anointed by God with a unique preaching ministry that melts even the hardest heart with hilarious illustrations and strong biblical preaching. Having been in full-time evangelistic ministry since 1978, Jesse's primary goal is to spread the Gospel. He has become a popular guest speaker at church meetings, conventions, seminars, Bible colleges and Christian television programs across America. His anointed sermons point sinners to Calvary and motivate Christians to exercise their authority over the devil by realizing their position in Christ. Jesse believes that Christianity is not just something you talk about on Sunday; it is a day-to-day fellowship with the Lord Jesus. It is this close fellowship with Jesus that makes the impossible suddenly possible. Today, Jesse's entire life is devoted to reaching the lost as well as strengthening the Christian in their daily walk with Christ. Jesse's weekly thirty-minute television program has touched millions of lives through secular and Christian television with the Gospel of Jesus. His program can be seen weekly on Trinity Broadcasting Network and other stations worldwide. Through anointed biblical preaching, Jesse is bringing God's message of hope to our generation. A message that cuts through all denominational barriers, transcends human hypocrisy and frailty, and reaches the heart of mankind.", "related": ["B00EUQTTLG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's 1916, and retired bank robber Wilson Young, 58, gets it in his head to rob $4,250,000 in gold bullion to make a political point about the way the country is going, in his eyes, straight to hell. While people are being suckered into buying cars and using electricity and telephones, the army is gearing up for WWI, which will send America's economy skyrocketing and temporarily prevent the coming Depression. To Young, the traveling roadshow of gold bullion is designed to legitimize paper currency and turn Americans into a nation of gullible consumers. He decides to express his protest through bankrobbing, which leads everybody from his wife, Lauren, to his old associates to assume that he is itching for that hoariest of Western cliches, the old outlaw's one last fling. True to the book's talky style, Young enlists the aid of a blarney-spouting top sergeant from a nearby military base to help him hijack that gold in a public square in San Antonio without firing a shot. Any potential suspense about the result quickly dissolves in a lot of engaging gab about the way the Army works, the state of the country and Young himself-his marriage, his relationship to his son, Willis (flying with the French), and his haunted memories of long-dead pal Les Richter. This is a tale as comforting as an old jacket, told in a wry, first-person voice, with a modern political point to make about this country's history. Tippette pulls it off beautifully.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

During all those years Diane wrote stories as a cure for insomnia.  She wrote short stories about dogs for a local German Shepherd Dog Club newsletter, and then expanded to full length novels.  After Diane and her daughter Laura co-authored a travel guidebook entitled Cruising the Eastern Caribbean (four editions were published by Hunter Publishing) Laura gave Diane the idea of writing a mystery set on cruise ships in the Caribbean.  Murder Caribbean-Style and Murder on a Ghost Ship are the first two novels of a High Seas Mystery series.  The third novel Murder for Glacier Blue features a wedding cruise to Alaska.  It’s scheduled for release in 2013. Howl of the Wolf was the first book in Diane’s Heirs to the Throne science fiction series.  It introduced the planet Drako, telepathic wolves, and the crew of the space ship that took sanctuary on a planet that banned technology.  In the second book, The Havenshire Resistance, Krystal’s teenage daughters must learn to use inherited powers and join an army of samurai women, telepathic wolves, and commoners to save the kingdom from the evil plans of Jarrack.  Dragon Defense is the third novel in the series.  Donovan’s group must train teenagers and encourage wild dragons to defend Drako from destruction by the Institute.

I have already shared some of what I read with colleagues.

The book makes a lot of sense!\" \"Many spelling assessments concentrate on giving a list of words. In my classroom, I have given the “list” assessments, only to see students not writing words correctly in their daily writing. It is a wonderful idea to break these words down into 4 groups of 25. It’s great that [Pat] included the paragraph assessment with bolded/italicized words and the key to what these words mean.\" \"I liked the point on page 62 about if your student can spell the first 100 words, they should really be able to spell over 600 based on those patterns. This is very interesting and useable information for a classroom teacher and would be great information to share with students learning to spell.\"-Mary Schroepfer, McKinley Elementary, Owatonna, MN   \"As a classroom teacher I know first hand how students’ spelling in written work seems to becoming increasingly problematic.  Students often spell words phonetically which are not always spelled correctly.  It seems as if students who continue to misspell these words in their writing do not move forward, as a matter of fact very little progress is made.   I think with [Pat's] approach students will have a better grasp on the tricky word patterns and help them to make a connection to other word patterns rather than just spelling one word and then moving on to the next.\" \"Yes, I would recommend this book for professional development as well because in speaking with many of the teachers it seems that students’ writing has become a sore spot in the classroom.  It seems that no matter how much writing you incorporate in your classroom, students are still misspelling common words that make their writing difficult to read.   There is definite need for this program and if it proves to be successful I am sure the books will fly off the shelf.\"-  Karen Berecsky, Second Grade Teacher, Mill Lake, Monroe, NJ", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But, for those who are in love with their Heavenly Bridegroom, and desire a deeper walk with God, I can highly recommend it. Every page will make you stop and think.Judith is a quiet, unassuming person, whom I have known for many years. She is always ready to come down to Engeltal (the headquarters of the End-Time Handmaidens and Servants) and lend a helping hand; and when she told me she had written a book, I certainly didn t expect the manuscript that she gave me to read. This is her first book, but I truly believe that if she wrote fifty more books she couldn t go deeper, nor rise higher in the revelation of how the Bride of Christ must make herself ready for her Wedding Day.There will be many souls at the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, but only those who have made themselves ready will be His Bride. If you desire to be more than a guest I recommend that you read and study this book that was not really written by Judith, but by THE TEACHER, THE HOLY SPIRIT.Gwen R.

Known for unveiling unseen worlds, scientific breakthroughs, and historical secrets, Rollins' knack for breakneck pacing and stunning originality has been hailed by critics and embraced by scores of millions of readers around the world.The Critics RaveThe New York Times says that his \"roguish charm comes from his efforts to persuade readers the story is credible [through] real-life sources for his novel's science, history and geography.\" Rollins' rare blend of action, suspense, and knowledge was also mentioned by the Huffington Post, which stated that \"After Crichton passed away in 2008 he clearly passed the baton to James Rollins, who like Crichton, is a renaissance man.\"NPR calls his work \"adventurous and enormously engrossing...\" and the New York Journal of Books had this to say: \"If you're a fan of smart, entertaining adventure fiction, this is your summer beach read writ large....All the science, all the history, and all the locations are masterfully intertwined. The characters are multi-dimensional. And the story is, well, a corker.\"The Story Teller's StoryAs a boy immersed in the scientific adventures of Doc Savage, the wonders of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and pulps such as The Shadow, The Spider, and The Avenger, James Rollins decided he wanted to be a writer. He honed his storytelling skills early, spinning elaborate tales that were often at the heart of pranks played on his brothers and sisters.Before he would set heroes and villains on harrowing adventures, Rollins embarked on a career in veterinary medicine, graduating from the University of Missouri and establishing a successful veterinary practice. This hands-on knowledge of medicine and science helps shape the research and scientific speculation that set James Rollins books apart.Explosive Page-Turning AdventuresThe exotic locales of James Rollins novels have emerged as a hybrid between imagination, research, and his extensive travels throughout the United States and Europe, as well as New Zealand, the South Pacific, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. Recent jaunts include book tours and stops across the country and several European nations to give talks, seminars, and media interviews.\nIn recent years, much of James' travel has involved meeting readers in small and large groups, at writing and fan conferences, and even aboard seagoing \"seminars.\" James' mentoring and coaching skills have made him a sought after writing instructor and guest speaker for workshops, symposia, conventions, and other forums throughout the country.James Rollins is the author of nine thrillers in the bestselling Sigma Force series (Sandstorm, Map of Bones, Black Order, The Judas Strain, The Last Oracle, The Doomsday Key, The Devil Colony, Bloodline, and The Eye of God); six individual adventure thrillers; and the Jake Ransom middle grade series (Jake Ransom and the Skull King's Shadow, Jake Ransom and the Howling Sphinx.)", "related": [], "rank": 185370, "title": "City of Screams: A Short Story Exclusive (Order of the Sanguines Series)", "author": "James Rollins", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 59, "rating_average": 4.3898, "rating_total": 259.0}

Shan has always had a seemingly endless source of terrific recipes. So I am not surprised that she's decided finally to put them down in a book - let alone three books! I suspect her divine culinary skills will have the same effect on others who discover the Mediterranean, Pacific Rim and Diet editions of her Fast and Fabulous Gourmet Cookbook series.

Très jeune, elle voue une véritable passion à l'égyptologie et à l'écriture. Elle suit par la suite des études d'archéologie et de philosophie. Ses écrits évoquent sa devise : liberté, diversité, spontanéité. Avec \"L'amour en fleur\", Eva prend plaisir à donner au quotidien une touche de fantastique à travers une histoire d'amour et d'aventure sensible et originale servie par une intrigue florissante, un humour malicieux et une tendresse poétique.  Son dernier roman \"La lyre de la grande souveraine\" est un véritable hymne à la liberté et à l'art. Il fascine par son style élégant, son écriture acérée et son intonation à la fois philosophique et sensible qui parle autant au cœur qu'à l'intellect pour traiter de sujets aussi fondamentaux que les relations humaines, l'amitié, l'amour, la souffrance, le bonheur, la mort et la vie.   —   Plus d'information : http://auto-edition.vv.si/les-auteurs-du-sites/eva-liebermann   —   Pour échanger avec Eva : http://auto-edition.vv.si/forum/viewtopic.php?f=27&t;=17", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

No one likes to shoot a deer and have it run off.\nNo one likes to take a marginal shot. When someone squeezes the trigger on a\ngun or a mechanical release on a bow, he or she wants to be confident of a quick, ethical kill. The best way to ensure that the deer goes\ndown quickly is to be close enough to identify where the vital organs are in\nthe deer and then deliver the shot to that spot. With any weapon, there's\nfar-more margin for error the further you get from the animal. Therefore, I've\nlearned that my chances for success are best when I get as close as possible to\nthe deer I want to take. Question:\nDid you have any-other motivating factors for writing this book?Phillips:\nWell, when I bought my first deer-hunting rifle with what was known as one of those \"newfangled\ntelescopic sights,\" at that time, I told my friends, \"If I see a deer, I can\ntake him, regardless of the range.\" I think that's what many hunters think if\nthey use bigger-caliber rifles. But there are two problems with this\nphilosophy. In many areas where I hunt deer, they've learned that if they move\nin open woods, they'll die. The smarter bucks have learned that the more\ndaylight hours they spend in thick cover, the longer they survive. Therefore,\neven if I can make a 1,000-yard shot with my rifle, if a buck's not going to\nmove into an open spot 1,000-yards away, I've wasted all my time at the range.\nThe second reason I returned to hunting in close places was that once I got my\nnew high-powered rifle, I missed the next six bucks I tried to shoot. To solve\nthis problem, I decided to mentally tell myself that my .30-06 was really my\n12-gauge shotgun. I started hunting close and learning more about the terrain\nand the deer, and my ratio of shots fired to deer taken went up dramatically.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

During this first year of school, I developed a stuttering problem that I still live with today. I dreaded any kind of class reading situation. I was frustrated many times during my school days when the teacher asked a question in class. I was a good student but never dared to raise my hand. Even worse were times when I was singled out and would play dumb, even though I knew the answer. I got to a place where I resigned myself to a life of silence rather than continually face the embarrassment of stumbling over the words I spoke.  I will never forget the day when my grade eleven teacher announced his next English assignment. Everyone in the class was required to do an oral report. As my stomach knotted up over the news, my inside displeasure, I am sure, became evident by the absolute look of dread on my face. The teacher was not even aware of my speech impediment, until I started into one of the most agonizing few minutes of my life. I had a three-minute talk that took me ten minutes and felt like an hour. I felt humiliated and dumb.  I find it fascinating that I now stand before a class (a church congregation) every Sunday morning to give a speech. Even more incredible is the fact that I am writing a book. Stunted in my communication skills, I disliked English and was not into writing at all in school. I remember laboring, for what seemed like hours, to compose a simple one-paragraph school assignment.

A glance at the contents gives you the general idea, boasting seventeen chapters, beginning with \"War Elephants and How to Beat Them\" followed by \"Ignominious Deaths,\" through \"An Army Marches on its Stomach (and Liver)\" before \"Unlikely Survivors\", and culminating with \"Weird and Wonderful Weapons\" and \"Towards the Future  -  Robot Wars\".  The author writes in an engaging, amusing, even 'matey' style, which suits the content, as if it were stories being exchanged in your local pub or down the wargames club. The chapters are divided into brief anecdotes, some barely more than a paragraph, a few page or two long. Sidnell's expertise in the ancient era is clear and where he seems most comfortable, but he has managed to unearth plenty of unusual and extraordinary facts from the full breadth of military history, whether it be idiots who met uncomfortable ends, bonkers inventions, breathtaking incompetence or simply exploits that just leave you wondering what the participants must have been thinking.  The book has no illustrations, which is a shame, as even a few black and white images would have added to our enjoyment and understanding of some of the more obscure items, but Sidnell has crammed a lot into some 170 tightly  -  typeset pages (warning: the text is rather small). Curiously, the book ends with a further dozen pages or so of ads by other Pen and Sword books, including an excerpt from another book by someone else, which we could have done without, quite honestly. (Or which would have been better used to provide those illustrations - ) But at GBP8.99, this is a witty birthday present for a chum that I would heartily recommend. Armed with its contents, you will be celebrated as either the most entertaining raconteur of unusual military lore  -  or the geekiest grognard at the club! I was going to say that it would make the perfect book to keep in the smallest room in the house, but the midget ninja of the title gained his fame for attacking a samurai lord from, shall we say, an unexpected direction that will have you checking your U-bend regularly! - Miniature Wargames  The tone is about right, with the right mix of amused surprise and clear explanation. There are also a set of useful footnotes that provide the original sources for most of the stories. I must admit some of the incidents described were quite familiar to me (the many wounds of Alexander the Great or some of the more unusual ways in which warships sank themselves), but given that I spent most of my time reading a wide range of works on military history I was surprised just how many of the topics were entirely new to me. There are plenty of interesting snippets in here, with enough variety to ensure that any familiar story is followed by something new and unfamiliar.- History of War", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I have been writing since I can remember. I always enjoyed telling stories and have been doing so since first grade when I wrote my very first one.  Various topics interest me, but I love action/suspense/drama and romance as Ian Fleming is one of my favorite authors. I feel that people love to get away from their everyday lives and go to a place that is rarely, seldom shared called the imagination.  When the Eagle Flies with the Dove is my very first novel, which I wrote in 1985 and copyrighted in 1990 I am hoping is one of those stories that will take your mind away from the day to day where you find it difficult to put the book down. And once it’s over I’m hoping that you wish that it didn’t end.  The Cunning Linquist is my first adult Men's Guide. Inspired by my girlfriend who told me that many of her female friends are having difficulty in the bedroom with their mates. It's funny how we believe that everyone's sex life is like our own not realizing how untrue that is. I hope that the people or couples who purchase my book discover ways to improve their love life.  Please keep an eye out for more of my books as I am currently revising others that I have written or currently writing. You can check for updates on my work at www.lankymania.com.

I travelled to London and found myself destitute, so I slept in the subways in the middle of winter. Eventually, I returned to South Africa, where I worked as a game ranger in one of the country’s premier game lodges. One night, a lion came into my bedroom while I was sleeping. Judging from his muddy paw prints on the polished slate floor - his head would have been right above mine! The following morning, we tracked the lion and after finding him in a riverbed, the chief tracker turned to me and said: “Mike, you are so lucky, I’m going to call you Lucky Mike.” So I officially changed my name to Lucky Mike!  I then completed two-year stint in the South African Navy as a diver, during which time I was attacked by a Great White shark and crushed beneath a super tanker. When I was discharged, I was penniless; so found work selling specialized fridges and freezers to the farmers around the country. Two years later, I had made enough money and built the yacht of my dreams; I was twenty-two years old and set off to sail around the world.  Six years later, I bought a bar and restaurant, situated above calm waters in a sheltered bay on a beautiful Caribbean island. I thought my life quite settled at last – but along came a hurricane and blew it all away! Around this time, I decided to face my fear of heights, so I took up skydiving.  Two thousand jumps later, there is no fear – only the pursuit of human flight. Taking the adventure a step further, I started Base-jumping, perhaps the most dangerous and thrilling of all sports. My most recent adventure has been a yearlong solo journey into the desolate regions of South and East Africa. I travelled alone in a twelve-year-old vehicle, in which I slept and lived. It was a time of lions, elephants and life in the bush with extraordinary adventures, but also solitude and thought; a journey to an emerald lake, infested with crocodiles, on the edge of a vast, bandit-ridden desert.   ‘The Adventures of Lucky Mike’ - Into Africa - Book One, is an account of many of my African tales. The Danger Zone - Book Two, covers my early years, becoming a Navy Diver and then moves on to my adventures in Skydiving and Base-jumping. All at Sea - Book Three, is an account of my experiences on the ocean.", "related": [], "rank": 3587252, "title": "The Adventures of Lucky Mike - The Danger Zone (Book Two) eBook", "author": "Lucky Mike", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She begins with a brisk history of sex in the Arab world that will likely be eye-opening for Western readers. By showing the roots of sensuous and sexual literature that date back to the tenth century, and noting scholarly opinions that a rebuke to colonialism provoked a shift toward conservatism, she prompts readers to question the sexually conservative roots of their own governments and politics, regardless of geography. From women meeting behind closed doors to discuss spousal disappointment and abuse to doctors all too familiar with surprising sexual practices, El Feki peels back every layer. Her research is wide-ranging and relentless. She did not accept official statistics on such topics as prostitution, STDs, or abortion, instead seeking out the opinions and experiences of countless individuals in clinics, suburban neighborhoods, beauty parlors, and the media in multiple countries and socio-economic levels to get a truth that is complicated but undeniable. Mandatory reading for anyone seeking to truly know the Middle East, Sex and the Citadel should knock the doors off assumptions held dear by so many Westerners. --Colleen Mondor", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has a lot to say, as the header explains at LEEZARD ON LIFE: \"LeeZard observes life and writes commentary, opinion and humor about politics, people, news events - heck, anything that strikes his fancy.\" Mr. Somerstein began his professional writing career as a broadcast journalist, network correspondent and editor. Over the course of his 20 years as a broadcaster, he won numerous local and national awards. As a freelance writer based in Seattle, Mr. Somerstein has published in New York Newsday, The Seattle Times, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer and The Seattle Weekly, to name a few. The truth is, Lee Somerstein really began writing when he was 10-years old. It was Grandpa Joe's fault; when the young LeeZard was in the fourth grade, Grandpa started challenging him to write stories. But, why does Lee Somerstein write? His answer: \"It certainly isn't for the money (although that would be nice). Every writer, once they find their 'voice,' seeks out his audience. But, you need more than a voice for that audience to find you, stay with you and pass you around like a cheap date; you have to have things to say. I have things to say and I tell a damned good story. For one thing, I've led a more interesting life than most: good, bad, awful, exciting, scary, sometimes inspired (maybe even inspiring) and sometimes downright stupid. That's not bragging or arrogance, it's just a fact. If I make someone laugh, cry, angry or think, I'll consider myself a successful writer. Most importantly, however, I've overcome tremendous obstacles to not only write but to stay alive. If the lessons I've learned in life and my will to survive inspire one person; If someone is at their absolute bottom and says, 'If that guy can make it so can I,\" I will consider myself a very successful writer.\"", "related": ["B00B56PP26"], "rank": 4654764, "title": "The Write Stuff", "author": "Lee Somerstein", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She believes that there's beauty at the core of most everything, but that truly unredeemable characters create the best stories. Eli is the author of \"Dead Trees,\" \"Mastic,\" \"DRAG.N\" and is a contributor to the charity anthology \"Let's Scare Cancer to Death,\" benefitting the V Foundation.  *** Eli lives in Virginia with her husband and two daughters. She is surrounded by battlefield country, farmland and lakes. Currently, she spends her days being a devoted mother and, of course, writing. Eli feels fortunate that her marriage is one of real love and she thinks her children are the coolest people in the world. She also feels so lucky to have an extended family that is ever present with encouragement and kind words. Eli completed coursework at USC-L, Columbia College, TAMU-CC, and George Mason University. She enjoyed a varied course load, but finally settled on Biology and focused on a career in lab research. She spent time in Texas volunteering at Flour Bluff Shrimp Mariculture Lab [and being paid in Pink Hawaiian Shrimp- which was, in a word, delicious.] and also spent time at NIH participating in an Animal Research Program in the Infectious Disease Dept. It took two years working in Histology/Pathology in Sterling, VA for Eli to realize she wanted to be a writer. She is still very interested in the sciences and hopes to use her background knowledge effectively within her writing. When it comes to her writing, Eli has one ultimate goal: to become better with each word written. She is obsessed with the nature of humanity- the innocent, the corrupted and the confused. She's always been a great lover of Science Fiction, but has also grown to truly appreciate other genres, especially Horror and Fantasy.  Her other interests include art with a focus on charcoal medium, walking her American Foxhound Dottie, eating egg-drop, wonton soup from the local delivery place and watching low-budget Sci-Fi movies with her awesome family. *****        DRAG.N is a brief novelette birthed during a whirlwind writing competition hosted by the Kernel Magazine of London.  Many doubted that anything of substance could be spawned within such time constraints, but in thirty hours, over a hundred writers completed full novelettes or novellas – quite an accomplishment within itself, regardless of literary merit.", "related": [], "rank": 2445612, "title": "DRAG.N: An Orwellian Dystopia", "author": "Eli Constant", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 25.0}

Sarah was\na character that I dreamt about one night, and in the morning I read an article\nabout writing in first person to help authors understand their character's\nemotions. I've been writing in first person ever since because it's so easy for\nme to be empathetic with people. It wasn't until halfway through the first\nchapter I realized I was writing about the woman from my dream. I can say that Sarah\nis based off of some very important women in my life, but none of them have\nquite gone through what I described.Liam is a strong male lead because I based him off some of\nthe most important men in my life. He doesn't know how to express emotion as\nwell as some can, but he cares deeply for the people he loves. While he may be\nquick to judge, he's also quick to reprimand himself for those judgments.Because this was my first serious novel that I really poured\nmy heart and soul in to, I pulled from the shallower ends of my knowledge and\nexperiences that were right at my fingertips. I admit, while I wrote this I\ncried, I smiled, I raged, and I felt like a piece of me had been torn out and\nreshaped by the end. I hope my readers feel a little bit different after they\nread about Sarah's tragic story of pain, and her uplifting story of triumph.", "related": ["B00C2DKWBU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 63.0}

And she happened to be none-too-shabby at it. Her earliest work debuted in third grade with a poem about a brown cat. From there she never really stopped. By high school, her creative writing teacher offered to be her literary agent both times she took the class. Still, feeling like a little bitty fish in a very big pond, she kept her writing mostly to herself and got lost in everyday life. She met people, now and then, that would fan the spark of writing into flame once again. She would share her work with them. She would be inspired to write and write and write some more. But always, after a while, she would let it die back again to embers and return to the day to day grind. Until finally, one day, she realized half her life was gone and she still wasn't what she was meant to be. But now, she is determined enough to finish what she had started and get her work out there. She has published three books featuring her poetry and photography: Where Moonflowers Bloom, The Tincture of a Radiant Madness and In Just a Few Small Words. Her newest poetry book, From A Season Of Sleep, became a bestseller. She has several more poetry books, another flash fiction collections and a short story collection in the works. She also has several novels in progress as well and is currently focusing on a science fiction novel entitled Gleamers Madness.", "related": ["B00E91DERW"], "rank": 4015286, "title": "The Napkin Novels", "author": "Sreya Bremtin", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has lived in many places, including: Massachusetts, Illinois, Minnesota, Brazil, Tennessee, New Mexico, Virginia, the Netherlands, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire. Married to her Carleton classmate, David, she has three grown children and six grandsons.Dorothea is the author ofThe Riddle of Penncroft Farm, an award-winning novel about the American Revolution for young readers. Named a Teachers Choice Selection by the International Reading Association soon after publication, it is read in classrooms throughout the U.S.Dorothea hugely enjoys writing and reading aloud stories in verse. She tells her grandsons (who \"star\" in some of the stories) that she has eight elves in her head telling her what to write down. This is not far from the truth. Three of the stories dictated by the elves have been finished; five more are in the works, for the rest of the Izzy Elves: Quizzy, Frizzy, Fizzy, Bizzy, and Whizzy.Dorothea is also working on another historical novel for young readers. It is set in 1825 in the small town in New Hampshire where she has lived since 1991.In addition to writing, Dorothea is an experienced actress and singer. She performed with the Ex Machina Baroque Opera Company in Minneapolis, and also played most of the Gilbert and Sullivan battle-ax contralto and ingenue mezzo roles with companies in Philadelphia and Minneapolis. The last time she played a ditzy G & S teenager was when she was 44, which required a wig, contact lenses, false eyelashes, and plenty of make up!She narrated her first three Izzy Elves stories for audiobooks, also available on Amazon.com.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

One day, she receives an invitation from her uncle,  businessman Castle Thornlocke, to attend a charity fundraiser at the  palatial Thornlocke estate in Libertyville, N.H. Tsara’s brother Court  has also been invited. Their relationship with their uncle has always  been tense and adversarial, but it seems that Uncle Cass’ new wife,  Alicia, has mellowed him somewhat, and Tsara believes his invitation  might be an attempt to mend fences. She makes the trip to the New  Hampshire mountains, and at first, all seems well—but her first night  under her uncle’s roof, she’s kidnapped by two men and brought to a  remote cabin in the woods. They explain that her uncle is holding one of  the kidnappers’ children hostage (along with half a dozen others’) in  his estate’s wine cellar in order to coerce them into paying outstanding  debts. Her uncle, it seems, is a ruthless power broker, with the  corrupt local police entirely at his disposal, and Tsara’s desperate  kidnappers see no alternative but to threaten him using similar methods.  Jacobs presents the ensuing tense moral and tactical standoff with  smooth skill and intense readability. Her sense of the New Hampshire  landscape is vividly atmospheric (“The sky was azure, wisped with  occasional brushes of clouds, and the trees were rocket bursts of fall  color”), and her characters are refreshingly three-dimensional; by the  end, Jacobs even makes a monstrous villain such as Thornlocke  understandable, if not sympathetic. The novel is fast-paced right from  the end of the first chapter, and the dialogue is crisply believable  throughout. Fans of mystery writers such as Lisa Scottoline and William  Kent Krueger will find much to entertain them here.An intelligent, thought-provoking adventure story and a fine debut.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 21.0}

It will talk you through step by step all the powerful strategies you need to put in place to outrank your competition.

She entered the US Army in 1984 where she met and married her husband of 27-year  Minister Kim Harris. They have two children Dominique and Stephanie. She exited the military in 1991 just shortly after delivering their daughter Stephanie. Her husband retired from the military in 2001, and they now reside in Waynesville, Missouri. She spent years writing and directing Christmas and Easter plays for her local church before becoming the playwright for her long-time friend Evangelist Susan Marshal of \"Still Useable Ministries\". Most of her inspirations came from a single song titled \"Reasons\" by Lynetta \"Cocoa\" Powell. She currently attends MOEC (Metamorphosis Outreach Empowerment Church) located in St. Robert, MO. Cynthia is the god mother of eight children: LaToshia Franklin-Webb (Whom she had the privilege of officiating her marriage to Derrick Webb), Kushaiah, Sharon  and Daniel Seymour, Geneva Alexander-Dawson, Samuel Horton, and Malcolm and Miesha Hall. She is known to many others as Momma Harris. You can view photos of her children/god-children and family and friends on the photo's page. She is a cosmetologists and currently owns and operates, Heavenly Creations Hair and Nail Studio located in St. Robert just outside Fort Leonard Wood, MO.    Many of the instances in her works are inspired by challenges, situations and tragedies that have occurred in her own life of how God brought her through when the pieces of her life began to unravel and fall apart. She is passionate about writing and understands that her mandate from God is to reach many with her gift of imagination and knowledge of the Word of God to minister to the hurt, confused and lost through romance and sound & drama.  All of her works are intertwined with each other and have one thing in common...the great state of Georgia.  Georgia is a base location for almost every book and the characters or either from there or the story is taking place there. Each book exposes the nature and title of the next one. Cynthia understands  that her responsibility to God is to spread his word by any means necessary. It is her determination to do just that...through the power of fiction romance and sound & drama. She was born to write for such a time as this!", "related": [], "rank": 1396275, "title": "Legitimate Issues (The Other Side of Through Book 4)", "author": "Cynthia Middlebrooks Harris", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He studied Engineering, and while studying itself, he had written several short stories without actually publishing them. The idea for The Silent Sound came upon him when he read about some cold cases involving death of the girls who had rejected the guys who approached them. Sriteja followed extensively the topics on forensic sciences, behavioural analysis and criminal profiling. While he studied his Masters in Belgium, he had finished his first novel. He then took nearly four months to make sure that everything, scientific and otherwise, was perfect in the novel. With the help of his two friends Julie De Mees and Andreas Mayer, who offered objective proofreading services, he had finished the novel in December 2013, in time to launch it for Christmas and New Year vacations. Currently he is working on a novella 'Finding Nour' where Kia Hills, the protagonist of The Silent Sound goes in search of a missing immigrant girl in a city full of human trafficking and sex slavery. What dark secrets reveal and whom she faces is a wait-and-see suspense. The plot development for the next novel in the series of The Silent Sound is also being carried out. This second novel in which Kia Hills, with a new partner Jessica Morgan, solves the mysterious murders and mutilations of fathers of little children is titled 'The Raining Fire'. This title is chosen keeping the tradition of the series in mind. This second novel will explore the darkest corners of human mind, love and romance, and fantasies. In this novel, Kia also solves the mystery behind her mother's death. What will Kia and Jessica face is again a wait-and-see suspense.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Speaker and success strategist Tam Veilleux is passionate about transforming  audiences to help them reach their full potentional.  NLP Certified, Tam teaches the mind/body connection in relation to results. Raw and authentic, she leads audiences in creating personal and professional change through memorable language and easy to use techniques. Her high-energy personality and passion for personal freedom along with an off-beat sense of humor makes Tam an enthusiastic coach, trainer and leader. Using familiar language she leads audiences into the not-so-perfect world of personal development in way that is less stale. She openly shares her rich history of growing up “very vanilla” as the middle child plumber’s daughter and shares her exploration of religion versus spirituality, dealing with divorce, being thrust into holistic energy healing, jumping on the law of attraction bandwagon (and then leading the parade) as well as multiple attempts at entrepreneurship before finding her passion in leading people to their personal success.     “I remember as a young girl thinking to myself  ‘big things don’t happen to little people like me’ and I couldn’t have been more right. Big things don’t happen to people who think small. Thank GOD I chose to create change in my life and became a person who dreams big and takes big action.” The ABC’s of Life and her creative use of colorful language teaches audiences about the importance of belief systems, the magic of attention, and the choice to stay stagnant or create change.   Leave no child behind! Her children’s book “Molly Kite’s Big Dream” encourages the dream, do have of life or people of all ages. Tam is a proud member of the Inspirational Women’s Leadership Association and contributor of the monthly  “Pay It Forward x 1 Million Magazine”.

I found that there were numerous answers to questions in my life, my career, and my family answered with simple everyday symbols in my dreams.After much prayer, I knew that I wanted to share the information I have researched over the past 17 years with everyone who may be interested in what their dreams mean. And I am sure they will be as thrilled as I am that the Lord would take the time to show us things we need to know in our dreams. In my case it may be the only way.. (laughter) because I am so busy with my hectic everyday life that I just don't always hear that small still voice speaking to me.I believe that the Lord will be sure to get the information we need to us somehow.. either through dreams and visions, or from friends, and those we trust in the Lord. Most of all with the Holy Spirit's guidance we can discover things that can really help us in our walk here on earth. God is Good!I hope these Bless whoever reads them.

Some of them were in relationships, and others were\nsingle, but they all wanted advice. Their questions mainly centred on choosing\na clinic, the investigations that were involved, and how to understand what\ntreatment plan was right for them. Many of them had done extensive research already,\nbut found the volume of information available on the subject overwhelming. What\nthey were really seeking was guidance from someone who had already been through\nthe process.As I worked\nthrough the emails, responding to each one, I realized just how much knowledge\nI had acquired during my three cycles of IVF, and how valuable that information\nand understanding would have been to me when I was first contemplating\nfertility treatment.While\ninfertility and its causes continue to be a grey area for medical science, the\ntreatment of it has developed into a booming industry with ground-breaking\ntechniques being introduced all the time. Recent advancements include\neverything from womb transplants to a revolutionary incubator (The EmbryoScope)\nthat provides detailed information about which embryos are most likely to\nresult in a successful pregnancy. The pace of change is so great that even\nthose working in the field of reproductive medicine struggle to keep up.There are also a\ngrowing number of alternative therapies that are believed to benefit fertility,\nalthough there is little clinical guidance as to which are the best ones to\npursue.While access to\nall of this information is undoubtedly a positive thing, wading through it can\nbe overwhelming - especially for first-time IVF patients. There is so much\nconflicting advice, so many unfamiliar acronyms, and so many complex tests and\ntreatment options to chose from that many people have no idea where to start\nand fear that pursuing IVF may be too much to take on.Throughout the\ntime that I was pursuing IVF, I relied heavily on the advice of other patients\nwith whom I came into contact, and their personal stories helped me to answer\nsome of the questions that fertility experts could not. I wanted to know what the\ntreatment would really be like, how I would cope with the outcome of the tests\nand investigations that scared me so much, and if there were any ways to reduce\ncosts - or if treatment was really as expensive as everyone had warned me.As there didn't\nappear to be an up-to-date IVF guide written from a personal perspective, I\ndecided to use my knowledge and experience to address that need. The title of\nthis book,Five Million Born, is a\ntribute to how significant assisted reproduction has been in transforming the\nlives of many people around the world, and a reminder to those of you reading\nit that you are not alone.I hope that it will\nanswer many of your questions and help you to take the next steps on your\njourney.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
