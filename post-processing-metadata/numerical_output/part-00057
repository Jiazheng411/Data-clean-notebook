The Zionist training farm was organized to prepare Jews for emigration to Palestine. One of the founders was Yeohezkel Tydor, the author's father, who died in 1993. Baumel's narration of the kibbutz's history is divided into two sections. Part one examines the kibbutz from its creation until the departure of the founding group to Palestine in late summer 1945. Part two traces the kibbutz's subsequent history in Palestine and Germany, from the autumn of 1945 until the mid-1950s. Kibbutz Buchenwald was abolished in Germany in 1948; the kibbutz as it was founded in what is now Israel--named Netzer Sereni--still exists today. The story of these pioneers and their physical, psychological, ideological, and political struggles forms the nucleus of this absorbing book.George Cohen", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is the first Arab journalist in Israel and a veteran journalist in the Israeli press. At a time when few Arabs inside Israel knew any Hebrew, he started writing for well-known Hebrew newspapers. He is a proud man of his village Jish in Upper Galilee, of his church in the Holy Land, and of his socio-political affiliation in Israel. Very often in times of crises local church and non-church authorities consult him. His long experience in the war in Lebanon gave him a special fame. We are grateful for his courage and for his writing this book that will be a reference on Middle East policy and especially on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” −Fr.

Donaldson is a medical cowboy, chasing viruses in Africa, but also a UCLA medical prof and ER doc. This book is a wild and extraordinary memoir of his 2003 summer in Sierra Leone as a naïve medical student studying Lassa fever (a close cousin of the Ebola virus). Donaldson gives passionate and powerful reportage on a struggling clinic treating villagers and refugees from neighboring war-torn Liberia suffering from the devastating and often fatal illness. What inspired the adventure was the work of Dr. Aniru Conteh (who died in 2004), the hero at the heart of the story, whose Lassa ward served thousands. despite the lack of equipment, medicine and staff. For a week, Donaldson, untried and unsure, was left to treat the desperately ill patients alone—a test that turned a frightened student into a caring, if not altogether confident, young doctor. Despite a slow start, this astounding story of the seemingly insurmountable barriers to public health in a Third World country revs up into an irresistible tale of discovery, courage and kindness.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The man behind some of the hottest technology IPOs of the decade, Quattrone's rise from South Philly street tough to the highest echelons of the banking industry, and the questionable practices that took him there and ultimately landed him in court for obstruction of justice, is the stuff of modern-day myth. Unfortunately, in the hands ofWall Street Journalreporter Smith, Quattrone's story is buried under a thicket of detail and minutiae without a clear line of analysis to help lay readers understand exactly what went wrong (for example, the author details instances where stock analysts were pressured to give positive coverage of companies doing business with Quattrone's group, without explaining what an analyst does or how their work affects the stock market). While an important and frequently compelling account, the book conveys little about the central personalities and reads very much like the court transcripts upon which it is based.(Jan.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And, it's narrated partly in the second person like one of those old choose-your-own-adventure novels. Narration using you usually seems like such a gimmick, a forced smart pose. But here, the chapters feel natural; the second person tone is relaxed and just contributes a slight edge to let us know this novel will be unpredictable, difficult to pin down. You re scared, but you want this to happen, writes Allen. You want something to happen. You want this to be over so you can go back to your regular life of being annoyed by Boy.The novel s protagonist you falls in with a ragtag gang of five pirates, who spend much of the novel trying to find a boat so they can get back to a life on the high seas. The pirates are named for their main qualities the captain, the drunk, the driver, the engineer, and Muffin. Allen has a knack for nailing characters with deceptively-simple descriptions: The driver wonders how Salaryman always manages to sound like he s casually inspecting his fingernails.Allen's novel challenges two frequent assumptions about CanLit. First, that it has to be serious, that it has to feel good for you. The book is an entertaining, joyous, daredevil leap. Without becoming anything like a genre novel, You and the Pirates plays with chicklit expectations: a whimsical female narrator, unwilling to marry her lackluster boyfriend; and thriller/action stylings: pirates, a stolen boat, a conspiracy that threatens the universe as we know it.And the second assumption Allen challenges? That CanLit needs to be set in Canada. You and the Pirates is set in a slightly-parallel-universe contemporary Japan. Allen brings us the believable grit of a real city, not pretty, not perfectly designed: They obstacle-course their way around the cat-scaring water bottles, a non-scared cat, varying piles of garbage and a rusting miniature shopping cart in the alley. William Gibson would feel at home here, though he d have more techie stuff (although Allen can t resist a boyfriend-bot). Allen comes by her exotic locations honestly: she spent a decade living as a gaijin in Tokyo, working as a translator, and the novel apparently started during her daily subway commute. She let her brain wander, and came up with this story of mysterious forces trying to change the direction of the universe.But really the story is about finding your place in the world. Whether you re a pirate who has lost your ship, or a woman who keeps getting in the way of terrorist attacks. You and the Pirates perfectly expresses the one thing that consistently thrills me about CanLit so much of what we re writing these days is about the struggle to find our place in a world where the only really consistent quality to our lives is change. How do you figure out how to be the person you re supposed to be? You and the Pirates offers a completely unexpected answer. --Lisa Pasold, The AfterwordYou and the Piratesis set in Japan and as I was about to travel there, I was very excited. I was assured by the publishers that Allen's version of Japan was fictionalized, and I might not see many similarities, but I ended up seeing many. One of the characters is nicknamed Salaryman, and it turned out that salaryman is an actual term the Japanese use (basically a corporate business man in a suit). Allen's army of cats reminded me of all the maneki nekos I saw there (Japanese cat sculptures). Another character nicknamed Lolita shows off a very common fashion trend in Japan known as, what else, Lolita fashion.But all the Japanese culture wasn't the best part of the book...The best part of the book was the risks taken by Allen herself. The first part of the book is told in the second person (She smiles at you, gently, like you'd expect a lady in a kimono to.). I know Allen is not the first person to employ this perspective, but you have to admit, it's pretty rare, especially with Canadian novels. Allen pulled it off masterfully. My reservations that I could slip into the mind of a young female in Japan were gone by page 3...I found myself thinking of the oldChoose Your Adventurechildrens' book series. But without the choices at the end of every other page, I then began to think of old Bugs Bunny cartoons when the artists' eraser threatens to wipe him out unless he cooperates. Then with the zany plot involving explosions, armies of cats, people obsessed with changing up to left, hypno-travel, and of course, pirates, I found myself thinking ofThe Master and Margarita,The Matrix, manga comics, andAlice in Wonderland. I don't imply that Allen ripped off the ideas of others, but it should give you some sense of the book's feel. If you said bizarre, you'd not be far off the mark. --John Mutford, The Book Mine Set", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her apprenticeship in fashion journalism began when Condé Nast hired her atVoguein 1922. Jumping ship a decade later to work for Nast's rival, Hearst'sBazaar, Snow set out to redefine the fashion magazine to include anything—fiction, diets, theater reviews, politics—of interest to a fashionable woman. To giveBazaara unique and arresting visual style, she hired layout artist Alexei Brodovitch, plus a succession of innovative photographers: Man Ray, Munkasci, Dahl-Wolfe, Avedon. For verbal flair, Snow hired the always outrageous Diana Vreeland, and commissioned works from creative artists like Truman Capote and Andy Warhol. Rowlands, who freelances for the fashion press, is great at explaining the fashion world—the rise and fall of key designers, or the significance of various styles. But she's clearly uncomfortable exploring Snow's personal side; the editor never emerges as a flesh-and-blood woman until the last chapters, when she's being unwillingly retired fromBazaar. Still, this lavishly illustrated and entertainingly informative fashion bio is \"must\" reading for theWset. Photos.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Probably not, if the focus is on what he did when with which cocktail waitresses, but veteran sportswriter Callahan takes a different tack altogether. Exploring the complex relationship between Tiger and his father, Earl, Callahan delivers a revealing portrait of a man and his talented son, the love they felt for one another, and the emotional scars that father passed along to son. Much of the book tells Earl’s story and a fascinating one it is. Unlike his son, Earl felt the full force of racism growing up, including four years at Kansas State University, where he played baseball, and later as a career army officer. Yes, Tiger became a stand-in for Earl (also a habitual womanizer), but Callahan shows that none of the simple explanations tells the whole story. In a book full of revealing anecdotes, perhaps the most striking is this comment from Tiger’s half sister: “I asked him once, Don’t you ever want to do a little dirt, Tiger, be a little bad?” The young boy answered, “I probably would if I didn’t know I was going to be famous someday.”      HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: A full media blitz is likely to bring the Tiger story front and center yet again, but this time Callahan may be able to offer some much-needed perspective. --Bill Ott", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Whatever the reason, Aaron just can’t stick to one media or one genre. He’s written novels, short stories, children’s books, roleplaying games, webcomics, essays, reviews, and educational books, and has ranged from mystery to horror to science fiction and fantasy to contemporary fiction. He’s won awards for his roleplaying work (an Origins Award and a gold ENnie) and his fiction (a Psi Phi Award and a Scribe Award), and is constantly finding new stories to tell and new ways to tell them. Recent fiction projects include the Stargate: Atlantis novel Hunt and Run, the Chaotic junior novel The Khilaian Sphere, the middle-grade series Pete and Penny’s Pizza Puzzles, and two Eureka novels (written under the house name Cris Ramsay). Recent game projects include the Supernatural Hunter’s Guide, Eclipse Phase: Sunward, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, and the Trail of Cthulhu supplement This Sceptre’d Isle.

Mit 17 Jahren ging er nach New York, dann nach Philadelphia, wo er die ersten Reiseskizzen schrieb.

Greenleaf is a former sailor, Polar explorer, military officer, policeman and lawyer. He is a Michigan Master Lawyer.

The novel spans 400 years of both Irish and world history, events of great interest to Joe. He personally investigated the facts of each event as the couple reincarnated through the centuries, careful that the circumstances and locales were historically accurate. Joe has degrees in Political Science, minoring in English, a Juris Doctor in Law and a Masters of Law in Information Technology and Telecommunications Law from the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland. He resides in Co Donegal, Ireland with his wife, Karlene. They also have a home in the Omaha, Nebraska, area. He is a full-time author. Currently, he has completed two sequels to Sudden Light, entitled \"Rising Light\" and \"Shining Light,\" to be published in 2014, six novels, and a technical book about Asperger's Syndrome, entitled, \"Tell Them I'm Not Crazy,\" to be published in 2014.

My editor assigned me the story of a mysterious \"dog woman\" who lived in our village. I spent three months immersed in investigation. After my article was published, I could never get the dog woman out of my head. Her story is a classic tragedy and also a classic American drama about the underdog and the powers that prevail.It took me 20 years, but I finally wrote a book about her, as seen through the eyes of the fictional George Woods. George is a boy who sees the good in the eccentric dog-hoarding recluse - just as I still see the good in her real-life counterpart.I wrote the story first as a screenplay. I thinkDog Womanwould make a great movie. To turn the screenplay into a novel, I locked myself in our house trailer on a lake - my \"writing shack\" - and stole my own dialogue, adding narration and description. It was fun to do, but I found that I preferred dialogue to narration and description. Therefore, readers will find that the book sails along rather swiftly on the strength of the conversation. This is my favorite kind of book. I think we all like to eavesdrop.This was my first work of fiction. I found it great fun to weave in elements from my own life and from the lives of people I've known. That's why readers will find references to baseball, chickens, Cajun traditions, Romanian food, faith and love of nature.I still think of myself as more of a nonfiction writer. In any fiction I write, there will always be a strong element of nonfiction. For me, truth is stranger - and more interesting - than fiction.", "related": [], "rank": 2573066, "title": "Dog Woman: Inspired", "author": "Gail Grenier", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Soon I was getting calls from cousins and neighbors and co-workers. Parents appreciated the chance to talk to someone unaffiliated with any college. Seniors appreciated a parent perspective from someone who wasn't their parent. When I returned to law school in 2002 more and more adult learners were asking my advice. My first book was written for them, \"Back to School for Grownups\". \"How to Save $50,000 on College\" was created to share what I've learned with traditional-age students (16-24) and their families. As I sat down to write each section of this book I asked myself, \"What have I heard or seen or done to keep costs down in this area without sacrificing the quality of the experience?\" Some stories came from my kids. Others from my students. A few from my own college experiences. My thought was to offer a variety of the best ideas I've witnessed, and hopefully include a few ideas, or thought-starters, for every reader. Think of me as that knowledgeable adult who has no agenda other than to see you succeed:)", "related": ["B00A1S0ZFG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jones needs little introduction.

Plus, he was there. As the first half ofUprising(\"Then\") retells, Jones and a small group of kindred luminaries were specifically invited by the prisoners to Attica to represent their demands. His recollection of the four fateful days between the outbreak of the riot and its bloody conclusion includes an arresting play-by-play of his negotiation with the prisoners, during which--despite being their guest--his personal safety was by no means always ensured. The second half of this extended essay (\"Now\") is both equally enthralling and utterly different in tone and pace, if not purpose. A discussion of the deplorable worsening of the American penal system since Attica, it explores the capitalistic motivations that have driven the evolution of our increasingly privatized and profit-driven \"corrections\" industry, the racially motivated disparity of our laws, and the nearly complete elimination of rehabilitation as a goal in our \"incarceration state,\" which--to quote Michele Alexander, as does Jones--\"imprisons a larger percentage of its black population than South Africa did at the height of apartheid.\" As Jones argues with passion and clarity, \"readers are instinctively gravitating toward something they subconsciously already know: that in the wake of the Emancipation Proclamation, we found a way to keep slavery alive.\" --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B00GB9ZQHQ"], "rank": 785761, "title": "Uprising: Understanding Attica, Revolution, and the Incarceration State (Kindle Single)", "author": "Clarence B.

However, I found that many readers enjoyed the first book and were curious as to what happened to Trinity and Travis after that one night at the club. I gave it some thought and decided that I would write a second book. This second book's focus is on Nigel, the club owner. However, you will find Trinity, Franny, Travis and William all within the pages of this second book and I am confident my readers will be pleased with how their stories played out.The first Night at Club Vampire book is a shorter piece (12k words) and is meant for readers who are looking for a quick erotic read. This second book is a longer story with several plot twists playing out. I was considering making the second book another novelette length story, but Nigel is a fairly complex character and it simply wouldn't do him justice to put his story into a 10k-15k word book.  I thank you for taking the time to read this and hope you enjoy reading about Nigel & Lacey as much as I enjoyed writing about them.All the best,Elixa", "related": ["B00JL41NPW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In place of a previously regnant understanding of the great philosopher, depicting him as an absolute idealist unable to comprehend difference, a staid liberal who walked away from his early enthusiasm for the French Revolution, we have a 'new' Hegel. This superb collection gives us the lineaments of this latter Hegel, who grappled unsparingly with difference and whose systematicity allowed breaks and interruptions.(Kenneth Surin, Duke University)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

One of the first books that he was given was 'The Wizard of Oz' The second was 'The Hobbit' by J.R. Tolkien he was so beguiled about these books that he dreamed of writing a book. He went to secondary school near Watford, he wasn't entirely happy there, but if he got bored in class he would look out of the window at March hares, trains on the tracks going north, and the Rolls Royce Helicopter engine factory. He didn't realise that that factory would become a movie studio for James Bond films and the Harry Potter franchise movies. His writing was physically bad and he got a lot of fear in his life, but when walking tired along the canal path from school he would describe each step to himself as if he was writing a novel. He took to maths; no writing needed, but dropped out in the first year of his Maths degree. Next came years in stores for construction equipement manufacturers and public works manufacturers, where he got some of the plot and characters for this book. He is indebted to these industries for giving him income and the pride of working for British manufactured goods. He got made redundant and decided to write the first of what he hopes will be many books. George now lives on the boarders of Kent and East Sussex, England, has a one bed roomed flat with a small garden and dabbles in the light art of solar energy. He is studying for a Certificate in Creative Writing part time at Tonbridge. Writing this book has taught him how to write, deal with life and semi colons.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So I started to wonder what it would be like if there were a group of people out there who could manipulate the perceptions people rely on to form memories and take actions. Out of this thought process came the story forBeyond Disbelief.  I decided to have a teenaged protagonist because I know that when I was that age on the one hand I was sure I had everything figured out, but on the other I seemed to be discovering huge, new, scary things about myself and the world around me constantly.  I made him a magician because, to me, they already blur that line between reality and illusion - they make you believe, however briefly, in the impossible. I also wanted my young hero to face a challenge, and to meet some interesting people who would teach him something about the power to manipulate belief.  So that all led me to create the Society of Illusionists, who we meet inBeyond Disbeliefbut will really get to know in future adventures.Brett is exceptionally loosely based on my own son, in that he was 14 when I wrote the book, has a little sister, lives in Portland, and likes doing magic.  His sister Sarah shares a love of animals with my daughter, and I tend to be a little like the absent minded professor at times.  Beyond those sorts of superficial comparisons, though, this is entirely a work of fiction. As it is a work of fiction, I have manipulated some parts of Portland as needed to suit the narrative.  I have probably grossly oversimplified various issues, too.  Nonetheless, I have tried to stay true to the sense of the place.  Portland is wonderfully weird.  Not as polished or outrageous in its weirdness as San Francisco, but still the sort of place where protestors call the police to arrange the time and place of arrests and no one blinks at waiting in line in the rain for bacon maple donuts.  It is a place of constant exploration, and hopefully as the series develops Brett's world will expand to reveal more of it.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

These are punchy, ghoulish selections by south-of-the-border writers unafraid of the dark.”—Publishers Weekly“Encompassing a definition of fantasy that includes the extraterrestrial, the supernatural, the macabre, and the spectral, these stories are set in unusual locales and deal with bizarre characters. All are very short (some just two pages), and most offer a surprise twist at the end, though occasionally the only reaction these endings may elicit from the reader is “Huh?” The universal scope of the themes transcends the Mexican provenance; for example, one detects an apocalyptic influence in Liliana V. Blum’s “Pink Lemonade,” and Argentine Julio Cortázar’s “Bestiary” influences Bernardo Fernández’s “Lions.” Most of the volume’s 34 authors, half of whom are women, are relatively unknown to American readers, and for many of them, publication in this anthology represents their first exposure to an English-reading audience. The translations, several of which were done by the editors, convey the individuality, if not idiosyncrasies, of these tales. VERDICT This collection will appeal mostly to fans of fantasy and sf and, to a lesser degree, those interested in contemporary Mexican literature.”—Library Journal“Langorous, edgy, sumptuously beautiful by turns, Three Messages expands our understanding of contemporary Mexican literary production, collapsing high-low boundaries and pre-established ideas about national identity.”—Debra Castillo, Emerson Hinchliff Professor of Spanish Literature, Cornell University", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Due to the last decade’s results in research and development in the fields of for instance detector technology, computing power, memory capacity position and orientation measurement it is now possible with this new generation of airborne cameras to generate different sets of geometric and spectral data with high geometric and radiometric resolutions within a single flight. This is a decisive advantage as compared to film based airborne cameras. The linear characteristic of the opto-electronic converters is the basis for the transition from an imaging camera to an images generating measuring instrument. Because of the direct digital processing chain from the airborne camera to the data products there is no need for the processes of chemical film development and digitising the film information. Failure sources as well as investments and staff costs are avoided. But the effective use of this new technology requires the knowledge of the features of the image and information generation, its possibilities and its restrictions. This book describes all components of a digital airborne camera from the object to be imaged to the mass memory device. So the image quality influencing processes in the nature are described, as for instance the reflection of the electromagnetic sun spectrum at the objects to be imaged and the influence of the atmosphere. Also, the essential features of the new digital sensor system, their characteristics and parameters, are addressed and put into the system context. The complexity of the cooperation of all camera components, as for instance optics, filters, detector elements, analogue and digital electronics, software and so forth, becomes transparent. The book includes also the description of an example system. Audience: This book will be of interest to managers, operators, data users dealing with the new digital airborne cameras; students in the fields of photogrammetry and remote sensing.", "related": [], "rank": 3701417, "title": "Digital Airborne Camera: Introduction and Technology", "author": "Rainer Sandau", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Learning to read was the most significant event of her early life.   Bobby married young and had three sons.  Her middle boy was deaf, and he taught her patience.  The other two were rambunctious.  They taught her forbearance.   After twelve years of marriage she divorced and worked at various odd jobs: directing traffic around construction sites, caring for challenged children and selling fabric by the pound at a remnant store.   Eventually, she mortgaged her house and bought the store.  Accompanied by her sewing machine, she began to sew one dress a day.  The dresses sold, the fabric didn’t, so she hired four seamstresses and turned the store into a boutique.   After twelve successful years, Bobby sold the business and decided to run a marathon.  Training was a huge bore, so she made up a story about Pheiddipides, the first marathoner, as she ran.   She copied it down, sent it to Chatelaine short story contest and won first prize.  Presto, she became a writer.   She married again, divorced again, writing all the while.  She published about fifty-five books for major publishers and is always writing, working on ebooks now.   After many adventures and many moves, she came home to Sparwood, the coal mining town where she was born.  She lives alone, except for two rabbits who keep escaping. She has two of her six grandchildren living just down the street--they own the rabbits but Bobby feeds them.  She walks, reads, writes and likes this quote: “When you change the way you look at a thing, the thing you look at changes.”", "related": ["B00D1WWGT2"], "rank": 176322, "title": "Full Recovery (Doctor 911 Series Book 2)", "author": "Bobby Hutchinson", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.75, "rating_total": 38.0}

My Mom read to me as a child and encouraged me to continue with reading as I grew to school age. I grew up in and still live around Kalamazoo, Michigan, which had, fortunately for me, a public library. I made regular trips to our library, first with my family, then on my own as I grew into a young adult. Many worlds of information and adventure opened up for me through my early years of reading, as well as many hours of enjoyment.  Reading books not only gave me enjoyment, but opened my mind to new ideas and inspired me to be thoughtful and creative as well. My love of reading grew into an understanding and appreciation of writing. I have used writing skills in every aspect of the jobs and goals that I have chosen to take on in my life. The writing skills merged with my love of adventure and my ever wondering imagination into a dream of writing my own stories. I finally mustered up the courage to put on my running shoes and chase after my dream. A dream that has come true for me with the publishing of my first book, Rise of the Altered Moon, a space adventure set in the future of humankind. With a flair of amateur arrogance I expected to kick out a well written cracker jack of a story, which, I feel that I did, but only after countless edits, re-writes, and corrections. I have grown as a writer with the completion of my first book and look forward writing again. The worlds of my imagination are at my fingertips and I hope that you as readers enjoy traveling through them.

Angelique is also the author of the new and creative Christian children's series \"The Tales of Kooshla and Saboo\". These books are geared for ages 3-9 and focus on teaching family values, the Word of God and the love of Jesus Christ. Angelique wanted to write a series that would reach the hearts of teens for the Lord and inspire them to study the Bible and use prayer as a weapon against the forces of evil which come against them on a daily basis.  After seeking the Lord's direction through prayer she was blessed with the vision for \"The Intercessors\" series. \"Exordium\" is the first book in the series of at least seven more books to come. Angelique was led in her heart to give away 1000 free ebooks before publishing on Amazon Kindle and CreateSpace and in that quickly learned that this book is not just for teens or young people, but for readers of all ages. The book is already receiving 5 star reviews and has proven to be much more than just the first book of a new series, it is a teaching tool for ministry worldwide. It is Angelique's hope that all the readers of \"The Intercessors\" series will not just be entertained by the stories, but let it impact their hearts to become real live Intercessors for the Lord.", "related": ["B00DW4KGWS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

William Francis Lynch to command an unusual expedition east to Ottoman Palestine, now Israel and Jordan, to map the Dead Sea. Horses weren’t strong enough, so Lynch improvised with foul-tempered camels to haul metal boats overland from the Mediterranean to theSea of Galilee. Traversing this backwater of a dying empire, he forged life-saving alliances with a Bedouin sheikh and a Hashemite sharif, and he and his men navigated the treacherous, uncharted rapids of the Jordan, braving fatal heat and shortages of food and water before reaching Jerusalem—but why?The expedition followed a long tradition of quasi-scientific expeditions as it tried to establish definitively, where others had failed, that the Dead Sea lay below sea level. But did it generate enough knowledge to justify the expense or the suffering of the fifteen Americans who joined Lynch’s obsessive quest? Was it the result of one man’s deadly ambition? A religious pilgrimage? A publicity stunt? Or the first step in returning Muslim Palestine to its former glory as a Judeo-Christian land of milk and honey?In vivid, absorbing detail—richly illustrated with engaging historical drawings and maps—Clash of Eagles masterfully recounts this seemingly foolhardy mission and America’s first footsteps in the Middle East.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His book illustrates the joy of fishing and why so many of us are obsessed with it. Fishing is special to all of us in a different way and for me it reminds me of precious time spent with my grandfather. Often in life when I get too busy with the foundation, I stop and remind myself of what Johnny Morris says...'If you are too busy to go fishing, you are too busy.' Mark's book catches this outdoorsman spirit and is a must read for all anglers out there that need time on the water to live life a little better.\"Darrell Gwynn,  President,  Darrell Gwynn Foundation\"Mark puts in words what many of us who commune with the joys and mysteries of the wild have long known in our hearts. His book is an excellent rendition of personal experience and commentary for both the true sportsman and the novice who wishes to understand our shared passion and love of nature.\"E.T. (Tom) Meredith IV, Wyoming Rancher and Outfitter\"I have known Mark for many years and have had the pleasure of sharing the boat with him on several occasions. This book shares his life's passion for the outdoors and his belief in the ethical harvest of game. It's a great read!\"Matt Herren, B.A.S.S. Elite Series Pro\"Mark Shepard is a true American outdoorsman that you would love to hang with anytime. Read his book and see for yourself. And I bet you'll learn something you didn't know, and maybe change your mind about something you did.\"Tim O'Neil, Marketing Director, Wildlife Foundation of Florida\"This book is a must read for anyone interested in the outdoors. Mark's life stories are a testament to his dedication to promote conservation of our natural resources.\"Joe Staigl, Wildlife Biologist and Lake Manager\"I've fished against Mark in tournaments, shared hunting blinds with him, and have come to respect his unyielding courtesy and faith. Mark has lived a life of unique experiences, and I know readers will get to know and appreciate Mark as an old-school American individualist. Effective game management in the U.S. can be achieved by a consistent and knowledgeable harvest, carried out by ethical hunters like Mark Shepard.\"Larry D. Martoglio, Wildlife Biologist and Forest Ranger\"If living the outdoors life has always baffled you, this book is the key to understanding its mysteries!\"Todd Kersey, founder and owner of BassOnline.com\"The bottom line of Mark's message is to: Get out of the house. Have fun. Go fishing, hunting, boating, camping, hiking, meet people, and make friends. It's healthier for your body, mind, and soul rather than being confined to four walls, mesmerized with the cyber world of today's electronics.\"Tom Martin, Chicago Police Officer (retired)", "related": [], "rank": 2534177, "title": "A Guiding Life", "author": "Phil Fragasso", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That small seed of an idea set Schwartz’s powers of creation loose, and within Two-Part Inventions exists a forest of stories that grows more lush and complex with each page. Schwartz opens her tale with a tragedy—a husband finds that his wife has died suddenly—then asks how this couple arrived at this point, creating tension around an otherwise ordinary story of a marriage. Pianist Suzanne goes from timid preteen to beautiful ingénue to flawed artist struggling with stage fright. The yin to Suzanne’s yang is charming, confident Phillip. Is he an egotist? A controlling husband? A man for whom a childhood trauma can never heal? Schwartz takes great care to mold her characters into complicated beings who find themselves unsatisfied despite promising beginnings. The result is a painstaking character study and taut modern fable about people who live at the cross-section of art and fame. --Annie Tully", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She is amazingly non-judgmental. She does not sort experiences or people into good and bad boxes, but dwells patiently and expectantly with them, confident that God has something to teach her in virtually everything. (Thomas G. LongPrinceton Theological Seminary)Gospel Medicineby Barbara Brown Taylor is a book of sermons that read like short stories. …The book is packed with memorable sayings and word pictures: ‘In case you have not noticed, Christianity is a religion in which the sinners have all the advantages,’ reads one. …I read one of these sermons out loud, just to see whether they spoke as well as they read. They do. (Ecw Communique)Those who have read Barbara Brown Taylor'sThe Preaching Lifewill surely welcomeGospel Medicine. Like her earlier work, this is a collection of sermons that address a variety of life situations. Taylor is a preacher/writer of uncommon skill, a homiletical thaumaturgist, if you will. . . . Taylor will catch your attention with a riveting phrase or striking allusion as she leads you down unfamiliar pathways where, to your surprise, you will discover new/old truths about yourself, your community, and your world. (Anglican Theological Review)Barbara Brown Taylor has won the respect of homileticians through her writing, lectures, and sermons at preaching conferences. This book of sermons will only enhance her reputation for theological insight and gracious speech. The gospel she shares is fresh and clear. …She writes with the feeling of the poet and the warmth of a personal friend who understands the struggle to be human and Christian. (The Review and Expositor)In these down to earth observations on God's presence in a broken world, Ms. Taylor re-examines a few of the 'tried and true' Old and New Testament stories with a fresh and a sharp discerning eye. (Faith At Work)Like all the best Anglican preachers, Taylor has a fine ear. She is not only attentive to speaking the truth (and there is a lot of truth in these pages). She is also concerned to speak that truth plainly, elegantly, and in relationship to the life we live. . . . Taylor herself is good medicine.

PorupQ:Why did you write this book?A:I wanted to write a spy thriller set in South America. I was living in Colombia writing guidebooks for Lonely Planet at the time, and I had just come back from a miserable month in Peru. Lima puts on a nice face for visitors, but behind that facade is a nasty, gritty, revolting city. I wanted to write about the dark side of the Gringo Trail.Q:This is some seriously hard-boiled noir. Reminds me a lot of Roger Smith's Cape Town novels--Wake Up Dead, Dust Devils,etc. Were you influenced by Smith at all?A:(laughs) No, actually. I pitchedThe Second Bat Guano Warto a bunch of agents, one of whom compared my writing to Roger Smith. I've since discovered his work and highly recommend it. Readers who like Smith will like my work, and vice versa.Q:You lived in South America for many years writing guidebooks for Lonely Planet. That sounds pretty cool. Was it?A:The problem with dream jobs is everyone wants them. The truth is that very few writers are good enough to research and write a decent guidebook, but that doesn't stop Lonely Planet management from treating its writers like dirt.Q:The Second Bat Guano Warportrays American foreign policy is a somewhat less than positive light. Would you like to comment on that?A:Sure. The CIA are a bunch of mafia thugs who murder, rape, torture, blackmail, and commit genocide to line the pockets of their corporate masters. All I've done with this book is portray them as they actually are.Because thisisa spy thriller. But you need to remember that spies are not James Bond characters. They are evil human beings. Most maximum security penitentiaries contain people of better moral character than the average CIA employee. Utter vermin.Q:Pitt and Ambo in the book certainly seem to fit that mold. But what about Horse? One of the more compelling dark heroes I've read in a while.A:Horse is a good man who made a mistake. And haven't we all?The Second Bat Guano Waris his journey out of the sea of filth and slime he's been swimming in for years. Yeah, it's a dark book, but there is an element of hope at the end.", "related": ["B00HWZG7ZI"], "rank": 32554, "title": "The Second Bat Guano War: a Hardboiled Spy Thriller", "author": "J.M.

The latter part of the book discusses these systems in detail, including system design, algorithms (with equations), and analysis results. … I recommend it as an enjoyable read for anyone who is interested in database design, especially in the context of social media applications. Computer science students especially should look at it.” (Alyx Macfadyen, ACM Computing Reviews, December, 2012) “The objective of this book is to present a new approach to social data storage which optimizes the distribution and replication of data. … The book is clearly written and structured, also the illustrations help readers to understand the presented concepts. The book is aimed at graduate and PhD students, software engineers and researchers interested in designing and implementing efficient distributed storage systems.” (Mihai Gabroveanu, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1257, 2013)", "related": [], "rank": 3274944, "title": "Data Storage for Social Networks: A Socially Aware Approach (SpringerBriefs in Optimization)", "author": "Duc A.

While I was serving as her nurse for three months, many things went wrong with her care. Foremost was the lack of knowledge and sometimes compassion from the different 60 doctors she visited during her illness.

Lee has had a passion for reading since she was in Pull Ups. It wasn't until she had to write a short story as a class assignment in elementary that she discovered that she liked to write and create her own stories. Love's parents and teachers took note of her talent, believing that one day she could become an author. Unfortunately, Love felt it would only remain a hobby since she thought it was too difficult to land a publishing deal. It would be nearly ten years before she picked up her pen again. Love dropped out of college after having her son, and then relocated to Raleigh, North Carolina. While working at a call center, in-between calls and on her break, she would read urban fiction. Soon she began working on her own novel as her interest in writing returned. Thanks to a chance encounter, Love linked up with best-selling author Treasure E. Blue on a social networking site. He introduced her to other literary heavyweights that shared resources to help her perfect her craft and offered invaluable advice. After receiving encouragement and mentoring from Nakea Murray of The Literary Consultant Group and David Weaver of SBR Publications, she decided to bring her dreams to fruition. Taking a leap of faith, Love quit her job and began writing full-time. Her novel 'Already Taken' hit virtual bookshelves in July and became an overnight bestseller. After much hard work, she is now the CEO and Founder of JME Publications, which specializes in romance books for the hood. Love currently lives in Atlanta with her four-year-old son. Outside of writing, she enjoys reality TV, K-dramas, and traveling.", "related": ["B00GM4N3MU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 76, "rating_average": 4.7105, "rating_total": 358.0}

And you could not\n     tell the difference from one specie and another because all belong to the\n     early form of the animalistic world or animals' world.  Military\n     Psychologist: How come you know so much about our life, custom and history\n     and what we do on earth?Alien:\n     This is a very simple matter. Everything you do and you've done does not\n     vanish. The substance of everything you have done, whether physical or\n     mental takes on a new shape, a new form. Nothing in the Universe comes to\n     an end but it transforms itself into something else. If not, the Universe\n     will seize to exist. If each time, part of the Universe, part of earth,\n     part of the stars, part of the rocks, part of the air, part of the water\n     vanishes and disappears, the Universe will be missing a lot of things.\n     And, if this continues endlessly the Universe will be empty. But the idea\n     of emptiness does not exist. There is no such thing as an empty space\n     because if there is something like an empty space you will not be able to\n     find it. And, to know where this empty space is, you have to know the limit\n     of the empty space by comparing it to a full space. The fact that you are\n     doing this means, you have given a size, shape, space and border to the\n     empty space. And, when you are able to localize and define its perimeter and\n     limits, you just proved it exists. This is a matter of mathematics and\n     physics, according to your science. So everything you have done on earth\n     has been preserved from the beginning of earth time. We can tap into it,\n     if we are interested. But we are not interested in humanity affairs. You\n     have been broadcasting for sometime now. And the frequencies of your\n     programs and your music are well preserved. But not as many of your\n     thought that they have reached us because we are very far away. And all\n     the frequencies of your noise, and music, were retained in your earth/\n     solar system perimeter. We knew about you, and also other advanced\n     societies in the Universe, knew about you from a very, very long time ago.\n     But, you had nothing to offer us. And if you wonder why then we are here\n     on earth, if we are not interested in you I can give you lots of answers. Some\n     of the Galactic community members lived on earth before and your ancestors\n     called them gods and goddesses. Many left earth while others remained\n     here. And with those who have remained here on earth we share information\n     with by means and ways incomprehensive to your mind. We enter and exit\n     your sky/atmosphere through time pockets. And this also is something new\n     to you, that you now are not capable of understanding, but in the future\n     you will.   General..: How do you explain thecrash of alien\n     spaceships?Alien:\n     They never crashed, they were smashed because they bumped against the time-wall.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                        Dr.\n     X: What do you mean?          Alien:\n     I used the word wall so you can understand it physically. It is not a wall\n     in the physical sense, it is a point of an entrance and exit that opens up\n     and closes up in a matter of seconds. When the space craft enters this point\n     successfully, it will exit successfully. It has only a few seconds,\n     sometimes a fraction of a second to do that. If the space craft misses the\n     opening of the point or reaches the point that just closed it becomes\n     solid. And, when it hits it, it smashes itself.                                                                                                                         General\n     R...: So what we heard from other alien species about how their space craft\n     crashed is not correct. We were told they were hit by an electrical\n     discharge and they crashed to the ground.Alien:  This is not correct at all, because our\n     communities are very advanced, even you in your limited/primitive\n     standards, you have developed tools and ways to protect yourselves from\n     electrical discharges and lightning.  You use a rod on the top of your\n     buildings and homes to protect your homes from lightening and other\n     atmospheric discharges. Many of your primitive airplanes were struck by lightning\n     and still did not go down. Our machines are well protected against your\n     atmosphere elements as well as other spaces and zooming dimensions.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Included are illustrations of iconic campaigns that make up the backbone of popular culture and ad history, as well as intriguing questions regarding how well the move from strict Federal Communications Commission (FCC) controls to self-regulation serves the public interest. The two-page epilog sketching the advantages and potential pitfalls of PSAs venturing into social media is excellent. Today’s students might find greater emphasis on new media and less of what could be dismissed as nostalgia for print and traditional television even more compelling and relevant.VERDICTSurpassing other treatments in articles, books, and sources cited in chapter notes, this work distinguishes itself by its breadth and by incisive commentary and analysis. A superlative history of public service advertising.—Elizabeth Wood, Bowling Green State Univ. Libs., OHKirkus ReviewsFrom the back stories of McGruff and Smokey through the conflicts of political polarization, this compact history of the Ad Council puts the relationship between government and the advertising industry in fresh perspective. Solid reporting and analysis from Melillo, a former Pulitzer nominee for theWashington Post, distinguish this first history of the Ad Council to date. It also suggests that more of a feature approach rather than a drier tone more common in academic or public policy writing might better serve this very interesting story, one that shows how the industry has bolstered its own image through what it has termed \"advertising's gift to America\" and how the council's attempt to remain above the political fray has profound political implications. \"Using simple messages to prompt individual action is the key to the Ad Council's public service model,\" writes Melillo, yet critics charge that placing such an emphasis on individual initiative tends to reduce environmental concerns to cleaning up litter rather than putting pressure on corporations that produce so much more packaging than is necessary and otherwise pollute far more than individual litterbugs. Similarly, Smokey's message that \"only you can prevent forest fires\" oversimplifies the often complex relationships of various constituencies for forest use and the role of fire in conservation. \"The organization has a tremendous responsibility to disparate constituencies: the client, the public, the ad industry, and the media companies that run public service ads free of charge,\" writes the author. \"Balancing the needs and interests of these groups in a way that is equitable to all involved is not always possible. That means that some campaign goals, despite good intentions, may not always serve the public's best interests.\" Maintaining a balance generally free of polemics, Melillo shows that the campaigns have done a lot of good but have also generated more controversy than readers might have suspected.\"... the first book-length study of the council's work and impact, it shows the Ad Council's significant role in shaping popular attitudes on some of the most important issues of our time.\" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\"For anyone interested in the compelling elements of American advertising history and the nature of social messaging, Melillo's insightful and eye-opening book is a must-read.\" Fern Siegel,Huffington Post", "related": [], "rank": 1392409, "title": "How McGruff and the Crying Indian Changed America: A History of Iconic Ad Council Campaigns", "author": "Wendy Melillo", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book functions as a \"curriculum generator,\" inspiring skills in critical thinking, conceptualizing, and analysis. It rejects memory-based curricula and disparages literary study based on \"what you knew rather than what you could do with what you knew.\" Regarding Shakespeare, the authors argue that adaptation becomes less textual and more a vehicle to change behavior and add \"flexibility in perspective,\" resulting in collaboration, feedback, and reflection. Borrowing ideas from cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner, they suggest that new transmedial adaptations arise from the selection and transformation of material, and the result is an axiomatic shift that privileges process over content.

He is currently focused on his transition into becoming a bestselling author under the banner of Worldhaven Agenda. Indulging in a thug's life, as a former drug dealer, weapons trafficker, and convicted felon, he realized that he could no longer follow the footsteps of deception. He soon found a better path to tread in the literary world. No stranger to adversity, Hood welcomes the challenges of establishing a successful empire, earning an honest living for his family, and entertaining the world one book at a time! Categorized as a menace to society by the Atlanta police department, Hood became imprisoned as a child for the offense of murder. What appeared to be a curse eventually became his precious gift. As time passed, maturity developed and a new purpose in life was born. Realizing his talent for the art of storytelling combined with the graphic experiences of a hustler's ambition, Hood quickly took notice of his way out of the Trap. Dedicated to mentoring the youth, rectifying his past, and affording other aspiring authors the opportunities to maximize their potential, Hood Chronicles is more determined to succeed than ever! As a message to his fans and those soon to awaken to his movement, Hood says, “Thank you for your support and with my introduction . . .

Jasper Deeter's contributions as Hedgerow Theatre founder, stage director and acting teacher are wide-spread and profound. His determination to wed quality theatre to the land itself is inspirational and strikingly contemporary, suggesting how excellence and innovation in theatre corresponded fundamentally to twentieth-century grassroots America. Thanks to Barry B. Witham's sparkling study we now know how and why that was so. Bravo!\" - Stuart J. Hecht, Department of Theatre, Boston College, USA\"Witham's rescue of a vital but neglected experiment in American theatre not only traces Jasper Deeter's concept for a 'sustainable theatre' through that director's three decades with the legendary Hedgerow, but it also sheds new light on theatre artists like Susan Glaspell and Hallie Flanagan whose careers were surprisingly impacted by the work there. The blending of narrative history with significant productions makes this an essential contribution to American cultural studies.\" - Felicia Hardison LondrÃ©, Curators' Professor of Theatre, University of Missouri-Kansas City, USA, Dean, College of Fellows of the American Theatre\"With characteristic thoroughness, insight, and clarity, Barry B. Witham leads readers through the history of one of the United States' most fascinating and yet comparatively unexplored experiments in theatre-making. Following thirty years of the legendary Hedgerow Theatre, Witham traces the work of its founder, Jasper Deeter, an artist committed to developing a 'living library' of American drama. Witham argues persuasively for the impact that Deeter and his compatriots had on the development of American drama, examining the company's influence on the careers of iconic figures including Morris Carnovsky and Eugene O'Neill\" - Heather S.

He is the youngest of four children. His father worked as a wagon maker on the railways and his mother, a housewife. He grew up in a loving and supportive family and, at an early age, was encouraged to go to Sunday school and then join the Boys Brigade, which he continued to be a member of until his midforties. He left school at sixteen and first worked for a London stockbroker as a junior clerk and then joined a City financial group where he eventually qualified as a company secretary. He next worked for IBM as a systems analyst in order to \"find out\" about computers and stayed with them doing a whole range of challenging and absorbing jobs for twenty years. He then went back to being a company secretary in 1991 when Lexmark International (a computer printer manufacturer) was created out of a small part of IBM's business and worked happily in that role until he retired in 2001. He married Elizabeth in 1969, and they have now celebrated over forty years of wedded bliss together and have three sons, all of whom are married and have children. Their love affair with Australia and New Zealand started in 1996 when they first visited both the North and South Islands of New Zealand and enjoyed themselves so much that they have returned there many times since. When they retired in 2001, they started to spend the British winters in Western Australia to avoid the cold and damp and return each year to enjoy the Mediterranean lifestyle. Lucidus first started writing in 2005 on the premise that \"everyone has a book in them\" and really enjoyed all the research he did for the first book, Blossom in Winter-Frost in Spring, which was eventually published in 2010. His second and third books, which were first a prequel and then a sequel to the first book, were published in 2011 and 2012; and his fourth book, The Red Rabbit Inquiry Agency, like", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There are a lot of anthologies out there dealing with superheroes, but this is the best one\"Comic Book Therapy“Editor Lalumière has put together an impressive best-of anthology for modern superhero fiction, with works from SF royalty like George R. R. Martin and Kelly Link, hit comics creators Kurt Busiek and Mike Mignola, and wonderful but lesser-known writers. The satisfying and varied stories range from J. Robert Lennon’s deeply sad “The Rememberer,” about a super-powered storyteller. who can never forget, to Benjamin Rosenbaum’s brilliant and lighthearted “The Deathtrap of Dr. Nefario,” in which a familiar crime-fighter calls his therapist from a routine death trap. Also of note are Paul Di Filippo’s “The Jackdaw’s Last Case,” starring Franz Kafka as a superhero, and Busiek’s hilariously cynical “Clash of Titans (A New York Romance),” about a marketing man encouraging the rivalry between a superhero and his villainous ex-girlfriend to increase tourism. There are a few missteps: Gene Wolfe’s “The Detective of Dreams” is out of place, and Rachel Pollack’s Wonder Woman-inspired “Burning Sky” detours so far into sexual fantasy that it entirely loses the plot. Even so this is by far the best superhero anthology around, and a must-read for comic book fans.”—Publishers Weekly, starred review“Super Stories of Heroes & Villainsis a fantastically presented anthology full of great stories. There are a lot of anthologies out there dealing with superheroes, but this is the best one I’ve run across. From pulp to steampunk, all the bases are covered. There’s a lot to love here.”—Comic Book Therapy“Super Stories of Heroes & Villainsis filled with smart, imaginative, inspired stories taking place in a variety of versions of the superhero genre.”—Fanboy Comics“Not only are the stories fine in their own right, but they will provide a certain illumination you can take back with you when you’ve returned to the 8-paneled page.”—Nexus Graphica“If the capes-and-cowls genre ever hopes to find a foothold in the mainstream, it desperately needs a champion, and we think Lalumière would be a great nominee for the position.”—Super Hero Novels“Super Stories of Heroes & Villainswas one helluva ride to read! From origin stories, romance gone wrong, to aliens from outer space and lets not forget philandering ‘heroes’ – there is a little bit of something of everything to turn your head.... Hats off to the editor for compiling a really great collection that any fiction fan would greatly enjoy!”—My Shelf Confessions", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When an opportunity opened for him to get involved with a new, emerging technology, he decided that the risk was reasonable and quickly advanced along with the industry. As a computer systems specialist and operations research analyst, he received the highest award that is given by a federal government agency, a gold medal for outstanding performance. During his career, he has traveled extensively throughout the European communities, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, Northern Africa, Middle East, South America, and several Asian countries, including Korea, Japan, and the Republic of China. He has worked directly with the highest levels of government and commercial organizations, implementing computer systems designed to make life easier and more manageable for everyone. He has served the communities where he has lived as a volunteer for the Boy Scouts of America programs, editor of technical magazines, and president of the computer professional society. For the past fifteen years, he has served as an elected member of the board of directors and treasurer for a large vacation beach resort. At the request of several members of his immediate family, the author decided to share some of his experiences to show how a person can have fun while advancing through life and overcome adversity by keeping an open mind and maintaining a positive attitude.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Most publishers are afraid\n to publicly announce and discuss their negative reviews, but since I\nstand behind my product and believe in its quality I will walk you\nthrough the negative reviews and together we shall see what they have to\n say. This list will be updated daily with the usernames of those\n''negative reviewers'', their motives to do that and parts of the book\nthat prove them wrong.The first reviewer to fall in this category is  J, L.Yu (arrow2fast)Arrow2fast goes a bit more personal and mostly tries to offend me. She claims she read only the first chapter of Money Flow and then returned it for a refund, because it was poorly edited. The funny thing about that is that THE ENTIRE first chapter is available for free if you use the Amazon ''Look Inside'' option, so Arrow2fast, why did you buy my book if you didn't like the first chapter in the first place? So please use the Look Inside option, check the first chapter and if it's that poorly written as Arrow2fast claims just don't buy the book.But she doesn't stop there. Arrow2fast claims that all my reviews are fake, because they were not Amazon verified. To clear up the record, Arrow2fast, I've been selling paperbacks in a local sea resort all summer, both on a stand and inside hotels through their receptionists. And when the summer season was over I published my books online on October 1st. So I had  a big fanbase before I even joined Amazon and people have been reading my books long before they were even published here.Arrow2fast also claims my characters were stupid adolescents. Well, Money Flow is designed as ''stream of consciousness''. The main character is a teenager and you see the world through his eyes. And most of the older audience do not like to hear the rants of younger people(mostly rebels) and are not interested to dive deep in their psychology, so I'm guessing Arrow2fast is an old person, who insults modern world teenagers on a regular basis.Next thing Arrow2fast claims is that I ''identify myself with the main character'' since I named him after myself.. Come on now.. Really? Do you really think I identify myself as a drug & money addicted criminal?By the way, the funny thing about this review is that by the time I posted this personal analysys, 0 of 50 people had already found her review ''not helpful''.", "related": ["B00GX6Q1XK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 63, "rating_average": 4.9048, "rating_total": 309.0}

Without knowing that their paths will cross again, they spend the next day together. At Sydney's insistence, they promise to tell \"no true stories,\" for Sydney wants the day to be an escape. Before it begins, Ben discovers her identity but withholds this from her. What follows is one wrong turn after another for two outsiders faced with an unwelcoming environment. Along the way, they encounter a string of obstacles, some they expect given the nature of the game they must play, some that take them by surprise, and some of their own making.         Boundaries,Jim Steinberg's debut novel, is a story of love and law, betrayal and redemption, overcoming the past, crossing professional boundaries and pushing past personal ones, facing consequences, and getting help from unexpected sources. Jim's short stories have appeared in Clapboard House, The Greensboro Review, The New Renaissance, Sensations Magazine, Cities and Roads, The Lone Wolf Review, The Bishop's House Review, Voices From Home - A North Carolina Prose Anthology, and Best Of Clapboard House.

Much of her camping has also included lessons on foraging and survival tactics, as well as learning about native flora in a variety of locations and climates. Over the years, she has accompanied many novices into the more natural world, sometimes in campgrounds and sometimes in remote locations.  So far, everyone who has ever ventured into the wilds with her has returned home, none the worse for wear. As a parent, she has experienced some terrifying moments when a child has seemed to vanish into thin air, fallen into water, or come into contact with a sick wild animal.  She has also experienced being a single parent taking her children camping, including the hair raising experience of going to the bathroom during a thunderstorm, only to hear her children’s screams of terror when a family of raccoons came calling in search  of a refuge from the storm.  She has survived the experiences, just as her own mother survived shrieks of terror and the occasional incident involving copious amounts of blood. Today, Gia is a grandmother and lives in Mississippi in a funny little house surrounded by gnarly old live oak trees.
