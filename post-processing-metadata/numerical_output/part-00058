TheMeditationsof Marcus Aurelius, translated and introduced by Gregory Hays, by that standard, is very worthwhile, indeed. Hays suggests that its most recent incarnation--as a self-help book--is not only valid, but may be close to the author's intent. The book, which Hays calls, fondly, a \"haphazard set of notes,\" is indicative of the role of philosophy among the ancients in that it is \"expected to provide a 'design for living.'\" And it does, both aphoristically (\"Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly.\") and rhetorically (\"What is it in ourselves that we should prize?\"). Whether these, and other entries (\"Enough of this wretched, whining monkey life.\") sound life-changing or like entries in a teenager's diary is up to the individual reader, as it should be. Hays's introduction, which sketches the life of Marcus Aurelius (emperor of Rome A.D. 161-180) as well as the basic tenets of stoicism, is accessible and jaunty.--H.

But overall, Collins's wonderfully illuminating, engrossing analysis illustrates, through the century there was a move toward endorsing increasingly exuberant expansion. Looking at history through the lens of economic growth, Collins puts postwar American society in a whole new perspective. A professor of history at the University of Missouri-Columbia, Collins tells the story of American economic growth as it waxed and waned and waxed again from the New Deal through the Clinton administration. Early on, he argues, many Americans questioned whether growth was possible or even desirable in a mature capitalist economy. WWII, however, set the country's economic engine in motion, and after WWII, \"growthmanship\" gained speed, reaching an apex in Kennedy and Johnson's \"growth liberalism.\" Economic expansion backslid between 1973 and 1985, as heavy government investment in Vietnam and the Great Society programs led to rapid inflation; price stability took priority. Nixon's \"progressive conservativism\" unsuccessfully tried to rekindle enthusiasm for robust economic growth by linking it to streamlined government and the moral rejuvenation of America. In the mid-1980s, Reagan's supply-side tactics succeeded in stealing the growth issue from the Democrats, repackaging it and recasting the GOP as the party of economic growth. Only then did Americans seemingly overcome their ambivalence about abundance. More recently, Clinton's eclectic and pragmatic approach to sustaining growth has put limits on it. Brilliantly original, this study demonstrates how different groups--from liberals to Cold Warriors--used economic growth to further their own ends, sometimes with disastrous or unforeseen consequences.

Stranded on a lonely road in rural Idaho, he heads east, on foot, as random snippets of memory wander in and out of his mind. Too traumatized to speak, his silence is misinterpreted by the succession of characters he meets on the odyssey home to Rhode Island. Stumbling upon a Wiccan meeting in a forest, he is taken in by one of the chatty young women and takes a job as a dishwasher in a local diner, where he is treated as deaf. Weeks later, he hitchhikes with a trucker and finds backbreaking work in Colorado fields with Mexican migrant farmers. He struggles to survive as he devours a frozen pizza found in a taxidermist's cabin, sleeps in a Dumpster, crashes a picnic, and steals a car. The adventures intertwine with thoughts about his girlfriend, locker-room antics, his parents, their bookstore, and his autistic cousin–spontaneously, as if his mind has short-circuited from the crash. Adam, though still mute, arrives home emotionally ready to accept his parents' death.

He'd heard those exact words way too many times during the course of his law-enforcement career.And denial was the fallback in every situation for most suspects.Even suspects as lovely as Megan McClain.Upscale all the way in her well-fitting, short-sleeved red dress and intricately patterned black pumps. Not exactly attire suited for the December snowstorm raging outside. She probably had a change of clothes stashed for the trek home—a planner.Paul gauged her height at five feet five without the two-inch heels. She was about a hundred and ten pounds of slopes and angles. Raven-black hair fell past her shoulders, and her vivid blue eyes, the pupils dilated slightly, were set symmetrically within her pale, heart-shaped face.The rapid beat of her heart was evident at the carotid pulse point on her graceful neck. Was she experiencing shock or remorse?Paul glanced around, quickly assessing and cataloging the crime scene. Beyond the faintest trace of spent gunpowder and the coppery odor of blood, he detected a citruslike scent. On the yellow walls of the room they stood in, painted works of art were hung, and little display lights threw a glow on the framed pieces, creating a half circle of light on the floor beneath the bodies.He noted that across the top threshold of each doorway, leading to other rooms full of artwork, a black seam hid a gate that would drop down if the security system was activated. Those gates were up. No alarm had been sounded. High in the corner of the room was a security monitor.Pulling his focus back to Ms. McClain, he shrugged out of his overcoat and laid it across the crook of one arm.\"Did you hear me, Detective…?\" she demanded, all spitfire and ready to explode. \"Why would I call 911 if I'd killed them?\"Paul ignored her question as irrelevant, because too often the perpetrator of a crime was also the one to call 911 in an attempt to deflect the police from looking too closely at themselves. He would consider Megan McClain a suspect/potential witness, until he knew more.\"Detective Wallace,\" he supplied, and flipped open his notebook to reread what he'd already learned from the responding officer. \"You were read your Miranda rights. Do you fully understand these rights?\"She waved an impatient hand. \"Yes, of course.\"\"Good. So you were working here alone. Is that correct?\"\"Yes. I mean no. I thought my boss was upstairs. I already went through all this with the other officer,\" she huffed, and pushed a lock of hair back behind her ear to reveal sparkling stones. \"And then again with those other people who practically strip-searched me.\" A shudder rippled over her.The CSI team had performed a routine exam of her person for trace evidence, checking her hands for gunpowder residue, taking any out-of-place fibers off her clothing and looking for blood droplets that would match the victims. The team had done their job.Now it was his turn. Interviewing the suspects and witnesses was a vital aspect of any investigation, especially done as closely to the crime as possible while the person's memory was fresh and they hadn't had time to embellish or minimize any details.\"I understand that, ma'am. Nevertheless, I need you to go through it again with me,\" Paul explained.He'd look for inconsistencies in her account of the events and for ways to dig deeper and sift truth from lies.She blinked her long lashes. \"Fine. My assistant had an appointment, so she'd left early. I was alone in the workroom preparing the Wahlberer painting for transport when Mr. Drake—\" She gestured to one of the two dead men lying on the floor to the right.Ms. McClain seemed momentarily frozen as she stared at the dark-haired man sprawled on the shining cherrywood floor. A pair of long-handled sheers protruded from the man's gut, and blood spilled out to stain the floor a deep crimson. The click and flash of the CSI tech's camera documenting the death echoed in the room along with the hushed whispers of those working the scene.A stabbing indicated a crime of passion.\"Mr. Drake came in…\" Paul prompted, wondering if there was enough fire in her blood to make her commit murder.She turned sharply back to him, visibly refocus-ing, her breathing a bit irregular. \"Mr. Drake arrived early. He wasn't due for another fifteen minutes. I wasn't ready. I asked him to wait in the red room.\"Paul arched an eyebrow. \"The red room?\"She made a sweeping gesture with one elegant hand toward the doorways. \"The different art collections are housed in separate rooms. Each room is color-coded.\"\"I see. So Mr. Drake went into the red room.\"\"No.\" She pointed to the other vic lying a few feet away. \"He—Mr. Vanderpool—stormed in even before Mr. Drake had taken five steps.\"Vanderpool was as Nordic as they came with his white-blond hair and large features. His wounds were consistent with a gunshot wound. But they wouldn't know for certain until the medical examiner did the autopsy.\"You say he stormed in? Why do you say it like that?\" Paul watched her closely, gauging her response.Would her gaze dart upward and to the right, searching for a fabrication, or would her eyes go up and to the left, recalling events and words of description?She stared straight at him with those eerily blue, sharply intelligent eyes, no shifting, no blinking. \"Mr. Vanderpool and Mr. Drake both wanted the Wahlberer painting. At the auction last night both men created quite a stir when they tried to outbid each other. Mr. Vanderpool stormed in claiming the painting was supposed to be his.\"She gave a look that spoke volumes of how dumbfounded she was by the men's behavior. \"I thought it strange that either would find the painting that valuable since Wahlberer is so new to the art world.\" She gave a delicate shrug of her slim shoulders. \"People who are passionate about art are an eclectic breed.\"Paul wouldn't know since he wasn't much interested in art. His focus was on contributing to society by getting the job done and putting away the bad guys. \"And where is this Wahlberer now?\"The painting had not been found in the workroom as she'd claimed it should be.Her mouth pressed into a thin line. \"I don't know.I last saw it in the workroom on the table, wrapped in brown packaging. I hadn't yet put the string across to secure it before I was interrupted.\"\"By Mr. Drake?\"\"Yes. By Mr. Drake.\" Frustration clearly marked her words.\"What was your relationship with Mr. Drake?\"She stared at him aghast. \"There was no relationship. He bought art through the gallery. That's it.\"Her denial rang true. \"How much is the painting worth?\"\"Mr. Drake bought the painting for a hundred thousand dollars.\"Ah. Motivation enough for someone to kill and steal. Even an art curator. He made a note to check into Megan's finances. \"Who knew that Mr. Drake was coming to pick up the painting?\"\"The staff. But none of them would do this,\" she protested, her lip quivering.That remained to be seen. \"You left the painting on the table.\"\"Yes.\"He noticed she didn't fidget or hedge.When she remained silent he pressed, \"And then?\"\"I went to find my boss, Lester Sinclair. I thought he was in his office upstairs. But he wasn't.\"\"Did you knock or just go in?\" He'd have the CSI team check out the second floor and hall for any trace evidence.She folded her hands together in front of her. He noted her nails were short and her skin red and dry. As if she'd scrubbed at them. Possibly washing away blood? He made a note of his observation on his notepad.\"I knocked first and then I went in. His office was empty,\" she stated, her voice curiously flat.\"Is there a back way from the offices upstairs to the gallery floor?\"Two little lines appeared between her black arched eyebrows. \"Yes. There's another staircase that leads to the back of the gallery, near the restrooms.\" Horror filled her expression. \"But you can't think Mr. Sinclair could have done this. He's nearly seventy years old. Why would he commit such a heinous crime?\" She tugged her bottom lip between her white, straight teeth.He arched his eyebrow. \"If you're sure he wasn't in the building, then why'd you go looking for him?\"\"I didn't know he wasn't in the building at the time,\" she replied, her eyes widening, expressing her agitation. \"Only now I know.\"\"And you didn't hear anything?\"\"I heard the gunshots.\" She blinked rapidly as if to hold back tears. \"I ran back downstairs and found them. My scissors were in Mr. Drake's stomach.\" She shuddered.Practiced at not being moved by displays of emotion, he consulted his notes again. \"Gunshots? As in more than one?\"She nodded with certainty. \"Yes. Two.\"He made a note to tell the crime-scene techs to look for a stray bullet since they had only one GSW. \"And your assistant, Lacy Knight, had an appointment. Where?\"She shook her head; her dark hair swayed slightly. \"I don't know. I don't keep tabs on her or the other employees.\"\"How many employees were here today and when did they leave?\" he probed.Without hesitation, she answered, \"Joanie, the receptionist, left at five as always. Donny and George are the daytime security guards. They both left at six.\"The call came in to 911 at five minutes to seven. \"There was no night-shift guard?\"\"Usually there is.\" She frowned, her pert little nose crinkling slightly. \"But Mack didn't show. Lacy said he called in sick. Mr. Sinclair was going to get a temp from the security company we use but I didn't hear what happened with that.\"\"We'll need the names and numbers for all the employees.\"\"You'll have to talk to Mr. Sinclair,\" she stated as her gaze fixated on the men from the coroner's office as they began to remove the two bodies from the gallery floor.Paul positioned himself in her line of vision. He wanted to keep her focused. \"Is there an exit through the workroom to the o...", "related": ["B000SEFBLG"], "rank": 918521, "title": "Double Threat Christmas (The McClains)", "author": "Terri Reed", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But this lively and entertaining western-filled with gun smoke, hot lead and accurate historical action-shows how wrong they were. Spur Award-winner Boggs tells this exciting tale using the first person narrative of 24 historic characters, including Frank and Jesse James; the Younger brothers; Bill Chadwell (aka Bill Stiles), who claimed the Northfield raid was his idea; Anselm R. Manning, who plugs an outlaw early in the battle; and plenty of others. Though the robbery netted just $26.40, the wild gunfight left bullet-riddled bodies and puddles of blood all over town. Add in the prostitute who knew too much, the grave-robbing medical student and the farmer who just wanted to shoot an outlaw, and Boggs (The Hart Brand; etc.) has created a vibrant retelling of the Old West's most notorious and deadly bank robbery flop.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She details the girl's life before her family went into hiding and places Anne in context with other persecuted children and their attempts to survive. With chapter heads that quote from Anne's diary and 19 archival photos, the text reveals a girl who loved her friends, celebrating birthdays, and being the center of attention. Lee succeeds at illuminating the lives of individuals who once had hopes and dreams…like us, including those who tried to help, those who resisted, and ultimately those who perished. The inevitable question of why it happened is addressed in a quote from a former neighbor of the Franks, …we were so scared. We thought, if we do the things that are demanded of us, we'll be all right….We thought, if we wear the star, if we obey the curfew, if wedoeverything, nothing will happen to us. This type of information considers the questions that readers ask as they learn about the period, making it a worthy title to include in a study of Anne Frank and the Holocaust.–Janet S.

Well, a drug. In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration approved Humatrope, a synthetic human growth hormone, for treating healthy children who were merely small. The hormone had long been approved for use in people with a hormone deficiency, but this was a much broader approval than ever before. I thought it sent a bad message to parents and to kids: being short is a problem, a condition that ought to be fixed. I wrote an essay on the topic for theNew York Times“Week in Review” section. That little essay got a lot of attention. I heard from plenty of people who loved the piece. And I thought maybe I should write a book—not for the grown-ups, but for the kids who might be feeling some of the pressures of growing up small.Q:Can you tell us anything about the personal nature of the topic?Schwartz:You're so diplomatic! I'm short. When the FDA approved Humatrope, it was for any boy who was likely to be less than five feet, three inches tall as an adult. Well, I'm five foot three, and now the government was calling me, officially, short. Short enough to need help! I wasn't too happy about it when I was a kid. I grew up in Texas, and a lot of the kids around me were huge. Huge. But I didn't think I was deformed.Q:Were there any moments in your history that were particularly frustrating, and/or inspirational, about dealing with height stereotypes?Schwartz:When you're little, everybody's a comedian. In the school playground and the hallways, I heard a lot of jokes and put-downs. \"Short Schwartz,\" which almost rhymed, was considered the height of cleverness, and I heard it a lot. Even as a grown-up, when people hear I'm from Texas, many say, \"But I thought everything was bigger…\" You know, that gets old. But I can't really call this a huge burden. This is really what I'm trying to tell the kids: if this is your biggest problem, you're one lucky guy.Q:As a science writer forThe New York Times, you see and assess studies and statistics all the time. How did that help you in examining some of the cultural stereotypes surrounding height?Schwartz:All reporters are supposed to be skeptical. As the old newsroom cliché goes, \"If your mother tells you she loves you, check it out.\" Becoming a science reporter gave me a toolkit that helped me to be skeptical in a whole new way: to check out studies that seemed to say one thing and to find the biases and flaws in the design of the study that mean that they actually didn't say that at all. It also taught me that science can be abused, whether in the name of marketing or for political gain. So as I approached the scientific evidence in studies that height might be more than a childhood annoyance for short people, but that it might be setting them up for failure later in life—well, the toolbox came in very handy.Q:Can you think of a few shorter-than-“normal” people who inspired you growing up or inspire you now?Schwartz:When I was a kid, I was tickled to learn that the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin, was only five feet, two inches tall. (The Vostok cockpit was cramped, and the Soviets chose small cosmonauts.) I loved hearing successful short people joke about their height. One of our United States senators from Texas, John Tower was under five feet six. \"My name is John Tower,\" he'd say, \"but I don't.\"  It all helped me to understand that you could be depressed or angry about being little, but the folks who succeeded found a way to laugh about it—and to disarm others by getting them to laugh, too. It's kind of like having a posse, this brotherhood of smallish people. I smile when I see George Stephanopoulos on television, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg leading New York City. Being on the small side didn't hold them back. It hasn't held me back, either. And it won't hold back the kids who readShort.Q:What did you learn in the course of researching the book that might most surprise people?Schwartz:The big surprise was how quickly the supposed evidence that there are big problems with being short fell apart. I figured that I would be giving my readers an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand discussion of the disadvantages of being short. But in fact, beyond having trouble reaching the high shelf, I didn't find any studies that really supported the idea that being short was a disadvantage—even those much-publicized studies that seem to say small people earn less than taller folks. Beyond that, I knew that science can be manipulated and misused, but even I was surprised to see how far people stretched it. I spoke with David Sandberg, a researcher whose groundbreaking work showed that the overwhelming majority of short kids actually cope pretty well with being small. His studies showed that their height doesn't cause them deep psychological stress, and in fact he found that other kids did not see them in a demeaning way. One of his studies, which I describe in the book, is really cleverly designed, and involves asking schoolchildren to cast each other in a play. It's a head fake -- he really used the process to explore the kids' attitudes toward each other. Sandberg was startled to find that his work was being cited to the FDA to support the notion that small kids do have big problems!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Engaging the ethical in Heidegger’s thought in relation to Aristotle, Michel Foucault, and Friedrich Hölderlin, William McNeill examines the way in which Heidegger’s thought shifts our understanding of ethics away from a set of theoretically constructed norms, principles, or rules governing practice toward an understanding of the ethical as our concrete way of Being in the world.Central to this study is the consideration of the ethical in relation to time: the time of biological life, the time of human life as biographical and historical, the temporality of human action, and the historicality of human thought. In addition, this book critically examines the predicament of ethical responsibility in a scientific-technological era, considering how the world of modern science and technology call upon us to rethink the nature of ethical responsibilities.\"McNeill’s scholarship on Heidegger is excellent, and he writes clearly and with great lucidity and insight on thoughts and questions that are quite difficult to articulate.\" — Daniela Vallega-Neu, author ofThe Bodily Dimension in Thinking\"McNeill’s knack for explicating the kernel of Heidegger’s often-thorny argumentation is on full display throughout the book, and his ability to render the difficulty posed by Heidegger’s dense thinking into the most cogent expression is most remarkable.\" — Jeffrey L.

Dennis Jr. was a child of the turbulent 60’s raised during the height of the Civil Rights Movement. The son of a convicted drug kingpen, he has served time in several maximum security prisons in the Florida D.O.C. It was there that he discovered his knack for writing the stories about the life he has lived. Always an avid reader and writer of poems, while serving 25 years for armed robbery he penned his first manuscript in what would be called \"The Kane Family Saga Series\". A collection of novels that span over 100 years and tell the tale of one family’s rise from the scourge of slavery to prominence in both the legitimate business world as well as the underworld. He hopes to bring a new and fresh perspective to the literary world. One that is truly based on the things seen and experienced; that’s why he hopes to introduce to the world \"Faction\", a combination of fact and fiction.  While serving time he met a young man named Ausha Rogers and they became close as brothers. While both were on disciplinary confinement there was a shake down and a book that Bobby was reading was confiscated. At that time the policy in the Florida D.O.C was that you could only have reading materials of religious nature. Angered by the policy and bored, Bobby decided to write his own book. After 4 weeks the manuscript for what would later be called \"Redemption\" was finished. By various methods Bobby sent the manuscript to Ausha who read it and said, “This is it Bro!” It was then that the dream for Hoodwrittens Publishing was born. Ausha was released first and Hoodwrittens was no longer a dream, he made it a reality.", "related": ["B00GM4N3MU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 3.7143, "rating_total": 26.0}

She certainly has not been out of the public eye   her celebrated marriage, divorce, motherhood, etc., have kept the gossip wags busy.  Also in the audience was Paris Hilton, another familiar face with an equally celebrated story.  Spears  performance was not her best, to say the least.  Media reaction was fast and furious.I was reminded that Americas youth these days have some very odd role models.  Young men think they have to become sexual, cigarette smoking thugs; young women feel they need to be thin as reeds and morally loose.  I m not the first person to say that young people need better role models.Is this a modern phenomenon?  I am not sure.  I think each generation has had its regrettable standards and examples, and that young people are in need of better role models.  Parents are challenged, churches fret, but little seems to be done about it.  My youth was spent in the crazy sixties.  Our role models were rock stars and pot-smoking hippies.Bradshaw s book presents a different view of young people, one that is more positive and hopeful.  The young people who inhabit this brief selection of short stories are, in the end, ordinary kids, some living in the British Isles, but all facing the everyday challenges that young people face during those tempestuous early years.  One theme that arises from these stories is the importance of family, and the possibility of triumph over even the most challenging obstacles.Can LDS young people live victorious lives in these challenging times?  Bradshaw believes they can, and her stories reflect the kind of optimism that these young men and women desperately need.Bradshaw is very good at presenting ordinary people in ordinary situations, who call upon extraordinary powers of faith and goodness to help them make sense of the world around them.  The stories in this book do not plumb the depths of spirituality, nor do they challenge the reader to work through complex plot lines and multi-layered characters.  Instead, these are stories of the folks next door, of the kids who sit next to you in Sunday School, of, perhaps, your own children.Please, No Zits will be enjoyed by young people anxious for a good story, and by parents who will find themselves reading these stories to their children.  I can envision some interesting conversations, opportunities for young people and their parents to discuss the things that really matter   those things that will last into eternity.  Parents and children do need to talk with each other more often, and these stories can be an exciting way to engage your children in ways that will stay with them forever.Jeffrey Needle. --Association for Mormon LettersI recently had the pleasure of reading a book of short stories by LDS author, Anne Bradshaw. Her newest book, entitled Please, No Zits offers quick reading for every taste. There s romance, adventure, introspection, and humor. But, for me, the best part of her book was the glimpse it gave me into life on the other side of the pond.Anne Bradshaw was born and raised in England. She moved to the United States a decade ago and brings with her a love and feel for the British Isles. Included in her book is a map of the British Isles. The towns and cities mentioned in her book are marked on the map so readers can identify their location. She has also included a glossary of terms. I did not need the glossary except for one word, eeejit. Of course, all of you who do know what the word eeejit means are probably laughing because I have just shown that I am one!I did not read the book in order. That s the nice thing about these books. You can bounce around according to your mood.The first story I read was the one Anne talked about the most, Rock Bottom in a Jail Cell . . .  The longest story in the book deals with a teenager having to face the consequences of his wrong choices and the difficulty he has in opening his heart to the Spirit. It was a story influenced by personal experiences of the author s friend whose son did make it back and now lectures on drug abuse and recoveryI felt the angst of recently returned Elder Kalan Ballantyne in the story Advertised on Her Face. He struggles with what to do when he comes home to find his girlfriend is engaged to someone much less worthy and notices the visible effects it has on her. Anne did a terrific job of drawing me into Kalan's thoughts.But not all the stories are so serious. A cute idea for asking someone out on a date is shared in Darkness at Noonday I smiled at the humorous way of asking a fellow seminary student out on a date . . .But my favorite short story was Mountain Nearing. Feeling awkward in a not-so-voluntary service project, the young hero Aaron Veasey, learns personal lessons and grows in maturity. By the end, the story brought a tear to my eye and, again, I wondered how much was fiction and how much was from personal experience.Anne writes for teens by writing about teens. She listens to their concerns: be it dating, appearance or feelings of eternity, and then writes a story she hopes will help them understand their divine worth and ability to live righteously despite the pressures of the world.One thing I appreciated in Anne s book was that so many of her stories were about young men. In fact, my own teenage son has been reading the book in bits and pieces, too. It s not so romantic and mushy that he can t enjoy it. I appreciate that Anne s heroes are not wimps. Some make mistakes and struggle with the consequences. Others struggle when they view the choices made by people they love. Many of her heroes are missionaries and, by creating stories with mature missionaries and returned missionaries, my son is able to stay focused on his own not-too-distant goal. Anne openly shows the struggle of making the decision to serve and the later blessings in  Beyond the Thorns . The trials of coming home were expressed in more than one story and even a girlfriend falling in love with a gifted pianist while her beau is serving a mission is shared in Slicing Rainbows.I liked the fact that the stories in the book were short . . . Easy to pick it up and read from anyplace  . . . Though some of the stories are set in the United States, most find a comfortable locale in the cities and countryside of the British Isles. I truly enjoyed the dialogue, cultural insight and language cadence from the various locations . . .  It was like going on a mini-vacation without the expensive airfare. How fun and refreshing.Terri Lynn Adams --BellaOnline LDS FamiliesRecently I read Anne Bradshaw's latest release: Please, No Zits, a collection of short stories. The stories are about LDS youth and the many challenges they face. I enjoyed each story, from fifteen-year-old Gabe participating in a Primary Nativity much to his chagrin, to Cody who faces the consequences of cheating, to Kimberly who finds a useful way to spend her time while waiting for a missionary.Unique to these stories is the setting. They take place all over the world: Scotland, England, Utah, Connecticut, Ireland, etc. The author has a great writing style (being from England herself) and has a talent for developing characters that draw you in immediately.Without being preachy or hitting you over the head with moral advice, Please, No Zits is a great read for teens and adults alike. The stories are inspiring and true to life. I love the frank way that the author approaches difficult topics like a non-member boyfriend, a non-supportive father, and coming back from drug-addition. You ll find lots of humor, some sadness, and plenty of inspiration.Heather B.

In Millie Blue's prior books, \"A Simple Peace\" and \"A Welcome Peace,\" the stories have taken place in the fictitious, but very familiar, town of Newton, Colorado. In this book, \"A Peace in the Making,\" she takes us in and around Rocky Mountain National Park where we embark on a new journey with new characters.  The main character, Molly Sutton, is beginning her career as a National Park Ranger. While her future looks bright, her past is dragging her down. Her boss, Chief Drake Johnson, recognizes the signs as he battles ghosts of his own past. He realizes Molly is hiding something and is determined to get to the bottom of it. It is here where Millie Blue's readers will recognize an old friend or two from the previous books.  Millie weaves the characters and locations together to create a wonderfully, entertaining read. She has a way of making the reader feel a part of the story. As the reader, you will learn about faith, loss and love. But, maybe and, perhaps, most importantly, you will just enjoy breathing in the mountain air and taking in the scenery along the way.   The author writes under the pen name of Millie Blue. While she doesn't reside in Colorado, she hopes she will one day soon. She and her husband have a chocolate Labrador Retriever. Cooper is the inspiration of the dogs in each of her books. The three of them have spent many summers hiking and enjoying the beauty of the mountains, rivers and streams in the beautiful state of Colorado.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Born in New Orleans in 1901, Armstrong grew up in an area known as “the battlefield,” where he and his family earned their living in rough ways—prostitution and gambling among them. Music was his salvation. Armstrong was exposed to “spasm bands” and the evolution of ragtime to the blues to jazz, though his repertoire was considerably wider. Stricklin explores the social and economic forces that helped make jazz popular and Armstrong’s exuberant labor and innovation, which nurtured it. He tracks Armstrong through Prohibition, the Depression, both world wars, and the civil rights movements, as well as his marriages and associations with famed musicians. He recalls Armstrong’s career with bands, records, films, and travel abroad as musician and later goodwill ambassador, until the outrageous resistance to school desegregation angered him. In final chapters, Stricklin analyzes Armstrong’s musical legacy and details his recordings within the broader context of American music. --Vanessa Bush", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Estranged from his father, Quinn returns to claim the abandoned Sayerne after his father's death.  This is his legacy, what he has waited for.  Sayerne is his at last-- or so he thinks.  When he is summoned by Lord de Tulley, Quinn expects to be granted ownership of his beloved home.  But Tulley has other plans in mind for him.  He wants Quinn to marry a woman Tulley has chosen for him.  With Sayerne at stake, Quinn knows there's only one thing he can do.  If only she had been born a man, Melissande d'Annossy would have control of her home.  But her liege lord Tulley has decided that a woman alone is vulnerable.  In truth, Annossy has been the victim of numerous attacks by mercenaries.  Melissande's old neighbor, Jerome de Sayerne, was an evil man who tried to merge the two estates.  When Tulley informs Melissande that he expects her to marry Jerome's son, she is appalled.  Marry the son of that horrible man?  She can't, especially since she has already vowed to wed another.  But Tulley gives her no choice.  If she doesn't marry Quinn, she will lose her ancestral home.  Reluctantly, Melissande agrees to the arrangement.  The marriage of Quinn and Melissande is a business arrangement and Melissande intends to see that it remains so.  Tulley's insistence that the marriage be consummated doesn't deter her from barring Quinn from her bed after their wedding night.  She intends to return to Annossy and stay as far away from Quinn as possible.  But Quinn has been given another ultimatum by the crafty liege lord-- produce an heir in a year or lose Sayerne.  Somehow, Quinn must convince Melissande that he isn't like his father.  Along the way, he will be enchanted by the beautiful Melissande and realize that Sayerne isn't the only thing he holds dear.

Here, however, the writer takes a gamble and it works for him. It is a mature piece with a particularly believable protagonist.\"~ H. R. L. Broscova, Editor-In-Chief, Carpe Articulum Literary ReviewReader Reviews\"I love this story. It is very well written and I very much like the way it's written. The story folds in on itself adding emphasis to certain thoughts and memories. The story itself is a reminder of what is truly valuable in life and how, unfortunately, sometimes it takes something nearly catastrophic to remind us of such. The characters are very well drawn for such a short story. The dialogue is well written and believable. I highly recommend The Traveler. It's perfect for a lunch break or a just-before-bed story. It was a 5-star read for me.\"  \"Well written story. I actually enjoyed it. It's not the thing I would normally read, but honestly the writing was so good that I decided to stick with it.

Marnie becomes a flyer in her cheerleading squad after a teammate is injured, but she worries she won’t be ready in time for the big competition in Toronto. She also worries about her best friend, Arielle, who spends more time chatting in an online artists’ community than in cheer practice. When Arielle disappears during the competition, Marnie is determined to find her, even though she may have left willingly. Marnie’s small-time troubles are of variable interest, but the mystery is timely and fast paced, involving an Internet scam run by a man pretending to mentor young artists while stealing their work. After a lot of buildup, though, the resolution is somewhat unsatisfying: Marnie’s confidence grows, but her squad drops out of the competition, pushing cheerleading nearly out of the story, while Arielle continues to live with her “mentor.” But where this series is popular, this one should find a home.

Kate Robinson is a young production manager of a commercial shoot about to film on the small Caribbean island of St Saviour. Most of the island is controlled by Lord Donald and Lady Cynthia Glencoe, a Scottish couple who were shipwrecked years before and decided to stay on the island as missionaries, opening a school for orphans. Almost as soon as Kate and her crew arrive on the island, they are targeted by an elaborate plot. One of the Glencoes' pupils seeks out Kate and claims she is being abused; Kate lets the girl stay with her, but in the morning Kate's valuables and the girl are gone. A search for the girl back at the school turns up a note claiming she has run away because Kate had attempted to seduce her. Then the cascade of plot twists begin: Kate is duped by the island's honorary British consul, and then her stolen items are mysteriously returned; an actress starring in the commercial is poisoned, for which a charter boat captain takes the blame (before killing himself). All the while a massive tropical storm is bearing down on the island, and after Kate is arrested for kidnapping and murder, she learns the horrible truth about the Glencoe family.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But it is Nancy's station in life to carry the weight of an illegitimate child on her very capable and resourceful shoulders. She also happens to be unaware that she herself is living a lie--a fact that greatly complicates her life in significant ways unbeknownst to her.

Within two years, buying statistics should \"settle\" into telling a story from which publishers can make clear decisions.In the meantime, I've had fun learning from eBook authors who are leading the way.  All this research, combined with my background in marketing, conveys to readers of \"How to Market Your Ebooks\" valuable case studies and newly minted proven techniques for increasing eBook sales.Mike", "related": ["B004UH1FN0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She grew up in a large family with wonderful parents, two sisters and two brothers. She is the baby of the family and adores all of her older siblings, even though they bossed her around when she was younger.    Writing in some form has always been Regina’s passion which is what lead her to a career as a marketing professional and romance author. Pursuing her dreams and seeing them come true is what life is all about.

L.K. Rigel continues to stretch her fairy wings in Bride of Fae. One of her many strengths is world-building, and she puts that skill into excellent play here.

This story wisks you away to London and you become entranced with the fairies, pixies, goblins and the humans who interact with them. You get to see the light and dark side of the fairie world and their inner politics and workings. L.K Rigel eloquently describes the scenery and paints such a picture in your head that you want to run away to Faeview.- Jenn's Review BlogI cannot wait for the next book. The way that Rigel started with the present in Give Me and then is going back into the past with Bride of Fae and the next book is really interesting. I don't know if I've read a series like that before, but I'm glad that I am reading the Tether's series.- Reading It All I love reading stories about Fae and Rigel's description and detail that she put into this fantasy world was amazing.

Many of his novels, with their recurrent concern for social reform, first appeared in magazines in serialised form, a popular format at the time. Unlike other authors who completed entire novels before serialisation, Dickens often created the episodes as they were being serialised. The practice lent his stories a particular rhythm, punctuated by cliffhangers to keep the public looking forward to the next installment. The continuing popularity of his novels and short stories is such that they have never gone out of print.    His work has been praised for its realism, mastery of prose, comic genius and unique personalities by writers such as George Gissing, Leo Tolstoy, and G. K. Chesterton; though others, such as Henry James and Virginia Woolf, criticised it for sentimentality and implausibility.", "related": ["B00CFW50MY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His mother’s side was from Canada where the men plied the fur trade in the Canadian wilderness. Others moved down into the wilds of Northern Minnesota and established trading posts among the Chippewa. On his father’s side were veterans of the War of 1812, and the Spanish American War. His natural grandfather died out West while working as a telegrapher for the railroad. His step grandfather, born in the 1800’s, was Blackfoot Indian from Montana. He was a hunter and horseman who brought a great deal of Old West influence into the Fisher family. As a lifelong Westerner Dave inherited that pioneer blood and followed in the footsteps of his ancestors. Originally from Oregon, he worked cattle and rode saddle broncs in rodeos. His adventures have taken him across the wilds of Alaska as a horsepacker and hunting guide, through the Rocky Mountains of Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado where he wrangled, guided and packed for a variety of outfitters. Dave weaves his experience into each story. His writing, steeped in historical accuracy and drawing on extensive research, draws his readers into the story by their realism and Dave’s personal knowledge of the West, its people, and character.  He has over 400 fiction and non-fiction works published. Included are 15 western/frontier novels and short story collections, 70 short stories, and inclusion in 18 anthologies. He has twice won the Will Rogers Medallion Award, in 2008 for Western Fiction and again in 2013 for Western Humor. Nine of his short stories have earned Reader’s Choice Awards.

It is clearly an important reference book on this subject.”  (Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 30 October 2013)“This is a good book. The individual chapters are well-written and authoritative . . . However, since the book treats all aspects of an important group of microzooplankton emphasizing functional biology and its role in plankton ecosystems, it should also be of value to all interested in biological oceanography.”  (Marine Biology Research, 1 May2013)“This well-produced, well-referenced book provides a great resource for both protozoologists and marine plankton ecologists . . .

Yvonne Carson leaves no table un-turned. She speaks from where she's lived. With wisdom, compassion, and a heart for people, Yvonne sets out to get to the core of what hinders us from realizing and walking in our God appointed purpose. These hindrances, she explains, begin on the inside, and find their roots buried deep in our past. With candor and insight, Yvonne beckons her readers to put in place the \"plan\" for discovery; and she does this, by first calling her past what it was: Painful, abusive, and masked. She begins with her story and it makes you feel that she is not simply a writer, but a friend. The journal pages included in the book encourage the readers to use this form of therapy and it works! After reading through the steps of her plan for discovering your \"GOD GIVEN PURPOSE,\" you can't help but feel empowered for change. This book is a MUST READ for any Women's Ministry.\" It will create a dialogue that has been sorely missing, in a world thirsty for help going forward, and those wanting to deal with the negatives of their past once and for all.

My views may run toward the conservative, but my passion leans toward the humorous. I have always believed my life is proof that God has a sense of humor. An avid reader since my teens, I began writing after quitting my job to stay home with my girls and occasionally needed to focus on something other than diapers and Dr Seuss. What started as an inexpensive hobby quickly became an obsession. Eventually I joined a local writer's club and enrolled in writing classes at a Christian university. Once the kids were older I ventured back into the work force and do my best to balance the necessity of a full time job with my obsessive hobby.

Yes, you will get plenty of reports of brilliances involving spectacular switches, deceptions, unblocks and discards of honours. But for every one of those, there are countless others in which the display would disgrace any beginners' class. I am going to assume that you are a regular club or tournament player who knows the basics of defence but who comes unstuck when it comes to situations where you have to work the hand out in detail.

As a player, coach and columnist, his path was set in motion by his father, Robert Erwin Arnett, who introduced him to softball games at Parson's Field, baseball in the schoolyard and golf along the Locust Street railroad tracks near the stadium. Although Bob's dad passed away when he was 11, he has remained a key influence in Bob's attitude and accomplishments throughout his life. The pattern has extended to Bob's relationships with his own children and grandchildren, who learned from him how to transfer the passion and work ethic inherent in golf to their own activities and interests. Bob has been part of the Terre Haute golf community since he became a 12-year-old caddy at The Phoenix Club in 1946. Nearly seven decades later, he continues to chronicle the local golf scene in his column, Rub of the Green, published by the Terre Haute Tribune Star and collected into a book by the same name. On and off the links, Bob has been a strong competitor and an even stronger friend to fellow aficionados of the game. He taught golf for beginners in grades 4 through 8 in Vigo County for five summers before he coached high school golf for 26 seasons, the past 24 at Terre Haute South where his boys finished second, third and fourth at the IHSAA State Finals and his girls claimed eighth in the 1988 finals. Bob's students have gone on to display exceptional sportsmanship win championships and secure positions as golf pros and competitive professionals around the country. As a result, in 1994, Bob was inducted into the Terre Haute Golf Association Hall of Fame. He is also in the Indiana Golf Coaches Hall of Fame. Bob's competitive golf game was set in motion when he won the Terre Haute Junior title in 1949.

Together, they are parents of five daughters and a son. They have 19 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren, so far. Martin was a public school teacher, working with special needs and other children for many years. Having taught history for almost forty years, he was appalled at the inaccurate, politically-correct history being inserted in the most recent textbooks. As a Korean War veteran, Martin has seen many changes happening in our great nation through the years. Thoroughly disgusted by the liberal teachings and revisionist history of recent textbooks, Martin decided to finally speak up.  Patricia started a second career in adult education after her children were grown.  Both Martin and Pat are horrified at what they have learned about the anti-Constitutional agenda of Barack Obama, his administration and his extreme-left supporters.  They are especially concerned that average Americans across the country need to learn just how badly our Constitution is being damaged and how people who want to destroy our country are gaining more power each day.  As Martin and Patricia researched more and more, they became horrified at the direction our nation is being led. Tired of watching every Obama critic being labeled as a racist or a crackpot, they decided to speak out.  Together, they wrote and published the The Crackpot Conspiracies Series  and The Islamorealist Series which are groups of books and reports. These books tell the truth about Barack Obama and his far-left liberal, progressive/communist, and Muslim cohorts, who are forcing our US Constitution to “hang by a thread”, in anticipation of overthrowing our great country. They also spell out the terrible dangers facing the citizens of the USA if we don’t get and keep each other informed and united. Both Pat and Martin are concerned about the downward spiral in public education, but they are even more concerned for the future of their country and the futures of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren. In addition to writing books, articles, and audio programs about politics, Martin and Pat both continue to take an active role in monitoring their grandchildren and great-grandchildren’s education.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This time with five dogs and two cats in tow. The weather...? 'What about us?' is her debut novel. 'Horizons', her first story, is in two parts - 'Beyond the Horizon' and 'Shifting Horizons'. Her most recent story - 'Mosaic' - is now available too.

Her motivation to take that step was her students: teaching creative writing to elementary age students all the way up through high school and encouraging those students to follow their writing dreams gave Samantha the confidence to take that step as well. Her second book, a holiday novella titled \"The Christmas Cottage\" hit #10 on Amazon's Overall Best Seller List on Christmas Eve. It was a great Christmas gift! Watching the numbers rise and fall is a daily roller coaster ride but definitely an exciting one! And on February 25th, she released the follow up novella - \"Ever After\". In March 2013, \"The Christmas Cottage\" was nominated for two Indie Romance Convention Award - Best Indie Romance Novella and Best Indie Contemporary Romance while Samantha was nominated for Indie Author of the Year! In August 2013, the video trailer for \"Wait for Me\" won an Oscar for Indie Author Book Trailer! More titles quickly followed: \"Catering to the CEO\", \"Wait for Me\" (Montgomery Brothers book 1), \"Trust in Me\" (Montgomery Brothers book 2), \"In the Eye of the Storm\", and \"Stay With Me\" (Montgomery Brothers book 3) which hit the USA Today bestseller list upon it's debut. \"Catering to the CEO\" was included in the romance bundle \"Loving the CEO\" - a five-book package - that made the New York Times and the USA Today Bestseller list.

One of the obstacles she had to overcome before achieving this goal was learning Sanskrit. Part of her reward was her husband, whom she met at a conference on Buddhism. She also took training in Spiritual Therapy with Hans Mensink and Tilke Platteel-Deur in Holland. Part of her reward was the skills to keep the in-loveness of her marriage lively through nearly thirty years. Joy Manné is not very good at being formal.Now we get to the informal stuff: In the middle of the training, her partner with whom she looked forward to living a beatnik lifestyle was appointed to a professorship in Lausanne, Switzerland (Professor of Sanskrit and Indian Studies) so she became a portable wife (the qualification for living in Switzerland with him) and moved to Switzerland, from where she diligently commuted to finish her training. Before you could say “snowy mountain,” clients were asking her to train them. So she did, starting with a four-year training modelled on her own teachers’ training. Joy still believes four intensive years are necessary to develop enough life literacy to understand what being human is about, and perhaps, if it is your calling, to work with other people. The techniques Joy’s work is based on are: Conscious Breathing Techniques: how you breath is how you are, so breathe well and be well; Voice Dialogue (Hal and Sidra Stone’s technique) for becoming literate with regard to your personality; and Family Constellations (Bert Hellinger’s technique) for understanding how the family energy field (also called family system) works and getting the best out of yours.And the personal stuff: Commitment is my thing. It’s the only way to make progress with our task of being human. I hope you enjoy this book, and all of my other books.And: I’m a daughter, a mother, and a grandmother. I know what I’m talking about.", "related": [], "rank": 954959, "title": "Conceptual Constellations", "author": "Joy Manne", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The author has allowed both characters to 'speak' and the result is a skillfully written, emotionally satisfying look at a D/s relationship. I loved seeing the relationship from Jack's perspective and experiencing his doubts about himself. Very refreshing in the BDSM genre. Although a fairly short story, it never feels rushed. The sex is steamy hot and their connection intense.-- The Romance Studio4.5 lips! Ms. Carr blends highly erotic D/s play with emotional scenes in Caught, as Callie and Jack finally bare their souls and are honest with what they want in a relationship. Ms. Carr is definitely an author I'm going to read more of for steamy BDSM stories that explore D/s in a realistic way.-- TwoLips ReviewsWhat amazed me the most is Ms. Carr's knowledge in describing each of the scenes that at times have a dark feel to them, but in a good way. Ms. Carr did an amazing job with the last scene. There were some intense moments that made Caught feel like a dark BDSM, but truly that is what I think made this book an awesome read.

Ever since winning a writing contest at the young age of nine, when she wrote a book about a girl with a pet unicorn, she’s dreamed of writing a book of her own. Quickly learning that dreams don’t just fall into your lap, she knew she had to chase them herself and not be afraid to dream a little bigger. Most importantly, she is a wife and mother, and is very lucky to have a family that loves and supports her in all things. She also has an unhealthy addiction to handbags and chocolate covered strawberries, neither of which she cares to change.
