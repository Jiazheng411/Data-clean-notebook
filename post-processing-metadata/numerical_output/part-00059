Before he died, he had been at work onLife Interrupted, a monologue about the aftermath of a horrific car accident he suffered while traveling in Ireland. Gray is replaced here by legendary playwright and actor Shepard, who provides a gravelly dignity to Gray's ruminations on illness and death. Shepard does a nice job of pausing between sentences, as if thinking of how best to describe his conundrum. Shepard is joined by novelist Francine Prose, who reads her own lengthy tribute to Gray and eulogies for Gray by figures including filmmaker Aviva Kempner, Gray's stepdaughter Marisa and his widow, Kathleen Russo. Their tributes, given at the time of his death, are far less polished than Gray's own monologue, but as homespun expressions of love and affection in the aftermath of his death, are perhaps the most affecting aspect of this well-wrought tribute to Gray's legacy.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Setting the stage for Blackwell's story is a foreword delineating the limitations of American medicine in the early 1800s and how much women suffered at the hands of male physicians, who practiced without standards. Onto this scene, from a close-knit family of Dissenters who emigrated from England, came a single-minded young woman determined to become a surgeon. A few physicians rallied to her cause, becoming sponsors, but no medical schools would admit her?except, eventually, Geneva Medical College of Western New York, and that was actually the result of a joke. The many personal and professional hurdles that Blackwell had to overcome in order to succeed are clearly put forth in this lively, well-documented narrative. Kline is particularly adept at placing her subject in the context of her social and intellectual milieu, her teaching career, and the community of medicine during her lifetime. This motivational biography makes thrilling the struggle of women joining forces to be recognized in a society totally controlled by males. A satisfying and eminently readable presentation.?Susan F.

This book describes how Mohsen evolved from little more than a sympathetic, fearful onlooker (days before the election, he and his mom attended a rally for candidate Mousavi) to a determined participant in the increasingly dangerous protests that followed the announcement of the election results on June 13 (Ahmedinejad reportedly won 62 percent). Mohsen would ultimately be arrested in an inauguration-day demonstration (August 5) and spend 24 days in jail; the first and final chapters are devoted to the horrifying treatment he endured while imprisoned, including torture and rape. A clear and important record of the human toll imposed by one dirty election and a close look at a national injustice that captivated the world, Moqadam (a pseudonym) can be jarring when attempting to score broader geopolitical points (castigating the Chinese and Russian governments, for instance, for executing Muslims while they simultaneously maintain \"strategic alliances with the Islamic Republic\").Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It's January, and the second grader has begun wearing a \"two-ponytail hat\" fashioned out of a pair of ruffled green underpants to keep her brain warm. Her outrageous behavior is endearing, and the support of her classmates is heartwarming. Throughout the winter the students of Mrs. Pidgeon's class think about poetry, and their teacher reminds them, \"Poetry is not to be judged. You just savor it.\" She shares poems written by her own mother, Mrs. X. As the children learn the difference between haiku, limericks, and couplets, Mrs. Pidgeon is dealing with more personal issues. When her mother dies, the students, led by Gooney Bird, create the most memorable poem ever. The story unfolds with fresh humor that keeps readers interested.

My mom had kept it and I found this paper while cleaning through my closet during my college days. According to my dreams back then, I wanted to be a farmer, but my last line was -but alas, girls can't be farmers. Well, I got my Bachelors Degree in Agriculture/Horticulture from Kansas State University, did agronomy research for years before starting a wholesale horticulture business. My company, Prairie Flower Creations, grew and dried flowers, ornamental corn, and mini pumpkins for the florist trade. In 1990 I was featured in Country Woman Magazine, but at the same time, my husband's job was transferred to California. I sold my business and tried to cope, growing flowers and pumpkins in five-gallon buckets on our cement lawn. I started writing about the family and farmland I was homesick for and started a new career, writing about women ancestors who had moved to the new state of Kansas and farmed its land. We eventually moved back to Kansas, bought land next to my family, raised buffalo, and I have a garden again. So not only have I fulfilled my dream to be a farmer, I've written about past and present women that have also tilled the prairie land of Kansas. Please read and enjoy my book series which are about the family that homestead our family farm, and my ancestors that homesteaded in Kansas in the 1800s. Considered historical fiction, these quality paperback books are age appropriate for everyone from age 9 to 99. Book, quilt, and Scandinavian gift shops sell them (or ask your local store to stock them for you) and schools use them in class studies to portray early pioneer and Kansas history. My writing time most days is spent on the computer with marketing my businesses, and working on the next book series.", "related": ["B00J8JT8JS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Published scientific evidence for ibogaine's effectiveness as a treatment for drug addiction includes studies showing reduced drug self-administration and withdrawal in animals, and case reports in humans. Ibogaine's mechanism of action appears to differ from those of other existing pharmacotherapeutic approaches to addiction and suggests possible normalizing effects on neural signal transduction that may attenuate or reverse abnormal neuroadaptations in drug tolerance and dependence. Theibogaalkaloids appear to offer a new pharmacological approach that may provide a paradigm for understanding the neurobiology of addiction and for developing new medications. However, ibogaine is not currently an approved treatment option in the United States.The First International Conference on Ibogaine, held at the New York University School of Medicine in November 1999, offered a lively and productive discussion on ibogaine from pharmacological, clinical, and cultural perspectives. The meeting brought together distinguished researchers in basic and clinical neurosciences, anthropology, and sociology, representing academia, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the pharmaceutical industry, as well as former \"guides\" from the informal treatment context. The interdisciplinary meeting agenda emphasized ibogaine's mechanism of action, including interactions with specific neurotransmitter systems, preclinical models of drug self-administration, and discrimination studies, as well as information on noribogaine, ibogaine's principal metabolite, and 18-methoxycoronaridine, a promising new ibogaine congener. Also discussed was the use of ibogaine in European and U.S. subcultures, in African religion and medicine, and how an understanding of the use of ibogaine in these settings could be applied to accessing hidden populations and optimizing the clinical milieu of current conventional treatment.Key Features· Interdisciplinary and comprehensive in scope-spans the fields of basic and clinical neurosciences, psychopharmacology, anthropology, and sociology· The first English-language scientific book devoted to the subject of ibogaine* Provides up-to-date information regarding ibogaine's mechanism of action, including interactions with specific neurotransmitter systems, preclinical models of drug self-administration, and discrimination studies, as well as information on noribogaine, ibogaine's principal metabolite, and 18-methoxycoronaridine, a promising new ibogaine congener*    Includes a history and sociological analysis of the nonmedical \"informal\" treatment contexts of Europe and the United States, which have existed for more than three decades despite ibogaine's lack of official approval*    Includes contributions from former \"treatment guides,\" in addition to respected authors from academia, NIDA, and the FDA", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Gastner, undersheriff in New Mexico's Posadas County, is recuperating from heart surgery at his daughter's Michigan home, but he can't wait to get back home to the land of green-chili burritos and real sunshine. When his chief of detectives, Estelle Reyes-Guzman, calls to tell him that his home has been burglarized, he moves up his departure date and heads home. The action swirls around Gastner like leaves in a high wind. First the burglary: probably kids, but they've managed to steal precious memories along with several guns he had locked up. Then an elderly neighbor, Florencio Apodaca, has mistaken a piece of Gastner's land for his own and buried his wife on it. And finally, a young boy camping in the nearby hills with his parents has managed to disappear, and Posadas County officials are coordinating a massive search for him. As Gastner, his daughter, Camille, and his colleagues all begin to adapt to his physical limitations, Gastner remains a solid center, using his knowledge and experience to good effect as the various cases of burglary, kidnapping and murder play out.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 30.0}

The story, a romance, ground to a halt on page 50 but Vanessa never forgot the excitement of bringing her own characters to life. She later wrote three unpublished novels, developing her skills as a writer while living on a remote lighthouse during what she thinks of as her baby-making, basket weaving, beach-walking days.     In 1985 Vanessa's novel Pacific Disturbance was published in hardcover by Mills and Boon. She now has over 10 million books sold and has been translated into 15 languages. She also has written what one critic described as, \"by far the best writing book I've ever read.\" Writing Romance, published by Self Counsel Press, won the Under the Covers Best Writing Book Award, and is currently in its third edition.     Over the years her love of storytelling and her curiosity about people led Vanessa to study psychology, volunteer on a crisis line, complete individual and relationship counselor training, volunteer as a peer counselor for a family life organization, and tell stories about life, love, and secrets. Vanessa is also an accountant, a university professor, a publisher of educational materials and eBooks, and a popular international speaker with considerable media experience.     Vanessa and her husband have lived on an island in the Pacific Northwest since they returned from a two year sailing cruise to Mexico some years ago. Vanessa loves hearing from readers.", "related": ["B00IJI2RH4"], "rank": 1619804, "title": "When Love Returns (Gabriola Island Book 2)", "author": "Vanessa Grant", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But though they take on some of the physical characteristics of the race they are trading with, the Kindred gene always ensures three things: physical prowess, extremely large and muscular body structure, and undying loyalty to the female of their choice.            Beast Kindredcome from Rageron--a jungle planet full of beautiful but deadly flora and fauna. They have dark hair, golden eyes, and hot tempers but their most defining characteristic is the mating fist. The mating fist is an area at the base of the Beast Kindred's shaft which engages fully only during bonding sex with his chosen mate. This ensures sex that is both tantric and multiorgasmic for both partners.            Blood Kindredare blond with pale blue eyes and come from Tranq Prime where ice, snow, and arctic-like temperatures are the norm. They have a set of double fangs located where a human's canine teeth would be. These fangs do not develop fully or become sharp enough to pierce flesh until a Blood Kindred is with a woman he wishes to mate and bond with.            Twin Kindredcome from Twin Moons--a world of vast, stormy oceans dotted with craggy but beautiful islands. True to their namesake, Twin Kindred always come in pairs. The brothers are not identical, however. There is always a light twin and a dark twin. These labels refer not just to skin, hair, and eye coloring but to the twin's moods and perceptions of the world. The dark twin in the pair is usually more moody and withdrawn while the light twin takes a substantially brighter view of life.  In all their years of travel the Kindred have come across only three worlds with species close enough to their own to initiate a trade.            Earth is the fourth.            After saving the Earth from the ravaging attack of the Scourge (actually a genetic trade gone wrong, a fact which most of the Kindred are unaware of) the Kindred warriors demand compensation from the governments of Earth--the right to call brides from among our world's population. Having no choice (the Scourge are still out there) Earth agrees. A type of draft is set up and every unmarried woman between the ages of nineteen and thirty-five is required to register. The chances of winning this \"bed-an-alien\" contest are about the same as winning the lottery--very rare--but it does happen on a regular basis. Before calling his bride, a Kindred warrior will become aligned with her and they will dream-share--or see each other's memories and daily activities in dreams regularly.Women who are drafted are required to go up to the Kindred Mothership and spend a thirty day \"claiming period\" with the warrior who has chosen them. If, at the end of that time, they have managed to resist the charms of their Kindred mate, they are allowed to go back down to Earth and resume their normal life. However, if they succumb to their Kindred male's seduction, they are mated for life and must move to the Kindred ship to live, leaving everything else behind and seeing their family and friends on Earth only infrequently. And the Kindred have a secret weapon--devotion to their female's pleasure and attention to detail during incredibly hot sex. The Rules of the Claiming PeriodThe Claiming Period lasts for four weeks:The Holding Week:the Kindred warrior may hold his bride onlyThe Bathing Week:the warrior and his bride bathe together and he is allowed to       massage her with scented oils.The Tasting Week:the warrior is allowed to perform oral sex on his bride.The Bonding Week:sex is allowed but it is completely up to the bride whether she will take things a step further and allow bonding sex which is a special and specific process to the three different types of Kindred males.               The only way out before the claiming period is up is a breach of contract. This can happen if the Kindred warrior does not strictly follow the rules and tries to skip forward in the order of allowed events or by breaking one of the rules laid down by the Kindred High Council. These rules--mostly to do with restrictions on communication with Earth--are for the safety of everyone aboard the Mothership and are nonnegotiable.             BairdHero of Book 1ClaimedBaird is a Beast Kindred, a native of Rageron. His father is one of the rare purebred Kindred whose bloodline has never mingled in a trade before so he has all the characteristics of his home planet. At six foot seven with black hair and golden eyes Baird is nobody to mess with and he has just been through a horrific ordeal. Captured and held by the Scourge he has been tortured by the evil AllFather who had a special affinity for the taste of his psychic pain. Throughout this ordeal, only one thing has kept Baird sane--the alignment of his mind with that of his bride's. When he escapes the Scourge Fathership his goal is to claim her without delay.   Olivia Waterhouse (Liv)Heroine of Book 1Claimed           Olivia is in her mid twenties and has just graduated from nursing school. She lives in Tampa, Florida with her best friend and twin sister, Sophia and their good friend Kat. Liv is stubborn, intelligent, and not afraid to stand up for herself.  With her nursing degree in hand and the rest of her life ahead of her she would be feeling great about life if she hadn't started having such dark, disturbing dreams which all center on a man with black hair and golden eyes. She has no idea what the dreams mean but when two hulking envoys from the Human/Kindred Relations bureau show up on her front step to collect her, she begins to get the picture.Not being the type to go quietly, Liv fights the process of her claiming every step of the way. Though she is required by law to go aboard the Kindred Mothership and spend the thirty day claiming period with Baird, she makes no secret of the fact that she fully intends to wind up back on Earth living her normal life at the end of that time. Of course, Baird is just as determined to keep her as his wife. SylvanHero of Book 2Hunted            Sylvan is a Blood Kindred, a native of Tranq Prime and Baird's half brother. He is built along the same massive lines as all Kindred warriors and has the blond hair and ice blue eyes of his people. He also has the cold, logical demeanor all Tranqs possess. But despite his icy exterior, Sylvan has been hurt in the past. After suffering a devastating rejection on Tranq Prime, he has vowed never to take a bride and no woman can move him. Until he meets Olivia's twin sister, Sophia, that is. Then, much to his chagrin, his mating instincts roar to life and he has to remind himself constantly that she is off limits. Sophia (Sophie)Heroine of Book 2Hunted            Despite their shared looks, Sophie is Liv's polar opposite. She's shy and gentle but not weak though it takes her a little time to learn to stand up for herself. She's a first grade teacher and an artist who loves to paint. She's also fiercely loyal to her twin and horrified when Liv is taken away to the Kindred Mothership. Her antipathy toward Baird, who she sees as her sister's kidnapper, extends to Sylvan as well so their relationship is stormy right from the start.             Though she dislikes Sylvan, Sophie can't help the way her body responds to him. She tries to avoid him but inHunted their ship is forced down in the middle of the Blue Ridge Mountains while trying to return from the Kindred Mothership to Earth. Wounded and frightened, she has no one else to turn to when it becomes clear the Scourge are hunting her for their own nefarious purposes.", "related": ["B00K94J2OW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 145, "rating_average": 4.0828, "rating_total": 592.0}

His treatise on the myriad benefits of smiling begins in rural Zimbabwe, but it reaches across the globe, through several branches of science, into a motley trove of peer-reviewed literature, and--frankly--from ear to ear. Along the way, Gutman addresses a grin-inducing gauntlet of whimsical questions. Did you know that we can detect smiles at double the distance from which we can distinguish other facial expressions? Why do emoticons smile differently in English than they do in Japanese? What does the Gross National Happiness (GHP) index actually measure? And what's on your Dandelion List? The fun goes on. A single smile can pack the dopamine load of 2,000 chocolate bars, or the visceral head-rush of winning $25,000! (And we're letting our children do this 400 times a day?!) Smiling can even make your next skydive statistically safer.

Some claim that these discoveries contradict the Bible's creation accounts. This cannot be. Since God reveals Himself both through the Bible and through the creation, the two must complement each other. It is our job to adjust those interpretations so that we can understand the whole revelation. When apparent conflicts arise, it is not the sacred Scripture or the scientific data that are at stake, but rather limited human interpretations of those two revelations. The Bible tells us that God is  the Creator. The creation tells us that biological evolution really takes place. Consequently, we can conclude that God has actually created  an evolutionary creation. While this is not the first book to discuss Evolutionary Creationism, it is the most comprehensive. Most books on the subject focus on either the science or the theology and leave the reader with an incomplete picture. In contrast, this book addresses both  sides of the issue in depth.Book Highlights:+ A sound, biblical interpretation of Genesis 1 is presented. This interpretation is based on the cultural context of the ancient Near East. When Moses wrote the creation account, he used the language of appearances so that every Human Being that has ever lived could understand it. As such, it can be understood by all, regardless of culture, historical period, ethnicity, age, or level of education. The purpose of Genesis was, and still is, to demythologize the creation.+ God's role as Creator, the image of God in humans, the meaning of \"very good,\" the relational nature of creation, the function of creation  as a revelation and other doctrines are explored. Also introduced is the fact that the Bible does not refer to the natural creation in supernatural terms.+ The evidence for evolution is described. Discoveries from astronomy, the fossil record, biogeography, anatomy, developmental biology, molecular biology, and genetics corroborate the evolutionary creation.+ Common misconceptions about evolution are addressed, including: transitional fossils, the objectives of evolution, irreducible complexity, and the 2nd law of thermodynamics.+ God's creative design is explained. The evolutionary creation operates  according to the natural rules of random mutation and natural selection. Rather than pointing away from God, randomness in creation is  actually part of His design.+ Theological considerations are addressed, including: whether the earth  shows the \"appearance of age,\" whether the Cambrian Explosion or Noah's  Flood can explain the evidence, and whether physical death could have occurred before the Fall.+ A dual-creation mechanism for the origin of Human Beings is put forward, which accounts for discoveries in anthropology, paleontology, and genetics, while staying true to the biblical text and keeps Adam and  Eve out of the realm of myth and allegory. In this treatment they are real people.", "related": [], "rank": 2508934, "title": "Can a Christian be an Evolutionist?", "author": "Vernon W.

This is the first book in a series starring Gus Candle, P.I.Horror has gone through phases: old dark house melodramas gave way to classic monsters, which were replaced by giant mutations and scientific - rather than gothic - monsters. The old dark house thrillers returned as Poe adaptations, until ever-darker monsters (including humans) supplanted them. Now creatures are back in vogue again, maybe more strongly than ever, in both violent and romantic forms.Crime tales have evolved in this century, too. First came gothics, then whodunits, then gangster stories and social-conscience melodramas. In the 30s and 40s, true noir developed, then heist, caper and spy stories. These have traded off in popularity ever since, sometimes black as night, other times comic.In that vein, the Gus Candle series will jump around in time, to various eras in the 20th Century, each melding different aspects of the crime canon with parts of the horror gestalt. A lot of the fun will be picking up on familiar references, and gradually filling in the gaps of elaborate cases Gus refers to along the way.This particular book combines two of my greatest genre obsessions: Chandleresque hard-boiled P.I. mystery and Universal monster-style horror.It took me about four years to get \"The Big Wrap-Up\" the way I wanted it. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.", "related": ["B00BOG0W2K"], "rank": 2313463, "title": "The Big Wrap-Up: A Hard-Boiled Horror Mystery (Gus Candle, P.I.

Specifically my parents moved to Morecambe, the seaside and to this day I still love looking at the sea. It's something you'll either 'get' or you won't. But when the wife and I bought our first house together, condition number one was it had to be near the sea. We were lucky enough to pick one with a view right across Morecambe Bay. The town might be struggling, but I've been around the world and have yet to see a better view. Amongst my various qualifications that I have yet to put to use is an MA in Creative Writing from Manchester Metropolitan University. I'd thoroughly recommend the course to anyone interested in writing as it's great to be around like minded folk. I also have a BA (Hons) in English and Urban Policy and a Post Grad Diploma in Management which the NHS (my employer) very kindly paid for. My favourite author is Stephen King and I maintain that when he's on form he's as good as anyone has ever been. Unfortunately, in my opinion, he is often sold short as merely a writer of horror stories. Still, he's hardly struggling for readers. My favourite book is Catcher in the Rye although it's not everyone's idea of fun. I'm also an armchair sportsfan. For football, it's Liverpool. Golf, Tiger Woods. He'll come good. Tennis, Federer, by a distance the best player I've ever seen and I was a big Sampras fan. Most nights I also enjoy an ale. And a gin - specifically Hendricks, there's none finer. I like Port too, but I'm less fussy about the brand. My first novel was Playground Cool, written as part of my MA. It passed with flying colours, I got an agent from my very first letter and then...rejection letters from publishers. I've been close to publication with Transword since with another novel but still the book deal eludes me. I remain undeterred and still write all the time.

She began experiencing symptoms of MS at 17 and, after six years of numerous doctors and psychiatrists who believed that the symptoms were psychosomatic, was diagnosed at 23.  Traumatized with the possibility of the beginning of her life and career coming to a quick and devastating end, she faced her greatest fear with the determination to be \"normal\" and productive. With the love and support of the \"love of her life\" she started her fight.  Trained as a teacher, her first major obstacle was to enter a classroom in a wheelchair.  She became a positive and motivating role model to her children and peers. To enhance her sphere of influence, she decided to pursue a position as an elementary school principal, in the meantime teaching children that all challenges could be used as a stepping stone instead of a stumbling block. As she culminates one career and begins another, she writes how she focused on keeping her \"normalcy\" and helps to teach others that anyone can start with a dream and keep it alive through gumption, a little bit of humor, and a lot of heart. Read this little book to learn how the spirit of a \"chic\" woman can help anyone facing challenges surround their fears and rise to their personal summit.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Nikolai's shipwreck returned to Sitka in 1810, expedition leader Timofei Tarakanov described their experiences to a visiting Russian naval officer. That description, originally published in a Russian naval journal, has become the basis for all later retellings of the story. Author Jane Galer has now adroitly placed this straightforward narrative within a broad social and cultural setting, reimagining these events primarily from a feminine perspective. Her heroine is Anna Petrovna, married to the incompetent, ailing ship's navigator. Soon Anna's capture by the Makah people leads her to a complete cultural and personal switch of loyalties. In exploring this remarkable change, Galer's writing is skillful, her plotting is ingenious, and her sympathetic amplification of Anna Petrovna's story makes this volume a wonderful literary adventure.-Ken Owens, author ofThe Wreck of the Sv.

Harrison's book contains 200 photos and some text that depicts the city from the 1830s to the present.Harrison has been compiling information for the book, which is a follow up to her first book \"Glen Cove,\" for the past two years. The new book covers topics such as the city's waterfront and its old hotels.\"People were [asking] for more after the first book,\" said Harrison, who has been a resident of the city for more than 30 years.Harrison, a professor of art and photography at the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University in Brookville, has been a photographer most of her life. She began taking photographs of the city after the September 11 attacks.\"I was taking photographs of people's front and backyard shrines,\" she recalled. \"Then I started taking photos of the beautiful things that I passed everyday. I photographed different places in Glen Cove.\"Her collection is entitled, What We See Where We Live, and is currently stored in the Glen Cove Public Library's history room.\"After taking those photos, I began to wonder what was there in earlier times,\" Harrison explained. \"I began to do research on the history of Glen Cove.\"Harrison said she searched for a pictorial book of the city, but there was not one printed. She contacted Arcadia Publishing company proposing to create a photo book that illustrates the history of the city and was offered a book contract in just two weeks.Some photos Harrison collected are from the library's history room. When those photos proved not to be enough, Harrison said, she contacted families that helped to shape the city and visited their homes to scan family photos. She collected photos from the Pratt family, who owned big estates in the city, and photos from JP Morgan's grandson, Paul Pennoyer.\"The Morgan family had a huge influence on the city,\" Harrison said. \"Morgan Park was named [after] JP Morgan's wife, Jane Norton Morgan. JP Morgan bought up a huge piece of land, leveled the buildings and made Morgan Park.\"And although Harrison loves all the photos in the book, she added that there were several great ones that didn't make the cut.\"There's a photo of the House of Elsinore, which was one of the first great Gold Coast Estates. The house was torn down between 1914 and 1930,\" she said. \"It was an amazing huge Victorian Mansion. There's a photo of it in the British Architectural Library because the architect, Jacob Wrey Mould, was British. I haven't been able to get the photo because they want a huge amount of money for it.\"\"Glen Cove Revisited\" is currently on sale at Henry's Confectionary on Glen Street and Landing Bakery on Landing Road.", "related": [], "rank": 1847266, "title": "Glen Cove Revisited (Images of America) eBook", "author": "Joan Harrison", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Trained as a ready to learn consultant, she works with Head Start organizations and child care resource centers. She also volunteers time writing end-of-life stories for Hospice.  She and Dwain, her husband of 40 years, have six grown children and seven grandchildren.  They consider their greatest success in life that their children like themselves and each other. The honorary title of “Auntie” is given in many cultures to the wise women who guide and mentor others in life. The artichoke also became a teaching lesson when Judy, with her young family, moved into military housing in California to find Artichokes in their yard.  Given that it takes two years for the vegetable to flower, the original gardener never got to see the seeds of her labor.  Many times, our actions and reactions in life are felt by people we will never meet, but we plant the seeds of kindness anyway. The symbol of the artichoke has great meaning in her teaching and writing.  As she works with families, she sees frequently only the outer edges are exposed and can be prickly, hard to open and sometimes bitter to the taste. They are closed to new ideas or methods. Many families prefer the known over the unknown, even when the old patterns and skills are not serving them well.  But as you expose the artichoke and people to warmth, caring, and time, gradually the leaves begin to open and expose the real treasure—the heart. You will enjoy Judy's approachable manner, wonderful storytelling and common-sense solutions gleaned from working with hundreds of families and organizations just like yours. Your encounter with Judy will leave you feeling inspired, entertained and especially motivated.

He spent 42 years with The Associated Press news service and during much of the 1960s he was a foreign and war correspondent. He spent a full day in Havana with Fidel Castro right after the Cuban Missile Crisis. He wrote the first worldwide stories about Mother Teresa from Calcutta. He reported the 1965 India-Pakistan war, Latin American revolutions, and traveled with President John F. Kennedy. He was living in Lima, Peru, when an earthquake hit, killing more than 60,000 people. He reported that figure and the Peruvian military dictatorship denied it for 24 hours. Realizing he had an inside source, the government ordered him arrested and expelled. McGowan returned to the United States and was bureau chief for AP in Indianapolis, Boston and Denver, where he retired at the end of 1997. Living a quiet life in Broomfield, Colorado, he takes flying lessons when the weather permits and takes Blanca, his therapy dog, to visit hospital patients.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He received the distinguished Outstanding Service to Environmental Education by an Individual Award for 2009. NAAEE is the professional association for environmental education. The thousands of members promote professional excellence in nonformal organizations, K-12 classrooms, universities, government agencies, and corporate settings throughout North America and in over fifty-five other countries. Duane Keown began his education career at the isolated Hideout Mine School on Deer Flat in San Juan County of Utah in 1960. It was a one-room school, long ago abandoned, with twelve students, K-8. Later, he taught biology and other sciences at the Monticello High School in Monticello, Utah. For three years, he was the principal of the San Juan Junior High School in Blanding, Utah. In 1975, he became a professor of science education at the University of Wyoming. Dr. Keown is best known in Wyoming for his work with teachers in conservation/environmental education workshops throughout Wyoming. In UW's Science and Math Teaching Center, he worked with teachers from more than thirty Wyoming school districts on the UW campus during the summers 1995-98 to write and compile environmental education activity manuals. Through teacher workshops, the manuals, Wild Wonderful Wyoming: Choices for the Future, went to one-third of Wyoming's K-12 teachers. He has authored numerous professional articles in journals on science education, environmental education, and religion. Other significant awards he has received include Wyoming Educator of the Year presented by the Wyoming Wildlife Federation (1993), Outstanding Service to the Educational Profession from UW's College of Education (2000), and Wyoming Environmental Educator of the Year", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Our Waybill To Adventure site is here to help those who hope to hunt for treasure. None of our books have an X drawn on a crude map! Our books are there to motivate those capable and willing to seek out the clues that will allow them to ferret out the sites where relics, old coins, and other valuables may still lie hidden. Using a detector is fun! These days it can not only be fun, it can be a large part of building your retirement fund! Silver has risen in price lately to 36-38 cents per troy ounce. That beat up silver dime is now worth the better part of $4.00. Gold... should you find a $20.00 gold piece, it is worth $1700 or more. If you do some homework, locate a good hunting site, and recover the bag once lost by a fugitive from a Civil War skirmish, that would be a fine accomplishment! If that bag contains $100 in small gold coins, you’d have more than a fine, fun day. That bag has $8510 or more in it. That sort of money adds to a person’s retirement fund. Waybill To Adventure’s books have been put together to help those who would like to take advantage of such opportunities! Each of these books will help motivate a treasure seeker, and enable them to maximize their efforts. We have spent years into building this impressive list of books. We have made all of them as presentable as possible. We truly hope that our efforts will allow you to find old relics, many silver and gold coins... and a new, adventurous path, which is the best part of it! Your partner in grime :-) Glenn === A short word from Leanne... What’s left to be said after Dad talks? Well, I guess I will throw in a bit of bio. I grew up on this stuff. I paid the lunch lady with dirty coins found in the parks of Boulder, Colorado. We 5 kids earned a real reputation for \"dirty money\"! So I grew up and as an adult, was involved in every aspect of my parents' publishing house. From writing to illustration to maps. And I think I may have been the one to \"lick the bindings\"! I have been on the computer since 1989 and am at a quite advanced level... and, am still illustrating, mapping, and writing! Our line of books – my solo effort – is taking on a whole new dimension, roughly doubling in size for each book. We are proud, proud of these books! If you have comments or questions, we will have a blog here on Amazon, as well as links to our sites. Contact me!

I didn’t want anyone to know so I slept in front of a Ticket Master.” It sent the morning crew howling with delight, became Tom Griswold’s “new favorite joke” and was featured on The Bob And Tom CD You Guys Rock. Since then York has been a regular guest on the show and was part of the 2005 Friends of Bob and Tom Show Concert Tour.In August of 2009 York appeared on the main-stage at the Legendary Buffalo Chip Campground for the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. York will be returning again this summer for his 4th year; headlining the Buffalo Chip Comedy Club with Dwight York and Friends.York’s CD Quickies (Stand Up! Records; 2009) can be heard on Sirius XM Satellite Radio’s Raw Dog Comedy Channel and was rated a “top ten comedy release of the year” by The Serious Comedy Site. Punchline Magazine says that Dwight York, as inventive as he is suggestive, is what Steven Wright would be if Wright had Robert Schimmel’s blue streak, and that’s a compliment to all three master comics.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

August Busch IV, the coked up, reckless son of August III, was a man-child whose love of expensive toys, drugs, and women helped drag down the family empire, Anheuser-Busch. Alex Berenson's aggressively reported story--part murder mystery, part Shakespearean tragedy--catches up with August the Fourth two years after his doomed 18-month reign as CEO of his family's company, which ended in 2008 when the 150-year-old family business fell into the hands of its Brazilian rival, InBev. Berenson, spy novelist, formerNew York Timesreporter, and author of the Kindle SingleLost in Kandahar, dutifully cites the works of those who've covered similar ground, but focuses primarily on a girlfriend's mysterious death, revealing how hubris, hard living, and greed led to the foreign takeover of America's beer.  Ultimately,The Prince of Beersis a father and son story. The Fourth's father was Anheuser-Busch's greatest modern leader, the brains behind Bud Light and the man responsible for making Budweiser a powerhouse. Like all the Busches, August III championed a chest-thumping family culture that valued competition,  guns and fishing, and women and drinking--all of which, over the years, resulted in messy divorces, squandered millions, and shattered families. Maybe it was inevitable that one Busch would go too far. Two years after losing control of the company, The Fourth was worth $100 million but was jobless, struggling to shoulder the burden of losing the family business. He indulged in expensive cars, guns, drugs, and women, one of whom died at his mansion in 2010. Berenson uses the investigation of Adrienne Martin's death to profile a flawed and doomed son, his too-tough father, and the dethroning of the King of Beers.--Neal Thompson", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 3.2222, "rating_total": 29.0}

I joined the Royal Navy straight from school, did four years at engineering college and then went to sea for three years in destroyers. I took a commission after that and joined the Fleet Air Arm as a helicopter pilot. I was married, had two kids and now have four grandchildren and one great grandson. I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": ["B009B56IMY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For me, themnothaving sex felt right for the way these characters developed. Angie is kind of innocent, and her naivete about life and thinking she's \"in control\" actually allowed her to at least control one thing: no sex before marriage. It's what fit her character.I fell totally in love with Jason as soon as he appeared on the page...he's definitely a \"wounded hero\"--one who believes he won't ever fall in love again. And that's okay with him.  He's worked hard to make his life rewarding--he's already taken the time to reexamine his priorities and is pretty content. He truly feels he doesn't need a woman in his world. Until he meets Angie.So, this is a story about fated people--Angie and Jason are meant to be together, and that's what's so fun to write--expecially when they don't agree!The subplots in the story really are special to me as well.  I do tend to write about dealing with relationships--and in this story, the focus is on parents.I also hope you will be touched by the theme: the past doesn't have to trap you...and how important it is to acknowledge and learn from the past rather than either keeping it hidden or ignoring it completely. I truly believe the past is meant to teach us, even though the lessons may be painful.I love to hear from readers, so feel free to send me a note.  And if you'd like to be on my once-in-awhile contact list, please let me know.  mail (at) janetwellington (dot) com or visit my author Facebook page facebook.com/JanetWellingtonBooksThat's all for now,Janet Wellington", "related": ["B00ILG76QQ"], "rank": 754304, "title": "UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL--a Second-Chances Sweet Romance", "author": "Janet Wellington", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 36, "rating_average": 4.5556, "rating_total": 164.0}

Son enfance est frappée par le malheur, consécutivement, il subit la perte de sa mère puis de son père et de sa grand-mère. Son tempérament, très sensible, l’amène à se poser très jeune des questions sur les inégalités sociales qu’il voit autour de lui. Il se fait soldat et les scènes de guerre auxquelles il participe seront la source de son roman le plus connu Guerre et Paix. Lorsqu’il se marie à Sophie Behrs en 1862, il regagne la campagne et débute une existence très disciplinée mais paisible que vient rompre une crise de conscience, en 1869, sur la condition humaine. Il se rapproche alors de la philosophie de Schopenhauer, et marque le début d’une vision anarchiste, morale et chrétienne du monde. Il rédige alors Anna Karénine et le succès de son œuvre ne l’empêche pas de se tourner vers une vie de plus en plus dépouillée. Pendant les dernières années de son existence, il vit comme un paysan, puis devient un vagabond, il meurt de froid, emporté par une pneumonie en 1910.La figure morale et pacifiste de Tolstoï a eu une grande influence sur des personnalités comme Gandhi ou Romain Rolland.", "related": [], "rank": 4639148, "title": "La Sonate  Kreutzer (French Edition)", "author": "Léon Tolstoï", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I never thought that this would be something I could do as a job itself, but now I can actually see myself doing it.

Settling and opening a music business in a Queensland country town allowed the family a more normal lifestyle. Janne attended the local school and began her music studies. Her interest in the paranormal and the nature of reality surfaced at an early age. From her early teens she was troubled by vivid repetitive dreams which seemed to speak of past lives. Psychic flashes and random, apparently out-of-body experiences coupled with the odd prophetic dream, fed her curiosity. Seeking answers bought only discouragement and dire warnings from both her parents and her church. Following into the family music business was a given. Janne taught and demonstrated piano, organ, keyboard, piano-accordion and guitar and performed regularly on local radio. Professional singing gigs lured her to other venues including Brisbane, Gold Coast, Noosa and eventually Sydney, where romance intervened and showbiz lost its allure. Janne has worked in retail, demonstrating and advertising, continually returning to music teaching. She continues to teach music and has involved herself in community projects in both a paid and voluntary capacity. She lives in NSW with her husband, Ian, and has two adult sons and two grandchildren. In recent years she has embraced her channeling/psychic and medium gifts and her affinity with the Tarot.

In this episode Emily is trying to figure out a serial killer arsonist, whose method of trapping his victims in some situation from which they cannot escape before burning them to death seems to be evolving with each new murder. The victims in this case are a rapist who was released due to lack of evidence, his cheesy defense attorney who has built his reputation getting similar cases dismissed, the judge who let the rapist go along with his only daughter and her husband, the private investigator who helped produce the lack of evidence , the Assistant District Attorney, and the Jury Foreman. The intensely personal and painful ordeals Emily goes through to finally stop the killer are more than sufficient to make you and Emily wonder why she continues in this line of work.    Dead Burn is a gut-wrenching, nerve-wracking thriller that will keep you glued to the edge of your seat from start to finish. Multiple sub-plots threaten Emily s life from directions she doesn t even suspect until after she has managed to elude them. If you like thrillers, get this book, a bottle of antacid tablets, and clear your calendar for a few days so you won t be interrupted. Advise your family that you are not to be disturbed, under penalty of your wrath if they do disturb you. Then prepare yourself for an emotional roller coaster that will challenge your stamina. This is a story you will not soon forget. --Reviewed by Lee Ashford for Readers' FavoriteDead Burn , a new novel by Jennifer Chase, is one of those very special books that not long after starting to read it, you very quickly realise that you have found an amazingly well developed and written story that quickly reels you in right from the very start. I really enjoyed reading this book. Jennifer Chase s use of a very clear and descriptive writing style allows a reader to cognitively experience the emotions and events that take place within and between the different characters in this particular gripping and absorbing story. The psychological and behavioural profiles used by the author for each of the individual characters found within this book are very real and you can see that the author s professional background clearly stands out in relation to this particular aspect in the very strong story line. In trying to provide some descriptors as to what Dead Burn is all about and without actually providing any spoilers for this book, I would briefly say that Dead Burn is a fictional story about crime, forensic profiling and the tracking and the catching of some quite disturbed criminals. This book contains adventure, thrills and spills, quite a few haunting moments with also a bit of romance thrown into the mix as well! I would highly recommend Dead Burn by Jennifer Chase as a very good and addictive forensic crime read. This book is currently only available in Kindle e-book format from Amazon, but I can see this book eventually becoming a print book best seller and possibly even being produced as a film. It is that good! Also, it is currently very reasonably priced! This is the very first book that I have read that has been written by the author Jennifer Chase. I am now looking forward hopefully, to reading further new books in this particular series by Jennifer! --Reviewed by The Secret Writer", "related": ["B00DXHBQ4G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.9091, "rating_total": 54.0}

While her grades might have suffered, her imagination seldom did. She even managed to keep most of her stories together for years, then lost them after a move when she left a trunk full of papers behind. (She'd meant to go back and get them, but circumstances prevented her from doing so.) So, she started over again. And lost those, too. After a trip to England in 2002, Kimberly began work on A Marginal Life (Well-Lived), inspired by the music of Jarvis Cocker and Pulp. The novel was completed in 2003, and she plans major rewrites of the manuscript with hopes of publication sometime in the future. Also in 2003, Kimberly met and fell in love with an Italian accountant named Alessandro. She married him in 2004. This necessitated her arrival in Italy and she has lived there ever since. Not long after that she started working for language schools and writing blog entries for her family in the US to read, and new story ideas began to develop. Finally, in 2007, Kimberly began work on a new project, inspired by her love/hate relationship with her new home. The novel Ask Me if I'm Happy was completed in 2009. Ask Me if I'm Happy was first released November 15th, 2010 in the UK, and was re-released in the US on May 31st, 2011. Also in May of 2011, Kimberly published the novella \"Alternate Rialto\", a prequel to Ask Me if I'm Happy. Kimberly released her latest novel, 27 Stages, in April of 2013. On June 8th, 2013, 27 Stages was included in Podium Cafe's 101 on Tour 100 Books.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

How could she not write about a scripture that required Israelite soldiers to shave the heads of their newly claimed Canaanite brides?  Particularly after getting a haircut that took her from shoulder-length to nearly scalped with a simple request for a 'trim'! She has a sequel, His Brother's Wife, that will pick up the book about 17 years later, so soon you will be able to see more of Javan and Taleh, and meet some of the other inhabitants of this little village.  She firmly believes that each book of a series should be able to stand alone, complete in itself.   She also loves English history, and gladly writes about whatever historical events and oddities grab her.  As for time travel, wouldn't it be great to be whisked off to another time?  Since no one has a working time machine yet, she'll just have to content herself with sending her characters there. A lifelong Minnesotan, snow delights her and she is jealous of everyone who gets a blizzard when she doesn't.  Blame that on early years living on Minnesota's beautiful North Shore.   She has been happily married since 1982, with one son, who is now married himself.", "related": ["B00AMLJZXK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 14, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 63.0}

My first full-length work of fiction, Flight To Exile, is a fantasy which, I just realized, takes place on a planet that doesn't have a name at all and blurs the line between sci-fi and fantasy in ways that are probably illegal. I then headed out far beyond Proxima Centauri and found a nifty story that soon turned into a Space Opera complete with wormholes and improbable laser guns. What fun. Laws of physics need not apply if you find a way to explain them away. The series stars Nova Whiteside as a space marine whose pesky humanity keeps getting in the way of her doing her job according to protocol. Currently, there are four books in the series, with two more planned. When not finding ways to torture my subjects or entice them with inter-species hanky-panky, I design web sites or write about designing web sites. I enjoy long walks on the beach or, given the local beach shortage, write about beaches far beyond Proxima Centauri.", "related": ["B00KIVZMSQ"], "rank": 397798, "title": "Delphi Promised (Targon Tales Book 4) eBook", "author": "Chris Reher", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.6, "rating_total": 23.0}

It covers the time from Adam and Eve to the nailing of Jesus Christ on the cross and his Resurrection after a few days. The book speaks about how Jesus Christ reacted to sins and how man reacts to the sins done by him and others.Reading a book like The Sacrifice - The Only Way To God is very uplifting. It brings you closer to God and reveals many things that you do not know about Him. It is a sort of educational journey too. It refreshes your memory on the wisdom and sayings in the Bible. The author has quoted many important lines from the Bible. In times when spirituality and religion find no takers because they are busy indulging in other activities, this book is like a breath of fresh air. It not only takes you closer to God; it makes you wiser too.This book is a must-read because of the messages it gives the reader. It is also a book for readers who do not want to read the Bible because many important quotes and sayings from the Bible are quoted and explained in the book.", "related": ["B00DDHE1BG"], "rank": 1564886, "title": "The Sacrifice: The Only Way To God", "author": "REV.

I've been writing ever since I can remember, but it became my full time job in 2010 when I decided that everything else I've tried bores me to death and I have to do what I've always wanted to do, but never had to guts to fully embrace. I've been a journalist, an editor, a personal assistant and an interior designer among another things, but as soon as the novelty of the new, exciting job wears off, I always go back to writing. Being twitchy, impatient, loud and hasty are not qualities that help a writer, because I have to sit alone, preferably still, and write for most of the day, but I absolutely love it. It's the only time that I'm truly at peace and the only thing I can do for more than ten minutes at a time - my son has a bigger attention span than me. When I'm procrastinating, I like to go to the gym, cook Italian meals (and eat them), read, listen to rock music, watch indie movies and True Blood re-runs. Or, in the worst case scenario, get beaten at every Wii game by a five year old. Don't be shy and get in touch - I love connecting with my readers.

During the war, Joe witnesses harrowing\nevents as he goes through the meat-grinder of a tour of duty. Such\nevents are enough to change his life's path and leave him floating on\nthe periphery of things, not wanting to return to the center of it all.\n But redemption only comes many years later, when Joe meets a woman who\n changes everything.Valentino knows how to enthrall and hold the attention of his readers.\n He is equally at home with describing the edge-of-your-seat horrors of\n war, as well as the gentler aspects of love and romance. His confidence\n  and surety as a seasoned writer is most clear in pivotal scenes, which\n  all the more makes the book such a joy to read.Overall, 'The Christmas Gift' is as unforgettable as it is endearing.\nValentino's uncanny ability to access certain emotional depths I only\nrarely encounter with other writers is a breath-taking experience. This\n is a story about finding love and meaning no matter how late in life it\n  happens, and the way it is told will leave you wanting the story to\nnot  end. Five stars for this beautifully written novel.REVIEW BY:-Meghan's Reviews on Goodreads", "related": ["B00IGCUGA8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her life has never been boring. Born October 14, 1953 in Canada, she hasn’t died yet, narrowly dancing past the inevitable on hundreds of occasions.  Her last words will be, “Watch this.”  She’s usually on a dirt bike, raft or pair of skis, and if she can’t be found outdoors, she’s probably baking. Carol gave birth to two Zen masters, daughter Whitney and son Mike, and was “como la mama” to forty others.  She believes that raising good children is the most important thing one can do in life. Carol attended Wellesley College, Wesleyan University and received her law degree from Washington University in St. Louis.  She has won multiple awards for her legal work and her writing over the years. Her bags are always packed and sightings of her have been reported in New Zealand, Hawaii and the catecombs under Paris.  She loves languages and makes passable attempts at French, Spanish, Greek and Navajo—not bad for the daughter of a hard-rock miner with a ninth-grade education. “Being friends with her is like getting a new little red wagon every day.”—David Long.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There were times I would have liked to find a way to make Jon materialize in front of me so I could give him a piece of my mind, but then came the day I finally typed the last sentence.Usually when that happens, I feel a little sad. The story I've poured my heart into for months has reached its end, and it's time to say goodbye. But this time I felt like Rocky Balboa must have when he ran to the top of those steps without stopping. I also thought about doing a victory dance. Not because I was glad to see the end of Jon, but because as writing challenges go, this was one of the toughest...and it felt good to know that instead of giving up and putting out an inferior story, I dug my heels in and gave it my best effort. And if early reactions are anything to go by, it was worth it.Now I'm just crossing my fingers and hoping Cal is a little kinder to me as I begin to tell his story.", "related": ["B00KG252XM"], "rank": 307153, "title": "Her Best Friend Jon (The Coach's Boys Series Book 4)", "author": "Kristy K.

The notebook form allows room for scenes in Brooklyn and on Cape Cod; the poet's feelings about her preteen daughter and her former husband; her thoughts on academia and on Asian-Americanness; her experience of her own body, in youth, in sex and in middle age; and her reactions to 9/11. Honesty has long stood among Hahn's strengths: \"I want hands on my face the way no husband or woman has ever held me.\" Childhood recollections are also movingly evoked: \"I need not write about those snow forts where I lay on my back looking up at the ceiling turning into twilight, my mother calling from the trite threshold.\" Hahn's self-consciousness about this cross-cultural form—a recurring theme—can become self-indulgent, and the development comes not from a change in Hahn, but from the terrorist attack on her city. No revelation emerges at notebook's end. And yet her individual musings retain their force, even in a form Hahn (The Artist's Daughter, 2004) calls \"a kind of fragmented anything.\"(July)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She balances an array of traditional credentials with non-traditional schooling in music, yoga,world scriptures and on-the-job training in a host of work settings. West attended Oberlin College, where she took a B.A. in history and philosophy, while performing in the conservatory orchestra and string ensembles as an “amateur.” Her M.A. in English and Ph.D. in Educational Administration are from the UW-Madison.  At the Robert Schumann Konservatorium in Düsseldorf, Germany, West participated in Sandor Vegh’s master violin class, at the same time teaching English-as-a-Second-Language at the state Volkshochschule.  Later, she worked as a confidential administrative secretary at the UW, while also training along-side pioneers of the holistic health movement.  She spent personal time in Spring Green, enjoying the hospitality of an extended family of Frank Lloyd Wright apprentices. For over 35 years, West has immersed herself in the I Ching, the ancient Chinese compendium of natural law.  She’s applied the principals of change mapped in this perennial leadership manual to the organizations she’s moved through, observing the dynamics of work-place relationships in hospitals, law firms, corporations, small businesses and schools. As the owner of a small business, +A Positive Action Press, Dr. West has published a user-friendly version of the I Ching called The Common Sense Book of Change and The Ultimate Personal Survival Guide: 64 Essays on the Book of Change.  In addition, she's produced a version of the world-loved Tao Te Ching which illumines its I Ching and yogic underpinnings, Two Sides of a Coin: Lao Tze’s Common Sense Way of Change.  A very private person, West is currently retired and lives quietly in rural Wisconsin, USA For more information and updates visit www.RethinkingSurvival.com.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Christopher Ash performs a vital service for the church by opening up God s truth about this neglected and, therefore, misunderstood area of biblical truth. The conscience shines light into the darkest corners of the heart thus facilitating God s people to \"guard the heart with diligence.'\" (Proverbs 4:23)—Tedd Tripp, Pastor, Author, Conference Speaker\"Christopher Ash has done us a great service in writingDiscovering the Joy of a Clear Conscience. After serving as a pastor and biblical counselor for 27 years now, I found myself saying, 'Yes, this is exactly what so many people are struggling with.'... Gives a simple and biblical path that can lead confused, hurting, and guilt-ridden people back to the grace of God and the hope of the Gospel.—Brad Bigney, Senior Pastor, Grace Fellowship Church, Florence, KY\"This rare treatment of a complex practical issue shines clear Biblical light into the dark areas of our thought and behaviour, with lucidity and great pastoral relevance. It will make you think and do you good. I warmly commend it.\"—David J. Jackman, Former President of the Proclamation Trust---\"In an age when so much attention is paid to our physical well-being, here is a liberating and nourishing book that addresses the urgent need of our souls. Whether we are haunted by past failure, paralysed by sinful habits, hardened by disobedience, or longing for the joyful freedom of a conscience cleansed and a life lived by God's grace, we all need to engage with this timely book.\"—Jonathan Lamb, Director, Langham Preaching; Chairman, Keswick Ministries\"Few things are worse than a troubled conscience. Christopher Ash peels back the layers to understand the mysteries of the human conscience. This book will help you to be happy inside, inviting you to come to Christ and enjoy the warmth of his sunshine. This book doesn't just take the reader for a suntan, for skin-deep spirituality, but aims to shine the light of Christ all the way down to our conscience.\"—Dave Bish, UCCF Team Leader\"Over the past few decades we have witnessed a revival of expository biblical teaching in our churches. Now we need a renaissance of biblically-shaped pastoral care and counsel which takes that Word into the furthest corners of the human heart. Of course we can still learn from, and integrate, the best that psychology and psychiatry have to teach us. But the pages of scripture rustle with insights into the human 'heart' and with 'cures' for the aching soul. Christopher Ash's book on conscience, full of practical wisdom and advice, is an important stepping stone toward realizing this vision. I hope it will inspire and equip a new generation of 'doctors of the soul.'\"—Glynn Harrison, Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry, University of Bristol---", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The good response to my first book The Himalayan Revelation has encouraged me to continue penning my effervescent ruminations. I am an engineer by education and a technologist by profession and more than anything else I love travelling and exploring new places. During my two decade active corporate career and travels into the lap of nature and history, I have came across many people, places and the tales associated with them which have left me enriched by some told and some often untold stories.  The Himalayas of Ladakh and Hampi are couple of those places which have left an everlasting impression on me. Their enigmatic environs hide many tales inside them, some of which have been passed from one generation to another. The Himalayan Revelation is my attempt to weave in some of those tales in a modern context. Though it is purely a work of fiction but the story is developed using facts gleamed from history and modern times.  In The Chronicles of Devi, I have attempted to tell a story which has captivated many minds for generations. Our ancient literature is full of enchanting stories. But most of these stories are hidden in the beautiful intricacies of Sanskrit in Vedas, Purans, and Shlokas. I have picked one such gem and have narrated this story in my own modernistic interpretation while keeping its essence intact- it is a story of a single woman and her lion fighting the forces of evil to preserve the balance of nature. The Chronicles of Devi is available in two volumes: Vol 1: Cosmos & Mahisha and Vol 2: Shumbh & Nishumbh.  I hope you like both the books.

Under all the little ruptures in our lives is a mud fight for the soul. For Wheaton the balm for it all is the story and storytelling, an essential inquiry in search of the flashes of angelism embedded in the dirt and grit of our human passage.” —Darrell Bourque, author of Megan’s Guitar and Other Poems from Acadie and former Louisiana poet laureate“Take a dysfunctional Southern family and put them on social media and it’s Katy-bar-the-door. With humor and poignancy, Wheaton shows just how strong and everlasting the call to home can be, even for those determined to escape.” —Brynn Bonner, author of Paging the Dead and Death in Reel TimePraise for The First Annual Grand Prairie Rabbit Festival“Delightful . . . Wheaton writes with an infectious energy.” —Publishers Weekly“Warmed my heart faster than a double shot of Wild Turkey and kept me laughing through the night. This is a rollicking irreverent debut. It’s also a charming love story with a heart as big as Louisiana. I am a huge Ken Wheaton fan.” —Matthew Quick, author of Silver Linings Playbook“Readers need to hold on to their hats because Wheaton’s roller-coaster ride of a book has hilarious highs that plunge to soul-baring angst, then zoom back up to the top.” —Booklist", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
