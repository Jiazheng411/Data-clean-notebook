Widely considered responsible for China's rapid economic growth, political reform, and open-door policy since the late Seventies, he is also linked to the Tiananmen Massacre in Beijing in June 1993. He thus represents a paradox, an enigma to the outside world. Goodman's political biography gives a detailed explanation of the relationship between these two images. Deng is characterized as a \"committed communist\" with a pragmatic view, who would like to bring forth China's modernization through the \"organizational\" rather than \"ideological\" leadership of the Communist party. The author's approach is more analytical and scholarly than Richard Evan's in Deng Xiaoping and the Making of Modern China (LJ 1/94). Recommended for academic libraries. [Librarians may also wish to consider a recent account by Deng's daughter Deng Maomao, Deng Xiaoping: My Father, LJ 1/95.?Ed.]?Mark Meng, St. John's Univ. Lib., New Yor.-?Mark Meng, St. John's Univ.

The protagonist of that tale, Arthur Seaton, still has some of his old fire, as grief intrudes on his life when he learns that his wife, Avril, is about to die of cancer. Arthur's troubles become a subplot this time around, though, as Sillitoe revisits the romance between Arthur's brother, Brian, and his old flame, Jenny Tuxford, whose disabled husband has finally died after an industrial accident forced him to spend the second half of his life in a wheelchair. The event that brings them together is Jenny's birthday party, where to the surprise of neither, sparks fly instantly despite the passage of the years. But Sillitoe's literary agenda consists of more than geriatric romance as he jumps back and forth in time, exploring Arthur's frustration with the lawlessness that has overtaken his community and Brian's dissatisfactions as a would-be novelist who wound up making excellent money as a TV sitcom writer. Brian and Jenny's eventual date is somewhat anticlimactic, although Sillitoe does provide some intriguing thoughts on how the passage of time has changed their perception of the affair, as the two characters consider reuniting. Sillitoe is no longer the aggressive, take-no-prisoners writer who brought these characters to life so provocatively half a century ago, but his craftsmanship remains high and his insights are always sharp. He does meander some, but in this novel, the literary journey more than justifies the occasional side trip.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Yes, her parents are controlling, but they are loving and dimensional, as are acerbic and demanding Miss Pringle, the archetypal music teacher, and Ally’s few friends, who provide sparks of joy, occasional jealousy, and support.

Jemma Dalton flies into Melbourne from Perth, convinced that her sister, Tanya Clark, did not commit suicide, despite her sorrow at the death, two months earlier, of her fiancé, Sean Mullins, in an apparent sex act gone wrong. Jemma moves into her sister's erstwhile apartment, intending to deal with Tanya's estate, but instead finds evidence that she did not know her sister as well as she thought. She becomes the focus of Tanya's circle of friends and associates, one or more of whom seems to have something to hide.I loved reading Brittle Shadows and think that it is Vicki Tyley's best book so far; I could not put it down and read it in practically one sitting. Everything about it had me hooked from the first page: the premise, characters, dialogue, and plot development. The book was, as ever, well written, but flowed particularly smoothly, gradually piling on the tension and revelations, and revealing its secrets cleverly. The ending came completely out of the blue to me and not once did I guess it correctly. Tyley is very adept at creating strong and original female characters and female-driven stories, but this does not mean that they could not be enjoyed by everyone.

Lord Hugh and Lady Cynthia Bottrell live in the shabby manor house, with Hugh's psychologist brother James, a bachelor, and lawyer Simon Lander, wife Beth, and daughter Jean occupying cottages on the grounds. The homosexual bond between Miller and Bottrell is soon uncovered, but more pressing is the disappearance of young Lizzie Biddick, a maid at the manor house, on the eve of her departure (with unexpectedly ample funds) for London. Wycliffe moves thoughtfully among these chatty neurotic characters, until events precipitate a crisis in which he manages to rescue yet another victim. Contrived motivation, unconvincing relationships, slow-motion pace, and a Wycliffe detached and sluggish add up to tepid stuff- -well below the Burley norm (Wycliffe and the Winsor Blue, etc., etc.). --Copyright ©1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Her non-fiction eBook, Death from Rheumatoid Arthritis, chronicles her mother's medical and personal experience, fighting the disease. After many years living with RA, her mother manifested many unusual physical symptoms. Only one specialist was able to correctly diagnose her with spinal cord syndrome, due to her eroded cervical spine. Sadly, when the diagnosis was revealed, corrective surgery was not a survivable option. The author's mission is to bring awareness to the fact that one can die from complications, due to rheumatoid arthritis. Her story lists signs and symptoms of an instable spinal column, related to the advancement of the disease. Mrs. Jones attended Pinebrook Jr. College and Southeastern University, earning her equivalence of an Associate's Degree in Psychology. The author has worked as a freelance writer for The Morning Call Newspaper, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. While employed there she wrote for the Arts and Entertainment Department, Neighbors Magazine and for Lehigh Valley Woman's Magazine.

F. SMITH SUBJECTED (the entire three-book series) explores a topic that has been considered extraordinarily controversial throughout humanity’s history: Creation and Evolution; Science and Religion; God and Aliens, Life and Purpose, etc. First and foremost, I did not write these books to propagate, promulgate, proselytize, or in any other way, preach the supremacy of any one perspective. I’m truly just a humble, genuine man with more questions than answers. I do suppose though, to quote the books that, “Life has its reasons…” I think, and it is deeply related throughout the entire series, that there is more going on than what we know. We all came from somewhere, and the flow of Time is apparently taking us somewhere. Where is that? I don’t know, exactly. But, I do believe the following: We (all those science guys, actually) have discovered that everything is made of energy and lives in a universe of the extremely BIG: quadrillion, trillion, gazillion Stars, Galaxies, Clusters, Nebulae, Black Holes, etc., which exist in an envelope of space that is not only apparently growing, but accelerating in its expansion. We have also discovered a universe of the small, which, in and of itself, appears to contain just as many sub-components as the big universe has large ones. And we, mysteriously, have found ourselves smack in the middle, looking up, and looking down, consciously considering it all as we scratch our little heads asking Why. The Amazing part…is that we learned all of this through our little three-and-a-half-pound brains. Wow! How’d we do that? Which has led me to think that…there’s more to us than just these little three-and-a-half-pound brains. ---------------- < O > ---------------- (G. F.

As an advertising executive, Polykoff pioneered her way to success in a male-dominated industry with suggestive double entendres that launched a hair-coloring empire. As the author dismantles her mother’s lifetime collection of stuff, we are treated to a string of illuminating departures: various ideologies on possession, different ways of viewing art (commodity, status symbol, or totally disposable), and the divergent philosophies of mother and daughter. We’re even taken into the auction houses of New York. The charm of this Kindle Single is its pragmatic and philosophical exploration of our detritus, of how and why we accumulate clothes, art, artifacts, memorabilia and all the other stuff we come to possess.--Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Waugh's first novel, The Loom of Youth (1917), is a semi-autobiographical account of public school life that caused some controversy at the time and led to his expulsion. Waugh was the only boy ever to be expelled from The Old Shirburnian Society. Despite setting this record, Waugh went on to become the successful author of over 50 works, and lived in many exotic places throughout his life which later became the settings for some of his texts. He was also a noted wine connoisseur and campaigned to make the 'cocktail party' a regular feature of 1920s social life.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Iacus, Department of Economics, Business and Statistics, University of Milan, ItalyThe aim of this book is twofold. The first goal is to summarize elementary and advanced topics on modern option pricing: from the basic models of the Black & Scholes theory to the more sophisticated approach based on Lévy processes and other jump processes.At the same time, the other goal of the book is to identify, estimate and justify, with the use of statistically sound techniques, the choice of particular financial models starting from real financial data.In the spirit of modern finance, this book considers only continuous time models like diffusion of Lévy processes. Therefore, the statistical techniques presented are those designed to work on real discrete time data obtained from these continuous time models.Key Features:Provides a comprehensive and in-depth guide to financial modeling.Looks at basic and advanced option pricing with R.Explores simulation of multidimensional stochastic differential equations with jumps.Provides a comprehensive survey on empirical finance in the R statistical environment.Addresses model selection and identification of financial models from empirical financial data.This book is an invaluable resource for post graduate students and researchers in economics, mathematics and statistics who want to approach mathematical finance from an applied point of view. Statisticians and data analysts working in a field related to finance will also benefit from this book.", "related": [], "rank": 2825053, "title": "Option Pricing and Estimation of Financial Models with R", "author": "Stefano M.

She could feel the man next to her give her a once-over. Dressed in jeans, with shirttails hanging out and shoes that looked more like slippers than street wear, he was probably thinking she was uptight.He was probably right.Six foot, thin build, he was also kind of cute, at least in an ordinary sort of way.What the heck? She was usually drawn to the good-looking ones. Maybe it was past time to shake things up. Taking a deep breath and curving her lips into a smile, she gave him a glance.He looked away.Figures. Natalie's luck with men was right up there with her talent for finding short lines.She peered at the darkness outside the coffee shop's glass doors. Jolie would be finished trying on bridesmaids' dresses before Natalie even reached the bridal shop. And Rachel would surely be finished with the fitting for her wedding dress. Natalie wouldn't even get a glimpse. She was on schedule to let down both her future sisters-in-law and disappoint herself, and for what?Caffeine was a horrible addiction.\"Double shot, low-fat latte?\" The barista raised a pierced brow and plunked the cup on the counter.Natalie flashed her best imitation of a grateful smile, picked up the coffee. She dodged her fellow addicts and pushed out the door, chimes jingling in her ear.A chill wind hit her face. November in St. Louis was unpredictable, but one bit of weather that she could count on was that winter would eventually arrive. Apparently it had sometime in the past half hour. Using her free hand to wrap her trench more tightly around her, she made a mental note to dig out her wool coat before work tomorrow.Her heels clacked hollow on the sidewalk. Dark windows stared down at her from all angles. City noises drifted on the breeze, sounding as if they were coming from the riverfront, blocks away. The temperature wasn't the only thing to have changed in the time she'd been stuck in the coffee shop. Since she'd last walked the three blocks from the office, the business district seemed to have vacated for the night.The bell on the coffee shop's door jingled, as someone followed her into the cold.She crossed the side street midblock and headed back toward Kendall Communications and the executive parking garage. The drive to the bridal shop wouldn't take long. And Jolie would try her dress on again, if need be. The night was looking up.The sound of footsteps shuffled behind her.She glanced back. The silhouette of a man strode along the sidewalk. Tall, thin, shirttails flapping in the breeze. Must be the guy from the coffee shop, although on second glance, his hands were empty. Shouldn't he be carrying a cup?She quickened her pace.She was being silly. She knew it. But there was something about the dark and the quiet and the cold that set her nerves on edge. She just needed to get to the Kendall building. There she could duck into the parking garage and the guy behind her would continue down the sidewalk to wherever it was he was headed.She turned the corner, half expecting her follower to walk right past.He made the turn, as well.She forced herself to breathe slowly, in and out, countering the patter of her heartbeat. People walked down the same streets all the time. She was being silly. Here she hadn't even had a sip of coffee and every nerve in her body felt like it was buzzing. Maybe she didn't need the extra jolt of caffeine after all. Maybe tonight she was twitchy enough without it.The darkened tower of her family business loomed ahead. She walked a little faster in spite of herself. With any luck, the parking attendant would still be at his post. He would smile his usual friendly smile, and she would chuckle to herself about how paranoid she was being. She didn't know why she felt so afraid of a guy that just a moment ago she'd thought was kind of cute.Sure, when it came to choosing men, she was a horrible failure. But that didn't mean just because she glanced this guy's way he would turn out to be a mugger.She passed the stairwell leading to the parking garage's lower level and made for the car entrance and the attendant. She turned the corner and looked to the booth.It was empty.Natalie's mouth went dry. She spun around, certain the man would be behind her, a gun in his fist or maybe a knife, his lips pulling back in a sinister smile.The sidewalk was empty, as well.She waited. Ten seconds. Twenty. No one appeared.He must have turned off. He must not have been following her after all.She was obviously losing her mind. Understandable, she supposed. Ever since Rick Campbell had been exonerated in her parents' murders two months ago and then was killed himself, the entire Kendall clan had been on edge. Murder did that. If any family knew that, it was theirs.On top of that, two of her three brothers, Ash and Devin, had lived through horrors of their own in the past two months. Horrors they'd thankfully overcome. Both now engaged to women they loved, her two oldest brothers had been blessed as well as challenged. But the deaths of their parents continued to hang over the entire Kendall family like a shroud.She shook her head to dislodge shadowy thoughts she'd been trying to banish for twenty years. As if a mere shake of the head would do that. The only thing that worked was painting. Turning her childhood fears and guilt into images. Getting them out of her head, onto canvas and shutting them away in her studio where no one could see them.She ripped open the flap on her coffee and took a long sip. Already her heartbeat was slowing. Already she was starting to feel normal again. But despite her earlier promise to herself, she didn't feel much like laughing. All she felt was grateful no one else had witnessed her ridiculousness.Replacing the coffee flap in order to keep her latte hot, she continued down the ramp to the garage's lower level. A lowered garage door and smaller human-size door nestled side by side at the bottom of the ramp. The executive parking filled the whole lower level. Besides being security locked, this part of the garage also had the advantage of being heated in the winter. And it had both a street entrance and an elevator that led directly to the offices on the upper floors.Balancing her coffee in one hand, she groped in her bag for her keys.The door behind her clicked open.She whirled around.Emerging from the stairwell was the man with the untucked shirt. The door slammed with a loud clang.The sound shuddered up Natalie's spine and echoed off the concrete. For a moment, she couldn't focus. She couldn't move. All she could do was think about how alone the two of them were—no other cars, no one to come to her aid. Even if she screamed, would anyone hear?Her phone. Instead of grabbing her keys, she pulled out her cell. She stared at the screen. Underground garage. Surrounded by concrete. No service.She held the phone to her ear anyway. If he thought she was calling someone, he would leave her alone. Wouldn't he? The shuffling sound of those god-awful loafers moved toward her.A high whistle of panic rose in her ears. Oil and concrete and old exhaust clogged her throat.\"No reception down here, I bet,\" he said in a quiet voice.He wasn't fooled by the phone. All she could do was make a run for it. Get through the door and slam it before he could follow. She dropped the useless phone back in her bag and groped for her keys. Her fingers hit steel. She pulled the key chain out, jingling in shaking fingers. She tried to fit her key into the lock.\"Need help with that?\"His voice was right behind her shoulder. The faint mint scent of mouthwash fanned her neck.She turned her head to look at him.He stared at her with sharp brown eyes. His dark blond hair was mussed, blown by the wind. He looked like a regular guy. Perfectly ordinary.Then why was she so frightened?She turned back to the door. He hadn't hurt her yet. Hadn't even touched her. All he'd done was ask if he could help. That had to mean something. Right? Maybe she was doing all this panicking for nothing. Maybe she really was going crazy after all. \"No, thanks. I can get it.\"\"You seem…scared.\"She didn't know what to say. Admit she was frightened out of her mind? Or just play it cool. \"I was just startled.\"\"Startled? That's not what I had in mind.\"His voice sounded low, calm. Everything Natalie wasn't. Everything she didn't think a mugger should be, either. \"I'm^I'm okay now.\" She fibbed, feeling far less than okay.He narrowed his eyes. \"Do you know who I am?\"\"Know you?\" She turned to face him. He stood so close she took a step back, hitting the door. \"You were in the coffee shop.\"\"Yes. I've been wanting to talk to you for a long time.\" He smiled. Cool. Casual. But his eyes…some-thing about them seemed hard. Something about his smile felt less than friendly.Was she imagining it?\"Excuse me. Hate to interrupt.\" The voice came from behind the man. Someone else.She peered past one of the skinny shoulders. Another man stood in the doorway to the stairwell, his tall, well-muscled frame filling the space. Everything about him—the expression on his face, the way he held his body, the look in his eyes—exuded calm and control. And even though she didn't know anything more about this man than she did the guy who'd followed her from the coffee shop, she let a relieved breath escape from her lungs and sagged back against the door. \"No interruption. Really.\"The man staring at her turned to face the interloper. \"Who in the hell are you?\"\"I'd like to ask you the ...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The seventh child of a seventh son of a seventh son, Michael Charles Antil Sr., and Mary Rowe Holman Antil. He completed the first grade at the St. Mary's Catholic school in Cortland, New York when the family moved to Delphi Falls, New York where he lived until just after finishing his eleventh grade in high school. Jerome Mark Antil grew up with five brothers and two sisters. Mary Margaret; Dorothy Louise; Michael Charles, Jr.; Frederick Holman; Richard Francis; Paul Robert; and James Joseph. His blood grandmother, on his Mother's side, was Catherine Rowe-Bell, who lived with the family in Delphi Falls. Catherine's sister, Josephine and her husband, Frederick Holman adopted Jerome's Mother as a child when her father left and never returned. The family called their grandmother, Aunt Kate, but always knew she was their Grandmother. The family also adored, Bomma Jo and Bompa Fred for their caring, love and devotion of their Mom. Just before his senior year in high school the family moved from Delphi Falls, first to North Syracuse and then to Milwaukee as a result of a year his father had spent in a TB sanitarium, and subsequent failed businesses. He moved with his Mom and Dad and two of his brothers moved from Delphi Falls, to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Jerome graduated from St. John's Cathedral in 1958 and went on to attend Xavier University in Cincinnati Ohio. His parents and younger brother James Joseph moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana where they remained. His career has been \"writing\" and \"marketing\" in the business world. He wrote marketing plans, sales and training movies and commercials. He has lectured at Cornell University; The Johnson School; St. Edwards University; and Southern Methodist University. Jerome was inspired to begin the career he always wanted, at the behest of his daughter, Worley Antil Coco and has spent twelve years researching for several books he is now working on. A note from her now adorns his wall, \"Start Writing - Be Happy!\" Light hearted nostalgia about growing in the 1940s. In his writing room he has the framed pages of his daughter's handwriting listing forty two subject lines of her favorite bedtime stories she was told by him. A promise made by him to his daughter, was that his first book would be a book to help divorced fathers cope, and have the same quality times with their children as she shared with him.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

By God s grace a conversation has begun that is helping many come to a fuller appreciation for and use of the Lord s Day. Pastor Ryan McGraw s voice in the conversation needs to be heard. As he says, I have sought to address what I believe to be the primary underlying issues behind the widespread neglect of the Sabbath day. Pastor McGraw s book is chock-full of biblical insights, freshly applied to the issue of the Christian Sabbath. I have been helped by the book and know that each one who reads it will be as well. --Joseph A. Pipa Jr., President, Greenville Presbyterian Theological SeminaryFar too many Christians only believe in nine commandments. The command to keep a day of rest on which to worship our triune covenant Lord is deemed as irrelevant or no longer binding. Providing helpful exegesis and theological consideration, Ryan McGraw gives the church important reasons to recover the abiding validity and necessity of the fourth commandment. Far from being legalistic, McGraw s treatment encourages all Christians to find worship, rest, and a foretaste of heaven to come on each and every Lord s Day. --J. V.

When working in art, she missed biology. It took a bout of multiple chemical sensitivities to limit her to writing. At last here was a niche in which she felt old-clothes comfortable. At last she could indulge all her interests, from art and science to nature and spirituality, from reality to fantasy.  Gloria Piper is a member of Novelpro, an exclusive writers' group for serious and professional writers. She brings a lot of insight to her writing.

It also provides conceptual organizational models and practical strategies for continually working towards quality improvement and for transparently tracking and documenting outcomes. Most importantly, this book finally brings quality assurance from being a lofty ideal into the realm of practical discussion.\"—The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning\"With its in-depth, cogent examination of structure and organization of worldwide distance education systems, this book can serve as an effective teaching resource, as well as an invaluable reference for administrators and policy-makers. Undoubtedly, it will prove to be an enlightening and useful contribution to the field of distance learning.\"—Educational Technology \"This volume makes a valuable contribution to the growing body of assessment-related work in this area, and as it is co-edited by two well regarded researchers, we can be assured that it includes authors whose chapters have been carefully vetted. The book’s organization presents an effective topical sequence, with chapters focusing on assessment-related issues in specific contexts- higher education, online education, international, regional, types of institutions, specific institutions, consortia, and corporations- then finishing with a broader discussion of quality assurance in the final chapters to nicely pull the entire body of work together. This approach allows the reader to be selective in choosing those chapters most relevant to their particular organizational setting, though all should be sure to absorb the beginning and ending chapters to gain an overall perspective.\"–Dr Michael Beaudoin, University of New England\"In terms of content, this instructive, inspiring, and rich book can be considered as a platform and even a complementary work for current and future research on QA in ODL. The present book as a roadmap of research on QA in different ODL settings, and as a guide, promising that regardless of activities reported here, there will be many opportunities and new horizons for the development of interesting projects covering a broad range of QA topics through a variety of research approaches, has taken a successful step towards such a development in theory and practice, though in effect, it leans somewhat toward the side of practice. I believe that reading such a valuable quality work will be of interest and benefit for researchers, students, professors, managers, authorities, policy makers and decision makers, practitioners, and, above all, end-users of services provided through ODL.\"–Dr A.

Taylors Core Values Nature and the related Catalytic Values are a transcendent new insight into the Human Operating System. It has truly changed the way I think about myself, the way I select and manager employees and the way I communicate with others. --Glen Villalobos, National Executive, Human Resources Volunteers of AmericaI bought this book and used this test on myself and everyone in my company.

His mother, Polly Richards, was an actress, his father he never knew. He grew up and was educated in South London. After a succession of different jobs, he started to write short stories based on his own experiences. In 1893 he joined the Royal West Kent Regiment. Three years later, he transferred to the Medical Staff Corps where he rose to the rank of corporal. When he went to South Africa in 1896, he was producing poetry in the style of Rudyard Kipling. With the publication of these verses, he began to establish a reputation for himself. His army pay was supplemented with regular articles for various Cape Town newspapers. In South Africa he met his first wife, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. Returning to England, he published his second book of poetry, but it failed just as the first one. In 1905, he began writing his first novel. As he could not find a publisher, he created his own company, The Tallis Press. Many novels followed, some written in just one weekend. In the late Twenties, he began to sell film rights to his novels. Along with countless articles, some 23 screenplays and many short stories, Wallace wrote more than 170 books, which have been translated into 28 languages and sales of which have exceeded 50 million copies. Over 160 films have been made from his books - more than any other author. In the 1920's one of Wallace's many publishers claimed that a quarter of all books read in England were written by him. His sales were exceeded only by 'The Bible'.", "related": ["B00263KWKW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fifteen years after retirement, he began writing \"The Wagons of Perro Loco and other short stories.\" Much of the humor in his stories is readily supplied by friends and relatives, telling tales of their ancestors' experiences, which he likes to 'enhance' and incorporate. Doc is currently working on a sequel to Warner Law.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But there the teams fitted perfectly into the rivalry between California's two largest cities, and their competition became even greater. In 1962, the two fought all season for the National League pennant, and Plaut ( Start Collecting Baseball Cards ) believes this fact has special significance. Maybe. But what is clear is that it was an exciting race that ended in a tie and was not decided until the ninth inning of the third playoff game, when the Giants secured the pennant. Plaut expertly builds the suspense and sensitively handles the interplay of personalities, having played a role on both squads. Still, it seems doubtful that fans outside California will be swept up by the book.

Hapless Charlie and his much more attractive and successful wife, Elaine--the author's other specialty--have just split up. A journalist with a talent for emotional exhibitionism, Elaine promptly launches a column in her popular Sunday newspaper. It's called \"Bastard,\" and it's all about our man Charlie. He can't blame her, really (\"If there had been a fork in the road at any point in his life, then he hadn't noticed it,\" Charlie admits). But he can deeply resent, feebly refute, then finally come to terms with her wrath. His journey is equal parts hilarious and frustrating, and only Nick Hornby could pack it so well into this appetizer-size story. Another drink?

Why are all the locals so quick to dismiss her death as an accident? Greg senses there’s more to it than that and finds an unlikely helper in FBI agent Dan Brennan. Their investigation rubs the townsfolk the wrong way, but that’s not enough to keep the young Yankee (Greg) and the cocky fed (Dan) from digging. Even when the local officials concede that a murder took place, they jump too quickly to make an arrest, leaving Greg to solve the crime on his own, making more enemies along the way.

I really appreciate you stopping by and taking a look. I guess in some ways I am an alternative medicine renegade. I talk about topics that, in my opinion, are critical for human health (mental, physical and spiritual). However, many people don't want to hear it because it places the responsibility for their weight and health squarely on their shoulders. I believe there is a health crisis in our country. We've all heard of the obesity epidemic and how children of grade-school age are being diagnosed with adult diseases as hypertension and Type II Diabetes. And, if the children are ill and overweight, then that means the parents are probably just as bad or worse. Indeed, there is a health crisis. But more than that, there is a crisis of personal responsibility. Giving in and 'going with the flow' is easy, at least for now. But sooner or later the piper comes around to collect with some sort of sickness, an unexpected condition that suddenly sobers the mood. And the truth can no longer be denied or escaped. That is why I have written this series of books. I want to use them to carry the message that EVERY weight loss goal CAN be reached with the proper mental artillery and physical preparation. I know what it's like to suffer with obesity and an eating disorder. Food addiction took more than 20 years of my life, and I want to prevent that from happening to anyone else. So here I am for all who care to listen.

Sherrill was born in Bryson City, North Carolina, and currently lives in Greenville, South Carolina. He had an on again, off again relationship with the United States military that began with his childhood as the son of a career member of the Air Force. His relationship with the military continued when he joined the Army upon his graduation from High School in 1973.Later he was in the Army Reserves and, later still, in the South Carolina Army National Guard, with whom he served in combat in Iraq, and from which he finally retired in 2008 after having earned two Meritorious Service Medals, a Combat Action Badge, various other medals and awards, and four honorable discharges. “Some people collect baseball cards,” he used to tell those soldiers serving under him, “apparently I collect honorable discharges. I was never aiming at staying in the military long enough to retire; it just sort of sneaked up on me.” While serving in the National Guard as a combat medic, he worked in his civilian job in Nuclear Medicine. Along the way toward this retirement he was educated at Blue Ridge Technical College, Appalachian State University, NC State University, Southeastern Baptist Theological Institute, and Midlands Technical College. A Sound Of Distant Thunder is William’s first novel, and it draws from his years of knowledge about the life and habits of soldiers, from his personal experience with the power of love and friendship, and from his belief in God and God’s ability to work in the lives of people in spite of the hardships which they face - a lesson he has learned by personal experience during his entire adult life and from his time in combat.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The teens became men leading separate lives, but once a year, with Laurence orchestrating the details, they met for an “excursion of delight”: they would pick a victim who wouldn’t be missed and do the deed. But in 1984 things changed—Alex was brutally gang raped, and the brothers changed the rules of their annual “game.” They went out for revenge—and things went awry. Enter Detective Superintendent Paul Snow, who soon realizes he has come across a crime that might end his career, whether he catches the killers or not.

Her parents left Hungary in 1868, fearful of the threat of a peasant revolution. They lived in Budapest before moving to Brussels and then on to Paris. There, she studied music with limited success before the family moved on again; this time to London, at which point her interest turned to art. She studied at the West London School of Art, followed by Heatherley's School of Fine Art, where she met a young illustrator, Montague MacLean Barstow, the son of an English clergyman who was to become her friend, lover and husband in a happy marriage that lasted nearly fifty years.To start with there was little money and the pair worked as translator (Orczy) and illustrator, before she embarked upon a writing career in 1899 which, to start with, was not a success, although by 1901 she had produced a second novel and a string of detective stories for a magazine which were greeted a little more kindly.  In 1903, however, in co-operation with her husband, she wrote a play about an English aristocrat, Sir Percy Blakeney, whose mission in life was to rescue French aristocrats from the extreme events affecting their class during the French Revolution.The play got off to a shaky start, but soon developed a following and eventually ran for four years in the West End of London. It was translated and revised and performed in many other countries. In tandem with the play, Orczy novelized the story and this became a huge success. There followed over ten sequels which featured the central character, Blakeney, along with his family and other members of what was referred to as the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel. The first of these, I Will Repay, was published in 1906 and the last, Mam'zelle Guillotine, in 1940.She also wrote many other novels, mainly romances, but also within another genre she mastered; detective fiction. Lady Molly of Scotland Yard was one of the first novels to feature a female detective.  The Old Man in the Corner stories are of particular significance, as they represented a new departure in fiction, with an 'armchair' detective literally attempting to reveal cases based on logic alone.Success brought financial reward and eventually she bought an estate in Monte Carlo, which was to become her home. England, however, remained important to her and in addition to working tirelessly during the First World War in aid of the recruitment", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I Write: True Crime, Thrillers, Romance, Children’s Stories. True Crime?  Because of my early background. Romance?  Because I have always respected and been a lover of ladies and life in general. Childrens stories?  because I was gifted at the age of 45 the most beautiful child ever created and I helped to create her. I started writing when I became friendly with a well known Scottish writer. Nigel Tranter, who reviewed and edited my first effort (The Exploiters) His comment, was “Bill You may never be a top writer, but you will be one hell of a story teller.” So that started me off and from then I have simply wanted to in some way perhaps influence others by telling my life story as it was.  My favourite book is (Key above the Door) by John Buchan and my favourite writer has to be Nigel Tranter, although he specialised in historical novels he too told it how it was. My best book has to be (Survive in the Shadows) this book really does tell it all. At present I am writing more children’s stories. My philosophy of life is really very simple. We only have one life so just live it to the full. 14 years back I had a large cancer operation. My brilliant surgeon said that if I did not take the chemo he would give me 6 months to 2 years  at the most. Two operations later and more to come in a few weeks and I am still going strong. That is me I have never learned how to give up in anything. I am 79 years young. Married to my beautiful wife, partner and girlfriend Jean, my savior!  She gave me a beautiful gorgeous daughter Katrina and of course our wee Yorkie dog Pepe. He is the boss of the home.", "related": ["B004DUMZ4M"], "rank": 3729239, "title": "Survive in the Shadows", "author": "Bill Graham", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Later in life, I discovered the joys of collecting and shooting guns, reloading ammunition and writing about my adventures with a healthy dose of fun.Since I took up the shooting sports, I've been immersed in industry professional activities including the annual Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade (SHOT) show, the Shooting Industry Masters, the Professional Outdoor Media Association and various other shooting industry organizations and events. I've been fortunate enough to personally shoot and test literally thousands of different guns ranging from black powder guns to target rifles to military machine guns to cannons - and everything in between.My career has been diverse, bordering on dysfunctional, with most of it spent leading marketing teams for a variety of technology companies including Microsoft and more than a couple of high-tech startups. I've finally seen the light and given up the corporate life to pursue my passion of creating slightly crazy, but educational, content related to guns, shooting, concealed carry and self defense. My most recent project is publishing a series of informative books under the Insanely Practical Guides brand. You can learn more at InsanelyPracticalGuides.com.I also produce a website, MyGunCulture.com that is a half-cocked but right on target look at the world of shooting and all things related. If you want to learn with a laugh about guns, shooting products, personal defense, competition, industry news and the occasional Second Amendment issue, visit me there!", "related": ["B00I2Y2AM2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He disturbs his family while pretending to be the wind but finds his best friend's hat. He disappears in the middle of a stormy day only to be found sitting in a big nest he built to protect a baby bird who had fallen from a tree. Chorao shows that youngsters can have two sides to their personalities through her colorful, amusing pictures. When he is awakened by a nighttime noise, Sam sneaks downstairs to find Grandpa making a mess in the kitchen. Hindered by his lack of glasses, Grandpa needs help making chocolate eggs and toast along with a huge mess, ultimately getting Sam into trouble. Sam explains all to Mom and Grandpa thanks him for helping. The animal characters have comical expressions and a great sense of movement.

Her love of writing and vivid imagination allowed her to create interesting stories. She took acting classes in school, as well, which gave her the unique opportunity to look at things from a director's standpoint due to her level of knowledge in the class, allowing her to see how subtle changes here and there can keep an audience's attention. She submitted the script for Finding Arianna: The Story of Nathaniel to the Golden Brads screenwriting contest and made it through to the fourth of five rounds. She has been writing stories since she was a freshman in high school. Her writing started out with scripts, and through reading books she was able to garner several different writing styles that matched her own way of thinking and writing. This allowed her to take her scripts and turn them into books. \"Writing a script is easy. Writing a book, however, not so much\" she admits. Writing has always been a passion of hers, and accomplishing the dream of publishing her work has always been the end goal. She currently lives in Kentucky with her husband and their four children. They also have two dogs and a cat. She and her husband, along with their children, rescue stray animals and return them to their homes. All three of their own pets were rescues as well.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Talty then rewinds to tell the story of this unlikely war hero's strange path to espionage, long frustration with his mission, and ultimate success as a turning point in the defeat of the Third Reich. Though Erickson's tale has appeared before--notably in both a book and film entitledThe Counterfeit Traitor--Talty's telling gets the story just right, depicting the modest, dapper Erickson and his long-classified exploits with tense pacing, surprisingly intimate details, and a reverence for this private citizen's suspenseful, tide-turning contribution to the American war effort.--Jason Kirk", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 120504, "title": "The Secret Agent", "author": "Stephan Talty", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.3, "rating_total": 43.0}

Tannenbaum, provides a critical review of current practices in the ecological risk assessment field and proposes alternatives that are supported by established science and keen observation. It is hoped that this approach will pave the way to a greater understanding of what appropriate and useful ecological assessment for contaminated sites should entail. He demonstrates that in most cases current practices do not provide for an assessment of ecological risk, and moreover, that endeavoring to assess ecological risk is actually an unnecessary undertaking at conventional hazardous waste sites. (He states, for example, that the concept of scale is often ignored by practitioners, questions why animals like deer are routinely assessed at 5-acre sites, and challenges the ecotoxicology data currently used.)The book is aimed at students and professionals in the fields of environmental science, ecology, ecotoxicology, and health risk assessment.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Enter Lilith, deadly, dangerously sexy, and on a mission from the Big Bad; the Guardians have their work cut out for them. When the forces of evil take the child right from former pop star Damali Richards's womb, she vows revenge-and along with her lover (Carlos Rivera), Father Patrick, Marlen, and the rest of the warriors of the darkness, she sets off on a journey to destroy Lilith and her minions-and to save the world from those who would destroy it first. Mixing religion and New Age philosophy with Buffy-style butt-kicking and a distinctly African-American flavor, Banks spins a head-bendingly complex tale of passion, mythology, war and love that lasts till the grave-and beyond. New readers may find it a bit bewildering, but devoted fans should relish this new chapter in a promising series. Agent, Manie Baron.

A communications specialist by day, I've written supernatural fiction for 22 years. I am currently in the process of releasing all my finished titles on Amazon.com and CreateSpace, including the time travel novel I've been working on for the last two decades. (Coming soon.) In my writing I try to get to the point while also employing concrete descriptions. I also try to write fiction that's actually fiction, not something that feels just like nonfiction. I don't personally see the point of fiction mirroring reality. (That's what creative non-fiction is for.)

For someone who is interested in entering a DD or power exchange relationship, I would say this is a must read.  It is informative, direct, and she speaks from experience with always an emphasis on safety.  For those of you who have a spanking or anal kink, there are delightful chapters that you might want to read through a couple of times (first for education, and then \"strictly\" for your own pleasure).  Though Ms. Raymond is the dominant in this F/F relationship, it is important to note that her suggestions are applicable to all couples since gender has little to do with being a dominant or a submissive.  I would even go out on a limb and say that vanilla relationships could benefit from some aspects of this book.On the other hand, if you're not looking for a \"how to\" but instead a love story of two people who are totally committed to each other (with a realistic \"view from the window\" experience), you won't be disappointed.  In every descriptive instance, there is love and sincerity ... from the punishments to playtime ... with honesty always at the forefront.Whether you are in a DD relationship, looking to start one or just curious how one couple lives within such a loving lifestyle - this is a great read for you.  I personally find real romance stories more erotic than fiction, (don't tell anyone I said that) and am confident that you will, too.", "related": ["B00JYQ9ZNY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Maloney, a veteran teacher, experienced a transient ischemic attack in the left hemisphere of her brain. She helplessly observed her mind deteriorate to the point where she could not speak, walk, read, identify household objects, or recall her family. Maloney traveled between the worlds of the surreal and the logical. The stroke resulted in aphasia, the loss of communication and other functions of her left hemisphere.After eighteen months of rehabilitation, she was finally able to communicate with others by using her hand as a metronome. The frustration of having the words and sentences formed in her mind but being unable to share them caused frustration and depression. Her verbal abilities suffered, along with her reading and comprehension skills. Even so, hard work, strong will, and persistence has allowed her to reach out to other teachers to offer new insight into the minds of her beloved special-education and reading-disabled students.In this, her story, Maloney turns her experience into a unique opportunity to gain an understanding of her students’ difficulties and to share that knowledge with other teachers.“Ms. Carol Maloney has written a compelling story that chronicles her amazing life before, during, and after her devastating stroke. She writes with frankness that touches one’s heart. Her story will lend encouragement to those who have suffered a stroke as well as offer strategies to those who have a loved one recovering from one. Carol Maloney developed aphasia after her stroke. I am happy to say that she has survived and conquered both the devastation of her stroke and her aphasia. I know this first hand: she conducts amazing PowerPoint presentations to my graduate class at Rivier University each semester. She is an inspiration to all who want to improve themselves.
