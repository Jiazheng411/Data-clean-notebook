After graduation, Alice hangs around London dabbling in fashion and the attention of men—first Hugo, a man twice her age, and then Harry, a depressed would-be songwriter with a pedigree similar to her own. Ostensibly the story of Alice's unrequited love for Harry, Spens's novel also forward marches through fashion shows and fetes, cigarettes and pills, stargazing and navel-gazing. The narrative flits back and forth in time and alternates hazy points of view among Alice, Harry and Alice's pill-happy best friend, Rose. The big field party that brings all three stories together, the Wrecking Ball, gives them a suitably soft spot to land, but the confessional narrative collapses in amoral inanity before then, ending up in a discomfiting netherworld betweenGossip GirlandA Million Little Pieces.(Oct.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As peace flows from Buddhist teachings, so too does an environmental ethic rooted in awareness and interrelatedness. Nhat Hanh's engaged Buddhism, a Buddhist school that emphasizes social responsibility, takes on the task of preserving and protecting the earth. A special bodhisattva (enlightened being)—Dharanimdhara, the Earth Holder—will guide human efforts to guard and restore the natural world. No effort is too small; an Earth Peace Treaty Commitment Sheet in an appendix lists nearly 60 easy behaviors to minimize ecological impact. The Zen monk's often poetic voice redeems what might otherwise seem repetitive writing or simplistic views; seeing with the eye of the elephant queen provides deep insight. A foreword by environmental journalist Alan Weisman (The World Without Us) adds a fresh framework for understanding Nhat Hanh's Buddhist insights about interrelationships with the natural world.

In writing these books, says Harris, the authors claimed \"the right to express publicly their opinions on the controversial issues of the era,\" whether religious, political or cultural. Ann Eliza Bleecker offers, in The History of Maria Kittle, the story of a neighboring woman who was taken captive by Indians during the Seven Years' War. Emma Willard's History of the United States, or Republic of America (published in 1828), reflects her nationalist perspective, and went through 53 printings in 45 years.

Zaki defied his father and married a beautiful young pregnant widow, only to find himself widowed a few years later and forced to accept his father’s offer to run a small shop in London. Zaki’s daughter-in-law—and former lover—Delphine has everything she thought she wanted: a loving husband and a smart, ambitious son, but she finds herself longing for the passion she shared with Zaki. Her 15-year-old son, Lucky, is an aspiring footballer, but he’s chagrined when his coach puts him in the goalie box. Still, Lucky finds love with his dream girl and success on the football field, growing ever closer to his dream to be on England’s World Cup team. A complex exploration of the ever-changing nature of wants and desires and the consequences of achieving one’s dreams, Farooki’s tale eschews easy answers for the complex, appealing characters that people its pages. --Kristine Huntley", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I am anxious for the next installment in this series because a bit of mystery surrounds it and a new band member is introduced fully.\" -- Cupid's Library Reviews 5 CHERRIES: \"Ms. Ramagos writes a compelling, yet fun novella. I couldn't put this story down. The connections to pop culture and the hockey angle made the story resonate with me. And who wouldn't want to meet a sex god, rock idol? I liked that Ms. Ramagos didn't make the heroine, Melody out to be a groupie. She gave the character her own strong identity, but also added dimensions to her that made her soft and relatable...And the sex scenes! Very hot! I felt like I was really right there with them!

This diary by an elderly German Jew who had a leading position there is one of the most authentic documents helping to understand the sho'ah.\"--Walter Laqueur, author of The Terrible Secret \"The publication of Philipp Manes’ diary is an extraordinary event and its significance in historical and literary terms can hardly be overstated. . . . It is above all the courageous directness and freshness of this record, itsspirit never faltering in the face of misery, which affects the contemporary reader most strongly. . . In the midst of incessant suffering, art and theatre acquire an ability to transcend, thanks solely to the power of words. This power makes itself felt in Philipp Manes’ diary, which is arguably the most important reason why this book deserves to be read today.\" --...", "related": [], "rank": 811036, "title": "As If It Were Life", "author": "Philipp Manes", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After leaving the service, Mallory accepts work as a private security guard in the Green Zone, where his scheme to profit is complicated by his growing attraction to a beautiful local, Tasneen Rahman, whose brother, Abdul, witnessed the abduction of Jeffrey Lamont, an employee of a communications company who turns out to be a Milwaukee beer magnate's black sheep son.

Trail of Thread: A Woman's Westward Journey is the life of Deborah Pieratt as she treks to the new Territory of Kansas. Through her letters we hear stories of humor and despair, along with trail-side camping, cooking and quilting. Readers will feel as if they pulled up stakes and traveled along with Deborah themselves. Thimble of Soil: A Woman's Quest for Land tells how the widow Margaret Ralston Kennedy travels with eight of her thirteen children from Ohio to the territory of Kansas in 1855. Then, while her sons are away fighting to free the Kansas territory from Missouri's pro-slavery forces, Margaret valiantly defends the homestead itself and holds the families together through the savage years of \"Bleeding Kansas\". Stitch of Courage: A Woman's fight for Freedom tells of the orphaned Maggie Kennedy, niece of Margaret and, later, wife of Deborah Pieratt's son. Maggie describes how the women of the new State of Kansas faced the horrors of the Civil War. Women alone banding together to protect their homes and children, never knowing from one day to the next whether their husbands and sons are alive or dead on some far lonely battlefield. Linda Hubalek has paid great attention to historical detail while her gifts as a storytelling draw the reader into the lives and events of her heroines with a charismatic intensity that is rarely equaled and never surpassed. This is historical fiction at its finest as both history and as narrative fiction. Although each book can be obtained separately, the recommendation is for acquiring the entire trilogy. --Midwest Book Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story is set on Atlantian Earth, on board various ships in space, and on the far off world of Eden. It is full of rich characters, monsters and hardware, but it is packaged in a totally different way to anything that's been done before.Although there are many visual centrepieces, it is the relationships between the principal characters and their understanding of each other that is the main focus of the story. At first opposing one another, many of the characters are forced together and learn that they are very much the same despite their very different natures and origins. All the aliens have different viewpoints and agendas; there are no blind killers, and the borders between the good guys and the bad guys are deliberately blurred. The idea is to break through the barriers of both race and creed and to show that all are the same underneath.More information about the story can also be found atthefriendlyambassador.com.Visit the author's website at booksandstories.com.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A smaller house, something with less upkeep and expense but still with plenty of charm, fits the bill for many of today's homeowners. People are rediscovering the joys of cottage living, whether through details such as a built-in window seat, a swing on the front porch or a bathroom fitted with an outdoor shower for washing sandy feet after a stroll on the beach. A cottage need not be grand; as long as it's homey and welcoming, it can still be a wonderful place to call home.  From the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York to Tybee Island off the coast of southern Georgia, Cottages reveals some of the most appealing examples around. A rustic mountain retreat, a sunny southern California casita, and a seaside fishing shack are just some of the classy cottages portrayed here. This book celebrates the joy of having a cottage of our own for kicking off our shoes and taking time to enjoy life.Brian Coleman, MD, is a practicing psychiatrist who divides his time between Seattle and New York. He is an editor with Old House Interiors magazine, as well as the author of thirteen books on the decorative arts, including the popular Scalamandré.Photographer Douglas Keister is America's most noted photographer of historic architecture. His most recent books are Stories in Stone, Courtyards, Silver Palaces and Mobile Mansions. Cottages marks his thirtieth book.  This is Coleman and Keister's second collaboration; their first was the book Classic Cottages.Jacket photos   2007 Douglas KeisterJacket design by Gabriella Hunter", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She did her best to outrun God, but ultimately realized that no one is quite that fast. She gave her life to Christ in 2003. In 2004 she became the Director of Small Groups in the Indiana church where she came to Christ. In 2008, she became the Small Group Network Coordinator. Founded by Saddleback’s Steve Gladen, the SGN is a network for leaders of small group ministry. Through her work with the SGN, Cheryl worked to connect small group ministry leaders across the world so that they might build relationships, encourage one another, and share resources and ideas. She is passionate about discipleship and believes that intentional and focused small groups are powerful tools in that life-long process. In January of 2012 she resigned her position with the SGN to pursue a full-time career writing novels. She holds a Master’s degree in Christian Education and an undergraduate in Creative Writing. She is also the author of one novel, and two reference books on writing. She is married, has three children, and two adorable granddaughters. She enjoys backpacking in the Colorado Rockies and gathering with family at her Indiana lake home on the weekends. Cheryl’s website is www.cherylshireman.com She can also be found on Twitter and Facebook. Her novels include... Life Is But a Dream: On The Lake Life Is But a Dream: On The Mountains Broken Resolutions Cooper Moon: The Calling Cooper Moon: The Temptation She is also the author of the much-loved non-fiction book, You Don't Need a Prince: A Letter To My Daughter.

Greeley is the first to admit how controversial he is. Religious purists attack his fiction as slanderous and racy. Even more divisive is Greeley's open criticism of the Catholic Church, including his denouncing of other priests for failing to handle the rampant pedophilia problem. Although Greeley is not flip or defensive when confronting his critics, he does make it clear that he is a man with a mission, and he will not be stopped from writing fiction or speaking his truth. In his chapter titled \"Pedophile Problems,\" he brazenly writes, \"Nothing has made me feel more contemptuous of my fellow priests--both as individuals and as collectives--than their response to the pedophile crisis.... The bishops in a way are worse.... After blaming the media for the problem, they set up a committee to study the problem, to make a report, and issue vague and feeble guidelines.\" This is the kind of strong writing one can expect from this highly opinionated (and highly admired) man of words and cloth. Arranged as a collection of essays, fans will find plenty of fresh material in this memoir, including chapters about \"Prayers,\" \"Catholic Schools,\" \"The End of the Confident Church,\" and \"Why They Stay--It's the Stories!\"--Gail Hudson", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Oh, you don't do that? It started in high school, I wrote a serial romance novel in a black and white composition book one chapter at a time. As each chapter got finished the book would get passed around to all my friends. They loved it and couldn't get enough. Except one of them left it behind after class one day and the only name on it was mine. I ended up in the Vice-principal's office trying to explain that it was fiction. In his defense, it was written as a journal. He couldn't believe I could know that much about sex and relationships if I hadn't done any of that. I told him he needed to watch more TV. After years of stumbling around in more jobs than any other two people I know, I'm back to writing and loving it! I recently quit my day job to write full-time. Scary! Thrilling!! I am more difficult to work for than my old boss. Who knew? I write for women looking to inject some contemporary romance into their busy lives. To that end my work tends to clock in at about 40- 50 thousand words or about 200+ pages. Short enough that you can read it in between everything else you do but long enough that I can develop the characters a little. Reviews are crucial for a self-published writer so if you review one of my books on the site you got it from send me the link. As a thank you for taking your time I'll send you the full cover art from that book. You can have your own collection!

My husband I had visited Pompeii earlier that year, and I wanted to learn more about the ancient town, which -- as Winnie in The Five-Day Dig notes -- is \"one of the most evocative places in the world.\"One aspect ofThe Five-Day Diginfluenced by the class I took involves ancient scrolls. In the book, TV host Dunk Mortill, determined to save his archaeology show from being cancelled, hopes to find scrolls during an excavation outside Pompeii. At the same time, he suspects a local priest of trying to get to the texts first and suppress them. This idea came from a blog post I stumbled across suggesting there are more scrolls in the real-life Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum, but that the Church is suppressing them for some mysterious reason. ; )When I first started writingThe Dig, I envisioned it as mainly a mystery, but the story wantedto be a romance, so it turned out to be a bit of a mix. The book is also my love letter to Italy and its ancient culture.My latest book is a time-travel romance about a contemporary heroine who winds up in an ancient Roman town. If you read and likeThe Five-Day Dig, please look forTemplum, too. And please stop by my blog at jenmalin.com for info and sample chapters for all of my books!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Deidre Rubenstein beautifully narrates this well-written story, creating subtle nuances between the town's eclectic characters. While Rubenstein's natural Australian voice works for the leading female characters and overall storytelling, when she performs as nasty  town gossips, she speaks quickly, using thick accents and high nasal pitches to create intrusive, irritating characters. She also uses a multitude of speech patterns and diverse dialects to differentiate children from adults, men from women, and one social class from another. Both story and narration are thoroughly engaging and thought provoking.

Mason’s  grief-stricken wife commits suicide and the killer gets off on a  technicality. Seeking salvation, Mason flees San Diego for Chicago. One  night in a seedy bar, Mason gets in a fight with three shady characters,  using his knowledge of martial arts to beat them to a pulp. But one of  the men is the head of a shadowy criminal organization, and sends his  best killer out to seek revenge. As bodies stack up around him, Mason  teams up with an attractive Chicago detective, Tara Rose, to find the  killer before he kills again. Will she heal Mason’s tortured psyche in  the process? Fluharty, a former Vietnam pilot, puts his flight  experience to good use in this novel, and also showcases an authority on  police technique and procedure. The story is briskly paced, and the  narrative remains central without disappearing behind extraneous  information. But, at times, the book’s brevity works against  characterization, specifically Tara. She is one of the central  characters, yet doesn’t appear until one-third of the way through the  story. When she does show up, she throws career and caution to the wind  to fall in to bed with Mason and team up with him on a rogue  investigation; this, despite the fact that she is previously described  as determined to become a police officer. The inconsistencies in  characterization may detract from readers’ enjoyment.An uneven, romantic thriller that will appeal to genre fans.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was heartfelt, funny and fast-paced. We were on the edge of our seats with the trials they went through on their quest for a new home and the characters were relatable and likeable. My son and daughter actually started to call each other Malika and Mashaka soon after we started reading the book and we were all cheering them on 'til the end.

Set within the rough confines of poverty, Caribé's story-though fictional-addresses the experience of Caribbean citizens who risk their lives to reach the promise of a better life in the U.S. After losing her family at sea when a previous escape attempt goes awry, Caribé is more determined than ever to leave behind the Dominican Republic and its looming threats to her safety. As she struggles to raise enough money to both survive and fund her escape, Caribé continues to dodge violent intimidations from Raul, a drug trafficker bent on using her for the trade. Once able to pay for the next yola headed for America, she struggles with the fear, starvation and filth that accompany illegal immigration. Days later, the U.S. Coast Guard stops her boat after it loses engine power, and the dehydrated passengers are transferred to the Coast Guard's cutter to be transported back home. Amid the chaos, Caribé meets Caleb, a young member of the Coast Guard responsible for rescuing her yola; upon returning to Dominican shores, they bond over the rescue. Caleb's crew regularly returns to the port, so he begins to see Caribé for meals, drinks and travel, before they exchange contact information and make plans for future visits. As Caleb falls for her, despite mocking from his crew, Caribé works to maintain an image that hides her hardships from him. Their love growing, the couple faces challenges to their relationship from forces greater than themselves-the complex, tragic systems of nationality and privilege that govern the world...the rewarding passages artfully capture love confronting the region's unavoidable ethnic and national stigmas.", "related": ["B00KG252XM"], "rank": 8948, "title": "A Place for You", "author": "Mike Christian", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Greenlanders in recent years have begun to introduce sheep and even cattle to their lonely farms. We were told that not for three years had the local lads been able to drive their Toyota pickups across the ice of Eriksfjord to visit the girls at Brattahlid.) I also spent some days in the less scenic surroundings of the Library of Congress in Washington DC, researching the history of the airfield, and especially sussing out the legend that Hospital Valley--a lonely meadow above the airfield--once was the site of a ghastly warehouse where terribly wounded soldiers of the Korean War were kept, because they were too frightful to be sent home. Was there any truth to this? Of course not, but the tour guide at the local museum is still peddling the myth, and if you have stood among the wildflowers in the incredible stillness of Hospital Valley, you can understand why people believe it is haunted.

Her college years were spent mastering stalking as a viable alternative to dating. In fact, she found one young man so captivating that she rented the vacant apartment beneath his. Despite his predilection for loudly playing Smokey Robinson's \"Tears of a Clown\" prior to dawn each morning, Ms. Bergstrom maintained that the situation was preferable to an actual relationship. Consequently, she grew lonely. One night in a crowded bar she looked up from her beer and announced to anyone who would listen, \"I'm going to marry a cowboy\". She drove from Massachusetts to Colorado, found a man who drove a pickup, chewed tobacco and wore Wranglers.

In his bold, incisive analyses, Franko dispels many of the myths surrounding Graham to reveal, in their place, a brilliant, conflicted, more human artist.\"--Gay Morris, author ofA Game for Dancers: Performing Modernism in the Postwar Years\"This book places Graham's mature work from the period 1938-53 in its social and cultural context through close readings of archival material, some of which has only recently emerged.

Franko creates a much clearer historical account of this than existing work on Graham and points to previously unexamined aspects of her work with psycho-drama that, in effect, anticipate later developments in dance theatre.\"--Ramsay Burt, De Montfort University\"Through the complex interweaving of Graham's work and life Franko creates a striking cultural study that combines analyses of politics, psychoanalysis, advertising, and manuscript materials.

The story's underlying adventure focuses on Moralin, who has been secretly trained in the art of combat by her grandfather, Old Tamlin. Moralin is one of the highborn Delagua people who live securely in a walled city. Her need for friendship makes her join three other girls on a forbidden journey beyond the city walls on the eve of their entry into temple service, a transition into womanhood. This decision catapults her into life-threatening adventures. Once outside the safety of the city walls, the girls are captured by the Arkera, the enemies of the Delagua. Kurtz spins an intricate yarn with one danger leading to another. Old Tamlin's wise teachings bolster Moralin's courage as she pretends to cooperate while planning her escape. She forms an alliance with Figt, a girl charged with watching over her, and the two eventually become true friends, willing to risk their lives for one another. Philosophical underpinnings show the selfish goals of each society without regard to the world as a whole. As Moralin's spiritual guardian, Cora Linga, has said in a dream, \"humans hardly ever get it right.\" Though often confusing and with emphasis on plot over rich character development, this intriguing story with its strong heroine will appeal to fantasy fans.Renee Steinberg, formerly at Fieldstone Middle School, Montvale, NJCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Following a brief teaching career in Hancock, New York, Donna married and relocated to her husband’s home state, Michigan, where she has been living since December 1971.  Donna’s writing career began in 1982 while working full time for an electronics firm. She resigned from her job in 1984 following a contract offer for her first book. Since then, Thomas Nelson Publishers, Zondervan Publishing House, Guideposts, and Bigwater Publishing have published her novels. Her husband, Fred, a former American History teacher, shares her enthusiasm for history. Together, they visit historical sites, restored villages, and museums, purchasing books and reference materials for use in Donna’s research. In preparation for writing Bluebird of Brockport, they spent a month traveling along the Erie Canal, visiting canal towns and museums. Fascinating historical stories of the Erie Canal inspired her to compile True Stories of the Erie Canal.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Featuring Coop, Sean, and Matt, this title follows the same vein of humor and fun as the previous two books. This time Sean takes the spotlight, so the book is told from his perspective. The plot revolves around another one of Coop's crazy schemes: to make a short horror movie and win the $50,000 prize at Rockville's TerrorFest. The problem is that the trio has no script, no money, and no equipment. At first, Sean is reluctant to go along with the plan, but when his parents announce that he will be sharing a room with his twin sister because a baby is on the way, he quickly agrees to the movie so that he can use his share of the prize money to build a new room on his house. Sean is a nice guy who experiences some embarrassing and hilarious life lessons throughout the story. He goes from wanting a relationship with one girl to finding himself involved in three relationships-all very different and comical. Plenty of realistic teen lingo and situations can be found here. Narrator Nick Podehl gives an outstanding performance and makes each character come alive for listeners.

His passions are evident in his writing, his speaking, and his consulting work.  He is passionate about ethical business conduct, integrity, and fair dealing.  This is evident in his book Mortgage Rip-Offs:  Learn the Secret to Saving Thousands Before You Apply.  This was evident during his early days as a mortgage loan originator when he literally walked away from $30,000 in commissions rather than be a party to bait-and-switch marketing tactics.  This is evident in his approach to both life coaching and business coaching and consulting. In a recent interview, Pat said, “One of the greatest challenges for those who are thinking about working with a coach or consultant is finding someone who is well trained and who takes an ethical and integrous approach to working with clients.  Sadly, there are far more professionals who attempt to create dependent relationships than those whose aim is to work at solving challenges and moving on.  I was very fortunate to have had extensive training not just in coaching, but also communication skills and ethics.” In addition to his active coaching and consulting practice, Mr. Mazor is working on his next book which presents a unique and practical approach to creating, what Pat calls, the success filled life.  When asked about this, he said, “Think of it this way.  We have all heard stories about successful people who, growing up, learned that they could accomplish anything they set their minds to; that this had a huge influence on their self-confidence.  Most of us did not grow up hearing that but all of us could have.  It’s never too late to believe that.  Over these last two years, I have been researching that very notion - that beliefs and belief systems can be modified.  They can and incredible pathways open up when negative beliefs are modified to empowering beliefs.  Conducting the research and working on the new book has been really exciting.” His second book is scheduled for publication Fall, 2013.", "related": ["B0080Z6LLE"], "rank": 1283209, "title": "Mortgage Rip-Offs", "author": "Pat Mazor", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 27.0}

Tactical management is the planning, organization, direction and supervision ofavailable meansto a chosen end.Project and Process Management are the crucial tactical management skill sets. Like a left hand and a right hand, they are complementary and most effective when their relationship is understood and exploited.The purpose of this book is to establish a solid-ground framework for process and project management. Through small and easy steps, you will increase your knowledge of tactical management and your confidence in evaluating the latest techniques and fads of this discipline.In this book, you will find basic answers to questions such as:How do experienced project managerscope with change? How can youmanage without criticizing? What basic issues does a theoretical approach to process and project management sometimes overlook? What is capability, capacity, sigma, earned value, utilization, measurement precision, linearity, stability, uncertainty? What is the difference between strategic and tactical management? Why do Information Technology tools for project and process management sometimes fall short and create confusion through unintended consequences?If you have been blitzed with management training that has left you with more questions than answers, then take a look at this book. In my experience, if the foundation is right, the more advanced material falls easily into place.", "related": [], "rank": 2193578, "title": "Thirty Seven Ideas For Tactical Managers*", "author": "Ron Parker", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lavinia has lived all over the UK but currently resides in London, England. She has travelled extensively to places including Africa, Asia, Australia, America and most of Europe. Although some of her books are set in Texas she has never visited the state but plans to spend time there in the near future. She is an avid reader and her favourite authors include J L Langley, Carol Lynne, Chris Owen and Andrew Grey. Lavinia particularly loves supernatural fiction and her favourite authors in this genre include Kelly Armstrong, Keri Arthur and Charlaine Harris. Although Lavinia is a huge fan of the romance genre, she will admit to reading anything and everything. She loves horror, a good thriller and if a book has the capacity to make her cry, well, all the better. One thing she does insist on in a book however, regardless of genre is a happy ending, so you will always find one in the books she writes.", "related": ["B008NXA7OU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a revelation of human behavior and how we act, not realizing the consequences of our actions. The characters of each story belong to different age groups and are from different walks of life. The stories revolve around characters taken from our day to day life, making it easy for readers to identify with them. The stories are crisp, short, and funny and the skillful narration by the author makes it an exciting read.", "related": ["B00DUQ121C"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has helped thousands of people discover the bodies, and more importantly, the lives of their dreams. There is a reason that people travel from all over the world to her little studio in Boston. A place where science meets support and transformation happens every day. \"I am you....the everyday woman that needed a way to change and reshape my body and my life. I started out with genetics that would predispose me to be overweight (most of my family is overweight), with a body type that blessed me with \"thunder thighs\" and a fitness and athletic training background that left me with a body I did not like (I once had those huge overdeveloped muscles) coupled with chronic back, neck and knee pain. I knew that there had to be a better way. A smarter way, a workout that could be truly challenging, but not leave a person feeling like they were beaten up. A lifestyle that did not require a person to be a professional dancer to feel elegant or a Zen Master to be centered, a way to be the weight that I wanted to be that also involved a cocktail and pizza! There had to be a way to simplify all of the confusion, the feelings of \"good\" days vs. \"bad\" days. The endless roller coaster of emotions that fitness and health often bring! A way to have fun and love myself and my body. So, being the geek that I am, I went into full research mode. I began studying and guinea-pigging everything from Pilates to weight training, stretching and resistance training, chi-gong, Chinese medical theory, tai chi, martial arts, yoga, various meditation disciplines, and cardiovascular methods on myself. I looked at the effects both aesthetically and emotionally of each one of these modalities on my body and my mind. I spent countless hours researching and focusing on the kinesiology of the body (how it moves) as well as how different exercises and lifestyle patterns affect the shape and health of the body and the spirit in general...\" The result?

An introduction to lectio divina and leader's notes are included.\"Stephen Binz has bridged the gap between contemplative biblical study and practical application. This is a rare achievement that many readers of Scripture will find profound and spiritually formative.\"--Thomas C. Oden, general editor, Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture\"In the Ancient-Future Bible Study series, Stephen Binz opens our minds, imaginations, and hearts to the experience of Scripture that God intends. In each book he leads us through the movements of lectio divina so that by understanding the Word and meditating on it we are drawn closer to the Lord in prayer and prompted to act on it. I believe that users of this series will encounter the Holy Spirit and find themselves enfolded in God's love.\"--Bert Ghezzi, author,Adventures in Daily Prayer\"The Ancient-Future Bible Study series revives a simple, time-honored framework for listening to God's voice known as lectio divina. This framework does not so much constrain as bring liberty--liberty to explore, to listen, and to grow. Stephen Binz's work is carefully considered, richly textured, and solidly grounded.

Plagued by endless painful emotions, confusion, hatred and rage, a mind can, in essence, create an inner world of death more terrifying and vile than any movie or news report.That internal film is always playing; unfettered by human laws or reasons to restrain, this 'soul footage'can roll horrific scenes of unrestrained mass murder and human debasement. Who is the wiser if he pillages and murders inside of his own mind? Who can imprison him for perpetrating these despicable yet abstract deeds? What of this inner world... this inner hell where everything and anything can come to pass? Is it all in the imagination, or are there(real) malevolent forces behind the curtain?And so I was intrigued by \"The Mind's Eye,\" the lense that goes above and beyond mere three-dimensional reality and can penetrate the illusion that, at closer scrutiny, is perhaps more real than what our physical eyes can display. Yet the horrors that appear before theMind's Eyeare a mere reflection of the destructive choices that the character makes. So what if we took this character and placed him in a hopeless path of self - destruction, a path so irrevocable and vile that it actually fueled the mental machinations?And this inner hell that he creates is the only outlet that he has for the suffering and psychological pain that assaults him day and night, a direct result of the insanely-destructive choices that he makes, knowing that his demise looms, but pressing on nonetheless, and with glee and defiance.What can he do to find relief but to reach out and soothe the misery with liquids, powders, pebbles and any other compound he can find? But that is not enough; the more he partakes, the more he craves, and the more he craves, the more his life falls apart, and the more he loses control, the more he is consumed with hate and rage, and as his emotions collapse, the more horrifying are the visions, dreams and apparitions, all leading to the very center of his existence where he meets his archenemy and tormentor.  And so, towards the end of this volume he says: \"I crown myself theKING\nOF PAIN, walking down my self-made Calvary with the world's crosses on my\nback, on the pathway to becoming my own self-righteous martyr.\"This statement was somewhat of a shock to me when it came because it showed that, somewhere inside his corrupted mind, there is an awareness that shows him flashes of truth and clarity. Together, we shall discover his fate.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Circumstances took him back to south Florida in late 1981, and he made a fateful decision to go to Key West for a weekend. The weekend turned into more than thirty years. It led him to life experiences he would not have imagined before. Some of these experiences inspired him to write music and screenplays. He continues to write and works with producer Anne O’Shea as a co-producer, composer, and screenwriter. He serves as organist and Lay Minister at the First Congregational Church of Key West, where he delivered the sermons that make up this book.", "related": [], "rank": 4824614, "title": "The Fantasy Passport: Sailing on Faith", "author": "Robert J.

I spent nine months a year for the first five years of my life in the hospital undergoing surgeries. My first two years in high school were in the seminary, until I decided I wasn't cut out for the priesthood. I joined the Army right out of high school and spent nearly ten years in the Service. While on active duty in the Army, I competed nationally for a Division Rifle Team and was also a member of a Post Skydiving Team.  I've made 1,400 Parachute jumps; over 1,100 of those jumps were free-falls from over 12,000 feet and 21 of the jumps were HALO jumps (HALO is a military acronym for High Altitude, Low Opening) meaning the jumper exits the aircraft from over 20,000 feet and is under 1,000 feet when the chute is deployed.  It was used as an insertion method for covert operations. Since leaving the service I have been involved in the computer industry for nearly forty years doing everything from computer programming to Company President. I have always been an avid hunter and enjoy the outdoors, especially when I'm in the woods or mountains.", "related": ["B00FED5D8C"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Since childhood, Nicole has been guilty of daydreaming a little too much. One of her favorite pastimes is staring into space, dreaming up stories, characters, lives, and dimensions when she really should be accomplishing other things. She parlayed her love of creating first into a career as a freelance writer and then into fiction writing. Her favorite genres are paranormal fiction and romance, followed closely by horror. A long time Pennsylvanian, Nicole spends her days writing, soaking up books, teaching her five children how to be weird (in a good way), dancing for the endorphins and gardening.", "related": ["B00DDF7UB6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 22.0}

This is a well-written intricate series of books that pick up where the previous book left off, so it is definitely not a standalone.Cosmos made an appearance in the first and subsequent books and is the reason for all the ruckus. The portal he created brought humans and Prime into contact and the rest is history. Prime have a population problem that human women can help fix, and we are more than compatible. Cosmos found out in the last book that he and Terra, daughter of the high chancellor of the Prime, are bonded mates. Problem is Daddy doesn't want his daughter mated to a scrawny human. Bigger problem is Cosmos isn't going to take no for an answer, and he'll show it takes more than brawn to protect a woman.This was another story that I devoured in this series, and look forward to many more. Both Cosmos and Terra were well-defined as people, but Cosmos a little more so since the reader has had much more interaction with him throughout the books. There is a sense of humor prevalent throughout the books and this one in particular when it comes to punishing the high chancellor for his egotistical behavior concerning his daughter. As usual, there is lots of build up to the big sexual bonding as well as updates on the previous romances and how they are coming along. A long-running story line came to a conclusion in this book and I have to wonder where the author is going to go next. - Night Owl Reviews", "related": ["B00K94J2OW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 43, "rating_average": 4.814, "rating_total": 207.0}

I am more curious than imaginative by nature and have always been interested in the hows and whys of life. As a young child and well into my teenage years my goals were to become the first woman on the moon (a fantasy at the time . . . long before space travel), and to become a famous doctor who discovered the cure for cancer or some equally horrible disease.Even though neither of those goals became a reality, my interest in science and how things work - especially the human body - has never waned. I continue to read voraciously and write about subjects that interest me. My goal is not only to share my findings with others, but hopefully to inform and help others with their own personal explorations.Even though I am in my senior years, I still enjoy a healthy physical body and a mind that still seems to work on a very high level. I look forward to many more years of research and writing about any and all subjects that interest me. I hope you will choose to travel that road with me through my books.", "related": ["B00D192118"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That is exactly what this amazing book, Creativity, 63 Short Lessons To A Happier Life by Andrew Goodman helps you to do.There isn't any padding in this book; not one page is wasted with irrelevant information.  Instead, each exercise is explained over the course of two to three pages.   All the ones that I've read and tried myself are easy to follow and usually only require one's time and dedicated attention to complete.  Each exercise has a unique purpose, such as for solving a complex life problem, helping to make difficult decisions, opening up the creative process, or allowing the person to think beyond their own self-imposed limitations to newer possibilities.  Using these lessons, one can begin unlocking their full potential.There is little doubt that people who are searching for inspiration will definitely enjoy Creativity.  While many books offer the reader only empty rhetoric about changing their lives, this is one of the few self-help books that I've ever encountered which offers a roadmap to getting from point A to point B.   Best of all, there isn't any preaching to be found within Creativity.  Instead, the whole point is that the reader begin exploring their own minds instead of that of the author, that they use the provided exercises to uncover hidden potential, reveal amazing self-truths, and examine their motivations for doing things which they may have not realized existed before.  Once we know more about ourselves and are better able to cast away the limitations and anxieties that seek to chain us to our daily routines, we can finally find happier, more fulfilling lives.  Creativity helps us to get there more quickly than we otherwise would have on our own by offering us these brilliant, quick exercises.Since I started with the exercises in this book, I not only feel better but I believe I'm a better person.  I have more knowledge of myself, my motivations, and the negative influences that can affect my happiness to a greater degree than I ever had before.  This has allowed for me to sustain better relationships with people in my life as well as to become more creative and content in my personal life.  If you feel like that life has gotten you down and there doesn't seem to be any way out of your self-imposed trap, then you're dead wrong.   Understanding the real problems that are often obfuscated due to the inability to reflect on our own selves will help for you to improve your mood and life in general.  Start with a few exercises from Creativity, an excellent book for delving into your own mental processes and finally understanding yourself.  I recommend it for all those who are lost in life and need a little guidance.   Carolyn Post, ReviewerInspireZine Self-Help Reviews", "related": [], "rank": 580157, "title": "Creativity, 63 short exercises to a Happier Life eBook", "author": "Dr. Andrew M.

Rather an energetic child, she studied ballet for a while, quickly moving on to ballroom and Latin American dancing. She was educated in north London and gained a BA Honours degree in Fine Art Painting at Norwich School of Art in 1986. Susan taught Art and Design in a number of schools in Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire during the 1980s and 1990s. She found that aerobics, yoga and swimming were excellent ways of keeping fit and coping with the demands of a teaching career. She also decided to buy a motorbike and obtain her motorbike licence so she could zoom around the countryside more easily. In 2001 Susan decided to explore the southern French Alps and ended up making her home there. Her main passions in life continue to be Art, Literature and Music. Susan's outdoor pursuits are landscape photography, hiking in the mountains and skiing. In 2012 she published a book entitled \"The History of Serre Chevalier and Briançon\" which was the first detailed history of her adopted French valley written in English. She has also produced a series of watercolours depicting scenes from the Serre Chevalier valley. Susan is a firm believer in the creative process. Like many other artists or writers she has found that an idea for a book or painting often suggests or imposes itself. She enjoys the challenge of bringing the idea to life and communicating it to others.", "related": [], "rank": 3105079, "title": "Family Holidays in a Motorhome", "author": "Susan Lomas", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From skydiving in Alaska to scuba diving in Hawaii, Carmouché has traveled the world seeking adventure and it is apparent in the books she writes  and workshops she gives.  Her adventures include riding camels in Africa, swimming under the stars in Puerto Rico, dancing salsa in Ecuador, and walking the cobblestone roads of Assisi, Italy. She has also found fulfillment working with the homeless, disabled and orphans in Argentina and Mexico and in the United States.  Her most cherished moments, however, have been watching her two beautiful daughters grow and strive to accomplish their own dreams. Despite all of these amazing experiences, she has survived many struggles. There was a time she felt defeated, but now she is recommitted to savoring experiences both in the novels she writes and in the life she lives. She is committed to helping others in her coaching, workshops and in serving the marginalized. Her secret hope is that anyone who is struggling will realize there is a light at the end of the tunnel and no matter how hard the fight, no matter how many times they have been knocked down, it is always worth staggering up to their feet and learning to breathe again.", "related": [], "rank": 1559812, "title": "Pictures, Lies and Promises (The Alaskan Heart Saga Book 4)", "author": "Tiffany Carmouche", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 72.0}

Other textbooks tend to work with a checklist of subjects as they summon the major religions serially to the stage. Kripal starts instead with the mystery of the comparative act itself, allowing that to determine what he brings forward for our attention. So it’s charisma, sex, the paranormal, and ‘soul practices’ more than it’s Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam. Kripal recognizes the comparativist in each of us and urges us to take it seriously. The result is deep and wide, and excitingly open-minded.”John Stratton Hawley, Barnard College, Columbia University“Armed with an extensive array of case studies and a richly diverse portfolio of illustrations, Kripal not only provides a lucid survey of the ‘facts’ of the world’s religions, but inspires us to embrace the fundamentally transcendent nature of the religious experience in all of its manifestations, both ordinary and uncanny, and to confront the inherent challenges of studying religion in a responsibly comparative manner.Comparing Religionsis a masterly example of how a book intended for the classroom can be an invigorating stimulus toward new ways of thinking about a phenomenon that pervades every aspect of our world.”Sarah Iles Johnston, The Ohio State University“Kripal is at his very best in this exceptional introduction to the study of religion. After a self-reflexive journey through the religious realms of myth, ritual, nature, science, sex, charisma, soul, salvation, and the imagination and its paranormal powers, we are guided to put it all back together with an eye to religious tolerance, freedom, and pluralism. This book is the red pill. Ingest it and you will be enlightened.”April D. DeConick, Rice University“Comparing Religionsis a lucid, entertaining, and even fun introduction to the comparative study of religion. It will be effective with its target audience, young people and the undergraduate classroom, because, while they must wrestle with the way scholars deconstruct and reduce to social or evolutionary functions such phenomena, Kripal never loses sight of the experiences and meanings of those transformed by, engaged in, and mobilized through it. There is no better single volume to entice students into the fraught and fascinating study of religion.”Bron Taylor, author ofDark Green Religion: Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Futureand editor ofThe Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature“Jeffrey Kripal provides a thoughtful and compelling discussion of key themes, ideas, and challenges that ground the study of religion across traditions and geographies. It is a layered and textured treatment that will capture the imagination and engage students from start to finish. This important and timely text is not to be missed.”Anthony B.

I re-discovered Iris Littleton and Henry Mayfield in 2013 and realized that they still resonated in my heart. In several weeks, I was able to draft the bones of a longer work, the words practically pouring onto the page.The story was inspired by a visit with my mother and father to my paternal grandparents' grave located in Highland County, Virginia. Much of the imagery in the book emerged from this visit one cold March day. While the story is set in the fictional town of Maple Gap, astute readers will recognize a loose interpretation of Monterey. Nonetheless, Maple Gap exists solely in my mind - created from bits and pieces of life in the Shenandoah Valley - from Winchester in the North to Lynchburg in the South. The flood, for example, was inspired by a tragedy that occurred in Nelson County during Hurricane Camille in 1969. Over 150 people were drowned or buried in mudslides that night, their bodies crushed between boulders and uprooted trees. Many were never found, entombed in the mud.The Winter Calfdraws from many genres. There are obvious elements of horror; pivotal scenes occur in a graveyard. The novel can be considered Southern Gothic, reminiscent of Harper Lee, Truman Capote, and Flannery O'Connor. The book can also be described as magical realism; it hints at a ghost story. It draws heavily from Appalachian folklore -- focusing upon the wise but misunderstood mountain witch who is hiding from the world. Some would describeThe Winter Calfas a coming of age story - the story of how two boys from very different worlds are changed when a strange woman enters their life. Finally, like James Herriot's veterinary tales or Steinbeck'sThe Red Pony,The Winter Calfis a rural story about life on a farm - a boy dreaming of raising a calf.The story focuses on three primary characters. Iris Littleton is the old recluse on the hill that everyone says is a witch. Folks in town say she murdered her five-year-old son - and waits for his return. Henry Mayfield is the wide-eyed but stubborn boy who dreams of raising a calf for the county fair. After an accident, Henry is terrified when he has to knock on Iris' door one winter day. Jerome Bigman is the school bully and Henry's nemesis; he dreams of killing his abusive father.WritingThe Winter Calfwas an emotional experience. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading it.", "related": ["B00HQLKVJG"], "rank": 162548, "title": "The Winter Calf (The Maple Gap Series Book 1)", "author": "Michael S.

This turned out to be the high point of his academic career. After barely graduating from Calvin College in 1992 with a philosophy degree, he was fired from a variety of jobs, before moving to California, where he stumbled into software development. As this job required neither punctuality nor a sense of direction, he excelled at it.

My last work was'Alien Enigma'which I co-authored with the prolific Darrell Bain. It was a Space Navy story that left me with a desire to do something more in the Military/ Space Marine genre. I'd been fascinated with stories of Alien Greys, telepathy and remote viewing. I'd read about the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency's Stargate Project and the military application of remote viewing and wondered how humanity could fight a powerful telepathic species? It sure wouldn't be easy. I also wanted to incorporate my usual desire for some comedy without losing the seriousness of the story. I later worked with an agent who wanted to sell the story to Hollywood for a 3D TV series (he's still trying), so we worked together on making a TV series treatment and slightly modified the characters to make them more interesting and superhero like. I really believe this story would make a great TV series or movie.  When I did the cover with artist Steven Youll, we wanted a cover that looked like a movie poster. In fact, we plan to make actual posters from the book cover art. Steve has done book covers for Star Wars books, Asimov and others. I loved his artistic style and was proud to have him do the cover for'Extinction'. I think 'Extinction'is best summed up by Ron Baker, a Kindle reviewer who wrote:\"Fresh take on alien greys and their interaction with the human race and universe. This complex story includes many elements I like in my science fiction. Reads like pulp fiction with a touch of humor. I also give this book credit for feeling like a stand alone novel even when it is a first book of a series.\"Hope my fans enjoy the story as I really enjoyed writing it.Tony TeoraSan Diego", "related": ["B00LDCER4E"], "rank": 657375, "title": "Extinction (Extraterrestrial Empire Book 1) eBook", "author": "Tony Teora", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 4.1667, "rating_total": 50.0}
