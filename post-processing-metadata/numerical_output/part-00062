Unseen projectiles ripped through palm trees, mangling fronds and scattering birds from their nests. Dirt and smoke filled the sky, momentarily blocking out the sun.The sudden impact of something weighty rammed into Kiki Brill's back, cutting off her scream. She plummeted forward onto the hard-packed earth, scraping her knees and elbows.Heaviness smothered her, trapping her flat against the ground and knocking the breath from her lungs in a whoosh.Panic shot through her brain in a fireworks display of red and white. She struggled against the bulky weight, clawing at the dirt, trying to breathe, to gain some leverage to get out from beneath whatever had landed on her.Desperation labored in her lungs. The stench of fertilizer overwhelmed her senses.\"Hey, watch it!\" a male voice close to her ear shouted.Fresh panic tore a path through her mind and pumped adrenaline in her veins. She twisted and bucked, needing to free herself of the man atop her.A momentary easing of the man's weight renewed her efforts. She kicked and pushed, managing to scramble away.She jumped to her feet ready to bolt, but as her gaze landed on the man, her heart stalled and cemented her to the spot.What?Ryan McClain, his richly made business suit covered in dirt and fertilizer, sat on his backside on the path leading to the greenhouse. Muck caked his dark hair and his turbulent, mocha-colored eyes stared at her with a mixture of panic and bewilderment.She forced a breath in and coughed, spitting out dusty gunk that matched the floating bits in the air.Her mind tried to make sense of what had happened. Something had exploded. Ryan McClain was sitting at her feet. Innately she knew he'd used his body to shield her, protecting her from the blast.Fear gripped her in a tight vise.Tutu?Her gaze jerked to the main house, just past the greenhouse where she'd been headed. The thatched roof and clapboard-sided structure still stood, looking undamaged.\"Tutu!\" she yelled anyway, and ran for the front door, aware of Ryan vaulting to his feet and running behind her.Grandmother Kaapa stood on the porch, her dark eyes wide with panic, but otherwise she seemed unhurt. Even at barely five feet tall, Lana Kaapa had a commanding presence.Lana's long, dark, gray-streaked hair was gathered into a loose bun, and a hibiscus blossom rested at her ear. Her blue-and-white floral housedress reached her ankles and revealed the ballerina-style slippers Kiki had brought her from Philadelphia.Kiki launched herself into her grandmother's arms.\"You're okay?\" Kiki gasped, panting in terror.\"Yes, dear.\" Tutu pulled Kiki back to inspect her. Tears gathered in her eyes. \"Are you hurt?\"Kiki shook her head as relief spread through her system, but the panic and fear wouldn't release their grip. \"What happened?\"Tutu shook her head, anxiety clouding her eyes. \"I don't know. I was resting and I heard a loud bang. I came out to see this.\" She gestured with her hand toward the small grassy yard and beyond to the crops of plant life, which stretched to the cliffs that kept the Kaapa Flower farm in business.Kiki turned to look and sucked in a sharp breath. A dark layer of grime coated everything—the swaying Tahitian ginger plants, the various colored proteas, the sunny cup of gold blossoms and all the other plants. Even the porch was dusted with gunk.She could feel the filth on her own skin through the cotton of her T-shirt and her green board shorts. Could see it floating in the air.Then her gaze landed on Ryan at the foot of the stairs, his expression concerned as he stared back at her. The memory of what he'd done hit her smack in the middle. He'd used his body to shield her from the explosion.Kiki turned to her grandmother. \"Call the police, please, Tutu.\"Looking dazed with worry, Tutu nodded and headed back inside.Facing Ryan, Kiki said, \"Thank you.\" She suddenly felt self-conscious as she descended the porch steps. She could only assume she looked as filthy as he did. His navy pinstriped suit was ruined and his once-shiny black shoes would need more than just a polish. \"Do you know what happened?\"His troubled brown gaze met hers. \"I just got here. Saw you, headed over to talk to you, and as I closed in something wentka-boom.\"Something? Her gaze searched for the origin of the explosion. She walked down the path toward where the company trucks were parked. \"My fertilizer truck!\"Ryan joined her on the path. \"Itwasyour fertilizer truck. I'd say that's what we have all over us.\"Slanting him a sideways glance, her lip curled upward. \"You think?\"He grinned. That same drop-dead grin that he'd used on her the first time he'd come to the flower farm five months ago to try to buy her out. Only now that smile held more charm and appeal, even coated with flecks of dirt.He'd protected her, putting his own life in jeopardy.Her heart did a double Dutch jump. But then a thought occurred to her. She narrowed her gaze. Had he blown up her truck? Distrust wound itself around her in a choking grip.The squeal of sirens filled the air, distracting her. Two police cars sped up the dirt drive that ran alongside the fenced-in crop of indigenous and exotic flowers, a cloud of dust billowing in their wake.She turned on her bare heel and walked back toward to the front yard. Tutu was already waiting to greet the officers. Two men stepped out of each car.\"The explosion came from the fertilizer truck,\" Kiki yelled and pointed the way.While three of the officers headed in the direction of the smoldering remains of the fertilizer truck, one man came straight to Tutu. Nikolao Abiko, Kiki's kalabash-cousin, the Hawaiian term for close as a cousin but not by blood.Tall, handsome and very much Hawaiian, Nikolao had been around Kiki her whole life. Seeing him here in an official capacity in his navy uniform with its yellow patches didn't feel right, wasn't normal.But nothing about this day was normal.She swung around to tell Ryan he should go and rammed smack into him. His warm breath fanned over her cheek.\"Hey.\" She gestured with her hands. \"Have you never heard of personal space?\"His dark eyes flashed with humor as he stepped back. \"Sorry. Didn't mean to intrude inside your bubble.\"She approached Tutu and Nik in the driveway with Ryan on her heels.Surprise and recognition showed in Tutu's eyes. \"Ryan McClain, I thought that was you. By the looks of it, you've been here for a while.\"Ryan smiled wryly. \"Yes. For a bit.\"Ryan took Tutu's fragile hand. Even after years of sun and despite her own natural darker Hawaiian skin tone, the blue veins beneath her thinning skin could be seen.He brought her hand to his mouth and placed a kiss on her knuckles. \"How are you, Auntie Lana?\"Using the traditional title of Auntie for someone older than one's self showed respect in the Hawaiian culture. Kiki was impressed, even though she didn't want to be. He at least hadn't come to the island thumbing his nose at their customs.Kiki rolled her eyes as her grandmother's smile widened.\"Gotta love a man with classy manners,\" Tutu commented, her worried dark eyes showing appreciation.Kiki would give him the manners, but his charm could only be calculated and didn't fool her for a moment. No man that suave could be sincere.Tutu made the introduction to Nik. \"Ryan McClain, this is Officer Nik Abiko.\"As Ryan's gaze turned to Nik, the charm receded, and in its place was a shrewder look that matched the one in Nik's eyes. \"Officer.\" Ryan put out his hand.The men shook hands. \"McClain. I have to ask what you are doing here,\" Nik said.\"Mr. McClain was just leaving,\" Kiki interjected. No way did she want Ryan to explain the purpose of his visit with Tutu standing there, because he undoubtedly had come back to take another run at buying their land.

Of course Tutu knew. Why else would McClain have come back other than to try to buy the farm from them?Nik arched an eyebrow. \"Care to enlighten me?\"\"I represent a developer and a group of investors who would like to purchase the land from the Kaapa family,\" Ryan explained, and handed Nik a business card.\"We are not selling,\" Kiki stated for everyone to hear, while she stared hard at Ryan, willing him to back off. She didn't want to upset Tutu any further; she'd had enough trauma for one day.Nik slanted Kiki a glance full of censure as he took the card and stared at it for a moment before pocketing it. \"So your visit here is purely business?\"\"For the most part. I do hope to present Mrs. Kaapa with a new offer to buy her property, but I also hope to learn to bodysurf,\" Ryan said, his mocha-colored eyes full of determination.Kiki groaned inwardly. Great. The sweet-talking charmerwasbent on convincing her grandmother to sell. Well, Kiki wouldn't let him.\"Is that your rental parked over there?\" Nik asked, drawing Ryan's attention away.Kiki glanced at the white, or rather the once-white, Mustang convertible parked beneath a tree.

His characters crack jokes (not young Thomas--at least, not often\nenough), do housework, agonize over whether or not to invest money in buying a\nblack slave, and travel through a New York world utterly alien toZagat'sorGossip Girl.

In contrast to George Whitefield's Calvinism, Wesley embraced the Arminian doctrines that were dominant in the 18th-century Church of England. Methodism in both forms was a highly successful evangelical movement in the United Kingdom, which encouraged people to experience Jesus Christ personally. Wesley's teachings, known as Wesleyanism, provided the seeds for the modern Methodist movement, the Holiness movement, Pentecostalism, the Charismatic Movement, and Neo-charismatic churches, which encompass numerous denominations across the world. In addition, he refined Arminianism with a strong evangelical emphasis on the Reformed doctrine of justification by faith.", "related": ["B00AVYSUQQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Blended into gorgeous rhythms, images, these voices entertain and enrich, but in this collection we also see Gibbons filing his talons for a fight. In beginning of the 20th century, William Carlos Williams declared that it s difficult to get the news from poems, but many die miserably every day for lack of what is found there. With Blue Horizon, Gibbons is at the height of his power and keenly aware of the stakes in the beginning of our 21st century. Unflinchingly, Gibbons poems handle bullies of all the varietals: the fink president of America ; the skulking boy who takes your lunch money; the tiny, ugly ones inside us clenching keys and camped at the gates of our hopes and ambitions. These poems fear none of these folks, and want you to feel the same way. These poems deliver the daily news and do not fear rain or snow or a few fenced, barking dogs on the way to pitching you the latest updates! James Jay, poetry series editor, Two Dogs Press --Two Dogs PressA guy who loves his wife, his sons, his cat, Ed Lahey, Ray Carver, Pabst Blue Ribbon, the Irish, Indians, and Montana can t be all bad--especially if he does the loving in strong, clear poetry a woman might recite from her barstool to a couple of dusty dharma carpenters. Love is alive and well in the outer provinces of art, thanks to poets like Mark Gibbons.  Greg Keeler, Epiphany at Goofy's Gas & Trash Fish --Two Dogs PressThe true poet says from behind his thirty ton eighteen wheeler: Lay down your life for love. Mark Gibbons takes us on the road and into the machinery of the night, where none of us swims the black waters alone. These poems; visceral, pulsing, come from the relentless drive of a working man's heart, then confound us with the simplicity of truth and the roar of the philosopher. There's lightning in these poems, reader, and when it strikes you cannot remain the same.

Then, a game of truth or dare causes her best friend to turn against her, and everything changes. It falls to frenemy Jenna to remind her that standing up for yourself is braver than going along with the crowd. Like Jeff Kinney'sDiary of a Wimpy Kid(Abrams),My Best Frenemyemphasizes the conflict between wanting to do the right thing and wanting to earn popularity. Written in descriptive language (Her words were covered in prickles) that sets the scene and gives readers insight into Ida's confusion and growth, the story is realistic and well told.Wendy E.

This captivating book zooms in with a telescopic intensity on America's blackouts, from the 1930s to the massive 2003 Northeast power failure that had many suspecting terrorism; anyone who reads this history will be unsurprised to find it was actually due to an over-burdened power grid. Beyond familiar individual frustrations, a blackout can cause major social and economic disturbance, signal political problems, and represent a massive failure of infrastructure; American history professor Nye contextualizes power failures in the U.S. as the result of long-term energy buildup and overuse. Nye examines how a \"utopian\" vision of electrical convenience at the 1962 Seattle World's Fair-television sets, movie equipment, a \"clothes conditioning closet,\" the home computer-became law (\"in building codes and in the 'war on poverty' electricity became a legal requirement akin to a natural right\") and how, when that right is denied, utopia can give way to chaos. Nye captures the disastrous 1977 New York City blackout in its broad causes, effects, and implications, as well as its small, frightening details: \"Guests of the Algonquin Hotel found that electronic locks had sealed their doors.\" Other chapters discuss rolling blackouts and activist-driven \"greenouts.\" Fans of urban studies will find this text rich with insight and information. 26 illus.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That mistake has now been corrected.The authors turn a hard eye on Potter's words from the first sentence of his book, which states three lies as facts. This is \"forensic\" history, and it includes looking at everyone around Potter. His biographer Henry Trumbull, for example, was a man as much at home churning out pornography as sermons.Not our idea of a founding father? They're here, too, from Washington to Franklin, from sex-addled Quakers to money-driven Pilgrims. All had a part in making Potter's life less a mad-cap adventure than a weird tragedy. As these characters turn the wheel of Potter's fate, we gain a view of the times that has seldom been shown.Did the captain of Potter's ship make his bones as a slave trader? Did Trumbull burn down the home of one of his subjects to create a bestseller? Did the most incredible of Potter's adventures--his mission to Franklin in Paris--actually take place?Yes, but how it happened is whereBeggarman, Spyexcels. The authors rarely trust accepted accounts. By digging deeper, they produce many surprises. When surprise turns to coincidence, they explore those, too.The book closes with a look at Melville set against the homecoming of Potter. It's the tale of an exile--or two--and the blood ties that define their lives. The way blood ties intertwine are the most important theme in the book.What happened when the wife of Benedict Arnold took a strapping young stone mason into the house? Did the richest man in America really begin his fortune by drowning a slave?SeeBeggarman, Spyfor the answers.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But Mays is adamant that he is England's \"avenging angel,\" and he keeps filling his \"book\" with names of society's \"enemies.\" His paranoid delusions spur him to a vicious car chase that Frazier tries to stop, but his efforts just get him listed in the \"book\"; Mays apparently dies in a crash. Having been saved by an unsuspecting samaritan, however, Mays embarks on a mission of vengeance that leaves no doubt that he is alive. Frazier searches for him \"down river,\" back where they grew up, and amid vividly hewn scenes of a coastal village, tries to rein in his far-gone pal and save a woman who had once played a part in each of their lives.

There is no cute love story or BDSM romance here. There is no boy meets girl, Dom meets sub story either.Symphony of Cis a six month journey of a woman rescued from an abusive excuse for a Dom into a training contract that takes her from submission through slavery and the final level of true ownership. This journey is depicted in beautiful and rhythmic cadence throughout. Each overture a snapshot in time that depicts another level of Cara's awakening.Be aware that this is a no holds barred account and despite the romantic prose the journey is in no way romanticized. Most vanilla readers and even many BDSM readers will get a clear idea of why they do not wish to engage in a 24/7 lifestyle of handing themselves over as property to be used at their Master's discretion in any way pleasing to them. There are some though that yearn for this lifestyle andSymphony of Coffers a beautiful picture of the freedom and release that a slave will gain by giving up every part of themselves to their Master. There is a metamorphosis that takes place through this symphony. A transcendence from awkward girl to most beautiful and cherished slave. As with any change there is pain and hardship as all beautiful things must endure.This book is very highly recommended to all that are interested in or participate in a D/s lifestyle. If I was a slave I would hope and pray that my Dom were as exacting as the one depicted inSymphony of C.Anyone in the community could learn so much from this beautiful symphony.Cali Girl - BDSM Book Reviews", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Abraham’s family is unusual, but so is her virtuosity as a writer; she’s probing, intelligent, dryly funny but enough of a writer’s writer that she can make the awkward process of DNA swabbing seem magisterial.... Abraham’s book is riveting not just because of its superb writing and suspenseful storyline, but because, in the end, it’s not just about her, it’s aboutus.”—Emily Donaldson, The Globe and Mail “With an irreverent sense of humour and the smarts of an experienced medical-science journalist, Abraham describes how questions about her ancestry had gnawed at her since childhood…. What her genes wind up revealing—about not only her own background but everyone else’s—is richer than any tall family tale.”—The Georgia Straight “Abraham is the ideal guide to the brave and crowded new world of internet genealogy.... Abraham writes with ease and humour, undaunted by com­plexity, and the narrative unfolds like a detective story.”—Literary Review of Canada “Abraham’s  story of personal connection—the stories, the letters and the memories—end up being more compelling than the scientific revelations....The Juggler’s Childrenis a fascinating tale of truth, lies, perception and, ultimately, family.”—Winnipeg Free Press “Lively, accessible style.... Though this book is built around science, it’s the personal experiences and relationships Abraham describes that will remain with readers.”—The Gazette“The Juggler’s Childrenis as exciting as any explorer’s account of the discovery of a new land, as carefully written as a fine novel, as rigorous as it is entertaining.”—Ian Brown, award-winning author ofThe Boy in the Moon“The Juggler’s Childrenis simultaneously a compelling family mystery and brilliant science writing. As she cracks her own family’s genetic code, Carolyn Abraham makes the complexities of DNA and the genetic linkages that bind us immediately accessible.”—Dr. Miriam Shuchman, prize-winning author ofThe Drug Trial“Combining traditional journalistic digging with the cutting edge science of genetic genealogy, Carolyn Abraham takes us on a witty and engaging journey across India, China, Europe and Jamaica in search of her polyglot family ancestry…. In the end, she vividly demonstrates that inside the microcosmic gene pool of a single Canadian family—and thus all families—we will find the vast history of humanity.

One truly feels for Cassie's plight-- married to a man who refuses to live, while desperately in love with a man trapped in his own marital hell. The supporting characters are genuinely interesting and entertaining. To be quite frank, it's lovely to see a romance in which the main character is a woman outside of her twenties.

His career as a solicitor encountered a  swift end  when  he   decided to leave Liverpool for London, with a  half-finished    manuscript  under his arm and £40 in his pocket. His first  book to    attract  attention was the largely autobiographical 'This is the     Schoolroom'.  During World War Two he joined the Royal Navy and served    in  the  corvettes.

I wanted these stories to stick with readers well after they'd read them, allowing them to consider the implications and the possibilities they suggest. Our imaginations can often be even more frightening than the most explicit descriptions. The rest have clear, final, and often brutal endings.Combined, this collection is the length of a short novel, though most of the stories can be read in a single sitting.

That trip to Paris last year, where you lost your wallet, slaughtered the French language, and had a half-dozen major meltdowns? Now all you can recall are the sunsets, the Louvre, and the wine. Well, in Sloane Crosley's new single,Up the Down Volcano, she resists that disease of selective short-term memory and instead delivers a hilariously honest account of her trip to South America to climb the second highest volcano in the world armed only with a bikini, malaria pills, a fleece vest, and a few feminine hygiene products. A self-described \"profoundly lazy person in real life,\" Crosley finds a gruff \"spider monkey of a guide\" named Andrés, who seems indifferent to her suffering and who speaks only a few sentences to her during her long ordeal. One being \"Do you eat beans?\" Another, to quell her growing alarm and fear as she experiences the effects of altitude sickness on her way up the volcano, is simply \"tranquillo.\" Crosley expertly describes the misunderstanding that arises through interacting with another culture in another language, which can lead, especially in her case, to disastrous results. And although Crosley barely makes it off that mountain alive, you will laugh your way through this armchair traveler's trainwreck, thanking Crosley all the way for keeping it real, and not boring you with stories of sunsets. --Benjamin Moebius", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 336809, "title": "Up the Down Volcano (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Sloane Crosley", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 3.375, "rating_total": 27.0}

Hailey and her friend Scarlet embark on many adventures together. One day, Scarlet the dolphin takes young Hailey on a new and exciting wondrous adventure to meet her friend Link, the endangered Green Sea Turtle who mostly lives in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Hawaii. Hailey, with the help of her new friends, learn all kinds of interesting facts about her new friend Link the Green Sea Turtle, as well as play games with him.\"Adventures with Scarlet the Dolphin: Green Sea Turtles\" was very informative and interesting and it brings the oceanic life of sea animals to life. The author also gave simple but easy to understand facts about the Green Sea Turtle that were also very descriptive. It made learning about the life span and the life process of the green sea turtles interesting without being bogged down with too many detailed facts.This book will also help to familiarize children with social and emotional developmental themes, friendships and relationships, and with scientific and mathematical concepts. I also really enjoyed the 'Finding Nemoesque' quality of the illustrations that were bright, vivid, colorful and aesthetically pleasing. I recommend this book for children who are looking for ocean adventures with new sea animal friends.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With contributions from: P. G. Wodehouse, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Bernard Darwin,Ring Lardner, Horace Hutchinson, Charles E. Van Loan, A. A. Milne, and many more.

Brenetia is a living testimony that no matter how bad the thunderstorms of life, you can survive and thrive when God is the driver of your ship. Brenetia is an overcomer who has survived numerous traumas and setbacks. She lost her mother at the age of 7 to an automobile accident caused by a drunk driver and was simultaneously disowned by her father; survived three years of molestation during her adolescence; and was a victim of extreme introversion with no self esteem. During 17 years of marriage, she endured emotional, verbal, and physical abuse; more than 40 extramarital affairs; two bouts of clinical depression; and the near death of her eldest son. Abiding firmly in the belief that God does not allow trials and traumas for no reason, she uses her testimony and anointing to inspire and encourage others to release the ghosts of the past and embrace forgiveness so that God can reveal His plan for victorious living and destiny. Brenetia's story and ministry has been featured on local gospel television, Atlanta 57 Alive in Atlanta, Georgia and at numerous women's conferences.

Sitting in the rental car for a moment, he tried to quiet the anger that had simmered inside him since he'd heard her voice on the phone less than twenty-four hours ago.He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel. Had she really planned to keep this secret from him? What made her think she had the right?He had no idea, but as soon as their conversation—which had gone nowhere—had ended, he had flown into Atlanta from Red Rock, Texas. Now that he was here in person, she wouldn't be able to put him off so easily. He intended to make it perfectly clear he wasn't going away.With a quick jab of his thumb, he sprung the car's seat belt. He headed up the walk of pavers toward the hunter-green double doors set like a bruised eye in the middle of the stately, two-story red brick building.He pulled back the brass door knocker and gave three sharp raps. It was slightly before seven o'clock in the morning. It was early, but his plan for the daybreak visit was to catch her before she went into work. She wasn't expecting him. He hadn't called before flying in because he wasn't about to give her warning, time to run, a chance to avoid him and the secret she'd already hidden for four months.If not for Jordana's cousin, Victoria, who'd told him to call Jordana because shedesperately needed to talk to him,he would still be blissfully unaware that the woman who'd blown him off after their one night was pregnant with his child.The opening door drew him out of his inward brooding. There stood Jordana, looking shocked and so damned beautiful with her blond hair wet from her morning shower. Seeing her standing there in her bathrobe, with her face fresh and makeup-free, he didn't know whether he wanted to kiss her or put his fist through a wall.\"Tanner? What are you doing here?\" She tugged at the sash of the robe, then crossed her arms over her ribs. The protective gesture pulled his gaze to her belly, which showed no signs of the child growing within. Of course, that big white terry robe wasn't exactly formfitting. It even swallowed up the prepregnancy curves that had been etched in his memory since that night.. when they'd taken refuge from the storm. His eyes slowly made their way back to hers.For one weak moment, seeing her again reminded him just how out of his league Jordana Fortune was. Not because her family had more money than European royalty, but her sheer presence—that mixture of grace and rock-solid strength—left him a little speechless.Yeah, come to think of it, he'd been a little speechless after she'd left him with a handshake and a no-nonsense \"thanks for everything\" the morning after they'd made love for the first and only time. That was the night the tornado had destroyed Red Rock and parts of San Antonio.Nothing had been the same since. And given that he would be a father before the year was over, it was beginning to sink in that nothing would ever be the same again. It scared him to death because his own father hadn't been strong enough to be a family man. Tanner pushed the thought back into the dark recesses of his mind—the place where he stored his faded memories of the man who had once been his father and redoubled his vow that he would stand by his family no matter what.\"Seriously? You're asking me why I'm here?\" His voice was a hoarse and throaty rasp. \"You're pregnant with my child, Jordana. I wanted to see your face when you told me how long you thought you could keep that news from me.\"Jordana sighed heavily and glanced around. He couldn't tell if her reaction was resignation or fear…fear of what? The neighbors finding out her little secret?\"Come in.\" She stepped back and motioned him through. He stepped onto the hardwood of the entryway and glanced around at the expensivelooking decor. High ceilings and vibrantly colored walls with paintings. The place was like a snapshot out of one of those architectural magazines. The day's first light was beginning to stream in through oversize windows that surrounded a large fireplace along the condo's back wall. Inviting and elegant. Just like Jordana. He would've expected nothing less of the crown princess of the Fortune South Enterprises dynasty.\"Look, I'm sorry, Tanner. You must've misunderstood our conversation yesterday. You didn't have to come.\" She closed the door, but kept her hand on the doorknob, as if she didn't expect him to stay very long. \"You're under absolutely no obligation with this child. I don't need or want your help. I thought we had established that when we spoke.\"Her cool words were a hot slap in his face. \"I'm not herefor you,\"he bit back. \"I'm here formy child.And I intend to be involved in his life every step of the way.\"She blanched.\"Hislife?\" Her right hand slid to her belly. \"How do you know the baby is a boy?\"\"I don't, but I intend to be there when we find out and for every other milestone inourkid's life. So, you might as well get used to that right now.\"Tanner had been raised by a single mother who sometimes worked two jobs to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. She'd done a damn good job. His loser of a father had never paid a penny of child support. It was obvious Jordana didn't need his financial help in raising their child. But the thought that she'd considered cutting him out of his baby's life cut him to the core. His own father had been so absent from Tanner's and his siblings' lives that Tanner referred to him as \"The Sperm Donor\" rather than a father. As far as he was concerned, the namefatherordadwas a title earned by men who took their roles and responsibilities seriously. Tanner had always vowed he would be there for his kids…when the time came to have kids.He just hadn't expected that time to beright now.Since leaving the Air Force seven years ago, he'd been married to his company, Redmond Flight School. Although he wanted kidssomeday—in theverydistant future—a family of his own hadn't been on his radar. Well, that's what he got for having impulsive, unprotected sex with Jordana. He had been taking her to the airport so that she could meet her family and fly back to Atlanta with them. The Fortunes had chartered a flight to take them home after they'd all gathered in Red Rock for the wedding of Jordana's sister Wendy Fortune to Marcos Mendoza. When Jordana had heard reports of a storm bearing down on Red Rock, she'd refused to fly out with her family. Then she'd changed her mind. Tanner had offered her a ride to the airport. They'd both been a little unnerved about being stranded out on the road when the tornado struck. And they'd both sought warmth and comfort in the other's arms. One thing led to another and… Well, you play, you pay.\"I know this is a hell of a time to ask, but were you not on birth control when we…?\"Stupid question. He realized it the minute the words passed his lips. The fact was further confirmed when sadness, or something just short of defeat, colored her golden-brown eyes. She shrugged and gestured toward the living room. \"Sit down, Tanner. I need a cup of tea before I can deal with you at this hour.

The other stories are no less dark: in Let Me Tell You a Story, a babysitter manipulates her charges into committing acts of evil, while The Shape is a harsh tale of mental illness and abuse. The bleakness might turn off some readers, but fans of intense, psychology-driven horror and sharp writing will be more than satisfied.(Apr.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

All he wants is strings - and to keep her safe.Her reaction to his chivalry...\" You bungling idiot!!!? Everything's changed. It's you he's after now.\"When I first started reading this story, I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy it or not. However the further along I got in the story, the more I wanted to know what was going to happen to Ashley and Crystal. There were a few surprises along the way, like a magical rose bush, which I did not see coming at all. This is probably due to not reading the first two books in this series. Now I find myself wanting to read the other books and the new one coming out soon. I'm so glad I did not give up on this story or author. I was pleasantly surprised by the ending and can't wait to see what she has in store with the next book. You definitely need to pick up\"We're One\"and all the other stories in this series.

Il padre, Giovanni Antonio, era un imprenditore e agiato possidente, fu poeta improvvisatore e sindaco di Nuoro nel 1892. La madre, Francesca Cambosu, era una donna religiosissima e allevò i figli con estremo rigore morale. Dopo aver frequentato le scuole elementari, Grazia Deledda venne seguita privatamente da un professore ospite di una sua parente che le impartì lezioni di italiano, latino e francese. I costumi del tempo non consentivano alle ragazze un'istruzione completa, oltre quella primaria e, in generale, degli studi regolari. Successivamente approfondì, da autodidatta, gli studi letterari. Importante per la formazione letteraria di Grazia Deledda, nei primi anni della sua carriera da scrittrice, fu l'amicizia con lo scrittore, archivista e storico dilettante sassarese Enrico Costa che per primo ne comprese il talento. Esordì come scrittrice con alcuni racconti pubblicati sulla rivista \"L'ultima moda\" quando affiancava ancora alla sua opera narrativa quella poetica. Nell'azzurro, pubblicato da Trevisani nel 1890 può considerarsi la sua opera d'esordio. Ancora in bilico tra l'esercizio poetico e quello narrativo si ricorda, tra le prime opere, Paesaggi edito da Speirani nel 1896. Nel 1900, sposò Palmiro Madesani, funzionario del Ministero delle Finanze, conosciuto a Cagliari; nell'ottobre del 1899 la scrittrice si trasferì a Roma e in seguito alla pubblicazione di Anime oneste del 1895 e di Il vecchio della montagna del 1900, oltre alla collaborazione sulle riviste \"La Sardegna\", \"Piccola rivista\" e \"Nuova Antologia\", la critica inizia ad interessarsi alle sue opere, che vantano prefazioni di nomi quali Ruggero Bonghi e Luigi Capuana.

This stimulating and insightful book should be on the reading list of every clinician who cares for patients with mood disorders.' Annals of Clinical Psychiatry'How do you write a book about a disorder that is ill defined and little researched? You could just outline the depth of ignorance and point out potentially useful paths but Parker has instead given readers the benefit of experience combined with what evidence is available ... if you are looking for a book that gives you the way to understand and treat bipolar II then Dr Parker's regimen may well be what you are looking for.' Psychological Medicine'Although this book does not provide 'the answers' to what a clinician should do in every instance of treating a patient with bipolar II disorder, it provides a wealth of data and informed opinion. Any clinician with bipolar II patients may wish to consult this comprehensive volume when faced with a challenging bipolar II patient.' Journal of Clinical Psychiatry'This substantial book on the 'newcomer' of bipolar II disorder was a pleasure to read and review, not only because the topic required such a definitive work, but also because of the inclusive structure and style ... the lucidity of the work makes it suitable for both trainees and experts alike. The interested consumer or carer will also find it beneficial and its language is largely approachable.' Australian Psychiatry'The way most of the chapters are written should make it easy - even for colleagues who are not too familiar with the recent developments in the field of the 'bipolar spectrum' - to better understand the issues about bipolar II disorder, its treatment, and its management ... this book is a helpful resource for clinicians and provides a well-written introduction into bipolar II disorder for researchers from different points of views.' Journal of Psychosomatic Research'This book not only fills a void in the literature, it does so in such a clear and concise manner that it is a true pleasure to read. What's more, the debate format results in excellent discussions of the definition and management of bipolar II disorder. As a resident who routinely treats patients with mood disorders, I found this to be an essential addition to my bookshelf.'

Since 2009 she has been revamping this short story into a novel striving towards publication.. The idea was instilled in her by the encouragement of a few girl friends whom she has acknowledged. Her vivid imagination began to flow as she began to think about past and present issues from external and internal environmental settings. She doesn't write ordinary romance so she calls is adult fiction which is not for those under 18. Writing is an emotional outlet that Sara uses to relieve stress. English and Literature were her favorite subjects especially in college. Sara's characters are developed from many people within her life. These characters come to life as the author develops an understanding of individuals and feed off of many attitudes, body language, and responses of those around her. She realizes that this gift of visionary creativity has been handed to her from the Lord above.

Even among their gaudily dressed people they\nstood out, and their Martian silks would have shamed the most garish parrots\nfrom the jungles of Brazil. Gleaming ring mail made from Martian metal peeped\nout from the sleeves and collars of their tunics, and heavy, fur-lined cloaks\nhung from their shoulders. They speared hunks of roastednilkurmeat from trenchers with jeweled daggers while half a dozen\nyoung women swayed among them, refilling the trays with steaming slabs of meat\nand topping off their mugs withceslin.\nThey were so absorbed in their banter that we stood there for a couple of\nminutes before they noticed us.The talk died off\nand one of them, a hulking giant of a man with dirty blond hair hanging past\nhis shoulders, surged to his feet.\"You,\" he shouted,\na thick finger pointing at Mor Teral, \"what are you doing here?\" He turned to\nSolan Dus. \"What is he doing here? I told you to kill him, you witless fool.\"Solan Dus shrugged,\nunperturbed by the outburst. \"He claims the right of trial by combat, Oar-dhras. It is his clan-right, and I\ncould not refuse.\"The noise of the\nthrong around us completely died away. Everyone stared at either thear-dhrasor the knot of prisoners. I\nlooked at Ul Pek, then over at Mor Teral, and felt my earlier confidence begin\nto slip. Ul Pek stood almost a foot taller and outweighed my friend by at least\neighty pounds.Ul Pek blinked\ndown owlishly at Solan Dus. \"You could not refuse? Why not, when yourar-dhrasordered it? You should have\nbrought me his head.\"\"Would thear-dhrashave me violate our laws, which\nhave been passed down from generation to generation for a hundred centuries?\"The giant spat on\nthe dais. \"That for your law. When I speak, I will be obeyed. Get out of my\nsight, and be thankful I do not have you killed alongside this traitor for your\ninsolence.\" He turned to the men on the platform beside him. \"Kill him,\" he\nsaid, pointing to Mor Teral.My barbarian friend\nthrew his head back and laughed. \"I do not think so, Ul Pek. Our people are not\nso quick to cast the law of our fathers into the dust as you. As one who stands\naccused of crimes that have no witnesses, tribal law says that I have the right\nto challenge my accuser. You either face me alone in trial by combat, or you\nmay find the whole tribe set against you for violating its laws.\"Thear-dhras'sface suffused with fury, but the looks on the faces of the people\nin the crowd surrounding us convinced him it was useless. Having his men kill\nMor Teral would bring doom down upon himself as well. He flung away his cloak with\na curse and stalked to the edge of the dais.\"Very well. Let it\nbe done according to law.\"Ul Pek's\ncompanions jumped down from the platform and shoved people aside until they\ncleared an area about thirty feet across, and positioned themselves around the\nperimeter. When this was done thear-dhraswaved at Solan Dus. \"Give the traitor back his weapons.\"I slid close to\nMor Teral. \"Are you sure about this?\" I asked. \"The man is built like a bullnilkur.\"\"I'll try to be\ncareful.\" His wink did not reassure me in the least.Solan Dus handed\nhim back his sword and a knife, and Mor Teral stepped into the circle. Ul Pek\nstrode in from the other side, his long, curved sword gleaming like wet blood in\nthe light of the dying sun. There were no formalities; at some unseen signal\nthey both tensed and went on their guards, blades sweeping forward to eye level\na few inches apart. They circled one another warily, the tips of their swords\nclattering lightly as they took each other's measure. They made no gross\nmovements, just a flick of the wrist or the slight shift of the angle of an\nelbow to send the point of their sword dancing an inch or two around the tip of\nthe other.Thear-dhrastook a sudden step forward and\ntheir blades flashed together too swiftly for the eye to follow, the blows\nringing in a martial music that gripped the heart of everyone in the audience.\nFor a brief instant they stood close to one another, then Ul Pek stepped back\nand they resumed their circling. A dark stain spread slowly through the grey cloth\nof Mor Teral's left sleeve.They continued to\nfeint back and forth until Mor Teral lashed out. Another vicious flurry of\nblows ensued, and he reeled back under the hammer strokes of his larger\nopponent. He was barely able to ward off the attack, his blade beaten further\nand further back towards his body until he threw himself to the side to avoid\nthear-dhras'shungrily thrusting\nsword. Ul Pek let out a harsh bark of laughter.\"You should have stayed\nout there hiding with themewricks,\nlittle man,\" he gloated.", "related": ["B007M2YDIE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His own household is quiet, refined, and more than a little restrictive. Much to his parents' dismay, he attempts to visit the West gang as often as possible. They welcome him with open arms into their loud and loving, messy and slightly wild lives. Young readers (and boys in particular) will enjoy their repeated exploits involving everything from potty humor and worm farms to barfing carloads of kids and creepy campfire tales. Set in New Zealand, but loaded with universal appeal, these zany tales will please fans of goofy family stories.

In 1838 he joined the Corps Masovia. After teaching for many years, Gregorovius took up residence in Italy in 1852, remaining in that country for over twenty years. In 1876 he was made honorary citizen of Rome, the first German to be awarded this honor. A street and a square is named after him.

Chronic Pain and Illness can make you feel totally on your own \"island\" of life. Often you feel as if no one understands, they do not relate and cannot possibly know the pain and suffering of these illnesses such as Lupus, RA, Sjogren's, FM, CFS, MS and so many more. These illnesses tend to be \"women's diseases\" striking women probably at least 3 to 1, rather than men. So, that in itself makes it even more difficult. You are NOT alone. We are many, that are finding each other through all forms of social media, and even just the person next to you in the market, bank, or on the street.

We need to go.\"\"Give it a few more minutes.\" Michael's stare was still on the\ndominatrix. He was nowhere near ready to\nleave. Natascha would have to get over\nit. He nodded to the waitress, and she\nshrugged and turned to go.\"I. Want. To. Go. Home. Now!\"\"Then call a cab because I don't.\" The words rolled out of his mouth before he'd\never realized what he was saying. His\ngaze drifted quickly from the woman to Natascha. Her mouth was rounded into a large O, and her\neyes were huge.  \"You'd rather spend your night with these\nfreaks?\"\"They aren't freaks to me.\"\"Is this because I wouldn't ride you\nlast night? Come home with me, and I'll\nget on top.\"At least she realized he wanted more,\nbut a little bit of cowgirl wasn't going to fix the rift between them. \"Too little, too late, Natascha.\"\"What's that supposed to mean?\"\"It means I need a lot more, and you\napparently aren't willing to give it to me.\"\"This? This is what you want?\"It was now or never. \"I think so.\"\"If I call a cab and leave here alone,\nI'll be packing a bag when I get home. I\nwon't be there when you get back.\"He caught her stare for a moment before\nreturning his gaze to the crowd around him.\"Do what you feel you have to do.\"\"I'm serious.\" Her brow furrowed as she gave him what he\nknew to be her best angry stare.\"I know you are. I am, too.\"Natascha grabbed her bag and rose from\nher chair. \"Goodbye,freak.\"Michael sighed with relief once she was\ngone, and that action struck him. Why\nwould he be so happy for her to be gone if he truly wanted her in his\nlife? As he glanced around the space, he\nsaw gazes turned in his direction, possibly having witnessed the little show\nthat had just occurred. Two women at a\ntable across from him raised their glasses in his direction and smiled. He returned the favor, wishing his drinks had\narrived so he could saunter over to the ladies and say hello. He smiled to himself just as the waitress\nreturned with his two shots and another drink he hadn't ordered, placing all\nthree before him.\"I didn't order that.\"\"No.He did.\" The waitress pointed\ntoward the front of the club, where there was a dais of sorts with a large\nchair. An older man sat there, dressed\nin leather, a female and a male at his feet.Collars rested around the subs' necks, and both rested their heads on\nhis knees while watching the crowd. Michael's gaze caught that of the\nmaster, and the man nodded. For a\nmoment, Michael paused, unsure of how to react.He wasn't gay, but he also didn't want to reject the man's\ngenerosity. Gender roles blurred for\nhim, so the thought of being mastered, even by a male, made his heart rate\nquicken.  Michael swallowed as he lifted\nthe glass and saluted the man, fear and excitement swimming through him. He took a sip of the heady concoction and\nnearly choked on the liquor content.Managing to keep it down, he returned the glass to the table and reached\nfor the shots, downing both in quick succession.\"Want two more or do we need to pace\nourselves?\"\"Two more. Then I'll worry about pacing myself after.\"The scantily clad waitress took off in\nthe direction of the bar as he sipped a little of the drink she'd brought\nhim. His gaze was immediately pulled to\nthe man at the head of the room, the weight of his stare calling to\nMichael. Michael felt his body begin to stir from\nthe attention, even though he'd never considered himself attracted to someone\nof the same sex. It wasn't the sex he\ncraved, necessarily; it was the domination.Could he cross the line if the chance arose? It seemed he would have the opportunity to\nfind out before long.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He soon adopted a passion for writing fictional stories at an early age while attending school. His first book HOME SWEET HOME, is an autobiographical account of his childhood days growing up in a family fighting poverty during and after the War. His book was well received by local and the National press. It was also on sale in Main Street stores and on the shelves of school and public libraries. His two years of National Service saw him serving in the Royal Army Medical Corp where he continued to write his army experiences. On leaving the army he wrote sports articles for his local paper. On being engaged to a local girl at the end of his army career, he married and settled in Stirling, where they had three children. His writing career really took off early in married life. To further his writing career he joined a local writing group and took a course in writing children's books. His first book in this genre was AMANDA AND THE RED TELEPHONE, which caught the imagination of many children and was a huge success. His second book, MY COUSIN CHARLIE was an equal success. His love of writing had to be put on hold for many years when his wife became seriously ill. It was his wife who encouraged him to pick up where he had left off and his passion for writing was resurrected. He took a four year Open University course in Creative Writing and was delighted when he was awarded a Diploma In Literature And Creative Writing. His unique style of writing is enjoyed by children and adults alike. His latest venture is as a member of Stirling Castle Writers Group, where he writes Historical Fiction Stories. His latest book THE CROW WOOD FARM MURDERS, can be downloaded , or purchased in paperback at AMAZON.CO.UK.", "related": ["B00B90UTD8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her father, prior to his passing, prophesied over her in the womb indicating that she would be a dynamic and anointed woman of God carrying on his legacy of high profile ministry and profound commitment to the cause of Christ, and that she would be used to bring deliverance and healing to the nations.Rein was saved, anointed, and called to preach at the tender age of seven-- a ministry prodigy often astounding those who heard her preach with her keen insight, revelation, and theological reflections on the word. Her ministry was developed in the Church of God in Christ, where she held many positions in ministry respectively, including: youth and young adult leader and minister, praise and worship leader, preacher, children s ministries leader, Sunday school and Bible study teacher, church administrator, drama ministries coordinator, praise dance ministries leader, etc.Called to pursue advancement in ministry, Rein was later licensed as a minister in the A.M.E church prior to a call to leaving it to support her pastor in launching a non-denominational ministry geared toward reaching the marginalized and oppressed. It was there that she continued her work in the ministry serving as a clergy member, minister of music, and youth and children s leader while launching out as an independent and highly sought after inspirational artist. Her ministry in the music has enabled her to minister alongside gospel greats and has afforded her numerous accolades throughout the bay area and beyond.While Rein grew up fully committed to ministry in every aspect, her young life outside of the church was a devastating one that included early prostitution by her grandmother, molestation, rape, abortion, and later divorce and domestic violence. Her passion increased for the people of God, especially for those with past traumatic and abusive experiences who needed support and ministry to their deeper needs and weren t being ministered to in the church. Fully persuaded that she could be used to minister to the hurting, marginalized, and oppressed, she began to seek God for the role that she could play in encouraging and promoting healing and transformation.In 2010, God ushered her off of a lucrative job as a Human Resources Executive and Chief Administrator and compelled her to chronicle her life s journey toward transformation in her book, I Am Not Garbage. From there, God has opened numerous doors for her and established several partnerships that allow her to minister the gospel of transformation and the Word in general to multiple youth and women s organizations, social clubs, schools, and churches.Today, Rein spends her time in servitude to Christ through full time ministry. She is a dynamic praise and worship leader and psalmist, an author, a youth, family, and parent coach, and a highly sought after motivational speaker and preacher who is committed to leading others in the direction of wholeness, transformation, and freedom through the work of her organization HeReinz Ministries LLC an organization founded on the Christian principles of hope and unrelenting trust in God, who by His power and love has the ability to transform us all -- one thought, one memory, one moment, and one day at a time.Rein reaches many through transparent testimony in combination with Christian theology through speaking engagements, classes, webinars, music, devotionals, books, social and other media as a means of drawing others into their complete wholeness and transformation teaching principles of living healthy and wholesome lives free from the pain of the past.", "related": ["B00BJ8Q902"], "rank": 1996906, "title": "I Am Not Garbage: My Life's Journey (I Am Not Garbage Trilogy Book 1)", "author": "Rein Johnson", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I even had it under erotic romance due to many racy sexual scenes, as well as Tami's masturbation scenes.To say\nthis sweet, sad, and sexy story--as written by a review, was a labor of love is\nto put it mildly. The setting is very close to where I grew up which makes it\nclose to my heart. Her inability to find direction and just let go and find\nlove is one I hope people can relate to.", "related": [], "rank": 2258467, "title": "Turbulent Heart", "author": "Suzy Ayers", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He became one of the most distinguished and prolific writers, in Irish and English, of his generation and was one of the major figures of the Irish Literary Renaissance. Abandoning an early intention to join the priesthood, he joined the British Army, under his mother’s surname and was wounded the Western Front. After the war, he traveled to South America, Turkey, Canada and the Soviet Union, holding a variety of jobs before entering the United States illegally in 1920. He joined the Communist Party there, a move that determined the politics he supported for most of his life. He returned to Ireland in 1921, at the height of the War of Independence. His ideas for Ireland’s future differed radically from those of Sinn Féin. Two days following the foundation of the Irish Free State, he and some followers occupied and held for four days the Rotunda building in Dublin, flying the red flag in a failed attempt at socialist revolution. Shortly afterwards O’Flaherty made his way to London where he wrote short stories in Irish. However, this early work was badly received, prompting him to write henceforth mainly in English. His first novel, The Neighbour’s Wife, was published in 1923 and was followed by a stream of novels, short stories, and poems. The House of Gold (1929) has the distinction of being the first of many literary works to be banned by the newly constituted Irish Censorship of Publications Board in 1929. Subsequent works of his were to suffer the same fate. His writing combines a graphic and striking naturalism, acute psychological analysis, poetry and biting satire together with an abiding sympathy for the common man and anger against injustice. The powerful ideological substratum of the writings of this lifetime Marxist is seldom noted or commented upon. Liam O'Flaherty died on 7 September 1984, aged 88, in Dublin. A memorial garden in his native village of Gort na gCapall, Inishmore, commemorates the life and work of this literary giant.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The quest deepened through the exposure to classic mythology and legends, which birthed a sense of hidden identity, that we are not who we have always thought we were, but are each of us heroes and heroines destined for something great and noble.  Who are we? Where are we going? What tasks are we meant to accomplish during our time on Earth? We are all on a journey together as we seek the answers. You may join L. M. Roth in that quest anytime you read one of the author's books.  L. M. Roth is the pen name of a Christian author from the American Midwest. You can keep up with the author on Facebook and play the L.

Their rapid growth in the 20th century improved access to higher learning. In the 21st century, access is no longer sufficient; completion and accountability are needed. Reduced resources have forced community colleges to restructure through a lens of growth and reduction, abundance and scarcity, continuity and change, access and success. Here the authors present models of restructuring that have been successful; for instance, one case study shows a community college using “reaccreditation as a catalyst for systematically reinventing itself”—a part of the college’s strategic plan to improve management and the institution as a whole, including its enrollment, use of physical space, budget development, and programming. Most valuable are the sections with concrete illustrations of innovations at community colleges around the country and reports from foundations and education associations calling for specific changes. The authors address the challenges facing community colleges through a combination of theory and case studies, historical perspective, an explanation of institutional stagnation, and potential paths to revival.VERDICTThis title is best suited for the professional educator.(Library Journal)With the spotlight on community colleges as never before, this book is a MUST READ for all community college educators! In honoring the past, Sydow and Alfred provide a great synopsis of the history of the community college movement. As we look toward the future, they challenge educational innovators to lead the way for community colleges to be 'change adept' as opposed to 'change adverse.' Opportunities abound as never before for community colleges to help insure the economic future of our country. The ideas contained inRe-visioning Community Collegeswill inspire and motivate educators to chart a bold future for this important sector of higher education.(E. Ann McGee, president, Seminole State College of Florida)Sydow and Alfred have provided, through this text, a desperately needed field guide for the uneven and shifting landscape surrounding today’s community college. Grounded in thoughtful context, yet providing a view of promising practices, the authors ask fresh questions of the reader, suggesting opportunity, and ideally prompting deliberate action for grappling with the seemingly unending disruptive innovation in higher education.(Daniel J. Phelan, president, Jackson Community College)", "related": [], "rank": 2975584, "title": "Re-visioning Community Colleges", "author": "Debbie Sydow", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From skydiving in Alaska to scuba diving in Hawaii, Carmouché has traveled the world seeking adventure and it is apparent in the books she writes  and workshops she gives.  Her adventures include riding camels in Africa, swimming under the stars in Puerto Rico, dancing salsa in Ecuador, and walking the cobblestone roads of Assisi, Italy.

Her most cherished moments, however, have been watching her two beautiful daughters grow and strive to accomplish their own dreams. Despite all of these amazing experiences, she has survived many struggles. There was a time she felt defeated, but now she is recommitted to savoring experiences both in the novels she writes and in the life she lives. She is committed to helping others in her coaching, workshops and in serving the marginalized.

I can assure you that the G-Spot Stimulator is the perfect\ninstrument for the next part of my procedure.\" Dr. Dickens brought the\nvibrator, curved side up, toward Megan and slipped it easily into her slick\npussy.\"Try to relax,\" Regina coached, using her gloved fingers to\nstimulate the patient's very erect nipples.Megan didn't want to relax - she wanted to escape! But when\nDr. Dickens started stroking her with the vibrator, her resistance dissipated.\nThe pleasure she felt was powerful and constant, and she was soon undulating\nher hips against the restraints. \"It's working\ndoctor!\" Regina whispered excitedly when a few droplets of milk seeped from the\npatient's nipples. The nurse leaned forward and latched on to Megan's breast\nwith her mouth, sucking the flesh enthusiastically to entice the milk to flow\nmore freely. \"Miss Mathis, your breasts are amazing and your milk tastes\ndivine!\"", "related": ["B00JYQ9ZNY"], "rank": 1083811, "title": "The Doctor's Dirty Cures", "author": "Lydia Litt", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Vesuvius in the home of a baker. What is so amazing about this discovery is that it was found in the place Jesus instructed all of his believers to pray to their father in heaven - in a closet! God promised since the days of Moses to write his laws in the minds and hearts of his followers. Once you read The Sator Square Unlocked, you will see how I did it and how God gave me revelations so rare and so special to give to everyone who is bold enough to follow his son Jesus.", "related": [], "rank": 2124373, "title": "The Sator Square Unlocked", "author": "Clifford Ross Marshall Pierre", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What are you waiting for?”—DR. TIM CLINTON, President of the American Association of Christian Counselors\"The big dilemma in conquering food addiction is that you can't just quit using like an alcoholic or a drug addict. The need to continue to eat exposes us to many triggers that take over our appetites. Add to that the emotional and relational triggers, it is no wonder so few people keep the weight off. Dr. Epstein has the answer to this dilemma. From her own experience, research and the experience of others she provides a way to put your triggers on safety. If you struggle with weight as I have, you will find something new and very helpful inFood Triggers.\"—STEPHEN ARTERBURN, Author ofEvery Man’s Battle, Founder of New Life Ministries, Women of Faith“If you work this plan you will see lasting results!

Basic breakfasts, lunches, dinners and desserts are presented in an accessible way that will ensure your success and increase your confidence.", "related": ["B00I9E5G3U"], "rank": 2496684, "title": "Food Camp", "author": "Michael Nolan", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ruth was raised strictly Brethren and from birth attended three meetings every Sunday at the Gospel Hall, the Wednesday night meeting, and the yearly \"Conference,\" until she left the Brethren at the age of twenty one. Ruth still has close friends in the Brethren, as well as the Amish, both groups descending from Anabaptists. Ruth's family had electricity, but not television, radio, or magazines, and they had plain cars. Make up, bright or fashionable clothes, and hair cutting were not permitted for women. Women had to wear hats in meetings (what others would call church meetings) but not elsewhere. The word \"church\" was never used and there were no bishops or ministers. All baptized men were able to speak (preach, or give out a hymn) spontaneously at meetings. Musical instruments were forbidden, with the exception of the traditional pump organ which was allowed only if played in the home for hymn music. Even so, singing of hymns in accompaniment was forbidden. Ruth Hartzler is a widow with one adult child and two grandchildren. She lives alone with her Yorkshire Terrier and two cats. She is a retired middle school teacher and enjoys quilting, reading, and writing.", "related": ["B00KTKV9UG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I worried that narrowing the scope of an ebook like this\nwould make for more fluff to get it to a similar length. I was surprised\n to find that this book continued to provide heaps of high quality info\nin a short read.I'm getting the feeling that I had better just\ngo ahead and get the whole series, as I know this series will end up\nbeing a one-stop shop reference book for me in the very near future!\nCan't wait until the next one!\"", "related": [], "rank": 2330806, "title": "BLOGGING SECRETS", "author": "Kaye Dennan", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
