(The Catholic Historical Review)A significant and serious work of scholarship....Ekonomou...amply and convincingly documents the often unexpected and even counterintuitive ways in which the Greek-speaking East influenced the West-Roman Church and papacy. (Logos: Journal Of Eastern Christian Studies)Dr. Ekonomou's book is a nicely written monograph on a topic that cried desperately for attention in the course of the last century and more. Apart from shedding much more light on some crucial aspects of what is considered the darkest of the Dark Ages, this is a work that for the first time focuses on the Greek/Byzantine/Hellenic dimension of the Roman Papacy and thoroughly investigates the background to a number of Popes of Greek/Byzantine/Hellenic/Eastern origin that shaped the Roman Church. This is a book that will be greatly appreciated by anyone interested in the early Papacy, Rome and Byzantium. A great complement to books such asThe Republic of St. Peterby T.F.X. Noble and the translated parts of the Liber Pontificalis.

This lack of understanding led to a large number of family tragedies across the U.S., even all over the world. As professional educators, we were pleased to find the book so clear and easy to read that we can even recommend it to parents without an academic background.We will use this in our own practice as much as possible, and we will also recommend the book to the family professionals for whom we provide training throughout the year. These are primarily clinicians ranging from Marriage & Family Therapists in private practice to Social Workers at government agencies like DSS, DCFS, etc. Our hope is that this book can help them learn to identify Parental Alienation cases more quickly, and recommend effective interventions based on this understanding.Ms. Adams writing is very clear and focused. Her storytelling flows, and the key details that are so important to understand in PAS cases are lucidly described in a way that makes the whole situation come alive. We have helped many thousands of parents in difficult PAS cases, and are glad to have this additional resource to educate those who need to gain a better understanding of PAS and its impact on family dynamics.\"--Bjorn Ahlen, Co-Founder & CEO Breakthrough Parenting, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As the story opens, Brock is confronted by an angry woman who demands to know where his neighbor, Will Trachey, lives. Taking the woman, who turns out to be Will's ex-wife, Katherine, with him, Brock sets off for Trachey's cottage, where they find Trachey dead, the victim of multiple gunshot wounds. Conservationist Luis Mendoza is blamed for the shooting, and Brock agrees to investigate on his behalf. In addition to dealing drugs, Trachey knew too much about someone, and on a small island, it's hard to keep secrets. Roby has created an immensely likable hero in Brock, a retired park ranger looking for a little peace and quiet, and the novel exudes the atmosphere of the island, the flora and fauna as well as the insular nature of human relationships there. Here's hoping this is only the beginning of the Harry Brock series.Jenny McLarinCopyright © American Library Association.

She takes her first steps when a an older man, twenty-eight year old Sloan Stroh, shows an interest in her. Leslie finds herself flattered and excited by this strange new man in town even though her father and brother vehemently protest her association with him. In McClellan's Bluff, Mary E.Trimble skillfully weaves together the conflicting emotions of a young woman who's blossoming with adult desires while still trying to balance those feelings with her inexperience and hesitation. Throw in an extremely protective family hawkeyeing her every move, along with rapid, severe change in that family's dynamics as her father prepares to remarry, and mix it with sleek, sexually charged stranger, and the end result is a volatile delight to read. Trimble definitely nails the psyche of a seventeen year old girl consumed with a new infatuation with the whiff of sexual expectation. And she does an admirable job of bringing her entire life and personality to life. The atmosphere is thick with details of the ranch life, something she's obviously knowledgeable about, and which proves interesting to readers. Additionally, she unfolds the story with darker twists while infusing it with Leslie's maturation in other areas too. She grows as a person as she learns to be a sister and truer friend, taking on more responsibility in her life. There's no doubt that McClellan's Bluff is a wonderfully written story that will engage the target audience. Additionally, it's so good that most adults would enjoy reading it, and should feel comfortable letting their children read it with the way Trimble handles the situations in both language and tone.  --Susan DiPlacido Blue Iris Journal", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

John allows his readers to see life through gay mens' eyes. And just like real life, John's characters have active and exciting sex lives. John calls on his broad personal and professional experience in writing gay erotica. John is author of numerous full length novels available through Dreamspinner Press, Extasy Books, Devine Destinies and Silver Publishing, several short stories in Alyson Books anthologies. John has written magazine articles for gay and straight audiences alike. John lives with his partner of 36 years who he legally married in 2008, and their three Scottish Terriers.

Brantley's \"A Little Dab 'a Do Ya\" is a cultural novel that will take the reader into the life and soul of a blues singer. Joe grows up fending for himself as his momma has many men in and out of their home and he is pushed aside. Trying to find food for himself and stay out of his momma's way, Joe grows up too quickly as he is taken into others' homes. One night Joe fills in on stage and his momma knows that his talent is going to overshadow her and she throws him out of the house. Joe finds himself eating at home of lonely women and also sharing their beds. Moving onto a new city becomes the best option for him and this is where he meets Langston who makes him revisit his journey to becoming a blues singer. While this not a book that I would typically read, the cover drew me to the book. Brantley's style of writing is easy to read and the culture comes alive in this book. Brantley's writing is very descriptive and there is vulgar language throughout the book, however it adds to the authenticity of the characters and the story as a whole. This is an unique account of a man's life and journey to whom he becomes and how singing the blues is a way for him to cleanse his soul and make sense of his world. --Kristie I. for Readers favorite", "related": [], "rank": 3216852, "title": "A Little Dab a Do Ya", "author": "Eric L.

Laura, bold daughter of Member of Parliament Fowler Maskey, and Amelia, scheming daughter of wealthy miner Boyd Roberts, reach womanhood against a background of racial and economic crises and their fathers' political duels in Rockhampton, a raw north-country town situated near gold mines and cattle ranches. Laura is in love with married rancher Paul McNamara, who cannot leave his wife, while Amelia adores ambitious newsman Tyler Kemp. Fleeing a forced marriage to the ruthless Bobby Cope, who's in charge of a Native Mounted Police troop, Laura learns that Amelia's father desires her. Meanwhile, tension escalates between ranchers and Aborigine clans, leading to violence that takes many lives, including that of McNamara's wife, prompting him to set out for the bush to find her killer. There, McNamara meets Wodoro, an intertribal \"courier\" who speaks English, and discovers surprising truths. Elsewhere, meanwhile, a woman looks for her husband's killer, and Amelia is driven to violence of her own. A crowd-pleasing ending crowns this colorful tale.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B007KTLSY6"], "rank": 1086226, "title": "Where the Willows Weep: An enthralling romantic saga of conflict and tragedy in Queensland", "author": "Patricia Shaw", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

'The Respiratory System at a Glance' provides a concise, digestible synopsis of the respiratory system. Essential basic features and clinical aspects of the respiratory system are covered thoroughly but succinctly. Bravo!\"--Lecturer in Physiology,Cardiff UniversityPublished Reviews of the 1st Edition\"...the book provides a succint yet easy-to-follow approach that examines each disorder in terms of its pathology, clinical presentation as well as its treatment.... these [case studies] can be used for self-testing and they are a useful way of bringing information together.... It is very useful for revising for finals, but is a pleasant enough book to read even before that!\" (Cambridge Medicine,Vol. 18, No. 1, Autumn 2003)\"The use of 'at a glance' in the title promises clear, easy to understand diagrams and, more importantly, hints at a slightly shorter reading time. The promise is delivered...Suddenly it's all so simple! You really feel like you have learnt a topic once you've read the two pages devoted to it.... I thoroughly recommend this book. The case studies are done brilliantly at the back of the book, even containing a comprehensable reproduction of a chest x-ray.\"--Third Year Medical Student,Guy's, King's, St Thomas' Medical SchoolGKT July-August 2003", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Reid was born in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Her love for medieval fantasy was sparked by the Narnia Chronicles by C.S. Lewis, which fed both her imagination and her spiritual development.  When at the age of thirteen her family moved to Germany, her passion for medieval history and legend only increased, and she found herself captivated by the ancient towns and castles of Europe.  Allison returned to the United States to study art and writing at Hampshire College in Amherst, MA.  She earned her B.A. under the tutelage of the well-renowned and prolific writer Andrew Salkey, a student of her other great inspiration, and the father of fantasy, J. R. R. Tolkien.  After graduating from Hampshire College, Allison moved to Connecticut.  There she got the opportunity to attend seminary and further explore her faith before returning to her home state of Ohio.  Allison now lives in the beautiful Chagrin Valley of Northeast Ohio with her husband and children.  She continues to work on the next book in her first published series while taking care of her family, and managing a career and home-business.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a matter of fact 98% of them are unknown to me. Their clients in the thousands recommended them and voted for them. They would send me emails containing their full names, what they do for a living, their websites to be included in the book, and describe their experiences with said lightworkers. As a matter of fact, I stated very clearly in the book, that I do NOT recommend any one (In the book or elsewhere) to be a perfect lightworker and/or a spiritual teacher. Thus the clients and the general public voted; NOT ME!2-The vote was a long process; the clients and the general public continued to vote around the clock, non-stop for 25 days. Almost the whole psychics-mediums' community knew about the vote. And if they didn't know despite the lengthy process of 25 days, then one thing comes to my mind: THEY ARE NOT PSYCHIC!!!3-I did not pass a judgment on the 855 listed lightworkers. Never, ever. Only on 4 pages, I described the kind of conversations I had with approx. 15 of them, and what vibes I received from communicating with them. I spoke briefly (2 lines or 3) about 15 only, and not 855!!!!4-Zillions of affidavits, statements and letters/emails of recommendation from clients and the general public (Doctors, professors, authors, psychics, scientists, heads of corporations, superstars who sent me their emails are mentioned in the book.)5-Those who were elected are the very best in the business. To mock them is a vicious and low-class attempt to dishonor them and attack their credibility. Any person who would slander them is nothing but the scum of the earth. Hatred, jealousy, envy, ignorance and fear of competition will motivate many to hurt others and discredit the book. But they will fail, for the PUBLIC HAS VOTED, and the TRUTH is revealed. I do strongly believe that Michelle Whitedove, Patti Negri, Allison Hayes, Chinhee & Sunhee Park, Shellee Hale, Danielle Egnew, Gabriela Castillo, Patrice Cole, Micki Dahne, Syd Saeed, Claire Braddock, Russell Grant, Lynne Caddick, Tina Bliss, Barbara MacKey, Melissa Bacelar, Bee Herz, Maureen Hancock, Dolores Cannon, Suzanne Grace, Ali Michaels, Blair Robertson,Bobby Marchesso,Brian Hunter,Chip Coffey,Daved Beck,Dougall Fraser,Doyle Ward,James Van Praagh,Jamie Clark,Jeffry Palmer,Jerry Yusko,Jethro Smith,John Edward,John Holland,Justin Chase Mullins,Matt Fraser,Robert Valera,Steven Weissand so many others who were voted by the public and included in the book are de facto, among the best in the world, if not, the best of the very best.6-No lightworker has ever paid a dime to be included or listed in the book, as owners of websites that list psychics on the Internet do and keep on doing. They charge psychics from $50 to $99 per month. I found this, to be atrocious and unfair.7-I have no ties to any psychic or medium. I have no interest in their financial enterprises. I was not paid to write about them. None of my assistants and investigative reporters is part of their circles and businesses.8-Already owners of websites that list psychics for a fee began to wage a war against my book, the honored psychics in the book, and even my name and integrity. They think that I am a threat to them, a real competition that could diminish their income, generated by fees paid by psychics, to be listed on their websites. I list psychics free. They list them for a fee. And if they cease to pay the listing fees, they kick them out!!!! They are strictly business people.9-In summary, the book was written, compiled and produced -by large- by myself, thousands of clients and unbiased reporters.10-Venomous so-called reviews of the book will surface soon, here and elsewhere, and to those who found satisfaction in doing so, I will say:les chiens aboient,la caravane passe.11-I asked the readers to be indulgent in the case they find grammatical errors in the emails, statements and recommendations of the clients. Some showed understanding and compassion. Few bitterly pointed out that the book is full of grammatical mistakes and errors. Well, they are not mine for sure. However few typos I  hold myself responsible for. It is a huge book which exhausted me for almost 2 months non-stop. So please turn the other cheek instead of biting me.12--I am so grateful to amazon.com and thousands of friends, psychics and readers who made this book a bestseller in less than 24 hours! Thank you.

Holy beings appeared before him with impassioned messages of urgency, entreating him to deliver God’s words to Earth. Within the same year, Master Okawa’s deepest subconscious awakened and revealed his calling to become a spiritual leader who is inspiring the world with the power of God’s Truths. Through these conversations with divine beings and through profound spiritual contemplation, Master Okawa developed the philosophy that would become the core of his teachings. His communications with Heaven deepened his understanding of God’s designs and intentions—how He created our souls, this world, the other world, and the Laws that are the very fabric of the universe. In 1986, Master Okawa founded Happy Science, a non-denominational universal religion, to share God’s Truths and to help humankind overcome religious and cultural conflicts and usher in an era of peace on Earth. As part of the Happy Science movement, Master Okawa founded a political party, the Happiness Realization Party, as well as a private middle and high school, Happy Science Academy. The universality and integrity of his spiritual teachings, delivered in his uniquely simple and pragmatic way, have attracted millions of readers and followers in over ninety countries. In addition to publishing over eight hundred books, Master Okawa has delivered more than 1,600 talks and lectures, and continues to share God’s Truths throughout the world.", "related": [], "rank": 4341080, "title": "The Next President: Spiritual Interviews with the Guardian Spirits of Newt Gingrich vs. Mitt Romney vs. Rick Santorum", "author": "Ryuho Okawa", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The free formatting guides and\nhelp pages were either bulked up with information I didn't need or\nstripped down to the point where it was practically useless. I was at my\n wits' end trying to sort everything out. It literally took weeks.Well, it shouldn't have.

Yet, gender played a crucial role in shaping the lives of the inhabitants of all pre-modern urban communities, both physically and conceptually, as a fundamental element of human identities, social relationships and the larger political, economic and cultural networks in which they were embedded.The wide range of case studies in this book spans various facets of gender during the ancient, medieval and early modern periods in Mexico, China, Britain, Italy, Carthage, Greece, Asia Minor and Persia.Gender and the City before Modernityoffers insights into the similarities, differences and convergences of gender as practiced in cities around the world.", "related": [], "rank": 4236652, "title": "Gender and the City before Modernity (Gender and History Special Issues Book 14) eBook", "author": "Lin Foxhall", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When daydreaming is your favourite hobby, you find that ideas are always popping intoyour head. The trick is to jot them down before they pop out of your head again! I also get a lot of good suggestions for new fairies sent in by my readers, and sometimes if they're very good I use them as the basis for a new series.  What is your favourite colour?  Bright red, the colour of courage and energy! Red is also the colour of Ruby in the Rainbow Fairies.  Which Rainbow Magic book is your favourite?  There are so many fab fairies, it's impossible to choose! But I have a soft spot for Summer the Holiday Fairy, because summer is my favourite time of year!  Are Rachel and Kirsty based on real people?  Yes. They're based on my best friends. Rachel and Kirsty are just like them: kind-hearted, adventurous, fun-loving and friendly.  Where is Rainspell Island?  Rainspell Island isn't a real place. It's based on a little island off the south coast of England that I used to visit when I was a little girl.  Which Rainbow Magic Fairy would you like to be and why?  Danielle the Daisy Fairy. Daisies are my favourite flower, and Danielle is the good-hearted girl-next-door whom everybody loves.  What makes you happy?  Sitting in the garden in the sunshine listening to the birds singing! Writing also makes me very happy, and reading the lovely letters from my readers.  If you could have one wish come true what would it be?  I've always wanted to be able to fly and have wonderful adventures just like Rachel and Kirsty have with all the Rainbow Magic fairies.  What is your favourite animal and do you have any pets?  I adore all animals so it would be really hard for me to pick a favourite! I have two dogs and three cats and love them all equally.

He wrote some 50 volumes of novels, poetry, short stories, fantasy, sermons, and essays. His influential body of work placed him alongside his eras great men of letters and his following was vast. Two decades after his death, his books were pivotal in leading C.S. Lewis to Christianity. He thus became the foundational member of Wheaton's Wade Center Seven.    After his death, most of MacDonald's books eventually went out of print as his name drifted from memory. However, he continued to be revered by an impressive gallery of well-known figures, including G.K. Chesterton (who referred to him as one of the three or four greatest men of the 19th century ), W.H. Auden (calling MacDonald one of the most remarkable writers of the 19th century), and Oswald Chambers ( ... how I love that man! ). In spite of such a following, however, MacDonald's reputation gradually declined throughout the 20th century.   MacDonald's most notable champion of the last century was C.S. Lewis, whose journey from atheism to Christianity was sparked by George MacDonald's prophetic view of God. Lewis persistently acknowledged his debt to MacDonald, whom he called his master. Lewis wrote: \"I dare not say that he is never in error; but ... I know hardly any other writer who seems to be closer ... to the Spirit of Christ Himself.... I have never concealed the fact that I regarded him as my master, indeed I fancy I have never written a book in which I did not quote from him.\" Both in his autobiography and throughout his writing career, Lewis emphasized that George MacDonald was the most significant impetus in his own spiritual pilgrimage.   MacDonald's writings can thus be seen as the spiritual soil out of which the faith of C.S. Lewis emerged. MacDonald's novels, fantasies, and fairy tales provide the imaginative foundation for Lewis's later writings, including the Chronicles of Narnia.   In spite of his own popularity, however, the spiritual roots of Lewis' s faith remain largely unknown. Lewis's words of 65 years ago are still true today. It has not seemed to me that those who have received my books kindly take ... sufficient notice of the affiliation [with George MacDonald]. Notwithstanding Lewis' s frequent emphasis on the Scotsman's influence in his own life, MacDonald's name in the late 20th century drifted into obscurity and his books became unavailable.   A resurgence of interest in the forgotten Victorian began to mount in the 1970s and 1980s, given initial impetus by Wheaton's Wade Center and the work of two Wheaton professors, Dr. Clyde Kilby, founder of the Center, and Dr. Rolland Hein, who released several editions of MacDonald's sermon extracts. MacDonald's name then exploded into public view in the years following, largely from the efforts of MacDonald redactor and biographer Michael Phillips. Building upon the efforts of Kilby, Hein, and others, and inspired by them, Phillips's work resulted in a new generation of readers discovering anew the treasures in MacDonald's stories, and led to a renewed publication of MacDonald's books on an unprecedented scale not seen since his own lifetime.   Now more than ever, thousands the world over are discovering why Madeleine L. Engle called George MacDonald the grandfather of all of us who struggle to come to terms with truth through imagination.", "related": ["B00GLSFJTW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Robust, flamboyant George Lambert, son of a Baltimore railway engineer, was reared in the New South Wales outback and became the most famous Australian painter of his day. In London he boxed Augustus John to the ground. His long absences from home added to the insecurities of his son Constant, who became a hard-drinking composer and conductor. Constant treated his own marriage as an amusing diversion; his ballet Horoscope cryptically described his affair with ballerina Margot Fonteyn. His jazz-classical fusions and a score for Diaghilev are now largely forgotten. Constant's son, Kit, manager of the rock group The Who, led a messy life of heroin addiction, drink and debt. Motion, an English poet and critic, explores the ways that each generation's flaws and neuroses were visited upon the next.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It received that acclaim in The\nBest American Mystery Stories edited by Joyce Carol Oates.Jack\n Whyte said this about the story:This story is wonderful...\nShades of Catcher in the Rye and Summer of 42, yet with more subtle\ndrama and tragedy than either one of them. The progression from laconic,\n semi-articulate disdain to hyperbolic overkill to stark, poetic\nsimplicity is masterful and the characters are brilliant. The English\nteacher, Mr. Sanders, emerges clearly, without ever being described; the\n father is juxtaposed with Curley [from of Mice and Men] without a\ndirect connection ever being made; and the narrator s skills increasing\nexponentially as the overwhelming aura of inevitability gains momentum.Diana Gabaldon said:Not only a gripping story with an authentic\nvoice, but a marvellous technical feat, combining three separate stories\n taking place simultaneously. By turns funny, touching, and horrifying; a\n beautiful job.The following year, Michael won the same award\n with his storyBut Not Forgotten. This is what the judges said about that one...Diana Gabaldon:Moving, with a sweet twist of an ending.Jack Whyte:A wonderful story, beautifully executed. The isolation of\nold age is there, and so is the invisibility and facelessness of old age\n in the eyes of youth.

In creating a scenario where you show how trust, friendship\nand then love was able to be nurtued fed and sustained between Sophie and Lucas\nyour story pulled me in gradually but firmly. You have written a truly\nchallenging and fullfilling story of love between two people who have more\nthings in common than the differences that are socially constructed by others.Out of a violent and painful first scene the story unfolds as a situation where\ntwo people, previously isolated from others find a new territory in the support,\nfriendship, respect and love for another person. The initial role of Sophie as\nthe person who rescues Lucas had alarms going for me in terms of the dynamics\nof power between the two.Many questions still remain for me but that is one of the reasons I found this\nstory so engaging.You create a range of complex external reference points in Sophie's personal\nlandscape of relationships. As they are all recalled as part of her internal\nreflections and memories I'm left wondering about how she relates to any other\npeople. Letting Lucas in seems to be unique and unusual situation for her.I am interested the role her publisher plays in showing Sophie's frustration\nand at times anger at being boxed in by others perceptions and preconcieved\nnotions.Connecting two isolated people raises the question about whether they are\nmoving into love from choice or because they are each reaching out to the only\nperson who represents an emotional platform outside of each persons previous\nexperience of simply existing as isolated individuals.\"-Ebonygriot UK", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.2727, "rating_total": 47.0}

He earned a Bachelor’s Degree at Penn State University and a Masters at Marywood University. During his college years RJ was a rhythm guitarist and vocalist in two bands. Shortly thereafter, he moved to San Diego where he went to work for a professional writing service. In addition, he wrote a monthly column for the Military Press, and another for a San Diego publication, providing advice to job seekers.      In the 90s, RJ got into comedy writing. He wrote for a local San Diego cable television show that had a Saturday Night Live-type format. Over its two seasons on the air, 34 of his skits were produced. Rock & Roll Homicide was the first novel in his Rock & Roll Mystery Series. The second novel, Rock & Roll Rip-Off, was selected 2010 Mystery/Thriller of the Year by Premier Book Awards. Third novel, The Concert Killer, features an original book trailer song that serves as a prequel to this serial killer novel.

As a result, there has been a variety of introductory volumes aiming to help the uninitiated reader grasp just how things 'hang together' with regards to a specific member of the trio.Perhaps due to the selectivity necessitated by approaching all three at once, Maher's book stands out amongst this group as offering the most accessible first port of call for the struggling student approaching the work of either Sellars, McDowell or Brandom. It is clearly and unpretentiously written; includes frequent previews and summaries throughout the narrative; and helpfully invites the reader into further engagement with the relevant thinkers by noting particular points of contention, puzzlement or incompleteness. The book thus succeeds in reaching its explicit goal, which is a genuine achievement given the difficult nature of the material involved.'–Jeremy Wanderer and Steven Levine, University of Massachusetts, BostoninNotre Dame Philosophical Reviews", "related": ["B00BM4TGXK"], "rank": 2132190, "title": "The Pittsburgh School of Philosophy: Sellars, McDowell, Brandom (Routledge Studies in Contemporary Philosophy Book 42)", "author": "Chauncey Maher", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I dreamed of the day I could start a family of my own and vowed to rear my children in a loving and caring manner. With the grace of God, I have accomplished this. My husband and I are the proud parents of two grown children. As an adult, I earned an Associate Degree in Early Childhood Education and proceeded to teach preschool. Nonetheless, I realize many children's lifestyles are similar to my upbringing and feel the need to encourage them to keep their faith in God.

I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask.

It'll be your own fault.\" She turned to walk away\nbut was detained by a heavy hand on her shoulder.     \"You can have one.\"     \"Mason!\"     \"Calm down, Bryce. I'll give her one of mine.\"     \"She's going to get us all caught.\"     \"Would you rather she run back to her dorm and tell them\nwhat we're up to?\"     \"Fine. She can have one. But no screaming.\"     \"I don't scream.\" Arlene grinned when her hand closed around\nthe familiar feel of a bottle rocket. She lifted an eyebrow at Mason before\nglancing around. \"The grove of trees look good to you?\"     \"You don't kid around.\"     \"You guys up for it?\"     Mason and Bryce exchanged glances in the dark before slowly\nnodding their agreement. \"Good.\" Arlene grinned. \"Then let's go.\"     Once they reached the grove they scattered, each canvassing\nthe area for their own spot to light the fuse. Finding a location that seemed\nrelatively dangerous, Arlene knelt to the ground and anchored her rocket. \"I\nknow you said no shenanigans, but I really need this right now,\" she whispered\nwith a sigh.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Two men were convicted of his murder, but his body has never been found. No suspect, however, was ever found in the case of MaryAnn Plett. The pretty, young real-estate agent disappeared after going to show a property to a client -- but some skeletal remains were discovered seven months later.In 1948, a family could hardly have guessed that their newly puchased home would come complete with a corpse; and, in another case, Winnie Wanner's bathroom was found splattered with blood. Although her estranged husband was seen leaving the apartment with a suspiciously large bag, Wnnie vanished from the face of the earth.These chilling tales, previously little known outside Alberta, also include matters of greed, rum running, shoot-outs, and hostages. They will be every bit as fascinating to the crime buff as those found anywhere.[Deadly Encounters] takes us behind the headlines and shows us the real people involved in the tragedies that crop up in our daily news. All the stories are well documented and told in a straightforward, accessible style. (George KaufmanBooks in Canada)True-crime aficionados will appreciate Edmonton writer Barbara Smith's addition to the genre. As a chronicling of some of the darker episodes of Alberta history - and there are many - it is a gem...[Smith's] writing is clear and, for the most part, her narrative flows beyond interesting and into engrossing waters.Deadly Encountersis a fine effort.

Moore (Woman Strangled--News at Ten) smoothly mixes mystery, romance, and humor in this excellent first in a new series set in Fort Worth, Tex. When Texas Christian University student Dainty Prescott lands an unpaid internship with WBFD-TV, the station manager, Gordon Pfeiffer, tells her to spy on his wife, Paislee. To Dainty's dismay, Paislee turns out to be having an affair with Dainty's law school boyfriend and date for the Rubanbleu's debutante ball, Strayer Drexel Truett III. Next, a sorority sister asks the pampered princess to investigate her mom's very suspicious fianceÌü, and ditzy Dainty soon realizes being Nancy Drew is a lot more fun than being Diane Sawyer. Adding romantic heat is Det. Jim Bruckman, whom Dainty meets after running a red light. Bodaciously blunt and destined to learn from her mistakes (or not), this Jimmy Choo–wearing snoop hasn't even gotten her license yet, but if this initial outing is any indication, her next case should be another eye-opener.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Everyone has ten pages in them, and I encourage everyone to write out those ten page stories for that reason alone. During that writing you will find part of yourself in the story, it leaks itself out whether you want it to or not. Writing those ten pages will bridge the gap between who you think you are and who you actually are. Don't concern yourself with if it's good or bad, Michelangelo's cannot be the judge of Picasso's. Just write, or act or paint of whatever it is you can do that's creative. We can run and lift weights, but when you start something creative and continue with it, your soul will grow stronger. We need that, the library of congress may have been built by muscle, but it's filled with the souls from the men and women who dared to live forever.  I suppose I should talk about myself. Well, here's me. I was born poor, I'm extremely uneducated to such a sad level that for years, for me to hold conversations with people I would remain quiet and search for excuses to get out of the situation. I am, of course still and always insecure that I'm not smart enough. Years later, I moved from Michigan to California to train as an actor. It was during these classes at PlayHouse West that I learned that I should stop following trends, stop considering what's attractive and what I should or should not look like. It's at PlayHouse West that I became comfortable with myself. I think of those moments fondly and hold that time in my life very dear to my heart.  I continue to read and study everything I can, simply to make up for all the years I didn't pay attention in classrooms or in life,at those times I was too worried if my smile were bright enough and my hair slick enough. I believe that I accidentally lose myself at times and I figure out who I am over and over again. I fight to remain myself, it's like Peter Pan struggling to fly. Sometimes I can think happy thoughts, sometimes I cannot. The difference is, I am not afraid to splat face first into the ground and laugh about it, lift myself up, and do a few more summersaults through the clouds. The key is to never be afraid of the next impending splat. Stay off the ground. That's where the alligators are.

Things didn't register for her at first as she looked down into the golden-yellow slitted eyes of the large reptile. Fear consumed her as she immediately thought of gators of crocodiles, but as the being pushed itself onto its hind legs, the blonde was more confused than she was frightened.The creature was at least six feet tall and naked, except for a loincloth that covered its privates. A tail swayed behind it while it canted its head. Its eyes narrowed at Felicia before its jaws opened wide, hissing in a most hostile way toward the blonde.Fear could only well up within Felicia for so long before it overflowed. She turned and jumped down the hill, no longer caring as she ran through the jungle. The blonde was quite fit and easily able to continue running for an extended time. Her breasts jiggled in a rather annoying fashion, forcing the busty woman to reach down and squeeze the mounds of flesh to keep them from being too annoying. She cursed at herself for tossing away the bra now.No matter how fast Felicia was, the lizardman was faster. Just as she started to think she had escaped, she looked over her shoulder to see the creature pouncing forward. Her eyes widened and she tried her best to dodge or counter his attack, but it was too fast.Landing on her back upon the jungle floor, she began punching at the beast's snout. It winced and turned its head away to avoid her attacks for a few moments until it opened its mouth and roared at her, giving her a perfect view of its numerous, scary, serrated teeth. With wide eyes, the blonde was too terrified to move again.Her life began to flash before her eyes, and yet all she could remember was the various times she had sex. And wow, was it a lot. Visions of the various relationships, hook-ups, and threesomes flooded her mind at once.The lizardman hissed as he observed Felicia. Something changed its mind. The blonde's attention was drawn to the creature's crotch, only to see the tenting fabric of its loincloth. She blinked in confusion, still not really understanding what was happening. But, as the beast moved the cloth away, Felicia stared as she was given the view of a thick, green, monster cock. It looked more like a human's than anything, but was structured completely differently with a ribbed appearance.\"Whoa! No! No, no, no, no!\" she protested while shaking her head.", "related": ["B003IWOC24"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She illustrated these stories as well, even though now she admits she can’t draw. Her parents would buy her extra school notebooks to write her stories in and her favourite place to write was under the carport during a rainstorm. She would sit at the picnic table and write for hours during summer storms. While still in high school, Serenity had nearly finished writing a full length novel. Unfortunately, the notebook fell out of her backpack during her Junior year (she believes on the bus) and was never found. Devastated, she turned from writing and threw herself into drama. For many years she participated in school musicals and community theater. She even had a very small (uncredited) part in the 2001 Tim Burton film “Planet of the Apes”. She did get to meet Burton though and said he was “eccentric but very nice”. She also did some modeling in the past few years and continues to pursue that venue as well. During this time she began writing again for an online RPG game based on the show “La Femme Nikita” (one of her favourite shows of all time). Slowly, she began to have ideas for her own stories again but always found that the middle of the story was missing. She wrote the beginning and left it until her block was defeated. Just recently, Serenity started writing again full force and has recently published her first book, an anthology of short stories. She has completed a companion novella to the book and is currently writing a paranormal mystery romance series. Serenity & Then Some: Serenity is the wife of an author. She is mum to 3 boys, currently aged 20, 16 and 20 months. Serenity graduated from Cerro Coso Community College in 2002 with two Associates Degrees in Social Sciences and Humanities, then went on to graduate in 2005 from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelors in Psychology and a minor in Latin American/Latino Studies. She is a proud Banana Slug and a proud sister of Sigma Pi Alpha Sorority. In the little free time she has between family and writing, she enjoys gardening, reading, crafting things, henna art, and watching such shows as Burn Notice, Covert Affairs, Warehouse 13, Law & Order SVU, Kitchen Nightmares, Project Runway and others.", "related": ["B00JE21FY0"], "rank": 2273587, "title": "The Fantastical Life of Serenity: A collection of short stories about what could be... but not quite is.", "author": "Serenity Valle", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If the story also sizzles with passion; has a large portion of life threatening danger, and is garnished with humour so much the better. Married at 18 I had a lovely house and two wonderful sons by the time I was 23. I started writing stories when the boys were in bed. My first efforts, painstakingly hammered out on a battered typewriter, made me realise that I required typing and shorthand skills to allow my fingers to keep up with my imagination. A couple of years, and a draw full of secretarial certificates later, I acquired a second hand computer and set out to write my first historical novel. Working full time as a sales administrator/office manager and running a home was stressful. I had to squeeze my writing and research in where-ever I could. When I also became a single mother my, 'me time' dwindled to a few hours a week. I never gave up. My novel got thicker and thicker and I realised that I had enough material for a trilogy. A new husband, Brian, came with another two lovely boys. Understanding my need to write, Brian actively encouraged me and fed me when I became too engrossed in the plot to remember to eat. Recently, after selling my Post Office and Newsagents, purchased in 2003, I sat down to write my first contemporary romantic suspense novel, An Exclusive Affair.

We all need a combination personal trainer / life coach /\ncomedian but we don't want to pay any more for it than, say, the price of a\npaperback book - like this one. If all you want are practical tips on how to achieve\nor avoid anything, you just need to Google it. Buying a car, painting a fence,\ndiagnosing your own symptoms or negotiating with a prostitute (and later having\nto re-diagnose new symptoms); there's no shortage of advice out there.

It won't always be obvious which\nare which so we're here to help. You're supposed to learn from your mistakes. Wouldn't\nlife be better for you if you learned from the mistakes of others before you\nmade them yourself? We, the authors, have made a LOT\nof mistakes so who better for you to learn from? Sometimes you need to make the\nmistake yourself and feel the pain to absorb the learning but not always. We've\nspent our entire lives making mistakes for your benefit and this book is the\nresult - helpful advice dished out in the sincerely facetious but easily\ndigestible style of two drunken uncles who occasionally repeat or contradict\nthemselves. If nothing else, we've learned that a sense of humour will prevent\na lot of your problems and lessen the problems that you can't prevent. Swimming pools can be treacherous if you're thrown in\nthe deep end when you don't know how to swim. (Actually, being thrown in the\ndeep end was how I learned to swim.) The less risky approach might be to\nstart out in the shallow end. We've structured this book along those lines. This\nis not about merely surviving. This is about thriving and moving yourself\ntowards success and happiness but also not taking things too seriously. The\ncontrol is in your hands.

His research investigates the fabrication of colloidal assemblies and devices, with a specialty in understanding the interparticle forces and sorting processes.  His research group uses a wide range of experimental and modeling approaches.  In 2009 Velegol was promoted to Full Professor at Penn State.  For his work in experimental and theoretical problems in the dynamics of complex colloidal particles, Velegol was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2011, and appointed as a Distinguished Professor at Penn State in 2012.  He is a member of ACS, AIChE, AAAS, and ASEE.  More recently, he has engaged in studying the “physics of community”, pursuing questions in learning, creativity, motivation, trust and deceit, courage, and other social science ideas using results from physics, chemistry, biology, and chemical engineering.  In 2011 he published a book, Wild Scholars, available through amazon.com, and he seeks to impact grades 7-12 education throughout Pennsylvania and beyond.

Patrick has hit on the major themes of what a man experiences as he travels through the tragic journey of a destroyed family. With the divorce rate hitting half of all marriages, and women filing for almost 80 % of these tragic states of mind, Patrick has written the first book designed to help the struggling male to deal with this national crisis on a personal level. Patrick O’Cahir is a writer in North Carolina and has endured many hardships due to the failing of the American family. He has survived by using humor and alcohol. Patrick admits that he is funnier after a few drinks and therefore The Drinking Man’s Guide to Divorce (and Women) should help even the most bitter men to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The research is real, the case studies accurate, and the book is right on for those men that go to bed each night wondering why their wife left them. Read this book, laugh and drink, and get on with your life with a new outlook on the female species. Patrick O’Cahir’s The Drinking Man’s Guide to Divorce (and Women) is the new “self help” book of the 21st century. His serious fiction, The White School, tackles the problems of inter-racial schools where discipline is a four letter word and teachers would stab their own mother in the back for tenure and to maintain their position. Education is secondary; survival is primary. O’Cahir has been there and done that, teaching and administrating, so his knowledge is first hand, and his use of the vernacular spot-on.

When I was eight years old, I spent a few years living in Connecticut, USA as my family had emigrated. I still feel America is my second home. However, following the untimely demise of my father's health and subsequent death, England, once more, was home. I have written short-stories and poetry from my early teenage years. I read Geography as a mature student at the University of Exeter, starting when my third child was 3 months old. I have been an active parent for thirty-two years and a single parent since 2007. I have four adult children and two grandchildren. My youngest son left home in 2012. I have had, and continue to have, an eclectic working life which has spanned the private, public and voluntary sectors within the United Kingdom. My experience stretches across the police service, marketing and, business, social and economic development. Apart from the trilogy Resurrections, I have five other novels clambering over one another calling out to be finished, read and heard. All of which I have started and to varying degrees are enticing my imagination. Two are fantasies, two are historical fiction and one is a a romance. I live and write in Exeter, England and enjoy its growing cosmopolitan feel along with the blessings of living in close proximity - 30 minutes or less - to the sea, rural landscapes and the wildness of the moors.

Clear, concise, effective, brillant!\" Gianemilio Osculati, CEO of Wealth Management at SanPaolo  Assicura  ‘This is a truly inspirational book which clearly sets out the steps to strategic success. It is a very useful tool for managing in the current very uncertain strategic context.’ Nicolas Petrovic,Chief Executive Officer, Eurostar  ‘In a sea of very useful frameworks and great cases about strategy, what really strikes me is the lean testing methodology which is truly compelling. This is a great way to hedge uncertainty across cycles, geographies, business models and also personal biases. I really see a way to transform the strategic process into a learning process for my organisation.’ Aldo Bisio,Chief Executive Officer, Ariston Thermo ‘I have been impressed by both the quality and practicality of the book.

Often while I was reading it I thought “Now I know why XYZ worked!” recalling in my mind situations and decisions I made in the past.It is a definite read for both young and seasoned executives. It is written in an easy, but at the same time, exciting style.’ Christina Miccoli, Chairman, CheBanca! ‘Although strategic thinking and acting are definitely the most complex business processes, Jerome and Davide have brilliantly mastered this challenging topic and have created a book providing clear and direct guidance, not only on how to tackle these challenges but how to finish as a winner.’ Dr Andreas Penk, President of the Pfizer Oncology business in Europe and Country Lead for Pfizer Germany ‘How to Think Strategicallymakes for fascinating reading on the three pillars of strategy: strategic thinking, strategy formulation and strategy execution.

Very useful and inspirational reading for those facing complex challenges who are willing to find unexplored paths aimed at turning threats into opportunities.’ Salvatore De Rienzo, consultant, EgonZehnder  ‘A clever way to view and approach strategic management.

Great job, Davide and Jerome!’ Marco Toledo, Chief Operating Officer, Tosetti Value SPA “Designing and executing a robust strategy to address a core challenge and create value, is a key condition to be competitive. The authors have structured the process like a journey through the strategic path and are providing the readers with very robust tools, case stories and tips, on how to make it work for everyone.

Crazy-happy childhood, she always has had a vivid imagination and loads of energy. The youngest of six -- four older brothers, and a sister -- taught her at a young age to be competitive in all aspects of life. At sixteen, she began competing in athletics (track and field) and before she turned seventeen, she was representing Canada in high jump. She continued to compete, breaking Canada's JR High Jump record (1.92m - 6' 3 1/2\" for those metric-ly challenged). She attented University of Toronto, and Kansas State University - winning CIAU's and becoming All-American 6x - NCAA Indoors Runner Up + more. But you're not interested in her athletic career - unless of course you're curious to know she stands 1.70m (5'7\") and has jumped 20cm over her head on more than one occassion. She's represented Canada at the World Championships, World Jrs., won Francophone Games, and loved every minute of every competition. From the grueling workouts, the crazy weights she lifted on her back, the days she thought her lungs were going to spit out of her mouth for lack of oxygen, the travelling around the world and the opportunity to read - her favourite past time. Wanita and her husband run an online business, dealing in antiques and collectables - particularly jewelry and porcelain (one of the business' website: www.wadeincanada.com ). After her father passed away in 2009, from a six-year battle with cancer (which she still believes he won the fight against), she began to write again. A passion she'd loved for years, but realized life was too short to keep putting it off. Her first book, Rae of Hope - from the Chronicles of Kerrigan - is available now, along with Dark Nebula - the second book in the series. Her Hidden Secrets Saga is also available!", "related": ["B00E3ERICC"], "rank": 4760, "title": "Seventh Mark - Part 1: Werewolves Shifters Paranormal Romance (The Hidden Secrets Saga)", "author": "W.J.

Stratton is an International Amazon bestselling author in the romantic suspense and mystery suspense categories for her debut novel After the Storm. She is a self-proclaimed dork that loves to make people laugh and can trip over nothing. Her inner rock star is always on stage performing to a sold out crowd but is quiet and shy on the outside. She lives with her husband and son in Arizona, which is a big difference from where she grew up north of Chicago Illinois. As an only child she learned to tell herself stories to make the long winters go by quicker while dreaming of summer vacations. Now as an adult she still makes up stories to pass the time, but now she writes them down to share with other people. When not writing you can find M. watching football (Go Bears!), NASCAR, or classic movies, watching her husband and father restore classic cars, and seeing who can be sillier, her or her son, and of course reading. Things you don’t know about M. Stratton: 1. She loves the movie Twister… she can say all the lines along with the actors. She will also use those lines in real life as often as possible.   2. Halloween is her favorite holiday. She starts planning months in advance. She has more Halloween decorations than Christmas.   3. She once made up a monologue about her love of chocolate chip cookie dough for her high school drama class.   4. There are times she thinks she is so funny she has tears running down her face while laughing at herself.   5. M. can play the clarinet but is in awe of anyone who can play the guitar, piano or drums, pretty much anything where your hands have to do two different things at the same time.   6. Cary Grant is her favorite actor. When she was in high school after Cary Grant died one of the cable stations ran a marathon, she watched his movies from 6 in the morning all day and night until 4 AM the next day.   7. Reading has always been an escape for her. She can devour a book in hours. When she moved in with her husband she literally donated over 1,000 books and saved over 1,000 for herself. She can reread books over and over again if she loves them. There are some that she has reread about once a year for the past 20 years.   8. She eloped after knowing her husband for only two months in 2006. They are still married over seven years later.", "related": ["B005M3IN72"], "rank": 624395, "title": "Eye of the Storm (The Storm Series Book 2)", "author": "M.

Over the last twelve years, Paul has worked as a soldier (part time only), a bouncer, a security officer and a police officer, not necessarily in that order. In a 6 year police career, Paul worked on the beat (on a mountain bike of all things), on response, then on LST, specializing in riot duties and working as a riot medic. Paul then went on to join DIU (the divisional intelligence unit) and worked on undercover drug operations as well as dealing with vehicle crime for the city and anything else that caught his eye. During his police career Paul was twice given bravery awards in the form of divisional congratulations. Paul eventually left the police for a high-profile security job in the US which fell through, and now uses the skills he gained in the police in the private sector in the UK. While in the police, Paul met Peter James and soon the two became firm friends, Paul helping Peter as an adviser on his Roy Grace series on novels. Outside of work and writing, Paul has studied white crane kungfu for about a dozen years on and off, and lives in Brighton which he loves and hates with a passion. Wherever he goes in the city he is reminded of a job that he attended, a person he arrested or a crime scene he worked, which is why he writes about the place with such vigour and realism.", "related": ["B00GDQQUM2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this\n book as it is very straight forward and practical. It lists down 15\ncommon situations that parents have to deal with and gives 5 steps to\nhandle each of these situations effectively. Though each child is\ndifferent, the suggestions made in this book should work well in most\ncases. Parenting is one of the most beautiful experiences in one's life\nand this book would help in making it all the more enjoyable!≧◔◡◔≦  BySteve BureauRaising children is not always easy. We move forward with our personal\nknowledge and depending on how we were raised by our parents. It is\nalways interesting to read about raising children. This book is very\nwell structured. The next chapter helped me a lot: \"Secrets To Get\nChildren To Do Their Homework\". I will use these 5 secrets tonight.≧◠◡◠≦✌  ByAnkit NThe tips the author offers in the form of secrets are practical and\nactionable. Every new parent must keep these points in mind. Its\nastonishing how many of us simply assume that we know parenting and\nwhat's best for our kids. We should instead take the time to pick out\nand read helpful books like this one.
