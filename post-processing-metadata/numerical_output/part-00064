Publication of The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms immediately established Hemingway as one of the greatest literary lights of the twentieth century.

Hemingway was an aficionado of bullfighting and big-game hunting, and his main protagonists were always men and women of courage and conviction who suffered unseen scars, both physical and emotional. He covered the Spanish Civil War, portraying it in the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls, and he also covered World War II. His classic novella The Old Man and the Sea won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954.

But what do these numbers really mean and are they communicating a categorical truth? Blastland and Dilnot, from the BBC radio showMore or Less, embark on a monumental task of interpreting numerical data and showing how its misinterpretation often leads to misinformation. It is one thing to measure, they write, quite another to wrench the numbers to a false conclusion. The authors take a close look at statistics that are accepted at face value—many stemming from scientific or medical discoveries. They examine everything from the link between alcohol and breast cancer risk to baseball batting averages to fascinating assessments of the manipulation of data by politicians when they talk taxes or the cautionary tale of a U.K. educational measurement program designed much like No Child Left Behind. Blastland and Dilnot apply their famously cheeky approach to the analysis of how people are duped, frightened or falsely encouraged by data.(Jan.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ibsen's genius,  revealed in these four selections, lies  in his  startling abiliy to define his characters and their  struggles,  whih epitomize the inner conflicts that  beset all human beings.

Lehmann attended public schools in his hometown of Novato, California, and then attended the College of Marin, San Francisco State, and University of San Francisco Law School. In late 1972, keeping an oath made after the self inflicted death of a close friend resultant from depression after small weight felony arrests for marijuana, Mr. Lehmann joined former Reagan and Nixon senior campaign professional Gordon S. Brownell, in drug reform efforts which led to greatly reduced and misdemeanor penalties for the same conduct where arrests had led to the loss of his friend. Mr. Lehmann has as of November of 2009 practiced law for more than 32 years, with a specialty focus since 1983 in litigation involving engineering and scientific proof, including matters involving accident reconstruction in aircraft and vehicle crashes, where he was a long time student of famed reconstruction expert H. Howard Hasbrook, a pioneer of that field.  The firm also conducted a specialty practice in level failures and engineering cases involving failed foundations and similar structural engineering issues.  Mr. Lehmann estimates that he has handled or personally supervised more than 1600 civil actions, including, for example, serving as Class Counsel in the Chevron Aviation Gasoline class action, which resulted in new engines for roughly 1647 aircraft and the resultant avoidance of many crashes.  Mr. Lehmann then served as co-Class Counsel in the Mobil AV-1 class action, resulting in major engine repairs or overhauls for 850 aircraft; from these two cases, in company with aircraft crash litigation, Mr. Lehmann has represented more aircraft owners in U. S. litigation than any lawyer in the United States.  Long fascinated by his legal work relating to the sciences and engineering, Mr. Lehmann has so far won five patents; those interested engine physics may find recently granted U. S. Patent 7,581,526 of interest.", "related": [], "rank": 3142194, "title": "No Canary in the Quanta: Who Gets to Decide if the Large Hadron Collider is Worth Gambling Our Planet?", "author": "Harry V.

When a classmate schedules a girls-only slumber party, the boys declare war, and Katie's two best friends are on opposite sides of the gender gap. So, when the \"magic wind\" turns her into a boy, she tries to reconcile the feuding parties, but her interference only seems to make matters worse. It takes a lost puppy and a determined team effort to bring the friends back together. The fantasy element adds a touch of humor to the familiar boy-girl conflict and the dialogue has an authentic playground ring. The drawings are reminiscent of comic-book art or those 1970s paintings of children with large eyes. Transitional readers will enjoy the humor and appreciate the satisfying triumph of friendship over gender roles.Elaine E.

When Jenny dies under mysterious circumstances, the daughters hope that some of her millions will trickle down to boost their budding businesses. But their mother has apparently died in penury and now each daughter must create her own success, as well as try to clear Jenny's name.

We arrived in Spain in 1962 with six hundred bucks to our name, not knowing where or how we would live.  We thrived, built our home and filled it with children, dogs, cats, horses, birds, and countless visiting friends.  In 1982, having unearthed or acquired some five thousand significant artifacts dating from Neolithic times to the fifteenth century, and 400 prime pieces of Spanish antiquities, we started Museo Hollander.  Nearly twenty years ago, Gino and I donated our museum to the Spanish government and began our reentry into life in the States.  Instead of returning to the hectic pace of Manhattan, we opted for the sylvan beauties of Aspen, Colorado-quiet and peace for me and snow-capped magnificent wilderness adventure for Gino.   I've had more than my share of careers, among them, high school teacher, filmmaker, museum designer and curator, hotel decorator, and poet.

Drawing on extensive original research in four countries, Falleti uses a new 'comparative sequence method' to show how decentralization reforms varyingly empower subnational political actors depending on when and in what order they are adopted.  This fascinating argument is a shining example of the power of comparative-historical analysis and will become a touchstone for all future research on subnational politics in Latin America.\"-James Mahoney, Northwestern University\"Advocates and detractors of decentralization have assumed that it increases the power of subnational governments - whether for good or for ill.  But what if they are both wrong?  In this important and innovative work, Tulia Falleti offers a major corrective to the literature on decentralization by showing that decentralizing reforms do not necessarily enhance the resources, authority and capacity of subnational officials relative to the center.  It all depends, according to Falleti, on the territorial interests (national or subnational) that dominate the initial decision to decentralize, along with the particular sequence of decentralizing reforms (administrative, fiscal and political) that is thereby set in motion.  Based on exhaustive research in four major Latin American countries, Falleti offers a theory of decentralization that is both elegant and respectful of the complexities of her cases.  This book should be carefully read not only by students of decentralization, but by the scores of development practitioners who are actively engaged in programs of support for decentralization across the developing world.\"-Kent Eaton, University of California, Santa Cruz\"Falleti's original sequential theory of decentralization persuasively explains the variation in the substance and effects of decentralization in Latin America's largest countries according to the timing of the entrance of the national and local actors onto the stage. Informed by more than one hundred and fifty in-depth interviews with top ranking politicians and extensive archival research, this marvelous book makes a compelling contribution to the study of Latin American politics.\"-Frances Hagopian, University of Notre Dame\"Tulia Falleti's study of decentralization in Latin America is a jewel of thoughtful, comparative analysis. Why is there so much variation in the autonomy of subnational governments? The answer is elegant and powerful: final outcomes depend heavily on initial reforms. A territorial coalition that prioritizes political over administrative decentralization carves a path to deeper subnational autonomy than one that prefers administrative over political decentralization. This is a must-read for anyone interested in decentralization.\"-Liesbet Hooghe, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill", "related": [], "rank": 2070102, "title": "Decentralization and Subnational Politics in Latin America", "author": "Falleti", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her collection of short essays includes three alarmingly candid, ironic, and funny stories about her insecure, at times misspent, youth. The first tells of her first two crushes, one of which winds up killing the other's father. In \"Mary Destiny,\" Lonow gives a behind-the-set look at her first acting role and an account of the drugs she decided to take before watching her televised debut alone. \"Indignity\" is Lonow's self-assessment as she watches a sex-club orgy, part of a bizarre plan to secure a boyfriend's love. Vivid writing and a brisk pace bring these stories to life, while laugh-out-loud moments make them totally satisfying. --Paul Diamond", "related": [], "rank": 1377427, "title": "How To Not Succeed In Show Business By Really Trying (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Claudia Lonow", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Covering the Lusitanian presence on five continents, it pays attention simultaneously to political decisions of opposing court factions in Portugal, to the leading role of noble captains and agents working inside and outside formal colonial institutions, and to their involvement in a variety of local cultures. As a result, Anthony Disney is able to emphasize the centrality of Portuguese colonial situations as cultural hybrids.\"  -Diogo Ramada Curto, European University Institute, Florence and Universidade Nova de Lisboa\"Anthony Disney has provided in this impressive two-volume survey of the history of Portugal and its overseas empire to the beginning of the nineteenth century a work of synthesis that has long been needed. Up-to-date in its scholarship, lucid and coherent in its exposition, his account, skillfully blending narrative and analysis, will immediately take its place as the essential starting-point for all those interested in the origins and character of the first truly global empire in world history.\"     -Sir John Elliott, Regius Professor Emeritus of Modern History, University of Oxford\"The history of the Portuguese world is barnacled with accretions: traditional errors, apparently ineradicable myths, partisan controversies, irrational passions.  Anthony Disney has scraped the bottom and set the ship to rights. His book is sober but engaging, meticulous but well paced, comprehensive but concise: a monument of scholarship and discernment, which everyone interested in the subject will want to hand.\"   -Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, Tufts University\"This book provides a comprehensive and stimulating view of the history of the early modern Portuguese Empire. Without losing sight of chronology and geography, political projects and economic trends, Disney skillfully elaborates on key issues of the social history of Overseas Portugal, such as the nature of colonial societies or the relevance of informal settlements. The author masters an impressive range of primary sources and secondary materials and builds on them to offer a refreshing global history of the Portuguese Empire that will undoubtedly stand as reference in the field for many years to come.\"  -Jorge Flores, Brown University\"Disney's volume provides a full economic and political outline of a truly global maritime enterprise.  It is the most accessible and up to date history of the Portuguese Empire available in English.\"   -Stuart Schwartz, Yale University\"This long-awaited volume by Anthony Disney possesses all the qualities we have come to expect of his scholarship. It is balanced, sober and written with clarity of vision and purpose. Four decades after Charles Boxer's classic work on the Portuguese seaborne empire, we at last have another elegant synthesis that takes on the whole of the Portuguese overseas enterprise from 1400 to 1800 armed with the fruits of the latest research. Imperial historians of a comparative bent will be obliged to read this work, and students of European expansion and the Iberian world will certainly find it on their reading lists. It is unlikely to be replaced for another generation.\"  -Sanjay Subrahmanyam, Professor of History, UCLA\"A remarkable achievement, combining rigour with lucidity and offering expert guidance across a complex and varied historical terrain.\" Times Literary Supplement", "related": ["B00ASEDPFA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That feeling of validation is invaluable to me. Reading Letters from Janice did exactly that, along with bringing new insights and unexpected information that I found incredibly joyful and uplifting.I don't know how a reader would feel if they came to this book without any background in metaphysical thought and then encountered the ideas put forth in Letters from Janice -- perhaps it would seem frightening or really hard to believe. But coming to this book after decades of studies in metaphysics, I could only feel extremely EXCITED by it.Having read both of Mr. Hatford's books on Valentino before reading the Letters from Janice, I came to this book already fully convinced that the author is an adept and true gateway to the essences of the departed. Even if I hadn't felt that way about Mr. Hatford, the essence of Janice comes through from word one; you can literally feel her presence in the printed word.I am really grateful that they each chose to put their time and effort into writing this book. I found the information within it nothing short of a personal blessing and so perfectly timed. If you are considering buying this book, do it!

(You\ncan easily substitute angry for upset, stressed, worried, sad, tired,\netc.)That much anger should have killed me (both mentally and physically), but it did not. Here is why:That\nsixth year I decided to leave everything that I was dealing with and\nstart over in a new city. One would say a new peace of mind. However,\nmy situation was not really better. I was still under-employed, had\ndebt, etc. But somewhere down the line, I started to post motivations\non my Facebook page. I would use things I was going through in my\npersonal life to encourage others on how to deal with the issues.A\nlittle down the line, people were inspired by my motivations and told\nme that I should write a book. After a month or so, I started writing\none. About a month into writing the book I noticed something. The\nmotivations that I was writing were changing me for the better. I was\nmore positive and excited for life.Well now a year\nlater and I am happy to say that my life has gone full circle. I am\nmore joyful, prosperous (both mentally and physically), and excited\nabout life. I have truly found peace.To me, this\nnewly found \"gift\" could have only been God's greatness entering my\nlife. I would have never dreamed that I would be taking a negative and\nturning it into a positive, while inspiring so many people.Between\nmy motivation books and my newly formed motivation company, also titled\nMotivation of the Mind. I am determined to continue this LIFE CHANGING\npositive movement. I want others to experience the newly found joy that\nI now have in life.I hope this book inspires, motivates, and blesses you,-Sylvester \"Sly\" Veal Jr-", "related": [], "rank": 2652898, "title": "Motivation of the Mind: 50 Motivations that Move You through the Mountains of Life", "author": "Sylvester Veal Jr.", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Madsen brings together a collection of articles by some of the most published scholars on Erdrich in the field, including P. Jane Hafen, Connie A. Jacobs, and David Stirrup. The result is an important and versatile critical compilation that employs a wide variety of theoretical approaches and enables readers to interpret Erdrich’s work in new, relevant, and thought- provoking ways...Another strength of the text is the variety of theoretical approaches the contributing writers use, from ecocriticism to postcolonial theory, from trauma theory to Native American theoretical approaches. These varied lenses help readers to consider Erdrich’s work from many diff erent viewpoints.

Driven to recreate the sound, he got his first whistle in 1995, and has been playing obsessively ever since. He originally earned his chops in Houston, Texas, known for its large Celtic music scene featuring such bands as Clandestine and Instanpitta, as well as a 20+ year old Irish Session tradition. With the Texas Renaissance Festival close by, and being one of the largest Renaissance festivals in the country, Greg had exposure to more top notch musical talent, such as The Rogues (6 time Grammy award winners), the Gypsy Guerilla Band and more. Greg formed his first band, Echoes of Ireland, in Houston in the year 2000. EoI featured a traditional sound with the tinwhistle as the lead instrument, accompanied guitar and bodhran (a type of Irish drum). The band quickly gained success and recognition in Houston, performing regularly in Irish pubs across the city, and was one of only two bands chosen to perform for Charles Sheehan, Consul General of Northern Ireland, on his visit to Houston for a Special Olympics Benefit in 2003. The band was also featured on KPFT's Irish Airs program.  After moving to Dallas, Greg formed the band Scotch-Irish to perform at the Texas Rennaisance Festival, as well as performing alongside artist EJ Jones during festival events. The band featured Greg on whistle and low whistle, accompanied by bodhran and fiddle. This dynamic trio cranked out high-energy dance music for 10 hours a day on the grounds of the Festival, and selling their self-titled CD. Greg began performing weekly with the O'Dwyer Session Players, and was quickly recruited to play for F-Troupe, later to be known as Paddy Gone Wild. Paddy Gone Wild is a large céilidh-style band featuring a revolving retinue of musicians.  Paddy Gone Wild released their first CD, The Greatest Hits, in 2008, prominently showcasing Greg's playing on much of the CD. Greg can currently be found playing occasionally at Irish sessions in Northern Virginia.", "related": [], "rank": 1469085, "title": "Fifty Great Celtic Jigs", "author": "Gregory L.

As passionate about life as he is about art, his is an amazing story about a man whose creative soul was shaped by the Arctic barrens and who has spent much of his life capturing that fierce beauty on canvas. Now living in a sea side cottage on Vancouver Island, where he shares his studio with a roving family of otters, he has turned his eye to the windswept landscape of the West Coast for inspiration. An outspoken champion of conservation, he uses his art both to reflect and preserve the natural beauty of the world.\" --Mark Hume, National Correspondent forThe Globe and Mail\"Ken Kirkby's story is a story of an artist who entered the world of the Inuit and was transformed by the experience. One of his famous paintings is an Inukshuk standing guard over a majestic Canadian flag. In March of 1992 he unveiled his painting, Isumataq, in Parliament, a moment that brought 301 Members of Parliament to their feet.Goody Niosi captures the remarkable story of Kirkby's life with the Inuit. She paints the picture of the world he found, the overwhelming beauty of the northern lights, the pain of snow blindness, the danger of the hunt for food and most of all the transformation of Kirkby that allowed him \"to walk through a golden door\" and become part of a culture very different from our own; one in which people are non-possessive, non-intrusive, non-violent, supremely philosophical and live life with a quite sense of humour.Kirkby has used his astonishing talent as an artist to change Canada's perception of the Inuit. In this beautifully written book, Niosi relates Kirkby's story from his youth in Portugal to his work as an environmentalist.\"--Thora Howell, bookseller and librarian\"The events and conversations are true as I remember them. Some were told to me and some happened to me but most were of my own doing. With the passage of time they have melded into each other like a myriad of tributaries dissolving into a river. I cannot with any certainty tell you if every detail is accurate.

It is divided into eight short chapters and consists of eight simple lessons on how to live your life by simply feeling lucky. The first two chapters say that lucky people live life driven by purpose and think creatively. Succeeding chapters show lucky people choosing their beliefs, being guided by values, managing their emotions, and recognizing the so called synchronicity sign posts. The last two topics are creating networks and being grateful for the good luck you receive everyday.Jesvir Kaur Mahil's \"You're So Lucky!\" is an easy to read and inspiring book. For people who feel frustrated at one time or another, just as all of us tend to do, this is a must read. The lessons are said to be tried and tested on personal development technology as well as coaching principles. It uses stories and questions, and is designed to lead to to self reflection. The book can be used as a guide on the state of our emotional and psychological condition too. One of the keys to feeling lucky is to be receptive to luck as something that can happen to us everyday. By doing so, we can create our destinies and shape our lives in such a way that we can achieve whatever it is that our heart desires. The lessons in this book can certainly be helpful to us as we struggle in our daily lives.", "related": [], "rank": 3643643, "title": "You're So Lucky!", "author": "Jesvir Mahil", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And it turns out that everyone with an office job is disgruntled at least some of the time. In a way, Dilbert predicted the current wave of reality entertainment. I'd love to say my writing is what makes Dilbert work, but it probably has more to do with the recognizable workplace situations and the fact that people see themselves in the strip. Dilbert works best when the characters give voice to what employees in the real world are thinking.Amazon.com:The Kindle edition of Dilbert 2.0 is split into four volumes organized by business era. Are there signature characters or themes that mark the essence of each era?Scott Adams:In the early ears, volume one, Dilbert wasn't strictly about the workplace. Dilbert had a job, but the comic was more often based around his home. The next volume involves strips written during the downsizing of the early nineties, at about the same time Dilbert became a workplace strip. Next came the hardest era for any cartoonist -- the dotcom years. During the go-go days of the Internet, when employees felt well-paid and hopeful, it was hard to find humor. Humor prefers dysfunction. We now know that the dotcom era was hugely dysfunctional, but it wasn't obvious to most people who were in it. Then came the modern era, when hope and compensation took a hit, and once again it became easy to do my job.Amazon.com:How did you narrow down your selections from more than 7,000 potential strips to the nearly 2,000 included in Dilbert 2.0?Scott Adams:It wasn't easy! I tried to find the strips that were the funniest while also having some meaning, or a funny story attached. But it felt like I was a mother with triplets and someone told me I could only keep one of them.Amazon.com:What were the greatest challenges and opportunities associated with translating Dilbert 2.0 for the Kindle Fire?Scott Adams:It's a fascinating process. When you change the physical delivery system for a comic, you can also change the pacing. There's a tradeoff between what looks best and what reads most fluidly. I think we found the right balance.Amazon.com:What are you most excited about for the Dilbert of the future?Scott Adams:I'm hoping a Dilbert movie comes together soon. We're working on it, but movies are never a sure thing. A lot of elements have to fall in place. And we'll be doing a lot with Dilbert.com and with mobile phone distribution. It's an exciting time to be a cartoonist.", "related": [], "rank": 210136, "title": "Dilbert 2.0: The Boom Years, 1994 to 1997: 20 Years of Dilbert", "author": "Scott Adams", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After graduating as an architectural engineer in 1963 he entered the office of Rietveld as an apprentice architect. Stahl worked in Germany and Switzerland, prior to leaving for the U.S. to continue his studies. His interest in Schopenhauer came about by suggestion of Rietveld to his questions as to whether any color theory or system had been an influence on Rietveld's use of color in architecture. He graduated in 1972 with a Masters Degree in Architecture from the University of Illinois, Urban-Champaign, and moved to Chicago where he still resides. He worked for a several architectural offices, dedicating much time to research, teaching, and art consulting; taught mural painting and architecturally related art from 1975 until 1981 at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago; and conducted extensive research on the Chicago street-mural movement. In 1981, for SOM (Chicago), he acted as technical consultant and artistic coordinator for a 24'x 25'x 2\" solid laminated stained glass window designed by Mexican artist Rufino Tamayo, fabricated by the Dutch company of Tetterode, and executed in Mexico City.

These people give of their time to volunteer and tithe on their income. Managing these resources is a significant responsibility and church leaders are challenged with this administrative oversight. Managing a church office has many of the same challenges as managing any other business and requires many of the same systems and processes to be successful.The GuideSmart Church Management - A Quality Guide to Church Administration, 1st Edition is perfect for anyone in church leadership. The book is a leader's handbook on running the day-to-day operation of a church.  With easy to understand examples, this book provides a simplistic approach to managing church resources - people, time and money.  Whether it is setting church goals, making budget decisions or managing church personnel or volunteers, this book offers practical application, tips, tools with real life examples and much more!The Response\"There's no magic wand or shortcuts to a better (church) office environment or more people in your pews. But following the ideas and embracing the concepts in this book may cause exactly the results you're hoping for; an efficient church staff or organization with greatly improved communication skills, leading to greater church services and/or outreach ministry, resulting in healthier Christians making a greater impact on the world around them, and even major church growth.  Isn't that what building God's Kingdom is all about?\"-Pastor Scott Freeman,Harvest Cathedral Church \"Smart Church Management is about quality not quantity. I was really impressed by this book and the brilliant ideas that Patricia shares with us with such simplicity and practicality. Somewhere along the lines of church history, Pentecostal and Charismatic church leadership equated organization and processes for not being organic and spiritual. We don't need another fast growth program for churches we need quality leadership and organizations that create quality people.\"- Mark Passarella -Eagles' Wings Ministries This book is a great resource for Church Boards, Business Administrators, Executive Pastors, Volunteer Leaders, Church Management Team or anyone managing church resources!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

On a regular basis, they visit Auntie Pish and Auntie Snowdrop, who raised his father. A letter written by Aunt Snowdrop arrives several years after her death, and as Michael reads it, he discovers the truth about his heritage, about his family, and about the bravery of his grandfather, who was black. This letter creates a story within a story, in which Morpurgo deals honestly with themes of war, death, and the racial injustice. According to an author's note, the novel is inspired by the true story of Walter Tull, a black officer in the British Army in World War I, who, although courageous, was never awarded a medal due to the color of his skin. Even though it's short and simple to read, appealing to reluctant readers, this novel offers readers of all ages a beautiful multilayered story of compassion, loyalty, and courage.—Denise Moore, O'Gorman Junior High School, Sioux Falls, SD", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Imagine her shock as she learns that his car accident might just have been murder. And to top things off, she has inherited control of her father's company, RossAir, which leases jets to private corporations. It is Allison's job to select a new CEO of RossAir Industries. The most likely candidatefor the position is southerner Alexander Coventry who is way too charming and brilliant for Allison's liking. From a wealthy Atlanta family, Alex proves himself to be a worthy ally, or shall I say adversary? \"Come Fly With Me\" is chick lit at its very, very best. Allison and Alex look like a match made in heaven, but will Allison allow Alex to take her on the ride of a lifetime?  The dialogue in \"Come Fly with Me\" is delightful, realistic and keeps the plot moving towards the story's conclusion. And humor abounds where it should, not overwhelming the text, as on page 104, Allison states \"My default setting is bitch.\" A gutsy, beautiful heroine, good dialogue, a good story line, several potential bad guys, and one definitely \"Mr. Right\". How much better can chick lit get?", "related": ["B00B9P2OR2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 13, "rating_average": 3.4615, "rating_total": 45.0}

But once you take in a new multimedia book,Deep Water, by Daniel Grossman, you'll feel the changes in your gut. You will also have a good sense for how scientists are measuring what's happening, allowing them to predict how high sea level could ultimately go.—Mark Fischetti,Scientific American(This review refers to the multimedia app version of Deep Water)Deep WaterWe know that sea level rise is an inevitable consequence of the global warming that our continued burning of fossil fuels is causing. What we don't know is how much to expect and how soon to expect it. Journalist Daniel Grossman in his Kindle Single,Deep Water: As Polar Ice Melts, Scientists Debate How High Our Oceans Will Rise, explores the momentous issue by looking at the work of three scientists who study the past history of elevated sea levels to get a better understanding of what is likely ahead for humanity. Grossman writes from a close acquaintance with climate science and his ability to distil the science in readily understandable form for the general reader is outstanding.* * *Grossman's short book is science journalism at its best, informative, accessible, and yes, entertaining. It's an intriguing first hand glimpse into paleoclimatologists at work, piecing together the results of their research, sometimes conflicting in their conclusions but pointing undeniably towards grave consequences for humanity if we set in train the disintegration of the world's major ice sheets. There is clearly warning enough, in spite of the uncertainties, that the danger is real and may already be in process. That's the seriousness underlying the highly readable narrative in which the book is cast.—Bryan Walker,Hot Topic", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She experienced Europe, Asia and Alaska first hand.  Her family never stayed in one spot too long; therefore, it was hard for her to make life-long friends. However, she did make friends and she learned quickly if she wanted to be included she needed to speak up and not be shy.   She graduated from high school at the bottom third of her class because grades meant nothing to her at this age.  She cared only about having friends and going to movies.  Her plans for her life were to find the ‘right guy’, get married, have children and be a great wife and stay at home mom.   She did meet the ‘right guy’ and did get married.   Her husband became a Health Care Administrator and like her father, he soon had Peg travelling the globe for his career.  Her plans to be a stay at home mom did not pan out; she raised her two sons while working a full time position outside the home.  In her spare time she went to college and earned the right to teach high school and then at the age of 40, she earned her RN.   As an RN, Peg gained experience in hospitals, outpatient clinics, long term care, sub-acute and assisted living. She eventually became a corporate nurse and from there she developed her own healthcare consultant firm.  In 2004, she developed an investment company, Conceptual Beginnings, to help small micro companies get a start.  In 2006, she developed Interactive Care Network (ICN) a network system designed for hospitals to help streamline the discharge process; it turned out so successful that she sold it 2010 when she received an unbelievable offer.    In 2012, she decided she needed to do more so she developed, Ordinary People Make A Difference; a company designed to provide mentoring and training to develop strong, ethical Leaders.  On March 9, 2012, Peg was awarded ‘Business Person of the Year’ by the Canal Winchester Ohio Chamber of Commerce and on May 1, 2012, Peg was profiled by PNC Bank in their magazine in an article titled ‘Women Who Achieve’. The young girl who graduated from John Dickinson High School in Wilmington, Delaware in the bottom of her class rose to the top.  Her life did not end up as a ‘stay at home mom’ but it did end up right for her.  She has been married to the same man since 1965, she has two sons and six grandchildren, Peg says her life has been blessed and she is anxious to see what the future has in store for her.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My first book, Small Dojo Big Profits, became an instant cult-classic for its no-nonsense approach to running a lean and mean studio while still keeping your standards high. It's a step-by-step manual for starting and running a successful martial arts school from scratch, even if you don't have a lot of money or credit (because I didn't when I first started).However, this book is written from the perspective of spending 15+ years launching, growing, and running studios through good times and bad. In it, I address numerous topics that relate more to the mindset a successful studio owner needs to have, rather than the step-by-step instructions of my first book. Of course, I still go into specifics regarding many topics that are relevant to today's school owner (where to spend your marketing dollars, for example). But, the main emphasis is on how to keep your head screwed on straight while you're moving at 90-to-nothing to launch and grow your school.Incidentally, this book is compiled from essays, articles, and blog posts I've written over the last three years for my martial arts business blog, MartialArtsBusinessDaily.com. Since I have a huge archive of hundreds of articles on that blog, I decided to republish the best of them in an easy to read Kindle ebook.The great thing about this format is that anyone can download and read this book instantly using Amazon's free ereading applications (available for PC, Mac, iPhone/iPad/iPod, Android, and Blackberry). And, in keeping with Amazon Kindle author tradition and customer preference, I've priced it at under $10, making this book affordable for even the most cash-strapped martial arts instructors.I hope you enjoy reading this collection of essays, articles, and ruminations on the business of teaching martial arts just as much as I enjoyed writing it. And, I also hope the information in this book helps you become the successful martial arts school owner you truly deserve to be.- Mike Massie", "related": ["B00FFAT7OK"], "rank": 593431, "title": "The Best of Martial Arts Business Daily", "author": "Mike Massie", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book boasts more than 200 vintage photographs along with Trimble's narrative. Trimble, who moved to the Prosser area at the age of 12, has lived in Houston and, more recently, in Maui before returning to Prosser to handle her father's estate. In October 2007, at the urging of friends, she visited Roslyn and the Roslyn Cemetery and found herself captivated. So I came home and decided I'd like to write a book about it she says. She sent a query to Arcadia Publishing, publisher of local and regional history books, and the project was born. Nick Henderson, the museum curator, opened the museum's archives to her I spent so much time there that he gave me my own key says Trimble, who drove an hour and a half to get there. I literally lived at the museum. The publisher wanted the project finished within five months. So I started at the end of November or early December and finished it at the end of May she says. Along the way she kept company, at least in spirit, with a host of those whose lives became part of the fabric of Roslyn's history. From Roslyn's early years as a mining town when immigrants from across the world came together as a community to its role in the making of Northern Exposure even those who think they know Roslyn well may find some unusual treasures between the pages. Those who don't know Roslyn well will find a wealth of information and anecdotes sometimes amusing, eccentric, almost always entertaining. Trimble's favorite story is about Tony Bailey, a man who was really a woman. She worked in the mines for nearly a year before her true identity was revealed. Tony Bailey was trying to save up money to open a restaurant Trimble says. Her father had left her and her mother when she was little. She'd been destitute. So when she got older she came up with the idea of going to work in the mines, saving up enough money and then disappearing. One day the guy Tony Bailey would be gone and she'd be able to support herself and her mother. One day at a local tavern she inadvertently walked into the women's restroom dressed as a man and was arrested. Among the stories: In the late 1800s, an Italian miner named Riela worked all day in the mines, then came home and dressed up like a woman before going out on the town. During a circus show in 1914, a snake handler named Myrtle Wilson was bitten by a rattlesnake and died. Her husband said he'd come back for her remains. Something must have come up. He never did. She's buried in the Old City Cemetery. You might say the spicy tamales made by a man named Mexican Jojo were the cat's meow, popular with miners and with gamblers at local taverns. Mexican Jojo never revealed his secret ingredients. Local residents may have sorted it out when he left town and they found barrels of cat skins and cat carcasses at his home. Back in the era when black players weren't allowed in the Major Leagues, Roslyn's Jimmy Claxton was a hard throwing leftie good enough to earn a spot with the Cleveland Indians. He had green eyes and light skin and told people he was Native American. His tenure with the team ended when it was learned he was of African-American descent. Was an 1892 robbery of the Roslyn Bank masterminded by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? That's the local legend. --Daily Record", "related": [], "rank": 995406, "title": "Roslyn (Images of America (Arcadia Publishing)) eBook", "author": "Jaymi Trimble", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The first book in\nthe trilogy,A Boy of the Agoge,\ndealt with Leonidas' boyhood, andA\nPeerless Peerlooked at Leonidas as an ordinary Spartan ranker. In this\nfinal book of the series, I turn to Leonidas' years of greatest influence. It\ndescribes him as a diplomat as well as a soldier, and above all as a king. I realize that fans of the film300may find it hard to think of Leonidas as a diplomat. In the\nHollywood cartoon, Leonidas is portrayed as the brutal antithesis of a\ndiplomat: he personally throws a Persian ambassador down a well.  But there is no more historical evidence that\nLeonidas committed this crime than that Xerxes was a monster. The historical\nrecord, foggy and imprecise as it is, suggests that far from being a tactless\nbrute, Leonidas was a savvy diplomat.\nBut Leonidas' accomplishments as king were probably even more\nsignificant, if harder to document. It is clear from looking at Spartan history\nfrom the Messenian wars to Sparta's dismal and ignominious end under Rome that\nLeonidas' reign was a turning point. Archaic Sparta not only saw the\nestablishment of a new, revolutionary form of government (arguably the first\ndemocracy in history), but also a significant flourish of the art and trade.\nSparta's most significant monuments were built in the Archaic age, and her most\nfamous poets lived then too.  In\ncontrast, Sparta in the Classical Period is characterized by artistic\nstagnation and a dramatic end to Sparta's competitiveness in trade and\nmanufacturing. In this period, Spartans disdained all forms of luxury, and by\ninference, art itself.  In short, Spartan\nsociety underwent a radical, indeed revolutionary, change in the mid-fifth\ncentury BC, immediately after Leonidas' death. Leonidas was the last of the\narchaic kings not just in terms of timing, but in terms of policy. During\nLeonidas' lifetime Sparta took an active interest in world affairs, and led an\ninternational coalition opposing Persia. Even more significant is the\npossibility that Leonidas' domestic policies were tolerant and liberal. As in the earlier two books in this series, I have made\nmaximum use of the available ancient sources, relying as much as possible on\nHerodotus and the sayings attributed to Leonidas and his wife Gorgo by Plutarch\nand other ancient scholars. This book also reflects extensive secondary\nresearch on ancient Sparta as well as a dozen trips to Greece to visit Sparta,\nAthens, Corinth, Delphi, Argos, Messenia, Olympia and Thermopylae. Over the\nyears this research has led me to an understanding of Spartan society that\nstands in sharp contrast to the often simplified, sometimes fantasized\nportrayals found in other works.  Sparta\nwas a complex and far from static society, and readers interested in a\nsystematic discussion of my interpretation of Spartan society should refer to\nmy essays on Sparta on my website Sparta Reconsidered and\nmy blog of the same name.", "related": ["B00L6CTWBE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her stories have appeared in the best-selling ‘Best Women’s Erotica’ series and Black Lace’s popular ‘Wicked Words’ collections. Formerly the editor of the UK edition of Forum magazine, she now contributes a spicy monthly column, ‘The Cougar Chronicles’, to its pages. Lauren Gallagher is an abnormal romance writer who has spent the last three years on Okinawa, but is being sent to Omaha, Nebraska for the next three. Her cover story is that she, her husband, their two cats, and their fluorescent green hedgehog are being transferred because of the Navy. Skeptics say this is actually a strategic move to get closer to her arch nemesis, M/M erotic romance author L.A. Witt.  Desiree Holt’s writing is flavored with the rich experiences of her life, including a long stretch in the music business representing every kind of artist from country singer to heavy metal rock bands. For several years she also ran her own public relations agency handling any client that interested her, many of whom might recognize themselves in the pages of her stories. Lisabet Sarai: I became addicted to words at an early age. I began reading when I was four. I wrote my first story at five years old and my first poem at seven. Since then, I've written plays, tutorials, marketing brochures, software specifications, self-help books, press releases, a five-hundred page dissertation, and of course, erotica. I'm the author of four erotic novels and two short story collections. I also edited the ground breaking anthology SACRED EXCHANGE, which explores the spiritual aspects of BDSM relationships, and the massive collection CREAM: THE BEST OF THE EROTIC READERS AND WRITERS ASSOCIATION. Amy Valenti is a tarnished tease, and her mind has lived in the gutter since the day she realised what sex was. She hails from England, which she doesn’t find quite as exotic and sexy as the average US citizen seems to, but if people want to compliment her on her accent, that’s all fine with her! Her muses are many, fickle and very demanding. Wendi Zwaduk: I always dreamed of writing the stories in my head. Tall, dark, and handsome heroes are my favourites, as long as he has an independent woman keeping him in line. I earned a BA in education at Kent State University and currently hold a Masters in Education with Nova Southeastern University.", "related": ["B0089YHC1O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I use a variety of methods. Some I drop from a great height, others I drown, but I've nothing against suffocation, stabbing, poisoning or simply battering a person to death.  As long as it grabs my reader's attention, I'm satisfied. I've written several novels and short stories. My series ‘Death in the Pyrenees’ comprises, 'Palm Trees in the Pyrenees,' 'Grass Grows in the Pyrenees,' 'Red Light in the Pyrenees' and 'Dead End in the Pyrenees.'  They are all set in a small town in France.  These novels are published by Author Way Limited.  Author Way has also recently published, 'The Unravelling of Thomas Malone' as well as a collaboration of short stories called 'Twists and Turns'. As I live much of my life in a small French town in the Eastern Pyrenees, I get inspiration from the way of life and the colourful characters I come across. I don't have to search very hard to find things to write about and living in the most prolific wine producing region in France makes the task so much more delightful. Perhaps you will visit my town one day. Perhaps you will sit near me in a café or return my smile as I walk past you in the street. Perhaps you will hold my interest for a while, and maybe, just maybe, you will be my next victim.  But don't concern yourself too much, because, at least for the time being, I always manage to confine my murderous ways to paper. Read books from the 'Death in the Pyrenees' series, enter my small French town and meet some of the people who live there ----- and die there. Alternatively read about life on some of the toughest streets in Glasgow or for something more varied delve into my short stories.", "related": ["B009HB3PSW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a story like no other and will be sure to please all kinds of readers as it has a bit of everything in it: Action, Adventure, Romance, Suspense, Fantasy, Comedy, and much more. It also has twists through out each book. There are little details in each book that seem minor but as the plot unfolds through out the series the details wrap together to make a very clever twist in the end. I hope everyone gives this new book a chance, I have been waiting 7 years to share this story with the world and now I can. :)Noël Marzen", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Self-assured Lord George Macartnay, leader of the mission, refused to kowtow before Chinese emperor Qianlong, who viewed the British as barbarian vassals and Macartnay as a common merchant. Members of the British delegation--among them doctors, painters, scholars and technicians--were amazed by China's wheat production methods but appalled by its approval of polygamy, infanticide, the mutilation of women's feet and its resistance to innovation. Peyrefitte sees the Celestial Court's rejection of Britain's gambit as a great missed opportunity for them, one which helps explain China's later decline. Illustrated with color plates and maps, the narrative follows China's ensuing chaos, exacerbated by opium smugglers, British naval assaults and indigenous rebellions.

She grew up in Geneva,Illinois with her loving and supportive parents and an older brother, who she admires. Kait currently resides in the South Chicago Suburbs with the love of her life, their two cats, and a ferret.  She is currently continuing her education at a local college. After experiencing and struggling with her own ups and downs, she found some relief and hope through writing. In her early teens, she began writing a few screenplays. She enjoyed writing screenplays about social issues such as, fitting in at school, bullying, identity issues, friendship, and love. The most interesting thing about her screenplays, or any of her works for that matter, is that she could strongly relate to the material because those issues had affected her or someone she truly cared about in her life. She has never been afraid to open her heart to others and that definitely may contribute to her heart-felt talent. By her mid-teens, she had been through quite a bit by then. Disaster after disaster. She didn’t know when she’d ever see or feel hope again. During the times of despair, she felt inspired to write again and began writing poetry. She would write poetically and personally about the people she cared about in her life, the issues she was facing with them, the feelings she felt, the experiences she was going through, and the things that she simply did not understand. It wasn’t until February 2011 when she decided that she could use all that she has learned and gained about her experiences to share with others and educate them as well. She truly enjoys helping people and would love more than anything to make a difference especially when it comes to mental health and the stigma.", "related": ["B005C70AVU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Most of the book has an offbeat, almost fairy-tale feel, but it's uplifting and satisfying. James spins her story with hope in mind, and her characters help us believe in castles in the air without equivocation.Rating: Four Stars - Compelling - Page-TurnerThis book tickles my toes and warms my heart. You will want to get a warm cup of chocolate and some nice tasty cookies or wafers to enjoy while reading this wonderful tale. Having such illustrative words gives you the total picture of what is going on as the plot thickens in all the right spots. This book naturally leads you in the direction your heart yearns to go. It has enough conflict to remind you that even characters’ lives have chaos, which is not always so easy to figure out. It is realistic yet very much like a fairytale. A movie, audio book and most definitely a sequel would be welcomed as it is rich with memorable events and makes you smile with understanding. The cover is very indicative of the story…magical.Rating: Four Cups5 Stars!Oh, what a joy it was reading this story! When I started to read it I thought that it would be yet another predictable book about fake boyfriends. I was wrong, very wrong to be exact.The Wedding Diaryis anything but predictable.The Wedding Diaryfollows the path that leads to the HEA of Cat Aston and Adam Lawley. They’re two people who were both in relationships that ended up badly and all that they were left with were broken hearts. But somewhere along the way they meet and they became close. The way to their happy ending, i.e. a wedding, is very rocky, but with a little help of an eccentric wedding planner, everything and anything is possible.The Wedding Diarywas so full of twists and turns, ups and downs and funny situations. Both main characters were so lovable. They might have seemed like weak people who avoid confrontations, but in crucial moments they showed that they had backbone proving that no one could mess with them.There was another character that I hated (but in the end I fell in love with) and that is eccentric wedding planner, Fanny Gregory. Fanny is a good spirit of the story. Most of the time I found her so annoying, but since nothing is what it seemed inThe Wedding Diary, Fanny also turned out to be something completely different.The writing is also great. The story was written from third person POV, but it follows simultaneously Cat’s and Adam’s story, so that reader knows what is going on with both of them. The story flows smoothly, all ends are tied up and the hero and heroine’s HEA is believable. Furthermore the descriptions are so well written that I felt like I was in London, England countryside and Toscana while reading this story.I love this story, because it made me feel good all around. So if you like well written, funny, happy and feel good romances, go grab this one.", "related": [], "rank": 1617016, "title": "The Wedding Diary (Choc Lit)", "author": "Margaret James", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 24.0}

Not jumped, but pounced on me like I was prey, and held me down like I\nwas a lightweight. When I tried to sit up, she actually leaned down and hissed\nat me...And I saw that something was deeply wrong with her, just by\nlooking at her eyes, which had become golden-rimmed slits--a primal force had\ntaken her and given her strength. I was pinned down and weaponless, since my\nmachete was knocked away during the pounce, and staring at some feral--and\nslightly attractive--eyes that regarded me with curiosity. Whether it was\ndeciding if I would be a good meal or not, I didn't think about.I was never one to believe in the old myths and legends. But\nwhen a normal woman comes out of a door with claws, a tail, sharp feline teeth,\nand her skin growing a fur coat with the same color pattern as a jaguar, I had\nto admit that maybe, just maybe, it was time to start giving them some real\nthought. If I lived through this, I would think twice about going to the tombs\nof ancient civilizations.Felicia leaned her head down further, until her nose was at\nthe crook of my neck. The soft breath coming from her tickled the skin, but I\ndidn't dare move. Not even when her tongue ran over it, sending a shiver down\nmy spine.Or when her tail started moving a bit more as she licked me\nagain, purring softly. Or when her nipples started getting harder as they ran\nagainst my chest and her heated body sweated, allowing it to glide smoothly\nalong the surface. Not even when she dragged herself backwards, having her\nextended tongue run from my collarbone down to my stomach, stopping at the\nbulge in my shorts...which she nuzzled.\"Hey--\" I began to protest, when a sharp hiss warned me\nagainst it. \"--okay, okay!\"Giving a deep snort, she managed to slip her clawed digits\ninto the shorts and jerked them down, solving the problem that the ability to\nundo a belt-buckle was beyond her at the moment. She held her nose over the\nhalf-erect member hidden by the thin fabric of my boxers, her eyes slowly\nglazing over as seconds passed and her mouth watered in what looked like carnal\nhunger. Eventually her tongue descended and took a long, deep lick of the flesh\nthrough the fabric.I strained my throat to not make a sound. Even through the\nunderwear, I could feel her saliva coating my cock and making it rise. It stood\nerect in the end, piercing through the fly of my dampened boxers and ready for\nher to do as she wished with it.", "related": ["B00KTGZDL6"], "rank": 35360, "title": "Curse of the Were-Jaguar (Mating with Monsters Book 6)", "author": "Mark Desires", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Carroll was the youngest of seven children and was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1970 where he was kept in a dresser drawer with the clean socks.  Luckily, he wasn’t kept with the dirty socks or else he might have grown up to become slightly warped. As a child, John spent most of his time wandering through the Mojave Desert in an attempt to avoid people.  He would stare at the sky, imagining what it would be like to explore different worlds.  One of his favorite memories is watching his dad build the fuselage of Evel Kneivel’s skycycle in their garage.  One of his least favorite moments was watching that skycycle fall into the Snake River.  (Not his dad’s fault and he has documentation to prove it, so nyah) As a teenager, John spent most of his time driving wherever he could in an attempt to avoid people.  He would stare at the road, imagining what it would be like to explore different worlds.  He was the captain of the chess team, lettered in golf and band while in high school, and wasn’t beaten up anywhere near as much as one might imagine. As an adult, John spends most of his time staring at a computer screen in an attempt to avoid people.  He stares at the monitor for hours, imagining what it would be like to explore different worlds.  He has been married to his wonderful wife for sixteen years and they have three obnoxio . . . wonderful children who always behave . . . when they’re asleep. Emo bunny minions surround John at most times.  He is their imaginary friend and they look to him for guidance.  At one point, they took over the world.  No one noticed because they left everything exactly as it was.  They gave the world back after a week because it was depressing. The Willden Trilogy is his first endeavor into the field of writing.  Other series and standalone works will be forthcoming.  In addition, John has written a number of short stories that can be found at most eBook sites.  He writes in the evenings and weekends whenever possible.  Regrettably, the family mentioned in a previous paragraph desires food and shelter, requiring the author to possess a full time job until his writing makes him rich.

Scott Fitzgerald and Jim Henson the Muppet creator.

When I was 5 years old, my mother had to leave my three sisters and me in order to survive. Though it seems like a terrible beginning, we all lived through it and gained great life experience. The will of providence brought me to work as a servant in the house of thegreat master, Sifu Qian Bo-Wan. His Kung Fu school became my home and shelter. At the age of 8, my passion for martial arts was recognized and I began learning personally from the great Bo-Wan. I was trained in various methods: Wing Chun, Shao Lin Guan, Tai Chi Guan, Xing Xi Guam. I studied Chi Kung with my master and Buddhist monks. Just before my Sifu left this world, he told me: \"Xi (his name for me), you have to go and spread this knowledge. You can do much more then I ever could, you will see.\" I felt humbled and obligated to carry out his wishes. After finishing my studies of traditional Chinese medicine with Dr. Le Cai, I moved to the Western world. I have to admit, I never understood what my Sifu meant by 'you can do much more'. He did not say 'better', but more. I spent the last 30 years in teaching martial arts, Chi Kung, and related disciplines, but just recently I understood why he used the term 'much more'.", "related": ["B00D99MAZC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.875, "rating_total": 39.0}

A third boy, a family friend, got away. Based on his testimony, the brothers mother, Clio Palliser, was convicted of the horrifying crime. The family of the nanny, Sabine Monroe, has never recovered from her tragic death. Now her sister, Chantal, reads that a luxury hotel has opened in Westerby Lodge, the British country estate where the murders occurred. Repelled yet curious, Chantal books a weekend at the hotel. She soon learns that several of her fellow guests were also affected by the tragedy: Brian Stonor, the policeman who investigated the crime; Sabine’s boyfriend, Malcolm; the neighbor who raised the alarm; and, shockingly, Gavin Vaughn, the boy who escaped. After speaking with the others, Chantal finds herself questioning whether Clio was the killer after all. Little does Chantal know that her determination to find the truth about her sister’s murder will lead to another horrifying near-tragedy. Compelling, suspenseful, gruesome, and frightening, this page-turner is only slightly disappointing in that it will be obvious to mystery buffs whodunit; only Chantal seems oblivious until it’s almost too late. --Emily Melton", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As my life experience grew so did my reading tastes and I found I loved the authors who pushed the romantic envelope; Mary Balogh's A Precious Jewel comes to mind. I love the outdoors and have hiked the Grand Canyon three times. Gardening continues to be my muse and listening to my pond's waterfall sets the mood for day dreaming which easily turns to writing. At age twelve a boy across campus was pointed out to me and I instantly fell in love. Four years later he finally took notice and became the love of my life. I tend to write \"love at first sight\" because I live it. My teenage heartthrob and I live in the Southwest United States with our Rottweiler and Chihuahua.

Loza is a unique fictional look at heaven. The room was white and empty when sixteen-year-old Peter Ramirez opened his eyes. He did not know who or where he was and he was filled with questions that only a man named Zarath could answer. \"You died in a car crash.\" Bits of smoke and a fire ball erupted when Zarath opened the book. Peter witnessed his own birth and many other milestones in his short life. After few days, Peter was reunited with his ancestors. Back on Earth, Peter's parents, Gino and Theresa, mourned the loss of their son. They made the decision to leave the Philippines and move to the US. Gino had always been gone a lot with his work, now he and Theresa were forced to spend time together. After being apart so much throughout their marriage, they no longer knew how to depend on each other. The characters had great depth. Theresa showed much weakness; the family constantly had their hands out asking for money and material possessions. She did not have the courage to tell them no. The chapters moved back and forth between Peter and Theresa, giving both perspectives of coping and reacting to Peter's death. I found this book to be pleasant although the author's concept of heaven is very different from mine. While I picture heavenly choirs of the saints singing God's praises, the author describes a heaven not a lot different from our earthly home. This tale stirred many emotions in my soul. The sadness we experience when we lose someone we love and the joy of a heavenly reunion. C.D. Loza is a talented author. I look forward to reading more of his works.", "related": ["B00J39NO9S"], "rank": 2662899, "title": "Life, Everlasting", "author": "C.D.

When\nreading Scott Hastie's poetry, this question quickly dissolves. How exquisitely\nrefined and subtle the language he uses, yet how accessible it is, at the same\ntoken! With a philosophical, sensual and spiritual eye, he paints with tender\npencil strokes the questions our daily lives confront us with. Scott's new\ncollection Meditations offers us a very beautiful and valuable focus on a\nspiritual perspective to life and consistently reminds us of the alchemy of the\nunexpected. Dr. Jelka Samsom --scotthastie.com.A close kept secret\nwand of words and wit that summon the soul ... to paraphrase Scott Hastie's own\nwords. Such is the power of Hastie's poetry he captures moments that would\notherwise slide away in the slipstream of life, ideas that remain unpondered in\nthe domino days and blank nights of normal life... His beautifully woven\nfragile net of words capture our imaginations, agitate and thrill the very\nspirit within that he chases for our\nillumination. Wendy Waters, Lyricist scotthastie.comScott Hastie\nweaves poetic prose with words of wisdom and love like a finely tuned instrument\nto bring new understanding to readers of all ages about themselves, their\nrelationships, and the world in which we live. Reminiscent of the transcendental\nqualities of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Hastie is clearly in touch with natural beauty\nand individual expression. For Hastie, life is truly a gift to be appreciated,\neven if we see it through different lenses; and he inspires faith in the\npossibilities of becoming more than ourselves, in the goodness of others, and in\nall of our precious potentials.

Now add to that bad guys after good guys, bad guys after other bad guys, people you can't tell whether they're good or bad, plot twists, poisonous snakes, and of course, an adorable dog. There's a double cross, a triple cross, and a brave heroine. Wow!You might expect a good amount of hot sex but that's not this book. There's some sex but this is really about the romance more than bedroom games. Don't worry. It may not be an erotic novel but it definitely is high on love, sex, and romance. As hard as it may be to believe, sometimes we romance readers crave more about what leads up to the bedroom and what happens after.This is my second Patricia Fischer novel and has put her squarely on my auto-buy list. There are so many more stories to tell about Tuscany, Texas. While the MCs are fabulous, there are enough secondary characters to well, populate a town.

It spans all types of M&A; and restructuring transactions and covers all the relevant knowledge from the academic research to the practical legal, accounting, and regulatory details. The book is up-to-date and teaches the state of the art techniques used today. The book contains numerous cases and spreadsheet support that enables the reader to put into practice everything that is covered. The combination of great writing and active case learning make this book the best I have seen in the M&A; and restructuring arena.”  --Matthew T. Billett, University of Iowa\"Mergers and Acquisitions continue to be amongst the preferred competitive options available to the companies seeking to grow and prosper in the rapidly changing global business scenario. In this new updated and revised edition of his path breaking book - the author and M&A; expert Dr. DePamphilis illustrates how mergers, acquisitions, and other major forms of restructuring can help a company grow and prosper in the highly complex and competitive corporate takeover market place. With the greatly enlarged and up-to-date material on varied aspects of the subject, the book provides a plethora of real world examples which will go a long way in making the subject easy, stimulating, and interesting to both the academicians and practioners alike.” --Donepudi Prasad, ICFAI Business School   \"Professor DePamphilis has made significant, important and very timely updates in this  edition. He incorporates contemporary events such as the credit crunch and the latest accounting rules in the West plus M&A; issues in emerging markets which includes family businesses. He also readdresses corporate governance, a topic that will become increasingly important in Business Schools the world over in M&A.; This text has become, and will increasingly become, the definitive comprehensive and thorough text reference on the subject.”  -- Jeffrey V Ramsbottom China Europe International Business School, Shanghai  \"The new edition ofMergers, Acquisitions, and Other Restructuring Activitiesdoes a comprehensive job of covering the M&A; field. As in the previous edition, the structure is divided into five parts. These are logical and easy to follow, with a nice blend of theory, empirical research findings, and practical issues. I especially like two chapters - the chapter on bankruptcy and liquidation is extremely relevant in today's economic conditions, and the chapter on private equity and hedge funds is interesting because M&A; activities by these players are not well-documented in the literature. Overall, I believe that MBA students would find the book useful both as a textbook in class and as a reference book for later use.” --Raghavendra Rau, Purdue University   \"This book is truly outstanding among the textbooks on takeovers, valuation and corporate restructuring for several reasons: the DePamphilis book not only gives a very up-to-date overview of the recent research findings on takeovers around the world, but also offers nearly 100 recent business cases. The book treats all the valuation techniques in depth and also offers much institutional detail on M&A; and LBO transactions. Not just takeover successes are analyzed, but also how financially distressed companies should be restructured. In short, the ideal textbook for any M&A; graduate course.” -- Luc Renneboog, Tilburg University   \"It is difficult to imagine that his last edition could be improved upon, but Dr. DePamphilis has done just that. His latest edition is clearer, better organized, and contains a wealth of vitally important new material for these challenging times. I especially recommend the new chapter on liquidation for members of boards of directors who face extreme circumstances. This is a remarkably useful book for readers at any level--students, instructors, company executives, as well as board members. Bravo Don!” --Wesley B. Truitt, Pepperdine University \"An impressive detailed overview of all aspects of Mergers and Acquisitions. Numerous recent case studies and examples convince the reader that all the material is very relevant in today's business environment.”  --Theo Vermaelen, INSEAD", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I was captivated by this very sweet story and read the book in one sitting. The words flowed beautifully across the pages and it was impossible not to get emotionally involved in the story. The characters felt real and the events believable. Joseph and Rebekah were the perfect couple who had been friends since childhood. Now in their early twenty's it was lovely to watch their friendship evolve into love. Joseph was a very sweet and caring young man who was always there for Rebekah and stood by her through the good and bad times. It is very hard not to fall in love with Joseph. Rebekah was a strong lady, a loving daughter and sister and very loyal to those she loved. The love and friendship between Joseph and Rebekah felt real and I enjoyed the dialogue between the two characters. The secondary characters added a great deal to the story. The introduction of the English visitor to the community created mystery and tension and was very well done.By the end of this book I felt I had a good understanding of what life would have been like in an Amish community. Ms Barnard has been able to write a beautiful tale with characters readers will fall in love with. I am thrilled to learn this wonderful story will continue and I look forward to following Joseph and Rebekah's life together along with other characters introduced in this book. I highly recommend Rebekah's Quilt.", "related": ["B00KTKV9UG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This installment is a prequel to the first volume, The Bomber (released in the U.S. last spring), which followed the adventures of Swedish journalist Annika Bengtzon. Eight years before her Bomber adventures, Annika is a novice reporter for the fictional Stockholm tabloid, Kvellspressen. Assigned to screening crank phone calls on the tip line in hopes of getting an occasional valid news break, Annika receives an anonymous tip about the nude corpse of a young girl in a public park. Sent with a photographer and an experienced reporter to follow up, she is rewarded with the admiration of her editors for her reporting but falls victim to the envy of the regular staff for her success. As the plot develops, the focus of the investigation shifts from the victim's lover, the owner of the upscale sex club where she worked, to an important government minister who keeps a secret apartment near the park. Delving into the bureaucrat's alibi, Annika discovers that he is somehow involved in the coverup of the reappearance of a missing archive that could shake the foundation of the ruling Social Democrats. Annika dons a G-string and goes undercover; a murky diary details sexual obsession; but repetition and minutiae weaken a plot fairly begging for resolution. The novel's pacing leaves much to be desired for American readers used to snappier action, and Marklund fails to supply substance in the form of serious character development or literary styling.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

DaVur was born and raised in an extremely haunted house near the wild and wooded banks of Lake Michigan.

She next attended Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, the only university in the United States to boast no less than two former faculty members entombed under the steps of the administration building. Ms. DaVur has traveled extensively throughout the Midwest leading writing workshops based on that book at youth camps, elementary schools, and children’s museums.

So first off, thanks to\nElizabeth for putting something wonderful in my head. The funny thing about\nthat is that the song doesn't really fit with the story. Don't get me wrong,\nthe story is wonderful, as is the song. The song, though, is soft and sensual\nwith emotional darkness that seems to wait around the edges and never really\nattacks. Woodham's story has the same soft and sensual feel, but it's\npunctuated by astounding slaps to the face. Let me make one thing clear. I love those slaps. Critical to the story are a\nseries of letters between two lovers, and the soft and sensual involves the\ndeclarations of love and devotion. Really, the language is some of the most\nromantic language I've read. It's breathtaking in its loveliness and beautiful\nin its sincere expressions of devotion. That's the soft and sensual part. Let\nme tell you the attack. Right in the middle of the sweet letters are\nexhortations to, spank, and claim. It's\nincredible, really. When Eleanor writes to Matthew, she pours out love while begging for\nmistreatment. The contradiction between the sweetness and the intensity is\nsimply perfect.

He currently teaches online for two universities in a number of subjects at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, and he currently writes mostly for a corporate audience as well as designing and developing curriculum for two universities.Dr. Smith enjoys research regarding human and organizational systems. He uses a holistic view and a whole systems philosophy to develop cogent arguments for Faith-based Prosperity. A faith-based approach is essential to provide a solid foundation from which to operate. Then, prosperity sub-domains can be better analyzed and integrated into a cohesive plan that can provide easy and fundamental ways to achieve a high level of life success.Through Boyd's studies in Human and Organizational Systems for his doctorate, he has developed a passion for sharing this knowledge with everyone. The premise is predicated on a spiritual foundation as necessary to achieve any meaningful long-term prosperity. After decades of business, teaching, and life experience, Dr. Smith has discovered a primary key to prosperity at the individual level. By understanding this premise, people are able not only to develop their own keys to prosperity, but to expand prosperous living to couple relationships, nuclear family connections, community, region, and national and even international levels.Through Right-Life-Relationships and Quantum Interactions, Dr. Smith demonstrates how the search for prosperity can be developed into a lifelong process of achievement and success. Prosperity for everyone is possible. His primary goal is to help make that happen.Not only are there new domains of knowledge to consider, but also practical applications are found to help guide individuals to lives of increasing fulfillment, prosperity, and joy of living.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While at the same time, none of them was doing\nanything productive outside of the workplace to better themselves (well\nbesides one).However, as for me, I looked at them one day and\n told myself, \"This can't be it . . . This ain't how I see my life . . .\n I refuse to grow old here.\"And that was the moment I asked\nmyself the big question, \"What do you want to do with your life? Where\ndo you see yourself in the next five to ten years?\"In\naddition to having a dead-end job with no growth potential, my life\nafter the workday ended was no different. Growing up in the Bradley\nCourts Housing Projects in Newark, NJ, I was surrounded by all sorts of\nillegal activity. The kinds of illegal activity that you could easily\nget caught up in if you were not careful.For instance, when I\n wasn't working, I hung around my friends who were mostly drug dealers.\nAnd while some of them sold drugs out of necessity - because they came\nfrom broken and/or impoverished homes - there were others who hustled\nbecause they thought it was the popular thing to do, or just to be a\npart of the in-crowd. Because they wanted or needed to make enough money\n to buy expensive cloths, purchase cars, and to hang out on the weekends\n getting high and drunk, and impress girls. (Keep in mind that we were\neither fresh out of high school or in the eleventh/twelfth grades at the\n time.)However, it wasn't until I began to observe my friends\n doing what they did to get by - as well as listening to the war stories\n that those who came before them told - that the foundation in whichMind Games: A Brick City Storystood began to form.Furthermore,\n unlike most urban fiction or street lit, instead of focusing on the\nportion of the drug trade that we saw or read about every day, I decided\n to takeMind Games: A Brick City Storyin a different direction, and\nfocused my attention on the aspect of the streets that I felt was\nheavily over looked.Therefore, I focused my attention on the\nlife of a drug dealer once he'd left the block and retired for the\nnight. I wanted to shed light on the relationship they had with each\nother, their enemies, their drive and passions, women, and family.\nBecause it is easy to see someone standing on the corner and calling\nthem a threat to the quality of life, but what most people fail to\nacknowledge is how this individual got this way.This is the question\n thatMind Games: A Brick City Storyanswers, as well as addressing the\ninternal conflict many of them face when the day comes that they have to\n make a life altering decision for the better or worst.", "related": [], "rank": 3188360, "title": "Mind Games: A Brick City Story", "author": "Ikish Mullens", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Then the real world came knocking and he forgot he loved to tell stories. After grabbing a degree from UNC-Chapel Hill, he remembered just what he lost. The Icarus Trilogy was Kauffmann's first professional project and he started on Murder of Crows back in April, 2010. In July of that year, Kauffmann was told that his grandmother had been diagnosed with cancer, which caused Murder of Crows to become an entirely different project. In order to cope with his grief, Kauffmann's writing became focused on how his characters dealt with loss, both in the form of personal identity and actually losing the people closest to them. Now, Kauffmann has decided to create an entirely new kind of story with The Forsaken Comedy, a series devoted to the Four Horsemen and their rise from Hell.", "related": ["B00ANFPHUU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
