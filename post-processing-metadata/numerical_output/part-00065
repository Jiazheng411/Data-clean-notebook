The 670 alphabetically arranged entries, written by scholars and experts, range from 1 to 10 pages and explore various aspects of radio broadcasting within radio's historical context. Types of entries include programs (The Green Hornet), people (Keillor, Garrison), networks and organizations (National Broadcasting Company), regulations and policies (Equal Time Rule), audience research (RADAR), evolving technology (Internet radio), radio stations (KYW), and radio's interaction with other societal forces (Violence and radio). Some entries are accompanied by one of 200 black-and-white photographs. The encyclopedia's scope is international, but treatment of non-U.S. radio is often done in broad surveylike entries such asAfrica, Asia,andNew Zealand. The majority of entries emphasize U.S. radio practices, with a secondary emphasis on key English-speaking nations like Britain and Canada.A substantial general annotated bibliography precedes the entries, and within each entry is a bibliography for further reading. The index is fairly comprehensive but could be expanded even more to accommodate geographical interests. For example, it would help to list entries for individual radio stations under the cities in which they are located.Several competent encyclopedias already exist with information on American radio programs and their performers, such as Luther Sies'Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920-1960(McFarland, 2000) andOn the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio(Oxford, 1998), also covering the \"golden age\" of radio. These are more inclusive of the less well known but lack the biographical details inMuseum of Broadcast Communicationsand the scholarly yet accessible narrative bent that places each entry in its broader context.The Encyclopedia of American Radio: An A-Z Guide to Radio from Jack Benny to Howard Stern(Facts On File, 2000) covers recent years but has shorter entries and lacks the international scope of the current encyclopedia. The new encyclopedia is a major addition to radio reference works. It makes a fantastic complement to a detailed radio program chronicler, but it can also stand alone. If libraries can only afford one major reference work on radio, this is the best choice. Enthusiastically recommended for academic and public libraries.RBBCopyright © American Library Association.

Multiple marriages are part of the culture, but Ike and Devon want only each other.     A rebellious faction on Nerumie has disrupted the production and trade of the ferrous ore, Morgane, and the Emperor decides that his youngest daughter, Miranda, should put her diplomatic training to use by finding out the cause of the problems. Ike and Devon are to accompany her. Sergeant Jack Ingram, who works closely with Ike, is to serve as Miranda's personal bodyguard.

The first half of the book, a three-part novella, follows Charles Mortimerhas, who has enjoyed a terrific career as a far-flung journalist. At age 56, though, he finds himself back in the desert covering a dubious civil war on the Moroccan border. Bitterly encamped with an insurgency, he fills his notebook with self-pitying reflections, addressed to his ex-wife, Saskia, and staggers in a \"daze of remorse\" pining for French photographer Celeste, a former lover with whom he shared his finest moments. Shukman's other characters are similarly beat up by peripatetic lives: Harry Burton, the privileged solitary British traveler of \"Castaway,\" stuck on the Bahamian island of Inagua, is \"a global man, highly trained\" and without attachment. Jim Rogers, the rich securities banker of \"Darien Dogs,\" is \"a modern-day hunter-gatherer,\" who arrives in Panama to secure the construction of a new oil pipeline, and gradually succumbs to the snares of a fetching local prostitute. They make for a sad bunch indeed, but in \"Old Providence,\" feted British painter Rothman Case, awash in drink by middle age, recognizes that the moment of bottoming out also affords him his first glimpse of artistic freedom.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I formerly served as editor and forum moderator of Thyroid Health for a major multi-topic content site and as a general health writer for another, where I received Editor's Choice Awards for my articles on health subjects.  In 2003 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism; \"Hashimoto's thyroiditis\" being the cause. This autoimmune form of thyroid disease that causes destruction of the thyroid gland resulted in my also developing \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\", due to a compromised immune system with severe co-morbid \"Adrenal Fatigue\". I also suffered severe anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks early into the onset of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Hashitoxicosis). A common heart murmur I was diagnosed with in my teens called \"Mitral Valve Prolapse\", also worsened in severity of symptoms, with the development of these other health disorders. My eventual receiving of diagnoses was a difficult process with proper diagnostic testing not being ordered by the first doctors I sought treatment from. These types of issues were inspiration for me to become proactive in my own health care and to self-educate myself on these health disorders, which I have done extensively since 2003. I now enjoy sharing this information with other patients experiencing my same health disorders.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Obsessed and haunted by the 9/11 terrorist attack, as well as by his fraught Russian upbringing, Cohen has found a sliver of hope in his relationship with Billy Farone, his 12-year-old godson. When bloody clothing is found on a Brooklyn beach, Cohen instinctively fears for Billy's safety. Despite reassurances from Billy's parents that the boy is away with a friend, Cohen remains uneasy—even after evidence links the clothes to a missing girl who eventually turns up dead. Cohen calls on his many contacts in the Brighton Beach Russian émigré community, including underworld figures and other unsavory characters, for help in solving the case. Meanwhile, his boss, who believes a serial killer is preying on New York City's youngsters, alternatively engages and excludes him from the investigation. Nadelson (Bloody London) pulls few punches, and the final revelation is a genuine shocker—a rare accomplishment in crime fiction these days. Nadelson is also the author of a biography,Comrade Rockstar, which is under film option to Tom Hanks.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Olivia Sharp is an \"Agent for Secrets,\" but those expecting a detective story will be disappointed, for Olivia is more of a social worker than an investigator. Her \"case\" involves few secrets since her client Desiree wants to be Princess of the Fillmore Street School, and everyone knows it. Desiree makes herself obnoxious by insisting that everyone be as perfect as she is. Olivia \"solves\" the case initially by giving Desiree money for her various projects designed to promote perfection. Since Olivia is wealthy and independent, doling out cash is no problem. Her parents are in Europe and the only adults around--a housekeeper and a chauffeur--exist merely to feed her or to provide transportation. If all this sounds unrealistic and irresponsible, it is. When Olivia finally convinces Desiree to give up her campaign by just telling her that she can't be perfect and bossy, one wonders why that didn't happen 40 pages earlier. The black-and-white illustrations are sprightly, but add little to the colorless plot.

Terrified, they watch as a neighbor's house is swept from its foundations, and pray that a small rescue boat will reach them before their own home is torn loose.

It doesn't take  long for the FBI to finger the perp--the father of a criminal DeCampe sentenced  to death--but by the time they track him to the abandoned farm where he's bound  the judge to the decaying body of his recently executed son, it may be too late  for Jessica to save her friend. Fans of Robert W.

Over the course of two decades, until her premature death from cancer in 2004, she could be found most mornings at Pegasus Coffee Shop, near the Island's marina, meeting friends and solving the world's problems over a cup of coffee-or at least making those problems actually fun to talk about. The coffee group still meets most mornings at Pegasus and still solves problems-and still manages to find a great deal of humor in daily life. For more than a decade, Elizabeth owned and operated Bainbridge House Bed and Breakfast, in three distinct Island neighborhoods: first at Rolling Bay, then at Lynwood Center, and finally in Winslow, Bainbridge Island's \"hub.\"  Besides operating her B&B;, Elizabeth was committed to the success of Bainbridge Arts and Crafts (http://www.bacart.org/), serving as a board member and president, and she was a founding member and president of the Bainbridge Island Lodging Association (http://www.bainbridgelodging.com).  But above all, Elizabeth was utterly devoted to her four children and six grandchildren, who were, quite literally, the light of her life. Inn Sight was written in 2001 and 2002, reflecting experiences operating Bainbridge House in the early 1990's, at Rolling Bay. In 2002, Liz submitted this story and won the coveted Malice Domestic competition for the best unpublished work by a writer of a traditional mystery (as exemplified by Agatha Christie).  Regrettably, \"Inn Sight\" never found a traditional publisher, a miscarriage her loving husband, Dennis, is happy to finally rectify. An e-book version of \"Inn Sight\" is also available, at http://www.amazon.com/Inn-Sight-ebook/dp/B003LBRNUU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1315418593&sr;=1-1.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hennessy's story jumps from daily life at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, to drills in the British countryside, to Iraq and Afghanistan, and the sum of these parts never quite adds up to a cohesive tale, though sections share a hurried disjointedness that occasionally comes off as narrative momentum. The jargon and relentless use of acronyms certainly captures military speech but obscures the basic development of many scenes. Though a glossary of terms is included, flipping for every DTDF, OPTAG NCO, and GPMG would make for more back-and-forth than any attention span would permit.(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

They will help to protect you in this dangerous competitive world we live in. They are valuable lessons that were passed down from father to son and they do work. They have been forgotten for hundreds of years but this book is published  to bring the knowledge back to the people. This is not positive thinking but it is what you should have in your life. If you feel you are faced with a situation that you can't win you can use the powerful tactic that Alexander the Great used at the battle of Gaugamela. Alexander only had 35,000 men when he invaded Persia as he encountered the huge army of Darius the King of Persia. Darius had the largest army in the world with 220,000 men and cavalry. They had 500 rows of soldiers. Nothing could withstand this Persia Army. Alexander's small army attacked and did the impossible. They not only won the battle, but they conquered all of Persia and later the world. You have a choice right now to continue as you are or choose the principles that will bring prosperity and safety in your life. Choose the ones that you feel comfortable with.

This would be the beginning of a life no one deserves to endure, ever.With nowhere to go, confused and frightened beyond comprehension, she settled in inside of a small washroom of a condo complex. Curled up as small as she could make herself, she lay abandoned, with only her pillow case filled with a few clothes. What happened next can only be adequately described in the pages within..., and this was only the beginning.Through her struggle to stay alive in a world she barely understood, with no lessons about life or warnings, with non-existent parents from a broken home, without support and encouragement or life experiences that might help in understanding right from wrong, good from bad, safety from danger..., this young girl met adversity headlong, with no recourse at her disposal.The memoirs of the next 30 years of her life of drug abuse, with METHAMPHETAMINES as her mainstay, physical violence, rape, conflict with the Law..., are described profoundly in this book. Also, the courage, the will to stay alive, the guts to persevere through an impossible road out of the toughest trap from which one might ever have to escape, Lori Stephens overcomes impossible adversity.And in result, this woman's strength to overcome--and her heroism to help others do the same--can only inspire and encourage every person in their daily lives. This is something to be shared and cheered about, because we all win when someone beats impossible odds. Through their examples, we, ourselves,  become fortified and empowered to overcome; we become more willing to help; we become more excited about living life!This woman's story will amaze you. It will make you realize so many things about yourself. And it will likely be something that you carry with you, for inspiration, for the rest of your life.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Not only must the reader dramatize differences of age, sex, region, and class among the characters who inhabit the fictional county of Wessex in the last century, but the straight narration must also showcase the eloquence of Hardy's prose. Vincent Brimble manages all this with ease. Which is fortunate, since the seven uneven tales here might seem downright dull in print. The first and best piece, \"The Three Strangers,\" pulls out all the stops: a violent storm on the downs, three mysterious strangers who seek shelter in a shepherd's cabin where a rousing christening party is in progress, and the booming of a cannon to announce the escape of a prisoner nearby. In other stories (e.g., \"Fellow Townsmen\") the characters seem wooden, with plots turning too much on coincidence. Woven through all, however, are lively descriptions of life in Somerset 50 years or so before Hardy's time: accounts of milking cows all day in a dark dairy (\"The Withered Arm\"), smuggling tubs of brandy over the cliffs (\"The Distracted Preacher\"), and preparing for the anticipated invasion of Napoleon (\"A Tradition of 1804\").

This is the ONLY book in the series that's told by a teenager, however, we do see and hear Zillael in the rest of the series but circumstances are making her grow up fast, and right before our eyes.If this is the first book you've read in the Parched novel series and you wish to continue reading on, then Parched (book 1) will be the next read.

The author, a Jewish only child, at the age of 50 with both his adoptive parents dad suddenly discovers his birth mother, Eileen, and that he is in fact the eldest of seven across the combined families of his genetic parents.In common with the memoirs of many of other adoptees, Reiter's also brings out the insecurity the process almost necessarily involves and the long-standing question, \"Why was I given up?\" Luckily, Reiter's adoptive parents were by-and-large supportive, though the death of his father when Reiter was only 11 was clearly a setback.Reiter grew up in one of the poorer areas of Cleveland, Ohio, where he seems to have been one of the very few white kids in a black neighbourhood. A further isolation was that there were very few Jews in the suburb. His frustrations in this context and well brought out and there is a child-like envy of some of his (adoptive) relatives who live in the richer, white part of town. Reiter's treatment of this early part of his life is almost a bilungsroman, albeit told in fragments.What is equally remarkable, however, is the author's more difficult attempt to capture the life and personality of the birth parents he never knew when young. The social context in the United States cities at the end of World War II is graphically brought out, including the sexual recklessness of the time and the psychological damage experienced by veterans, even by those who (like Reiter's birth father) didn't see combat. In prose sections like \"What a Girl's Got to Do\" and \"Dancing Sinatra\", Reiter very convincingly recreates a sense of a woman who is drawn to sexual adventure and who feels that a more luminous fate should await her than her circumstances allow. It's hard to know how much of this material Reiter heard directly from his mother after he met her again and how much he fictionalised from the raw data his birth family must have supplied after the reunion. In either case, it's done with both an understanding of the times and considerable empathy and affection.Some readers may wonder why the book is so consciously fragmented and perhaps why Reiter has arranged his material in terms of the planets of our solar system (and the classical myths associated with them). A part explanation might be that the materials of his book are either remembered in fragments or came to him later in that manner.Another, perhaps, is to give the story of his early life (and those of his relatives, biological and adoptive) a wider resonance, to place himself and them in more universal context. Some may consider the dramatic monologues spoken by some of the planets as distractions from the \"real\" story but, as Reiter's concise outlines of some of their associated myths implies, our human behaviours are often influenced by factors well beyond our own knowledge and/or control (including the eternal patterns of mythology).My Planets is also available from the publisher as an enhanced eBook, which pushes the fragmentation principle even further by adding more images, sound, music and film. --Geoff Page,The Canberra Times", "related": [], "rank": 4868341, "title": "My Planets", "author": "Dr David Reiter", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Audrey Carpenter's compelling book assiduously reconstructs the many facets of this fascinating man's life, from his demonstrations of Newton's discoveries and his experiments with steam power and electricity to his pivotal role in the creation of new social activities such as Freemasonry. Carpenter vividly evokes through the figure of Desaguliers the coffee houses, taverns, masonic lodges and noble residences of Georgian London.

Slade Suiter considers consciousness an important byproduct of becoming authentic rather than considering it as an end in itself. He believes that authenticity is natural and automatic, requiring no work or effort to arrive at one s true self or essence and that our essence is, by its nature, conscious. All you have to do, then, to become conscious is to remove that which is standing in the way between who you are now and your true, authentic self. Sounds simple, right?  Inspired by extraordinarily trying personal events, the transcendence received from working with a horse whisperer, and the power of dreams, Slade Suiter s debut is an eye-opening treatise on self-awareness and our inability to get out of our own way. Fun and light of spirit, the heart of Suiter s book teaches how to come clean with our dishonesty with ourselves because it is that which blocks us from our authenticity. Most humans spend their time trying to become and defend that which we are not in order to feed our egos. But instead we need to be honest in our inner dialogue so that we can be drawn to our authentic selves. The media, workplace, politicians, society all are saturated in lies and we need to recognize all of them within our own lives and begin dismantling all self-deception. Using personal stories and examples of transformations, Suiter presents a valuable thesis on how to access your authentic self and live a more fulfilling, truthful, and self-aware life. Provocative, freeing, and essential, Suiter launches a deep stirring of honesty and excitement with his philosophies and teachings, stimulating a rediscovery of truths long hidden within. An eye-opening ramble full of laughs of both the uncomfortable and uncompromising varieties, Get Off Your High Horse and Walk: Rediscover Authenticity in a New Way will change your life for the better if you have the courage to let it. --Create Space Promotional TextOh My! I have never, never ever read a book like this. Slade goes in where people are afraid and gently stirs up a hornets' nest that needs to be stirred up. He has a very productive way of helping the reader to see the EGO as something not to fight, rather to open an honest dialogue with. This really makes sense because it is based on common sense -the less common of the senses!- which I feel many of us have forgotten to listen to in our busy lives. After the few first pages I started to shift in the way I see and address things. I fill lighter.

Yet in response to the enthusiastic devotion of their followers, the Church has often found itself unable to disavow them, and has thus embraced sainthood as a kind of catch-all college for stigmatics, ascetics, visionaries, and all manner of Christ's own ostentatious oddballs. Bill Donahue has done his homework on this motley cast, and his useful primer on sainthood fairly bristles with bite-sized synopses of this fascinating institution (e.g. \"compared to the Vatican, the Wizard [of Oz] is relatively easy to work with, and a lot cheaper to lobby\"). Donahue's exploration follows the candidacy of Kateri Tekakwitha, a 17th-century Mohawk Catholic whom Pope Benedict XVI cleared for canonization within days of this essay's publication, and her story exemplifies the contemporary business of sainthood. The curious pedestrian and the hagiography scholar alike should find plenty of interest here, buoyed by Donahue's approachable tone and topical wit. --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B00GB9ZQHQ"], "rank": 5201133, "title": "The Secret World of Saints: Inside the Catholic Church and the Mysterious Process of Anointing the Holy Dead (Kindle Single)", "author": "Bill Donahue", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 32.0}

I could not handle putting small children through the same processes again and again with no end in sight. So I started researching herbal remedies. Natural forms of medicine that work with the body instead of against it. And the results were amazing.That was 20 years ago. I've used herbal supplements, salves and poultices for almost everything since. There is no magic pill or wonder drug for everything of course. And many illnesses and injuries absolutely require a doctor or emergency room.Not every herbal remedy works the exact same for every person either.

It means a move from suburban London to the isolated village of Tip Hollow in rural Dorset, and a new home, repossessed from its former owners, that Helen senses from the first is a \"very unhappy place.\" Helen's unease increases after the family moves in and ominous events start occurring. Helen answers the phone to find no one on the other end; her beloved cat, Skittles, disappears; she learns that Tip Hollow was once an ancient burial site. Helen is cheered when Skittles is found by Rita Markham, an elderly widow living in an old thatched cottage, but when she takes a visiting friend to see the cottage, they find it deserted. Questioning the postmistress, they discover that Mrs. Markham has been dead for more than five years. Finally, the police show up looking for the previous owner's missing wife, who they fear may be buried in the Tempests' garden. This deceptively simple story from veteran British novelist Thorne (Alice Davenport) builds to a satisfyingly chilling finish.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

[Coen's] eloquently written book offers a programmatic synthesis and an empirically grounded proposal for a theory of biology. . . .Cells to Civilizationswill stimulate many productive discussions about the origins and development of life in all its complexities.\"--Manfred D. Laubichler,Science\"Clearly written . . . intriguing, thought-provoking . . .\"--Library Journal\"InCells to Civilization, [Coen] couples his knowledge of genetics with metaphor and art, likening the unfurling of mutant snapdragon flowers to an artist's brushstrokes on an expanding canvas. . . . The book is packed with fascinating facts. . . . [H]uman cultures and minds are among the most complex information systems in nature, and Coen does a good job of reminding us of their roots in evolution.\"--John Hawks,New Scientist\"The ideas [inCells to Civilizations] are subtle, possibly significant, and slightly unsettling. What more could a reader wish for?\"--Robert Schaefer,New York Journal of Books\"What are the connections between evolving microbes, an egg that develops into an infant, a child who learns to walk, and the rise of Ancient Rome? For many years, scientists have generally thought these great transformations--evolution, development, learning, and cultural change--occurred through different mechanisms. But geneticist Enrico Coen, in his pioneering new bookCells to Civilization, reveals that these transformations revolve around shared core principles and manifest the same fundamental recipe. Coen blends provocative discussion, the latest scientific research, and colourful examples to demonstrate the links between these critical stages in the history of life.\"--Chemicals & Chemistry\"Coen's book is ambitious and stimulating. . . .Cells to Civilizationsis good material for conversation and a worthwhile read.\"--Deniz Erezyilmaz,truthdig.com\"[Coen's] prose is every bit as good as Richard Dawkins' or Steve Jones', and his rich illustrations, particularly the way he uses classical and modern art to make his points, refreshes the text and keeps one's focus on the arguments. His clever ideas and engaging and creative writing style suggest that he would make a fascinating dinner companion. I loved this book and will put it on the general reading list for our biology undergraduates. I suspect it will also find resonance with the interested layman.\"--Charalambos P. Kyriacou,Times Higher Education\"[Cells to Civilizations] was thought provoking, informative, and fun to read.\"--Choice\"Do not be daunted by the scope of the book, which is written for a wide audience, although it contains enough science for biologists and anthropologists to ponder and argue with Coen. For the rest, it is an easy read, particularly as the biology it contains is peppered with vignettes drawn from painting and art history, which act as a guide for the more dry science that forms the meat of the argument.\"--Alfonso Martinez Arias,Development Journal\"Cells to Civilizationsis a very approachable and thought-provoking reading for everyone involved in education and science.\"--Monika Biro,American Biology Teacher\"Cells to Civilizationsis an intelligent and entertaining book by a distinguished biologist.\"--Robert C.

Regrettably, there are very few concertina players left in Australia. Dennis has been at the birth of literally hundreds of songs, having written some forty songs about Australian history, and nurtured many song-writers from their first idea through to the first public performance of their song. Twenty years of painstaking research into the origins ofWaltzing Matilda, combined with his knowledge of Australian traditional songs and proven song-writing ability, gives Dennis an intimate understanding of how the song was written.", "related": ["B00EI7AG4G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Scott Fitzgerald , takes on the assignment of a lifetime--to write the sequel to the most popular novel in publishing history, Oh, Shenandoah . Alma Glaze, author of the sweeping tale of the Revolutionary War, was killed in an accident 50 years earlier, right after the equally popular film of the book was completed. When Hoagy agrees to the project, he takes on some alarming partners: domineering Mavis Glaze, Alma's sole heir; her twin brothers, Frederick and Edward, mostly dependent on their sister for financing; and nubile Mercy Glaze, Mavis's only child and heir to the Shenandoah fortune. The family housekeeper is found dead after suggesting that the mysterious death of one of the stars, which also occurred right after the film's completion, was murder.

All those patrol cars with lights flashing illuminated the unpainted buildings and the boxcar. The red light made the buildings and trees look surreal and desolate. I saw the policemen moving slowly toward the house, resting their hands on their holsters. I was so overcome with guilt and fear that I tumbled out of the car and ran toward the house. \"Pops,\" I sobbed, \"I'm sorry!\" Fortunately, before I reached the house, one of the officers grabbed my arm. Get back in the car!\" he ordered. He pulled me back to the car, chucked me into the patrol car by my arm, and slammed the door behind me. Once there, my mother shot me a look that immobilized me. The officer crossed to her side of the car and tapped on the glass. She rolled the window down and before he could speak, she said, \"I'll keep her in here, but you better be ready, he's going to fight.\" \"Where is the boy?\" the officer asked. \"He's in that boxcar over there.\" \"And it's locked?\" he asked. \"yeah, the key is inside. I think he's got it,\"she said, jerking her head toward the house. \"He's in the bedroom upstairs, you say?\" \"Yes, up the steps and to your left.\" \"Okay, we'll get him,\" he said. \"Carefull!\" she answered. He nodded and, touching his brim, joined the rest of the men waiting for him. After checking the back of the house, they all moved to the door. All but one of the officers filed into the house. The one left behind stood guard over the patrol car where we sat. I heard loud voices but no shots...that was an encouraging sign. It seemed like hours before they reappeared with Pops. His hands were cuffed behind his back, and his pockets were turned inside out. He was a pathetic figure as they led him out of the house that he had built as a newlywed. Ther was a gash on his forehead, and his lip was bloody. His eyes darted around wildly, and when they found my mother and me, they locked themselves on us in a silent curse. One of the officers held the keys above his head and rattled them as if to say, \"We have them.\" We both scrambled from the car and hurried to the boxcar. We stood there, clutching each other, while the officer finally found the right key, unlocked the door, and slid it open. \"Hello,\" he called, his voice floating out in a cloud of frozen vapor. Taking his flashlight out of his belt, he pointed it around inside the boxcar. \"I'll take a look,\" he said as he hopped up and disappeared into the darkness. Moments later, he reappeared. \"We'll need to get Rescue out here,\" he said. \"Lets get him inside, and get Rescue on the fucking radio right now!\" he said, nodding to one of the policemen. Then, turning to my mother, he asked, \"Could you get some blankets, Mrs. Beck? Bring a couple please.\" He spoke in a monotone voice, trying to sound calm. When they brought Willie in, he was wrapped in the blankets my mother had given them. They laid him gently down on the couch in our tiny sitting room. I could feel the cold radiating from his body. He struggled to sit up and failed. I thought he looked like a little old man. He was blue and shaking uncontrollably. His face was beaten bloody, unrecognizable; even his hair was matted with blood. \"I'm sorry he did this to you,\" I said. He didn't answer but feebly extended his hand to me, and I took it. Every breath had a small sound to it. I wondered if something inside him was broken, and if he could be mended. We sat like that while we waited for the ambulance, my mother and the police officers trying to warm Willie with blankets heated in the oven and a hot water bottle that Mom filled. The ambulance arrived with more colored lights scampering from tree to tree and onto the buildings in rapid succession.

The games I used to play with my brothers were not games of football or frisbee, but games of imagination. We would, in reality, be riding our bikes in circles around the city park - but the whole time we would be following my imagination as the bikes became wild mustangs with names like \"Singing Moon.\" We would wrestle a sled to the top of the monkey bars and sit balanced there while I told of our adventures in outer space aboard our spacecraft.  My brothers even followed my cues when I ordered, \"Now you say . . .\" Then I lost my confidence in my stories. The kids at school did not understand how I played, and I became a bearer of \"Dixie Fleas\" who had to have invisible disinfectant sprayed on any desk I had occupied before another child would sit there. At school at least. I lost my voice. Jr. High and our school blended with 2 others to create classes where not everyone knew I was outcast. Some people actually asked to see what I was writing all the time behind the curtain of my long red hair. Amazingly, the comments were positive and they asked for more. But I was still timid and mostly believed that my stories were not as good as the books I loved. So as I grew, I had to write but the only writing I shared were letters I wrote by the mailtruck load to friends and family. That is when I started thinking of the stories we all love; all the same in one thing, they had the kind of friends where you felt safer, and more included than you had ever felt at home, friends you had always wanted, who made you look around with a lump in your throat, wishing you could stop time. They were a group of imperfect, overwhelmed and harassed people who became winners because they didn't have to face the overwhelming odds, alone. Even in the face of dark wizards, popular girls, bad hair days or War, they had each other's back. When one of them had a weakness, another had a strength to balance it out. When one was a jerk, someone else saved the day, and forgave them eventually. It has those friends we all want. Now times are turning more difficult again. The world needs a source of encouragement so that we can find a way to be that kind of support when we are needed. As times are dark, people look for a reason to laugh, love and hope again. I hope my stories give us that. I can be found on blogspot at both \"Echo's Voice\", and \"Duffy Barkley's 'Mom'\"", "related": ["B00BGGBLXW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a counselor, he \"counsels\" in the traditional sense: advising, directing, and nudging--or pushing--others into facing and resolving their issues.Mr. FitzMaurice has a variety of formal and advanced training in counseling, which includes Addictions Counseling, Family Therapy, advanced Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), Transactional Analysis (TA), and over 1300 hours of diverse training for continuing education units (CEUs). To make the best use of that extensive training, he takes an integrative approach, grounding himself in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and using the other theories to build upon that one core theory, rather than focusing on multiple theories and mastering none of them.After more than twenty years in counseling, Mr. FitzMaurice has worked four years in the substance abuse field, directed two community mental health programs, and spent fourteen years counseling in private practice. In that time, he has refined many principles for and methods of counseling. He now puts those principles and methods into book form to share them with a wider audience, so more people can benefit than he can reach in person. Currently, he has more than twenty books written, most of which are available worldwide as e-books from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Sony, Google, Kobo, and Apple.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her father worked within the oil industry and she spent much of her younger years travelling, finishing in Canada, where she attended, and graduated from St John High school in New Brunswick. Her love of the English language was due partly to the inspiration of her English Tutor. An Oxford Don, he despaired of the American/English idioms, and as she was the only English student in the school, found her a delight to teach. Spending another year in working in Canada, life then returned her to England and on to the remote Shetland Isles for three years. Following her return to the UK, she threw herself into Floristry for fifteen years, and her artistic talents took another turn when she picked up a pen for the first time to write her first dragon fantasy novel. It took another ten years and the passing of her artistic father, to discover her talent for painting. Setting out on a new path, she now paints celebrity portraits to raise money for charities. Through Face book in 2010 she met a friend who encouraged her to take up writing again, shortly after this inspiration which rekindled her spiritual beliefs, she met her (writing collaborator and co-conspirator) Keith David. They now combine their sensual words drawn from the depths of their souls, to captivate the imagination, and entice the reader to discover their innermost desires. Virginia, now residing on Madeira Island, Portugal, soon intends a final move to a small town in Texas where inspiration for the Heaven Scent trilogy originated.", "related": [], "rank": 3965923, "title": "Heaven Re-Scent (Heaven Scent)", "author": "Virginia Alison", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

No matter where she is, there is always a book close at hand. Her love of reading began at an early age and blossomed over time to include many different genres, her favorite now being fantasy. As a preschool and elementary school teacher, Greta tried to instill the joy of reading in the children she worked with. Books were an important part of her classroom and story time was the highlight of the day. It has been a while since Greta was in a classroom but she had lots of experience in reading to children of various ages and remembers what they enjoyed listening to. She tries to incorporate that knowledge into her work as an author and believes it makes her a better writer of children's and young adult books. She now resides in SC with her husband, Robert and three dogs. Greta has six books published at the present time; three children’s books in the Patchwork Dog and Calico Cat series, two MG/YA fantasy entitled \"Gerald and the Wee People\" and \"House on Bo-Kay Lane\", and a nonfiction account of her experiences with an autoimmune blood disorder called ITP - \"Heartaches and Miracles\".

He spent a number of years in and around North Wales before starting his career as a trainee manger with McDonalds Restaurants in 1989. He worked in management at McDonalds Restaurants Ltd from 1989-2002, working his way up to Business Consultant (area manager) working in the corporate and franchised departments. On March 23rd 1993 he was managing the Restaurant in Warrington`s Bridge St when two Irish Republican Army bombs exploded directly outside the store, resulting in the death of two young boys and many casualties. Along with hundreds of other people there that day Conrad was deeply affected by the attack, which led to a long-term interest in the motivation and mind set of criminal gangs. He links this experience with the early desire to write books on the subject. His early novels follow the adventures of an elite counter terrorist unit, The Terrorist Task Force, and their enigmatic leader, John Tankersley, or `Tank` although his later books follow Detective Alec Ramsey and the Major Investigation Team. His novels are set in the North West and North Wales. In 2007, he set off on an 11-week tour of the USA. The Day before he boarded the plane, Madeleine Mcann disappeared and all through the holiday he followed the American news reports which had little information about her. He didn't realise it at the time, but the terrible kidnap would inspire, The Child Taker years later. During the trip, he received news that his house had been burgled and his work van and equipment stolen. That summer was the year when York and Tewksbury were flooded by a deluge and insurance companies were swamped with claims. They informed him that they couldn't do anything for weeks and that returning home would be a wasted journey. Rendered unemployed on a beach in Clearwater, Florida, he decided to begin his first book, Soft Target. He never stopped writing after that. He has reached over 200,000 downloads of his thriller novels and has had 7 books on the top 100 kindle charts, 3 number ones and an Amazon clicks Reader's book of the month award. Recently he has 8 stand alone novels and a horror thriller, Nine Angels and the biographies of three time world champion Russ Williams (Undisputed) and extraordinary lady, Debby Hughes (Lapping it Up).", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Wicked Autumn is a refreshing read for everyone who loves a really good murder. -- Charles Todd. A tiny village in the English countryside during a storm-wracked winter. A house party at the local castle that ends in two deaths. A dishy vicar, formerly an MI5 agent, summoned to the castle to solve the certain homicide of the lord. Put it all together, and this is one gift-wrapped package for cozy lovers and Agatha Christie devotees. But it is also a pretty cheeky cozy, written by someone who knows how to use the conventions and poke fun at them at the same time. In the second in the series starring vicar Max Tudor (following Wicked Autumn), Tudor escapes the amorous clutches of the church ladies in Nether Monkslip to visit Chedrow Castle in the wake of the deaths of Lord Footrustle and Lady Baynard. (An old cop friend wants Tudor on the scene to observe the viper's nest of relatives.) Tudor's observations on evil, honed by both his spy and vicar backgrounds, are one of the best features of this thoroughly entertaining mystery.

A born storyteller, she was regaling her mother with stories before she learned to write. As a child, she coerced her playmates into performing in short plays she wrote in between watching her favorite cowboy heroes ride the television range.  A devoted mystery/detective fan, Ann began with Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys and by late elementary school had progressed to Erle Stanley Gardner and Dashiell Hammett. She cried when Mickey Spillane died. After college she began her career as a Jill-of-All-Trades, teaching school - in grades second to junior college and subjects from social studies to English and speech to math to Spanish; working at newspapers as a photographer and feature and column writer; walking hots and rubbing horses in the barns as well as doing publicity work at thoroughbred race tracks; working in multiple positions at a florist; and on and on. She has often said the only two criteria a job must have to be considered are: 1. Have I ever done this before? (Answer: No) and 2. Does it sound interesting? (Answer: Yes). Through all this she has written - something. When asked at conferences, \"What do you write?\" The reply is, \"What do you want written?\" At one time or another Ann has written poetry, skits, song lyrics, novels, short stories, essays, newspaper columns and feature stories, advertising copy, whatever someone needed to have written. She writes for the same reason she breathes - it is necessary for her existence.  Ann is the author of two non-fiction books on Western movies, Riding the (Silver Screen) Range and Uncredited: Cliff Lyons On and Off Screen; and one Western novel, Donovan's Trail. She also contributed two selections to the anthology, Tales From the South, Volume 1. Her latest book is a mystery, Double Stalk.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After years of participation in such gatherings, it occurred to him that others, not just old sailors of his acquaintance, might have an interest in his stories and therefore he should record them for posterity. This task remained unrealized for several years until his grandson, Sean Kristofer Vail, was attending college at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. In one of his courses, he was assigned a project requiring that he interview a senior citizen and write a report on the interview. He selected the author as his subject who used the opportunity to write his memoirs. As a result, the grandson received considerably more material than his professor wanted to review, so he was faced with the task of drastically editing the information for his report. He received an A for the project. The material in this book is entirely factual and is taken from those memoirs", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has also written personal essays and articles. A short story, “Getting the Bugs out of Tom Sawyer,” was published in McGraw Hill’s 2000 edition of Tom Sawyer. He has also reviewed books for the Mark Twain Forum, a scholarly website for Twain enthusiasts. Recently, John has turned his energies to writing fiction.

This often resulted in having a spiral notebook next to me at work, and if there was a two minute lull in traffic I would quickly write up a bit of the manuscript. When I got home I would type up what was written and make an attempt to pre-edit it. Eventually I finished writing and typing the manuscript, and it came time for me to think about where to go next, so I reached out to my friends and we pulled off what you see here today.

Apart from Cassie's childhood memories and emotional bond with the property and the staff who run the cattle station, the girl has a feel for the land, the rainforest areas, the aboriginal heritage and the descendants who still remain working for Yallandoo. The different twists and turns in the story retain the reader's interest while not all the outcomes are as one would expect!With her first novel 'Inheritance' Kate Loveday has created a fantastic read.

Fed up with the genocide,\nthe Malturians, an alien race badder than their own, takes them to task for the\nbrutality and proceeds to wipe them out but not before a small group manages to\nescape to a galaxy far, far away. The two alien races responsible for six counts\nof genocide? Blue-skinned Peridian and. . . humans.Illusions\nwas avery engaging and well written novel. It raises the question as to\nwhether we should still be punished for the long-forgotten sins of our fathers.\nAlso, should something be considered superior if it uses its vast resources to\nsuppress and exterminate others? My answer is no, but the questions and ideas\nRafferty brings up make forgreat book discussions. Though there is extensive\nthought put into this futuristic world, I felt the Peridians and humans acted\nvery similarly, with many of the Peridians having names that were Indo-European\nin root. I wasn't sure if it was mainly due to contact with Europe and America\n(I have yet to see a futuristic sci-fi novel focus on the continents south of\nthe equator), or because the author felt familiar names would be easier for\nreaders to remember and relate to.

Papas draws a compelling portrait of a complex and contradictory 18th century man: an aristocrat more democratic than most native born revolutionaries; a humanist  more comfortable with his dogs than with people; and a feminist in a patriarchal world. Charles Lee emerges from these pages as one of the few men bold enough to challenge George Washington's judgment and one of the most articulate visionaries of the future that was possible for America.\"-Carol Berkin,Presidential Professor of History, Emerita, Baruch College & The Graduate Center, CUNY\"Did General Charles Lee or General George Washington have the right strategy to win the Revolutionary War? Readers may end up debating the question with the passion that divided the Americans of 1776. But this much is certain. With deft touches and shrewd insights, Phillip Papas has restored to vivid life a major figure in America’s past.\"-Thomas Fleming,author ofLiberty! The American Revolution\"Renegade Revolutionaryis a revisionist book which corrects historical misimpressions of Charles Lee as bizarre, opinionated, abrupt, and morose to the neglect of his erudition, intellectual courage, social radicalism, and  capacity for military professionalism. But it is revisionism with a light touch. Almost every paragraph exhibits the author's determination to understand and explore Lee's character—including his bipolar mood swings—and to respect the readers' curiosity and capacity for balanced judgment. Alternately calling his subject 'Charles' when presenting instances of his complex humanity and 'Lee' when reporting objective fact, Phillip Papas strikes the kind of balance that Charles Lee unsuccessfully sought to exhibit to his contemporaries—especially the American people whose Revolution mattered more to him that personal vindication that he knew he could do little to garner.\" -Robert M. Calhoon,author ofPolitical Moderation in America's First Two Centuries\"Papas has written a marvelous book about the bristling, impetuous eccentric that was General Charles Lee, whose pageant of a life included soldiering against Iroquois Indians, Spanish expansionists, Ottoman Turks, and Polish insurgents – all this before he made himself a historical figure in the American Revolution. Papas not only covers the controversies surrounding Lee’s capture by the British and his comportment at the Battle of Monmouth, but he also explains the nuts and bolts of 18th-century military life, be it battlefield formations or officer commissions in the British army. Papas’s subject evokes the sprawling novels of Henry Fielding and Daniel Defoe, full of adventures, pathos, and ambition.\"-Judith Van Buskirk,author ofGenerous Enemies: Patriots and Loyalists in Revolutionary New York", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story follows the DuMonde family and their obsession with a certain book. This book, however, is evil and inside its pages lives a demon that has been trapped for centuries. The DuMonde brothers declare war on each other when the younger brother Remy steals the book from his older brother Maurice in the dead of the night. Remy and his mistress leave New Orleans and settle miles away in a small town. They take up residence in a local pub, but their past will eventually catch up to them in the end. Meanwhile, Lydia flees her home as her father is keen to get her married off for a piece of land. Her new husband is a bully and so is his son and life with them would be unbearable. Lydia changes her identity and poses as a man, only to end up in the same small town as Remy. She finds herself in grave danger as the demon plays havoc in the small town. Inevitably, secrets become exposed and lives are lost.Renna Olsen has delivered a classic thriller in Cold Prairie. At first I thought it would be a classic western novel, but as time went on it was far from the normal classic. The demon and the possessions added a sense of intrigue and danger. The book in question was unique and the demon it contained would never be able to be controlled fully. It was well written with plenty of twists to keep the reader alert.

She learned to read at her great-gran's knee and it was there she developed the love of reading which has stayed with her throughout her life. At some point during her early years it occurred to her that she could perhaps write as good as, if not better, than some of the authors she was reading and this inspired her to start writing short stories. She began entering her stories in literary competitions in 1991 where she achieved great success, winning a number of awards. Two of her award winning short stories are featured in The Gold Anthology, which is a collection of award winning entries from the Jamaica Cultural Development Commission's annual literary competition.

He was born in a seaside town in Wales and moved to Oxford, England to study Physics. He has worked at a government research laboratory and as an entrepreneur, starting two successful internet companies. He is interested in many things - science & technology, the environment, travel, visual arts, music (mainly choral music, from Bach to Vaughan Williams to Tavener) and gardening. He is dangerously obsessive about health and fitness and practises Astanga yoga. He thinks that lists of interests and hobbies don't really tell you much about a person's true passions. In his case he is most passionate about ideas, belief systems and abstract concepts like love, beauty, truth and immortality. He still lives in Oxford with his wife, the novelist Margarita Morris, and their two children. His debut novel, The Yoga Sutras, is a philosophical comedy - dark on comedy but light on philosophy! He likes to read both fiction and non-fiction, often reading several books at once. He loves to read stories that dazzle him and show him things that he thought were impossible, and that is the kind of book he aspires to write. Steve suffers from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and some days doesn't manage to do very much. When he can, he works obsessively and takes on too much. He and his wife are currently creating a 1920s-style garden with formal lawns, topiary and a secret garden. This is an unwise project and is not to be recommended.

His mighty jaw opens my mouth to his, the taste of him like an elixir on my tongue. His own tongue drives into my mouth, deep and strong. I love feeling part of him inside of me--but it only makes me want to feel him absolutely everywhere.All at once, I find myself spinning in the air as he flips me onto my stomach. I writhe against the bed as he slips off my panties, the final stitch of fabric that lingers between us. I arch my back, letting my firm ass rise to him. He runs his fingers down my spine, sending waves of goose bumps dancing across my bare skin. Those hands graze over the rise of my rear, teasing me. He's doing this on purpose.\"Touch me,\" I beg, looking at him over my shoulder, \"Please, touch me.\"His golden eyes blaze with wicked, dominating lust as he looks at me, on my hands and knees before him. Those long, dark tresses of his hang loose around his shoulders now. He looks like a warrior, a brutish beast who could snap me in two if he liked. But I know that's not what he'd like right this second...\"I'll touch you when and how I damn well please,\" he growls, letting me feel the thick, throbbing length of his desire, pressing between my legs.Knowing just how hard, how ready he is to spear me on that staggering member of his has me wet as hell. And he knows it, too. He runs two sure fingers along the length of my slit, groaning with satisfaction to feel how much I want him.\"Ever been with a man like me before, babe?\" he asks, resting those fingers against the aching nub of my sex.\"Never,\" I breathe. It's the only word I can manage to get out before the surges of pleasure, radiating from his touch, leave me wordless.\"Then you've never been with a real man,\" he growls in my ear, leaning over me.He's relentless in his touch, and my knees give out beneath me. My cheek presses hard against the mattress as my mouth falls open in wonder. My entire body trembles as he bears down on my cl**. Finally, when I don't think I'll be able to take another moment, I come hard. He buries a hand in my hair as I cry out my pleasure. His fingers twist in my dark curls, and I feel that massive c*** poised against my body.\"I'll make a real woman out of you yet,\" he smiles devilishly, lowering himself onto me.", "related": ["B00JYFN3GA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 66, "rating_average": 4.3636, "rating_total": 288.0}

Her first release in May of 2011, the Highland time travel novel A Laird for All Time, has steadily ranked in Amazon's Top 100 in Time Travel for the past three years with more than 80 five-star reviews so far. A Question of Trust, the first of her Victorian historical romance series Questions for a Highlander, was released later that year and quickly followed by series additions A Question of Trust and A Question of Lust.  The series primarily follows the siblings of the MacKintosh clan.  Ten brothers and their lone sister who end up looking for love in all the right places.  While the series continues on with familiar characters well known to those who have read the entire series, each single title is also a stand-alone tale of highland romance. With a degree in US History from UNLV and having previously worked as a historical interpreter at Colonial Williamsburg, Angeline brings her love of history and Great Britain to the forefront in settings such as Victorian London and Edinburgh.  As a former military wife, Angeline has lived from the west coast to the east, from the north and to the south and uses those experiences along with her favorite places to tie into her time travel novels as well.   Angeline is a native Minnesotan who recently relocated back to the land of her birth and braved the worst winter recorded since before she initially moved away.  She lives in Apple Valley outside the Twin Cities with her husband, two children and three dogs. She is a wine enthusiast, DIY addict (much to her husband's chagrin) and sports fanatic who roots for the Twins and Vikings faithfully through their highs and lows.   Most of all she loves what she does everyday - writing.  She does it for you the reader, to bring a smile or a tear and loves to hear from her fans.", "related": ["B00KY0YURU"], "rank": 293024, "title": "A Question for Harry (Questions for a Highlander Book 5)", "author": "Angeline Fortin", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
