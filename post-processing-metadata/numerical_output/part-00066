The two have made it to the city of Timoch but have a long way to go. Way back before the moon was \"squeezed,\" Conrad and Xmary returned from Barnard's Star with a cargo of that world's cryogenically frozen human children. What to do with all these mortals? The queendom is already overrun with billions of its own,immorbidchildren, and the violent Fatalists, a group of mortality advocates, tend to further destabilize matters. Bruno hires Conrad to crush the moon in a desperate attempt to find space for the masses of humanity. Refugees from other colonies straggle back to Sol, Queen Tamra struggles to equitably resolve associated problems, and events spiral toward destruction as well as a final battle when Conrad and Bruno confront the Glimmer King and his metal armies.

I knew I was writing a trilogy after I finished \"Time and Time Again\" in December 2002 because there was one more kind of supernatural phenomenon I wanted to tackle, using the same main characters. Life after death.Even as a little boy, I felt that life was the rule and death was the exception. And that, for human beings, life was everlasting. All science fiction is speculationabout the universe, bolstered by notions and theories that have some basis in fact. In my case, that speculation about the way things work behind the scenes is also supported by my own observations of life. I lived my own life as I observed it and took notes at the same time. It's a pretty tall order and not a lifestyle one would wish on anyone else. By the end of May 2003, \"Providence\" was finished and The Evermore Trilogy was completed. I had written another installment in the lives of Jack Rand, Karen Smitrovich and the extraterrestrial Unim and, hopefully, this third book would entertain my readers with another window on the everyday world. The real protagonist in \"Providence\" is Verona Petrov, a Russian national living in the United States and teaching at a small but prestigious university in Pennsylvania. Her course in virtual remembering is part of a new, experimental,para-science curriculum at Foxboro University. Verona's research into the afterlife garners her enough attention that certain people want her dead and that's the plot behind the rest of the story. When I finished \"Providence\" in May 2003, it only took me a month before I was on my way to penning a fourth sci-fi thriller that would stand alone on it's own merit. Back in 2002, my intention was to begin a new career, writing science fiction novels that were based on my own observations of life, the world around us, and that vast unknown we call \"the universe\". I used fictional settings in all my novels, referenced by real places to add credibility and believability to my tales of supernatural wonder and the eternal conflict between good and evil. I also gave carte blanche to my seemingly boundless imagination. The result, I think, is a highly readable, evenbelievable, blend of science fiction, action/adventure, humor and, yes, even a little romance.The Science Fiction for Thinkers collection is not your typical genre sci-fi. And it's definitely not horror or fantasy, which are often billed as science fiction. In my sci-fi there are no superheroes, no capes and swords, no castles and princes, no dragons or warlords, no flying waffle irons or, heaven forbid, vampires. My heroes are everyday men and women, the atypical protagonists whose antagonists are often exotic creatures with unbridled personal ambition.Science Fiction for Thinkers has a little something for everyone. But the biggest offering is \"hard science fiction\" that includes exciting high-tech wizardry and cutting-edge concepts about life, time and space, and death. Plus a world of adventure for thinkers and seekers. As a science fiction author, I endeavored to open a new window on the everyday world and to offer a unique vision of the cosmos. I like to think that, if you take a chance and dare to read my particular brand of \"crossover\" science fiction, your world may never look the same.As always, \"Happy reading, no matter who or what you choose to read.\"", "related": ["B00FI23NDG"], "rank": 3113299, "title": "Providence", "author": "Michael Casher", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Some are erotic, some are literary, some are romantic, some dabble with fantasy, some tackle coming out a perennial of queer storytelling. There aren't any duds, but highlights include Sam J. Miller's on-target tale about racial insensitivity, ''Haunting Your House''; Trebor Healey's elegiac account of a young man memorializing his lover's death; Christopher Schmidt's trilogy of short-shorts observing queer life, ''Three Scenes''; Craig Laurance Gidney's recasting of French poet and libertine Arthur Rimbaud, ''Strange Alphabets''; and David Levithan's charming account of a teen's babysitting adventure and his encounter with ''Starbucks Boy.'' Anthologies promising the ''Best'' are entirely subjective; for every story included there are certainly three or four just as good that don t make the cut. But Berman founder and publisher of Lethe Press has a good eye for queer prose, as this quality compilation attests. --Richard Labonte, BookMarksBerman's introduction makes it clear that by ''gay'' he means gay men; all the stories are about gay boys and men. A few of the stories are by well-known authors, but most are by lesser known writers. One interesting feature of the volume is the ordering of the stories, which for the most part is chronological by the age of the main characters, from school boys through retired elderly men, including an elderly couple (together since 1956) one of whose members suffers from Alzheimer's.Style and themes are varied. The first story is rather stream of consciousness. A couple of the stories are autobiographical essays. But most are more conventional narratives. Themes run the gamut of gay life. The younger boys suffer bullying and rejection and even rape, but some also advance toward coming out and enjoying gay life. Young and older men suffer but also enjoy the ups and downs of gay relationships. AIDS is important in at least one story. Some stories are sad; some are violent; a few are comical. And others are fun and joyful.A nice feature of this collection is that, unlike most anthologies, the reader doesn't have to skip to the end to learn about each author. Instead, very short bios precede each story. Additionally, the stories are very well written and edited. Not a single typo was encountered. Even if these aren't the ''best'' gay stories, they are very good and I recommend this anthology for any library and any reader interested in contemporary gay fiction of the shorter variety. --James D.

When they arrive, they find that surface appearances are deceiving.Using a safari as a cover, Hammer and Jack display their marksmanship abilities, impress the natives, and overpower the opposing force. Solving the mystery of who is behind the diamond stealing becomes more and more difficult because for each puzzle solved, more obstacles are thrown their way.Hammer Spade is a roll-with-the-punches kind of guy. In this novel, he is paired with an eclectic cast of characters. But whether he is dealing with an African bushman or a British aristocrat, Hammer's common sense and quick wit allow him to deal with the current situation all the while maintaining his calm demeanor.No matter how serious the circumstances, there is always humor to be found somewhere. Hammer and his friends never lacked for something to provide light entertainment. For example, zebra steaks sound quite tasty. However, after reading this book, I do not think I will ever be enticed into trying one! This book is an enthralling read.Judy Jacobs, St. Joseph MO, October 18, 2006", "related": [], "rank": 4614562, "title": "Hammer Spade and the Diamond Smugglers (The Adventures of Hammer Spade Book 2)", "author": "E.

Her other passion is science-fiction and she likes nothing more than to immerse herself in a whole new universe and the amazing species therein.

Chillemi's most recent original paperback,The Complete\nHerbal Guide: Heal Your Body Naturally and Maintain Optimal Health Using\nAlternative Medicine, Herbals, Vitamins, Fruits and Vegetables(December 2012)\ndebuted at # 1 on Amazon's best-seller list and has been rated five stars from numerous readers who purchased the book.Chillemi's first published book, Epilepsy You're Not Alone in 1998, helped\nmillions of people understand and cope with their disorder enabling them to\nlive a happy, healthy and productive life. Since that time, Chillemi has\npublished numerous non-fiction and fiction books includingThe\nComplete Herbal Guide: A Natural Approach to Healing the Body, Epilepsy and\nPregnancy: What Every Woman Should Know, Co-authored by Dr. Blanca Vasques,\nM.D., Faith, Courage, Wisdom, Strength and Hope, Natural Cures for\nCommon Conditions and The Secrets of Happiness and Success: The Power Of\nPositive Thinking.Her love affair with non-fiction and with health genre in\ngeneral, began during her junior year of college when she was having faced by\nnumerous obstacles due to her epilepsy disorder. Hoping and praying that she would be able to\nfinish college and not let her epilepsy disorder get the best of her, she\ndecided to research her disorder hoping to find out more about her disorder and\nways to cope with it. Sadly, there were not many books written about epilepsy\nduring that era. The few books written were\nby doctors and the medical terminology flew right over your head. Determined to find the answers to my\nquestions,\"How can I graduate college\nwhen I am constantly having seizures?\", \"How can I become a success in life and\nnot let epilepsy destroy my hopes and dreams?\", \"How do people with epilepsy cope\nwith their disorder?\"I decided to write an article to epilepsy foundation and\nasked them to publish it. I wanted to\nlearn how others coped with their disorder.I received hundreds of letters from all over the United States and\nCanada. I decided to use the knowledge I gained to help myself and others by writing a self-help book called,\nEpilepsy You're Not Alone. Writing that book changed my life. Letters poured out from readers thanking me\nfor writing the book. I never realized how\npowerful words could be. My greatest gift\nwas not figuring out how to help myself, it was being able to help others who\nstruggled from the same problem. There\nis no greater gift in life than the gift of giving. I graduated college, received an Associate's Degrees in\nBusiness, and then went on to receive a Bachelor Degree in Marketing and Advertising,\nbut in the end, I changed my career choice to journalism. I graduated Richard\nStockton College in 1996. I began writing seriously in 1994, penning the manuscript\nthat would become Epilepsy You're Not Alone.I held many jobs during those first years as a writer, finally settling\nin (much to our delight) to write full time in 2000.Chillemi is an active member of her\ncommunity and helps organizations in New Jersey. Shehas\nwritten features for journals and newspapers. Her articles have appeared in\ndozens of newspapers and magazines in North America and abroad. She won an\naward from the Epilepsy Foundation of America in 2002 for her help and\ndedication to people with epilepsy.Born in 1972, Chillemi was born in New York and lives in\nNew Jersey with her husband Michael, and their three children, Michael, Alexis\nand Anthony. The family pets include two Shih Tzu's, Rocco and Princess, and two\nbirds Elmo and Tweedy.When she is not writing, Chillemi chases after his three Shih\nTzu's, takes long walks, hits the gym, and goes to all her kids' football, soccer,\nwrestling, basketball and cheerleading practices and games.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I have learned that not just any Bible will do. I want a Bible that is completely accurate, with nothing missing. In 1602 God provided the Spanish-speaking world His precious words in the Reina-Valera Bible.However, after 1602, modernistic, ecumenical Bible societies got their hands on our Received Text-based Protestant Bible in Spanish and corrupted it by incorporating Alexandrian Critical Texts.For several years, I was puzzled over which Spanish Bible I should use. They all had problems. I prayed that God would raise up some brave Hispanic Bible believer to revise the Reina-Valera Bible by replacing the corruptions with pure readings that reflected the Received Texts.God answered my prayer. This book reveals the history behind the making of the Reina-Valera Gómez Bible (RVG) and expresses the true motives and desires that drove this work.Following this fascinating history is a 44 page chart showing the corruptions that found their way into our Bibles, and how they are corrected in the RVG. --Emanuel Rodriguez, Author", "related": ["B004R9QA36"], "rank": 1618247, "title": "God's Bible in Spanish", "author": "Emanuel Rodriguez", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Penelope, aka Pen or Penguin because of the size of her nose, is a likable 16-year-old with a life full of calamity. One of her classmates, Seb, wants to prove that people with certain DNA patterns can cause themselves good or bad luck by the way they treat others. When he tests Pen's DNA, he finds that she is an extreme example of his theory but, if that were true, she would be a terror, and she's not. Seb thinks she might have a secret twin. As it turns out, she has a clone, a stereotypically nasty rock diva who threatens to make Pen's life even more miserable. The only way for Pen to rid herself of her misfortune is to transfer her DNA by overcoming Sereena's security measures and touching her. After several convoluted attempts, she succeeds. In the meantime, she's fallen in love with Seb, whom she suspects is more interested in Sereena. A satisfying final twist, well-drawn main characters, and plenty of action don't make up for the absurdity of the plot, which includes an uncharacteristic move by Pen as she ruins her school formal. Plenty of books manage to combine humor and well-rounded people without resorting to contrivance. This isn't one of them.—Tina Zubak, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, PA(c) Copyright 2010.

{"asin": "B004Z90A7A", "price": -1, "imUrl": "", "description": "Commonweal’s mission is to provide a forum for civil, reasoned debate on the interaction of faith with contemporary politics and culture. Read by a passionate audience of educated, committed Catholics, as well as readers from many other faith traditions, Commonweal presents well-argued, respectful points of view from across the ideological spectrum. In an often contentiously divided Catholic church and secular culture, its status as an independent, lay-run journal of opinion encourages conversations that can be difficult in other settings.Since its founding in 1924 Commonweal has staked a claim for Catholic principles and perspective in American life, and for laypeople’s voices within the church. It has been credited with helping prepare American Catholics for Vatican II and its aftermath, and Commonweal’s current readers say it has helped them weather the sexual-abuse scandal in the church and work through questions and frustrations related to the role of women, the relationship between religion and politics, and church teachings on sexuality. The magazine has an ongoing interest in social justice, ecumenism, just-war teaching, liturgical renewal, women’s issues, the primacy of conscience, and the interchange between Catholicism and liberal democracy. Today Commonweal publishes many of the leading Catholic theologians, writers, and public figures in the United States, including Alice McDermott, Luke Timothy Johnson, Margaret O’Brien Steinfels, Ken Woodward, Paul Elie, and Sidney Callahan, among many others.Commonweal has always been liberal in temperament, opinionated but tolerant in tone. It has never shrunk, however, from taking strong and controversial positions. The editors condemned the firebombing of Dresden and the use of atomic weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and in the decades to follow Commonweal criticized American racism; supported resistance to U.S. involvement in Vietnam; and took issue with the 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae but also the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade. Today the magazine maintains prolife convictions while being critical of single-issue abortion politics, and provides a space for marginalized voices in the church and on the national scene.Commonweal is published 20 times a year in print as well as in digitally enhanced multimedia formats, including special issues each year dedicated to contemporary theology, interreligious dialogue, books, and fiction. It is edited by Catholic laypeople and published by the nonprofit Commonweal Foundation.Kindle Magazines are fully downloaded onto your Kindle so you can read them even when you're not wirelessly connected.", "related": ["B002MAP9X4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sir Alain de Villequier, a Norman knight and the local justiciar, seeks the killer, but Lassair, with her mystical powers, may prove more effective in discovering who strangled the girl, if only she can keep her imagination and her tongue under control. The charming, compassionate Sir Alain, Lassair learns, had more than a passing interest in the victim. Clare deftly evokes the tension between the Norman overlords and the Saxon natives of the fens as the former try to impose both Norman law and religion on the latter, who remain under the spell of the old religion. The murderer's identity will surprise most readers. (Dec.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

James realized that Darwin's ideas could be extended and applied to any type of information, whether genetic, computer algorithms or ideas passed from one person to the next. During this research, James inevitably encountered \"The Selfish Gene\" in which the evolutionist Dawkins lays out these same ideas and coined the word \"meme.\" After completing his Master's Degree at Stanford, James went on to a career in computer architecture and design.  But his study of memetics, religion, sociology and evolution became his second career. In addition to his work, James is an accomplished guitarist, a tolerable clarinet player and a deep-sea sailor.

His winged sandals have flown him for over three decades to follow a career as an Engineer in nine different countries, but he has always aspired to be a writer and during that time, he put together the ideas for a series of five books in the fantasy sci-fi genre.In 2008, he finally sat down and started to write the first of the series. Following Kurt Vonnegut's belief that every story should start from a question, his questions are many and he sets out to answer them in this first series: 1. If some of the characters of Greek and other ancient mythologies had really existed, what happened to them? 2. If there could once have been a civilisation which developed early in the History of our Solar system, what could have happened to it? 3. If the asteroids are the remnants of a fifth planet, what could have happened to it?The Trismegistus is an attempt to partly answer these questions. At times it becomes a historical novel, at others it is pure fantasy and of course it cannot help exploring the scientific possibilities along the way! By necessity, mythology straddles history, science and the imagination. David has painstakingly visited most of the settings and sifted through all of the available knowledge about the myths on which the book is built. Writing about Hermes has been a way for David to break free from the shackles of reality that are his work in everyday life. By day, he deals with the hard realities of maintaining an underground railway in London. After work he escapes to places where only Hermes can fly.", "related": ["B00ABT3KW0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book provides the insight and is a great read.\"   Keith Edelman, Managing Director of Arsenal Football Club     \"What a great read! This will inspire not only those in business but in sport too. Want to motivate your staff? Give them a copy today!\"   Martin Edwards, Former Chairman of Manchester United Football Club     \"They say in football that when one door closes, another one slams in your face! In this book Messrs Theobald and Cooper illustrate clearly just how much businessmen can learn from the study of football. Competition, strategy, tactics, leadership, management and teamwork, are carefully analysed. The book is striking and evocative. It will appeal to all practitioners and students of commerce and especially those with a love of the beautiful game. Business, like football, may be simple but as one illustrious manager once said, the problem is making it look simple.\"   Keith Harris, Executive Chairman of Seymour Pierce and former Chairman of The Football League     \"Theobald and Cooper confirm what many people have suspected for some time - leadership and management in football and business are variations of the same theme. Very readable and relevant for all those interested in business management.\"   Alan Murray, CEO of Hansons PLC     \"I am indebted to the authors for writing this book. I now feel fully justified in my habit of peppering my management talks with sporting analogies. Just when I was beginning to think I'd overdone it, I now find countless examples in here, and I can't wait to introduce them into my talks, oblivious to the pleading looks from my audience. In sport, you see competition in its purest form. There's no grey, no amount of management speak can gloss over the result. There are lots of lessons, I believe, for managers to see what really matters when the pressure is on.\"   Sir Terry Leahy, CEO of Tesco     \"A host of experts have contributed to Business and the Beautiful Game, which takes the tactics of football and applies them to the workplace.\"   Newcastle Upon Tyne Evening Chronicle (Series)     \"Forget Donald Trump and Alan Sugar, for a leg-up the corporate ladder, look to the men who earn their seven-figure salaries at the chalk board rather than in the boardroom...touchline tips from managers past and present that can be learned and used at work.

While out riding one day, Rachel encounters her new neighbor, Jason Beaumont, an American privateer who recently became the earl of Falconridge. Rachel's hope to never again cross paths with the brash, arrogant American is dashed once her father and grandfather betroth her to him. Fortunately, Jason has as little interest in marrying her as Rachel has in becoming his wife, so together the two of them concoct a scheme to avoid their impending wedding. Their plans take a small detour once they realize someone is trying to kill Jason, but even more distracting is the fact that they both are starting to enjoy each other's company. Readers with a taste for unconventional heroines, bold heroes, and plots made up of equal measures of passion and danger will find Henke's lusciously sensual Regency wonderfully satisfying.John CharlesCopyright © American Library Association.

I told him we should write a murder mystery and kill the son-of-a-bitch off in the first chapter and spend the rest of the book figuring out who did it. So I did.Q: It seems like so many lawyers become novelists. Is there something about framing a case, and presenting it to a jury, that makes a lawyer especially skilled at effective story-telling?A: I was a trial lawyer for 28 years. Trying a case is all about telling a story. You need a hook, a compelling protagonist and a narrative that holds together, makes sense and gives the jury a reason to root for your side. Writing a novel requires a lot of the same story-telling skills.Q: After writing several \"Lou Mason\" legal thrillers, you shifted gears and began writing about an FBI agent. What prompted the shift?A: I developed a movement disorder called tics which is similar to Tourette's. It makes me shake, spasm and stutter. I wanted to write about my experience so I created Jack Davis, an FBI agent in his mid-50's and gave him my disorder. I wanted to find out what would happens if he shakes when he should shoot.Q: \"Freaks Must Die\" novel is your first foray into the horror genre...was that a challenge for you? How is it different from writing a legal thriller or a crime novel?A: It was a challenge to get in the horror mindset. Once I integrated that into a crime setting, it felt the same, only bloodier.Q: This is also the first time you've written for a series that you didn't create. What was that experience like?It was a great experience. The collaboration with the creators of the series, Lee Goldberg and Bill Rabkin, was a terrific learning experience. Capturing the voice and sensibility of Matt Cahill was a challenge. I felt a real responsibility to stay true to the character and the series.Q: What's next for you?A: I'm working on a novel that will be out later this year introducing a new series featuring Alex Stone, a public defender with a \"Dexter\" sense of justice.", "related": [], "rank": 133614, "title": "Freaks Must Die (Dead Man Book 10) eBook", "author": "Joel Goldman", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 28.0}

Now his oldest sister takes him to school and he has to walk in all by himself. But that's not all that has changed. His best friend, Joseph, is in the hospital, and his friend Lexie seems to prefer playing with Breezie. And worst of all, his mother forgot to pack him a Lunchable for the second-grade field trip to the Georgia Aquarium. When Ty wanders away from his class, he ends up in the closed penguin exhibit and manages to slip a baby penguin into his backpack. He sneaks it home and hides it in the bathtub until it is discovered by his sister Winnie. She solicits the assistance of their oldest sister to return the penguin to the aquarium. While Ty gets scolded for running off at the aquarium, he doesn't face any consequences for stealing the baby penguin. And, it's unclear how Winnie and Sandra are able to successfully return Pingy. Animated illustrations, some filling a full page, enhance this beginning chapter book. However, the book gets off to a slow start as the most exciting and interesting aspect of the story-the kidnapping of the baby penguin-doesn't occur until chapter eight. Nevertheless, this spin-off of Myracle's \"Winnie Years\" series (Dutton) will appeal to fans of other younger brothers like Megan McDonald's Stink Moody and Lois Lowry's Sam Krupnick.-Rachel Kamin, North Suburban Synagogue Beth El, Highland Park, ILα(c) Copyright 2013.

The players are about to perform the latest work of Jonas Applegarth, a controversial, foul-tongued playwright whose ego is nearly as fat as he is. But amidst the triumph of the performance, tragedy strikes: the elderly choirmaster of a children's acting troupe (and rival of Westfield's men) is found hanged above his own stage. When stage manager Nicholas Bracewell discovers the body, he hears the distinctive sniggering of the murderer, nicknamed the Laughing Hangman, echoing in the theater. With little to go on, Bracewell investigates while providing bodyguards for the universally unpopular Applegarth and sorting out his own relations with his former love, Anne Hendrik. A second murder at the Queen's Head, home of Bracewell's troupe, leads to a riveting finale. Fans of Bracewell and company will relish this return to the company of Lawrence Firethorn, lead actor and ladies' man, and unlucky playwright Edmund Hoode, who may at last have found love.

He and his wife trained and became Salvation Army Officers for 11 years moving around New Zealand to various posts.  His search for truth led him to question some of the tenets of the Army and in 1984 he left The Salvation Army to start a small charismatic group where he still ministers today. The truths in his books are based on first-hand experience and a desire to discover a real and true faith. Central to that is a close and intimate personal relationship with Jesus Christ. His heart desire is to help other believers come to know Jesus as a friend and lover and thereby prepare them for an eternity of wedded bliss with their chosen bridegroom.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Visiting different countries and cultures throughout our married life gave me an expansive view of food and customs, which show up in most of the dishes that I cook and serve to friends. I have been in the food industry since I was 15, and love running my own catering company. When we took on this endeavor to sail, our friends were very skeptical of our abilities, thus pushing us ever further to accomplish this challenge. Both Ted and I are very determined to finish what we start, so this part of our life was amazing. Writing a book of our family adventure was the icing on the cake!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From adolescence to adulthood, his imagination continued to feed itself on a diet of books, movies, and art, all the while growing and maturing--waiting for its opportunity. Then, during a procession of monotonous, physically laborious day-jobs, his imagination leaped into motion, bringing together characters and locations of a world that would someday come to life on the pages of a book. In late 2008, Jason made his first attempt at writing, managing to complete a whole scene before returning once again to reality. A year and a half later, a spontaneous night-time conversation with his wife encouraged him to take his writing seriously and to keep on dreaming. Over the next seven years, Jason carved time out of the real world to live in an imaginary one of epic fantasy, science-fiction, and military/political conflict. The fruits of this labor would later become the first three books of the bestselling AWAKENED series. Due to the overwhelming support of readers around the world, Jason has continued his trajectory into make-believe, recently jumping from stable employment in the micro-electronics industry into the mysterious abyss of full-time writing. Living in Colorado with his beautiful wife and two children, Jason now spends the majority of his time fusing the best parts of his favorite genres into stories of internal struggle and triumph, friendship, betrayal, political alliances, and military conflict. If you'd like to follow along on Jason's journey or get behind the scenes info on the AWAKENED or WANDERING STARS series, you can find him on Facebook (jasontesar.com), Twitter (@jasontesar), on his blog (jasontesar.com), or send him an email at jasontesar@yahoo.com.", "related": ["B00I9E5G3U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 26, "rating_average": 4.4231, "rating_total": 115.0}

Not having a political or religious agenda, he shuns all so-called \"interpretation\" and speaks only to the plain words of the Scripture that is at the core of the religion. His books are unbiased guides, as a legal scholar would write. Lamp takes nothing for granted about a reader's religious knowledge or lack thereof. His books are easy to read in spite of their serious subject matter. Every term and quote is explained with clear citations to its place in the Scripture so that readers might check it out or read further in the Scripture they happen to have at home. His books are lighthearted in tone, like going on a romp through the Scripture, and you'll wind up being much more knowledgeable about your religion and your Scripture.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Before pursuing his doctorate in English at the University of Delaware (English, 1980), he spent two years away from formal study to fish and to plunder libraries and used bookstores for books on fishing and a wide variety of other subjects. His scholarly publications have treated metrics, the legendary history of Britain, Geoffrey Chaucer, and lexicography.

Although there are days when Lee misses the place where his roots are, he plans to stick around the Badger State for quite a while. Lee grew up in a small town called Chino Valley, during a time where someone driving along the highway could blink and miss it. Lee prefers the small-town life, although he doesn't mind an occasional trip into the bigger cities to get the essentials. During the day, Lee is a journalist, writing and taking photos for The Shawano Leader. At night and on the weekends, however, he can be found at his laptop, creating brave new worlds or turning the existing one into a fantastic realm of love and surprises, with occasional scary thrills thrown in to keep readers from getting too bored. Writing has always been in Lee's blood. He enjoyed writing stories in school, and in high school, he tried his hand at writing plays. He turned out to be good enough that his high school drama teacher asked to produce one of them—\"Murder on the Boardwalk.\" Getting royalties for creating something has inspired him to keep going. Lee's foray into full-length novels did not blossom until 2006 when he visited family members in Wisconsin and went on a camping trip with his sister and brother-in-law. It was autumn, and the changing colors of the leaves mesmerized him. Even though he was on vacation, he started developing the idea for his debut novel \"The Colors of Love and Autumn.\" Since then, Lee has published a sequel to that book, as well a paranormal trilogy based in Sedona, Ariz., and a stand-alone novella, along with a pair of short stories. Lee shows no signs of stopping, working on two or even three writing projects at a time. When he's not writing, Lee is running around with his Canon Rebel, snapping pictures of people, places and more. He shares his home with his dog, Toby, and his roommate, Keith. Lee hasn't found the man of his dreams like most of his main characters, but he's still hoping.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She encouraged him to be different and often reminds him of where he came from and the struggles that led to his wildly successful career. Will was born and raised, without meeting his father, within the only black family in the impoverished Los Angeles neighborhood of Boyle Heights. Former classmates remember him much as he is perceived today, as charismatic and charming. White dutifully recounts the highlights of Will and the Peas’ experiences thus far, from their early days clubbing in Hollywood to their worldwide fame and Will’s work with Michael Jackson. Some controversies are addressed, including the lawsuit involving celebrity blogger Perez Hilton. Fans of Will.i.am will enjoy this “unauthorized,” lighter-than-a-soufflé biography; those seeking more depth will have to wait. --June Sawyers", "related": [], "rank": 2259028, "title": "Will.i.am: The Unauthorized Biography", "author": "Danny White", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Instead, he went into journalism, beginning his career with the Daily Herald in Biloxi-Gulfport, Mississippi, later going on to the Atlanta Constitution and, eventually, the Los Angeles Times. Here Nelson recounts his career and explores changes in journalism and the South during a tumultuous period. Through his relentless pursuit of news and challenge to the racial status quo of the South, Nelson covered white supremacy, black resistance, and political demagoguery. Nelson recalls reporting on corruption in the Georgia prison system and offers behind-the-scenes details of his book Terror in the Night (1993), exploring a bizarre plot by the FBI and the Meridian, Mississippi, police and Jewish community to entrap two Klansmen. Nelson is as frank in his criticism of himself as he is of the scoundrels he uncovered, noting his early naïveté as a reporter and his slow acceptance of the civil rights beat. Photos enhance this engaging look at a fascinating reporter and the times he chronicled and influenced. --Vanessa Bush", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This playful peach spent ten years as a journalist, reading the news on various radio stations across Australia before deciding to take her on-air persona into the real world, training in various subconscious mind skills to become a Relationship Therapist. Wanting to help more people than she could possibly see in a day, Tamra founded Getting Naked Pty Ltd to encourage ladies and gents to develop the relationship they have with themselves in order to achieve the success and happiness they desire. And what did she call this mind work? Naked Therapy of course! You'll often see Tamra gracing our television screens on programs such as Channel Seven's Sunrise. And she continues to write for leading health publications including her regular column in Nature and Health magazine, 'Ask Tamra' If Tamra's not inspiring others to love life, she's baking scones or behind her drums bashing out tunes with her band. www.tamramercieca.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At the age of 14-years-old I was placed in a plastic and metal back brace that went from my shoulders to my buttocks with two medal bars that wrapped around my neck. Needless to say wearing this thing to school, high school no less, every day was horrific. On a daily basis I was tormented and desperate to find an escape; that’s where writing became my escape. I could write a story and magically transport myself into a different world, a different body and I was safe from the torment. This became my passion, the one thing I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to give this gift to others. I have a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Journalism and have been writing practically my entire life. I used to write for the college newspaper before it was discontinued my senior years. I have written freelance for sites such as, phatguru.com  and celebritycafe.com . In 2009 I created my own magazine called, The Conzine, a magazine that focused on who celebrities were behind the glitz and glamor of Hollywood. In September 2010 the publisher of Fan Quarterly got wind of The Conzine and purchased the content rights for a mutually agreed upon price. I have hundreds of published articles on various websites and online news organizations and have also created a fairly successful blog entitled, “Rose Are Red Violets Are Blue.” I began writing, “Midnight to Sunrise,” in August following a dream I’d had with the very same concept. I always loved vampire romance stories but always felt they lacked originality because they followed the lore too heavily. I wanted to create something that wasn’t your typical vampire vs. werewolf story.

A sequel to Gilman's feminist classic, Herland (1916), this continues yet radically changes that book's utopian vision. Ellador leaves Herland with her new husband, Vandyck Jennings, one of the three men who discovered the world populated entirely by women. After a tour of Europe and Asia, they return to \"his\" land, the United States. More sociological tract than novel, the book analyzes social, economic, and political problems, discussing overpopulation, gender roles, environmentalism, the care of children, and racism?issues that are surprisingly relevant today. The final pages of the book provide an unexpected twist that completes the reader's understanding of Gilman's overall purpose. Recommended for academic libraries.?Yvette Weller Olson, City Univ.

Me and my daughter however are both made of soft plump limbs, little muscle tone and struggle to stand upright without losing balance so the challenge was on with this new book. So I got my best long skirt on (I know, not ideal, but I was just going to be the narrator), my son got his Tae Kwon-do outfit on and my daughter, who is 3 years old, got dressed in pink leggings with a fetching pink tutu and a vest. I put a few old mats down left from the good old days of callanetics and we were good to go. Now, as normal with me, I am always a little sceptical at the ability an author has to motivate the reader into anything other than rigid boredom but am constantly and pleasantly surprised by children's utter enthusiasm for almost anything other than homework or housework. Firstly, can I say something brilliant about this book - hot diggerty - it stands up on its own! So the kiddies can prop it up on the table on its own little stand and see it properly to practise their gymnastic moves without having to keep stopping to pick the book up. What a marvellous idea! So, we worked our way through the book page by page, starting with the warm up exercises and then onto stretching with particular success and hilarity trying to do a stretch called the 'feet to head' stretch where you 'simply' lie on your tummy and try and push your head back towards your feet and touch them together. The kiddies puffed and panted and Delilah, the 3 year old, rolled out of the stretch several times finding herself under the coffee table giggling and I gave it a go to find I was approximately 3 foot short of my feet being anywhere close to my head.(I'm sure I could do this 30 years ago. Has someone implanted a steel rod down my spine rendering me utterly inflexible whilst I wasn't looking?) My son however was so good at it he could practically plait his hair with his toes (should he want to). The illustrations on each page are superb, showing very clearly how to create the move or stretch in colourful glossy pictures and with very useful hints and tips attached to help give you a better idea how to achieve them and also showing you how NOT to do them, to avoid strains or injury (or long skirts falling over your face). We practised the pike headstand (I say we, this was done by my willing colleagues), the cartwheel, the bridge, the circle roll, easy ones, difficult ones and I must say I joined in and we all had a brilliant afternoon. My son took the book to bed with him to study in more detail and my daughter and I had a donut afterwards to celebrate the joy of exercise. This is an excellent book to use to encourage your children into gymnastics, it's easy to follow, beautifully written and an awful lot of fun, so roll up your rug, push the toys out of the way, turn the telly off and have a laugh whilst learning something new! --Hayley Thornton", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was empathetic with staff but always challenging and focused. As his sponsor for the work Steve gave me constructive feedback on how the college contributed to the performance of staff in meeting challenging targets. The college success rates moved from 45% to 80% in a relatively short period of time, a true measure of the impact of performance management.A\"  I wish I'd had this book 15 years ago.

One particular advancement mentioned was theLaser Babieswhere babies will be scanned from head to toe to find any imperfections so some improvements can be done. Of course, there are organizations that are against this procedure like the PETI or The People for the Ethical Treatment of Infants. Because there are advancements, there will also be groups that will be against it.When I was readingLaser Babies, I thought it sounded like newborn screening but instead of cystic fibrosis or hearing loss or congenital heart defects and other conditions, this scanning will find imperfections that can be treated by cosmetic surgery. Though it was mentioned that imperfections inside and out will be detected, this is like a very high tech newborn screening. It was so absurd that it was fascinating. When talking about the future, some people will think of computers and robots but Preston Randall is a unique writer for thinking of Laser Babies. My favorite part was the presentation about the babies, with the alternating voice-over describing what is happening in the video. It was like seeing it in my mind's eye. I also liked the ending, because even in the future, things like that may still happen. The Uranium Bites cereal is original. So to summarize, this short story is really interesting even if it was a little disturbing.", "related": [], "rank": 28296, "title": "Laser Babies", "author": "Preston Randall", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although originally from Denmark she is a New Zealander, who moved first to London, then California and Hawaii, and is now primarily back in NZ.  Her rich background - from cavorting with the rich and famous in London and being part of the revolution in consciousness in 60s California, plus Yoga ashram eco-community living for 17 years as director of a Yoga Centre, running Childbirth and Childcare businesses, and finally 17 years indigenous earth-centered  living in Hawaii,  has furnished her with multitudes of multicultural and multidimensional perspectives.

Expressly hoping to provoke the end of exceptionalism, he adduces America's fondness for ritual reenactments to demonstrate the shortcomings of event-specific historicism in light of big-picture history. In a clear and vivid voice, he draws attention to the effusive literary style of many early historical records and shows how science, not just religion, was swept into the perpetuation of certain myths. While he cogently outlines the importance of seeing society as a construct connected to its past, he loses ground when he leaps into the realm of political philosophy. His assertion that fundamentalist beliefs regarding markets, individuality, and government go largely uncontested is difficult to substantiate. Peering through the lens of myth-worship vs. historicism, Smith maligns certain abstract political notions because they have historically coincided with a Christian vision for the country and a reverence for the rugged American prototype; insufficiently acknowledged is that willingness to face the nation's history openly does not automatically discount certain abstract ideas. A thought-provoking collection, its conclusions step beyond what is substantiated by the material.

For Macadoo, life is full of many joys in the field, such as prancing with other yearlings and foals and playing with monarch butterflies. Then Mamare, the yearling, and many others are herded onto a truck bound for the auction house. The horses will either be bought for work and leisure or bought for slaughter. The young horse finds himself alone in the kill line and tries frantically to catch a kind buyer's eye. What will be his destiny? Will he ever see his Mamare again? Will he be ground into chunks of meat? Listeners will be quickly drawn into this suspenseful story. Amateau's character development leaves listeners with a strong affection for the creatures in this story (Candlewick, 2013). She masterfully weaves information about many different creatures into the story as well, through encounters with the young horse. JD Jackson's voice does not change for the different characters, but his pace and emotion work well. This is a wonderful choice for schools with avid horse fans.—Katy Charles, Virgil Elementary School, Cortland, NY", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She went on to college to study Psychology and Social Work, but then was grabbed by a burning desire to share the many stories inside of her. Her first novel was penned at the tender age 20, while working as a security guard. The book was written because of a bet she had with her baby sister. Laid back and easy going, Boo still possesses an eagerness to please and a determination to succeed. Boo is able to grab her readers with engaging, unique story lines. She touches on all subjects from romance, street life, lust and even racism. Her style is fast paced while still being detail orientated, witty and extremely humorous. Boo's literary diversity led to her acquiring a publishing deal with #TBRS Pleasure Principle Publications where her novel 'Undercover' graced the National Best Sellers List. In Boo's words she doesn't write because she wants to; she writes because she has to!

Brougher, Esq., MPH  At first glance, ownership of intellectual property seems straightforward: the control over an invention or idea. But with the recent explosion of new scientific discoveries poised to transform public health and healthcare systems, costly and lengthy patent disputes threaten both to undermine the attempts to develop new medical technologies and to keep potentially life-saving treatments from patients who need them. Intellectual Property and Health Technologiesgrounds readers in patent law and explores how scientific research and enterprise are evolving in response. Geared specifically to the medical disciplines, it differentiates among different forms of legal protection for inventors such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, explains their limitations, and argues for balance between competing forces of exclusivity and availability. Chapters delve into the major legal controversies concerning medical and biotechnologies (deleted \"in terms of pricing, markets, and especially the tension between innovation and access\"), including: The patent-eligibility of genesThe patent-eligibility of medical process patentsThe rights and roles of universities and inventorsThe balancing of access, innovation, and profit in drug developmentThe tension between biologics, small-molecule drugs, and their generic counterpartsInternational patent law and access to medicine in the developing world As these issues continue to shape and define the debate,Intellectual Property and Health Technologiesenables professionals and graduate students in public health, health policy, healthcare administration, and medicine to understand patent law and how it affects the development of medical technology and the delivery of medicine.", "related": [], "rank": 1441283, "title": "Intellectual Property and Health Technologies: Balancing Innovation and the Public's Health", "author": "Joanna T.

Grandfather's Uncle by Philip McQuillan is no exception. There is such a naturally conversational singularity of purpose in McQuillan's writing that the act of reading this paean to his father becomes a privilege - a rare opportunity to know a true character through the eyes of those who loved him most. McQuillan's objective is to ensure that his colorful, witty, and wryly entertaining father (who passed away recently at 98 years of age) will not be forgotten. In this respect, Grandfather's Uncle succeeds brilliantly.McQuillan's father was a devotee of Shakespeare and a great lover of words; hence, the text of Grandfather's Uncle is peppered with many seldom-seen words and phrases, all of which appear in bold font to make the reader feel closer to the subject. It would be easy for some to say that Grandfather's Uncle is too personal to appeal to a wide range of readers, but such a cursory assessment would do it a great disservice. In truth, it is its simple purpose and straightforward approach which render it refreshing and, ultimately, beguiling. In the Afterword, McQuillan offers readers an e-mail address to use in giving feedback on Grandfather's Uncle and encourages them to craft personal memoirs of their own loved ones 'hic et nunc' - 'here and now' - while they are still fresh in memory. Such a noble intention is not easily diminished or discounted. Grandfather's Uncle offers many valuable lessons as it brings to light the wit and wisdom of a man worthy of being remembered for generations to come.  ~ Readers' Favorite", "related": [], "rank": 26732, "title": "Write To Remember... eBook", "author": "PHILIP McQUILLAN", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 13, "rating_average": 4.6154, "rating_total": 60.0}

With the ending of his second marriage and his personal life in shambles, he set out on a path of self-discovery. He began to ask, “What has my life been about? Surely there must be meaning to all of this?” He found the courage to look within for the first time in his life, and what he discovered will help change your life for the better. Greg employed hundreds of people and was deeply involved in numerous lives while on his path to external success. An insatiable reader, he studied Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) in the early nineties, as well as transcendental meditation – which became a workplace ritual. He became one of Australia’s leading business people and entrepreneurs. Finally needing more answers to life, in his late forties and early fifties he undertook intensive work with psychotherapists, psychologists, and counselors, attended numerous group therapy sessions, and shared life experiences with many people.

It's a beautiful story about living life, taking chances, making choices, following your heart, and it's ultimately about love. Goulden has an amazing talent for storytelling and for bringing characters to life. The plot was perfectly paced; the relationship, friendship, and sexual tension between Monica and Quinn were realistic and gradually grew over the course of a month. I was so completely immersed in this book that I stayed up all night until six in the morning because I just had to finish it. After wiping the tears off my face, and in an attempt to get over the devastation of coming to the end of one of my new favorite books, I had to Google this fantastic author to see if she had written anything else. To say that I was ecstatic to discover that this was the first book in a trilogy would be an understatement. I will be counting down the days, hours, and minutes until the next book comes out. A.L.

There are all sorts of ecommerce sites on the web. Why do so many of your books focus specifically on eBay?Answer. I think eBay offers the best shot for new sellers to gain traction selling online. eBay is easy to get started selling on; it has a built in customer base of over 250 million eager buyers; and you can sell just about anything.Question: That last part is the million dollar question, what are the best things to sell on eBay if you want to make money?Answer: That's the great thing about eBay. It really doesn't matter what you sell. There are so many people on the site, with so many interests, that you can sell just about anything if you package it right.Question: Can you give us a few examples?Answer: Think cell phones, consumer electronics, and video games. eBay has hundreds of sellers moving these same items. The problem is these are almost impossible fields to compete in. You're up against the likes of Best Buy and the other big box giants.Question: So what do you do?Answer: Smart sellers narrow their focus down and serve a niche.     Do you service and sell used cell phones? There's a huge market for refurbished phones on eBay. If you have a ready source of phones, and can restore them to factory settings you're going to do well.     Let me give you another example. My Kindle went crazy last fall and wouldn't charge. None of the computer stores in town wanted to look at it. The one guy I did find who was willing to give it a shot wanted eighty bucks, but he wouldn't guarantee anything. I searched eBay and found a guy who would reset the charger stem (return postage included) for $34.95. When I checked his feedback he was doing a booming business, and he wasn't the only one. Five other sellers were thriving doing the same thing.     In my case, I take old magazines libraries and book stores are begging to get rid and harvest articles and pictures from them that sell for twenty to fifty dollars each. In fourteen years of doing it, I've made over thirty thousand sales.Question: But aren't there too many sellers already? How can the average guy hope to find a new niche that will make them money? Isn't it a little like finding the proverbial needle in the haystack?Answer: Ideas are all around you?     Do you run a local screen print shop? You can do short orders of six, twelve or twenty-five t-shirts and cater to the small business market. Are you an artist? Open up an eBay store and put your masterpieces out there for a larger market to find. Is there a local business in your area that everybody just loves? Test the waters and put a few of their products on eBay.     If you're really at a loss for what to sell, take a drive around town; open up the phone book; follow your kids around for a day and listen to what gets them excited.Question: Earlier you mentioned you can sell anything if you package it right. What did you mean by that?Answer: You've got to be creative in your listings. That means crafting awesome titles loaded with keywords; your pictures need to showcase what you're selling and make people want to buy it; you're item description needs to make customers drool for more.     I keep thinking back to a designer I use on Fiverr. She describes her book covers as being so realistic customers will want to reach out and lick them. Are auction listing so enticing customers will want to lick them. If not, you probably want to go back to the drawing board.Final Question: What's the best way to get started?Answer:  Dive in head first. So many people talk about what they want to do. They put all of these obstacles in their way. I'll do it when I can spare a thousand dollars. I'll start when I'm on vacation next summer and have the time to do it right. I need to get more information before I get started.    Listen to me. That's all a bunch of horse-hockey we tell ourselves to keep from trying. The best way to start doing something is to do it. Make a few mistakes. Who cares?     Read my books. Learn how to sell on eBay. Whatever you do, don't over think it. It's not rocket science.     What's the worst you can do? Loose a few bucks. Maybe make a few extra bucks. You'll never know until you give it a shot.", "related": [], "rank": 812907, "title": "How to Make Money Selling Old Books and Magazines on eBay (EBay Selling Made Easy Book 8) eBook", "author": "Nick Vulich", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This sequel to The Proud and the Free opens in May 1860 in Springfield, Mass., as 19-year-old Diane Parmelee, a blonde, blue-eyed army brat, encounters a former childhood friend, the darkly handsome Cherokee Lije Stuart, now a Harvard University law graduate. Old passions flare, but Diana refuses Lije's marriage proposal when he insists that they live in the Cherokee Nation Indian Territory. Returning to his family's plantation, Lije runs into Kipp Gordon, his mother's brother and the bitter enemy of Lije's father, The Blade. At age three, Lije witnessed Kipp and other masked men kill his grandfather, Shawano Stuart, who had signed an unauthorized treaty that surrendered all Cherokee land in the East to the federal government. Because The Blade also signed the treaty, Kipp and his son, Alex, still consider him a traitor. Lije, The Blade, Kipp and Alex all join the Confederate Army during the Civil War, but soon enough Kipp and Alex desert to the Union, a scenario that gives the Stuarts and the Gordons the opportunity to settle their old scores on the battlefield. Although the on-again, off-again romance between Lije and Diana is as predictable as it is contrived, the fierce intrafamily feud and background material on the Cherokee Nation keep the narrative lively and interesting. 125,000 first printing; Literary Guild and Doubleday Book Club selections; author tour.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the early Eighties, working as an anti-nuke activist with Oregon Fair Share, he was one of a small group of people whose actions led to the lawsuit that ended nuclear plant construction in the United States.  Over the last fifteen years, Michael Adzema has managed and authored a number of popular websites and blogs, including Primal Spirit; Becoming Authentic; The Great Reveal by the Planetmates; Apocalypse NO; Culture War, Class War; and Things That Want to Be Said. In addition to Planetmates: The Great Reveal, he has authored the books, Falls from Grace, which is listed as a reference on prenatal and perinatal psychology; Experience Is Divinity; Apocalypse NO; Primal Renaissance; Culture War, Class War; and the companion volume to Apocalypse NO, titled Apocalypse Emergency—Love’s Wake-Up Call. An updated version of Falls from Grace, next to be published in the Return to Grace series, has been completed and is due for publication in 2014. Along with it, and all books except Primal Renaissance mentioned above, four more books are to be published in his Return to Grace series, for a total of ten volumes, being released in 2013 through 2015.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He suggests that Grace transfers her spirit to the body of his newest patient--Mrs. Vanessa Knight, a gorgeous-looking woman who is soon to be released from life-support. Grace doesn't need much convincing to take this drastic step. She will live on and realize her two dreams: to be a mother, and be loved by a man. Only to hear her soon-to-be husband's whispered words just before the life-support is switched off: \"Good-bye, darling. I'm glad I'll never have to see you again.\"Lucas Knight has been contentedly preparing for Vanessa's death. Throughout their marriage, this volatile woman had become increasingly vicious towards him and their young son. Therefore, he's appalled and traumatized when, miraculously, she comes out of her coma. Strangely, this girl isn't anything like the witch he'd said goodbye to. He could love this gentle angel.
