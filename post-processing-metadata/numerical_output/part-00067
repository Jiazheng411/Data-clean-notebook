The century old vampiress and the innocent sorority girl...it's the classic Hammer movie setup, but redone with a delicate touch that brings the setting and the characters to glorious life. Lea Griffon, despite her years of experience with men and women, is wonderfully vulnerable. You feel all her insecurities and all her desires. Meanwhile, her lover is innocent, in all ways, yet loving. Clancy Rosabel is just what the vampiress needs to bring her out of her self-imposed isolation. Watching these two women, seperated by the traditions of old-blood New Orleans, come together is truly beautiful. The Garden House teases your emotions, keeping you totally engrossed to the final page. In addition to Lea and Clancy, there's a handful of lovely, fully fleshed secondary characters. Caspaar, Lea's vampire brother, is intriguing enough that I'd love to see his story one day...and the story, though briefly mentioned, of the property's ghost, makes you want to know more about him as well.

Based on interviews and previously unpublished sources, this is a commendable account of the associations Martin Luther King Jr. had with Jews and Jewish organizations. Schneier frankly confronts such issues as African-American anti-Semitism, the left-wing connections of King's important Jewish advisor, Stanley Levison, and the early reluctance of many Southern Jews to endorse the civil rights movement. These kinds of problems were balanced by the vigorous support King received from such Jewish leaders as Morris Abram and Abraham Joshua Heschel, Jewish participation in the historic march from Selma to Montgomery and the assistance King gave to the struggle against Soviet repression of Jews. Perhaps the most troublesome episode in the groups' relationship occurred during the Six-Day War, when King's powerful pacifist convictions and the anti-Zionist harangues of several African-American leaders combined to make him reluctant to advocate favoring Israel. However, he never endorsed anti-Israel attitudes and, in the last speech he made before his 1968 assassination, spoke fondly of his trip to Israel in 1959. Schneier's candid, well-balanced presentation is a significant contribution to African-American/Jewish harmony.

But despite this burden, she maintains, some women in various times and places have developed their innate capacity for intense same-sex friendships, with or without homoerotic components. Raymond looks at the lives of medieval nuns who formed spiritual and emotional ties in convents that gave them independence from a man's world. She examines the 19th century Chinese phenomenon of \"marriage resisters\": rural women who banded together after leaving their husbands or refusing to marry at all. Her radical feminist critique is, unfortunately, vague on how women's friendships might transform patriarchal social structures and bind women's lives together. The study is a mixture of impassioned rhetoric, jargon and tough-minded analysis.

For years, the friends have been telling each other scary campfire stories starring the Pricker Boy, once a real child who was tricked into getting caught in one of his father's animal traps, taken in by the dense woods, and transformed into a revenge-seeking creature with \"skin hardened like bark…and thorns over every inch of his body.\" Their belief that the stories aren't real is shaken when a package filled with childhood objects—sacrificed in years past to keep the monster away—mysteriously appears. Going into the woods beyond the hawthorn trees won't really bring danger and death, will it? And Pete, with his unpredictable behavior, isn't really going over to the dark side, is he? This summer is all about the friends testing their limits, finding a way to deal with their fears, and overcoming emotional trauma. While loose ends abound and certain plot elements defy logical explanation, the spooky mood is sustained and will carry many readers to consider their own nightmares, imagine their greatest fears, and have empathy for these characters dealing with their own bogeymen.—Joel Shoemaker, South East Junior High School, Iowa City, IACopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Set in St. Petersburg in 1868, Morris's superb second novel to feature Porfiry Petrovich (afterThe Gentle Axe) puts the detective borrowed from Dostoyevski'sCrime and Punishmenton the trail of a series of vile murders. When the wife and son of a doctor die after consuming a box of chocolates at their dacha, the obvious suspect is the morphine-addicted doctor. Then a shooting and a stabbing lead Petrovich elsewhere—to an elegant confectioner's full of pastries and possible revolutionaries as well as to the city's underworld. As Petrovich breaks in a new detective, the aptly named Pavel Virginsky, he introduces colleague and reader alike to the Russian capital and to the ills of the entire society. Morris captures this world with expert strokes, never content to merely peddle exotica, but making sure that his characters spring convincingly from their setting. While the person behind the crimes is a little unlikely, this novel stands out from a number of fine czarist-era mysteries—by Russians and foreigners alike—like a Fabergé egg at a yard sale.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It will definitely put your mind to work. As the author says \"Are You Ready\" I don't have a lot of time so when I read a book it has to be one that catches and KEEPS my attention. Tribulation did both of these things. I highly recommend it to all. Carol Welch --Review from Amazon.comI stayed up until 3:am because I couldn't stop reading this book. I got so caught up in the story that I forgot it was a work of fiction. It was like I was right there during all the happenings. I know some will be offended by this story, and that is so sad, because it follows along with what the Bible teaches us. I give James Edwin Branch 5 stars and I know he will be blessed for the message he sends out in this wonderful book. I could preach a whole sermon here, but I don't want to use up all the space, so all I'm going to say is PLEASE...READ THIS BOOK...you won't regret it --Author Mary H. CollinsI actually read this three times. I got it as part of a test market for it. I think the Author wanted to know if those of us that read it would find it offensive. The first time I read it I liked it and thought it was interesting at how it shaped the end of the world and the way we would have to deal with it. After I finished it I started looking at things in my daily life and decided to read it again. Too many things that are happening on the world stage are in the book. The second time through I saw the Love of Christ in the book and the struggle the characters went through. It would be a struggle to give up everthing you know and love. The last time I read through it I sat in my house and wondered if I could handle what is coming. I think this book might upset some people I found it inspiring. --Robin W.

Psychologists Apter (Altered Loves: Mothers and Daughters During Adolescence) and Josselson (Revising Herself) show that the important role of female friendships in fostering a sense of self has been largely ignored in studies. Drawing on academic research, interviews with girls and women from a variety of backgrounds and the expertise of school counselors, the authors examine how females negotiate relationships that can include difficult periods of possessiveness, unrealistic idealization, envy and conflict. They also describe the benefits these relationships provide, such as pleasure, comfort, support and the nonjudgmental ear of a close friend. Apter and Josselson argue that these positive aspects contribute to psychological growth, and they recommend honest communication as the best way to strengthen female friendship.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The daring will enter into the blessed mysteries of pagan antiquity. Unabashedly utopian, the author interprets current intellectual ferment surrounding chaos theory, the Gaia hypothesis, and aerodynamics as an auspicious sign. If humankind can recognize this world-historical moment, the true Trinity--Chaos, Gaia, and Eros--will once again cover the earth with peace and harmony.

Fortunately for Sarah, her estate manager, Will Pursley, offers his help, but what starts out as a working relationship between Sarah and Will gradually turns into something much more personal and much more satisfying for them both.

Like all good fiction, his stories are simply about the joys, the hopes and the sorrows of people...Townsend's genre-bending tales span geography, space and time, taking us from 19th-century Salt Lake City to late-21st century Kansas City, or from \"Spirit Prison\" to the U.N. where an alien has just arrived to explain that God does really live on the planet Kolob. For a lesser writer, this challenging range would press fiction into absurdity. But for Townsend--who has a bit of Philip K. Dick's blood flowing through his veins--it only adds to the richness and variety of his developing oeuvre. --Kirkus ReviewsThat's one of the reasons why I found Johnny Townsend's new book \"Mormon Fairy Tales\" SO MUCH FUN!! Without fretting about what the theology is supposed to be if it were pinned down, Townsend takes you on a voyage to explore the rich-but-undertapped imagination of Mormonism. I loved his portrait of spirit prison! He really nailed it--not in an official doctrine sort of way, but in a sort of \"if you know Mormonism, you know this is what it must be like\" way--and what a prison it is! But flights of fairy-tale fantasy aren't the only strength of Townsend's work. He also captures the feelings and personalities of a variety of people on the fringes, fitting their lives into Mormonism and Mormonism into their lives. Johnny Townsend has written at least ten books of Mormon stories. So far, I've read only two (\"Mormon Fairy Tales\" and \"The Circumcision of God\"), but I'm planning to read the rest--and you should too, if you'd like a fun and interesting new perspective on Mormons in life and imagination! --C.

When political satirist Steven Colbert celebrated the rise of \"truthiness,\" he called attention to an important pathology in our body politic. Over the past decade, it has become increasingly common and acceptable for public figures to boost whatever beliefs they feel will help their cause. Nowadays children mostly consume misleading and harmful information. We are poisoning their information environment as dangerously as sugary foods ruin nutrition and toxins pollute air, water, and soil. Societies sometimes organize to regulate or eliminate pollutants. Lead and mercury were used for centuries before they were largely outlawed. Over the last few decades, we began to limit smog-producing gases, acid-rain components, and asthma-inducing particulates in our air. Recently the entire world has been struggling with the fact that rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide lead to higher global temperatures that kill forests, wipe out glaciers, and inundate low-lying islands and coastal areas. These problems, and others, can't be solved unless our people understand the issues and wrestle with options.That requires operating on truth, not truthiness. However, society's most powerful players are addicted to lying and foment truthiness fever purposefully. This book lays out a 10-Step Program for recovery from that addiction. The need is vital, and we are very short on time.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After the First World War, however, he gave up legal work in favor of writing full time. He went on to complete some thirty books ranging from light-hearted farce to adventure thrillers. The Berry series established Yates’ reputation as a writer of witty, upper-crust romances, and he was also very successful with the thriller genre though the character Richard Chandos. As a consequence of his education and experience, Yates’ books encompass the genteel life—a nostalgic glimpse at Edwardian decadence and a number of swindling solicitors, and he regularly featured in bestseller lists and was greatly admired by both readers and fellow authors.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In Stand Alone or Come Home, Lon Fendall shows how Mark Hatfield s evangelical faith drove his political convictions.Hatfield understood that faith in Jesus Christ has implications beyond issues of personal behavior. Beliefs and actions that made him clearly both evangelical and progressive include:Consistent value of human life: He stood in opposition to war, capital punishment, abortion, euthanasia, and gun violence.Care for God s creation: He supported forestry research, timber management, and protection of water quality.Understanding of social justice: He worked toward ending racial discrimination and caring for the elderly, the poor, and the hungry in the United States and around the world.About the AuthorLon Fendall spent ten years on the staff of Senator Mark Hatfield. For 13 years Fendall was academic dean at Wilmington College, Tabor College, and George Fox University. He currently serves as director of the Center for Global Studies and the Center for Peace and Justice at George Fox University in Newberg, Oregon. He earned his Ph.D. in history from the University of Oregon.Mark A. Noll(Francis A. McAnaney professor of history, University of Notre Dame):Mark Hatfield was an important American politician for a very long time. Now in this well-documented book, Lon Fendall explores the moral and Christian principles that undergirded Hatfield s public career, and also shows how such principles might help others to engage in public service with higher ends in view.Richard J. Foster(founder of Renovare, and author of various books includingCelebration of Discipline):Mark Hatfield is one of the most significant political figures in recent memory...significant because he carved out in his day a creative path between the old options of conservative and liberal. Because Hatfield was at one and the same time a progressive in political thought and an evangelical in religious faith, he gives us today new ways of looking at the interface between politics and religion. The perspective of Mark Hatfield, as presented inStand Alone or Come Home, is vital to the contemporary political milieu.ReviewGerry Frank(former chief of staff to Senator Mark O. Hatfield):Having spent decades at Mark Hatfield s side, I know this statesman s character to the core. He, indeed, played a historical role in Oregon s and the nation s political well-being, and is a sorely missed example in today s acrimonious Congressional halls. All of his life, Mark Hatfield led his state and country by personal demonstration of faith in God and country. Lon Fendall has captured, in a superior manner, the spirit and the accomplishments of this talented public servant. ---Myron S. Augsburger(president emeritus and professor emeritus, Eastern Mennonite University):Stand Alone or Come Home, which presents Senator Mark O. Hatfield as a disciple of Jesus in the political arena, is a must-read for those who want to understand the role of Christian presence in government. Lon Fendall presents Senator Hatfield as a progressive evangelical whose mission was not to Christianize government but rather to bring a Christian understanding of issues into the governmental processes. He sought to be clear on justice and peace in treating all people with equity. From my association (as an inner-city pastor in D.C.), it was evident to me that Hatfield s walk as a disciple and his spirituality of relationship made a special impact on Capitol Hill. As a Mennonite and a pacifist, I am privileged to know and respect Senator Hatfield as my Christian brother.Stephen P. Hoffmann(R. Philip Loy professor of political science, Taylor University):A generation ago Mark Hatfield modeled Christian political engagement for evangelicals just beginning to think about how to relate faith to politics. Lon Fendall offers an insider s retrospective on a distinguished career in electoral politics. He makes a strong case that Hatfield is comparable to William Wilberforce as a progressive evangelical leader, while not hiding the dilemmas and criticisms Hatfield encountered as governor and senator. This book is a timely tool for reassessing the evangelical involvement in public life that has both reflected and contradicted Hatfield s example.Dr. John Perkins(founder of John M. Perkins Foundation for Reconciliation & Development):For more than 35 years Senator Hatfield has been a friend, mentor, and hero of mine. He was gracious enough to write the endorsement for my first book,Let Justice Roll Down. His life is a testimony and profile of courage, conviction, and integrity. He had the courage to stand alone as he made the difficult decisions, the right decisions. Everyone could learn from Senator Hatfield s life, and I pray that his example will inspire the next generation of leaders.Marie Rietmann(former staff to Senator Mark O. Hatfield; current lobbyist for Women s Action for New Directions [formerly Women s Action for Nuclear Disarmament]):An insightful and accurate portrait of a truly great leader who always endeavored to do the right thing in public policy. One especially important contribution in Senator Hatfield s vast political legacy is the moratorium on U.S. nuclear-weapons testing he achieved in 1992. The moratorium still stands today as the cornerstone of eventually ending the scourge of nuclear weapons worldwide. Many of us working to build on what Mark Hatfield started regard Hatfield as the founding father of progress on the issue we care about most ending nuclear testing and achieving nuclear disarmament.James W. Skillen(president, Center for Public Justice):Mark Hatfield was an unusual senator from what now seems like a bygone era. But he was simply ahead of his time a pro-life Republican who was more progressive on social justice and the environment than many Democrats today. Fendall s fine study introduces us to a statesman who fit no type, a Christian with a high view of public office. ---Timothy Sherratt(professor of political studies, Gordon College):Fendall does readers a service in pointing to a model for Christians in politics that is framed by the values of human stewardship, reconciliation, and basic human dignity. Hatfield s politics will make interesting reading for a new generation of evangelicals who may be unfamiliar with Hatfield but whose evangelicalism instinctively resembles his.Tom Getmanexecutive director international relations, World Vision International; Senator Mark O. Hatfield s legislative director 1978-1985):Every person who aspires to public service should own and use this handbook, which chronicles the humility and courage of a man who was unafraid to stand alone because his principles dictated his politics. Mark O. Hatfield, the modern-day William Wilberforce, is one of the most extraordinary elected officials of the 20th century. His story told by Lon Fendall inspires the reader to consider what American politics could again become.Joel C. Hunter(senior pastor, Northland; author ofA New Kind of Conservative):No matter what you thought of the stands Mark Hatfield took, our nation is richer for his public service. Viewing policy as a deeply moral endeavor and an expression of personal faith, and embracing the common good rather than the advancement of only one party is a pattern we all can follow. This book is an inspiration!Ronald J. Sider(president, Evangelicals for Social Action):Stand Alone or Come Homeis a significant book about one of the most courageous, biblically faithful, Christian politicians in American history. An important book for anyone interested in applying Christian faith to public life.Steve Monsma(research fellow, The Paul Henry Institute for the Study of Christianity and Politics, Calvin College):Readable, first-rate, inspiring. Lon Fendall tells the inspiring story of Mark Hatfield s career as Oregon s governor and U.S. senator, and of his courageous stands for what were at the time unpopular causes. He clearly shows how these stands--and his progressive approach to public policy issues, more broadly--grew directly out of his Christian commitment as an evangelical. Hatfield s inspiring story is one of Christian faith and commitment to principle overcoming political expediency. I highly recommend this book. ---", "related": [], "rank": 946187, "title": "Stand Alone or Come Home eBook", "author": "Lon Fendall", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

partly because,\nin the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because\nif I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately\nwithCaptain Vorpatril's Alliance) it would upwhack the numbering\nsystem. Nevertheless, the books and\nstories do have a chronological order, if not a strict one. It was always my intention to write each book as a\nstand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with\nthat book that's in your handright now, don't put it back on the\nshelf! While still somewhat true, as the\nseries developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that were\nricher for each other. I will list the\nsub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats. Shards of HonorandBarrayar. The first two books in the series proper,\nthey detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral\nVorkosigan of Barrayar. Shardswas my very first novel ever;Barrayarwas actually my eighth, but\ncontinues the tale the next day after the end ofShards. For readers who want to be sure of beginning\nat the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two. The Warrior's ApprenticeandThe Vor Game(with, perhaps, the novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" tucked in\nbetween.) The Warrior's Apprenticeintroduces the character who became the series' linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the\nfirst book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by accident; the second\nhow he fixed his mistakes from the first round.Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things\none can best discover for oneself),The Warrior's Apprenticemakes\nanother good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male\nprotagonist. After that:Brothers in Armsshould be read beforeMirror\nDance, and both, ideally, beforeMemory. Komarrmakes another good alternate entry point for\nthe series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read beforeA Civil Campaign. Borders of Infinity, a collection of three of the\nfive currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure\nsampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit\nthemselves to length. (But it may make\nmore sense if read afterThe Warrior's Apprentice.) Take care not to confuse the\ncollection-as-a-whole with its title story, \"The Borders of Infinity\". Falling Freetakes place 200\nyears earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with\nthe main body of the series. Most\nreaders recommend picking up this story later.It should likely be read beforeDiplomatic Immunity, however, which\nrevisits the \"quaddies\", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in Miles's\ntime. The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear\nin italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words\nand 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.  Falling FreeShards of HonorBarrayarThe Warrior's Apprentice\"The Mountains of Mourning\"\"Weatherman\"The Vor GameCetagandaEthan of AthosBorders of Infinity\"Labyrinth\"\"The Borders of Infinity\"Brothers in ArmsMirror DanceMemoryKomarrA Civil Campaign\"Winterfair Gifts\"Diplomatic ImmunityCaptain Vorpatril's AllianceCryoBurn                   Caveats: The novella \"Weatherman\" is an\nout-take from the beginning of the novelThe Vor Game. If you already haveThe Vor Game, you\nlikely don't need this. The original 'novel'Borders of\nInfinitywas a fix-up collection containing the three novellas \"The\nMountains of Mourning\", \"Labyrinth\", and \"The Borders of Infinity\", together\nwith a frame story to tie the pieces together.Again, beware duplication. The\nframe story does not stand alone, and mainly is of interest to completists.  The Fantasy Novels My fantasy novels are a bit easier\nto order. Easiest of all isThe\nSpirit Ring, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed\nbooks that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are the four volumes ofThe\nSharing Knife--in order,Beguilement,Legacy,Passage,\nandHorizon--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one\ncontinuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks. What have come to be called the\nChalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written,\nlike the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and\ncan in theory be read in any order. (The\nthird book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely\nconnected first two.) Some readers think\nthe world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in\npublication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the\nfirst (but not the third.) In any case,\nthe publication order is: The Curse of ChalionPaladin of SoulsThe Hallowed Hunt  The short story collectionProto\nZoawas an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three\n(1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but\nnot in this handy format. The novelette\n\"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" may be of interest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is\nthe first story in which that proto-universe began, mentioning Beta Colony but\nbefore Barrayar was even thought of.My latest original e-edition isSidelines: Talks and Essays, which is\njust what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of my nonfiction\nwritings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions,\nand some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove an interesting companion\npiece to my fiction.Happy reading!  -- Lois McMaster Bujold.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Upon her death in 1878, the townspeople of Pasadena, Calif., find the remains of her clothing infested with hundreds of large brown bugs. This legend, related in its first pages, presages the subsequent events of this dramatic novel, as these indefatigable creatures appear repeatedly both as a portent and final evidence of death. In his first English work, Mexican writer Morales eloquently fuses the fantastic and the factual as he traces the growth of early California from 1892 to the late 1940s. Within this broad scope, the book intimately focuses on the families behind the establishment and success of the booming Simons Brickyardthe rich American brothers Joseph and Walter Simons and the hundreds of Mexican immigrants who have fled a tyrannical regime and feudal hacienda system. The vivid clan of Octavio and Nana Revueltas and Octavio's many brothers illustrates both the increasing material comfort and spiritual discontent of the workers who realize that they have merely exchanged one brand of feudalism for another, namely the Simons's paternalism. In the hopeful but unsentimental novel, amid the red dust of the brickyards and periodic earthquakes of California, \"the place where paradise trembles,\" the Mexicans struggle to find acceptance and to claim their adopted land as their own.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hunted by vengeful KKK into a neglected cavern, Nathan passes through a waterfall into the vast, incredible subterranean world of Thuromest.  In hot pursuit of Nathan is the Klan leader and Aryan warlord Karl--but straightaway both have an even bigger villain to face: Krytor, a bat-winged devilish menace.  The only weapons foretold as able to foil Krytor are three mystic gems. Nathan happens to possess one of them, the Key of Knowledge.  While subtlety, especially in dialogue, is not Ballantyne's strong suit, he does deploy a few unexpected narrative twists and one or two moral ambiguities. The most obvious of the latter is the no-goodnik bully-racist Karl poised to redeem himself (or...will he?) in succeeding volumes of what is a planned trilogy. Action rarely lets up, and readers with a taste for retro-30s-style pulp adventures set in exotic hollow-earth worlds will be tunneling through the final 100 pages eagerly and looking forward to the next installment.Generous action and a nonpreachy but Scripture-compatible spirituality uplift this Tolkien-esque journey.Kirkus Indie, Kirkus Media LLC, 6411 Burleson Rd., Austin, TX 78744 indie@kirkusreviews.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As she puts it, “I was in church before I was born!” Her Nazarene parents’ search for a deeper relationship with God personally introduced them to several patriarchs of faith including, David Duplessis (Mr. Pentecost), Demos Shakarian, the founder of the Full Gospel and Businessmen’s Association. Jeanetta remembers watching her father speaking intently with Bro. Shakarian about the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. She was also privileged to meet Stanley Frodsham, who wrote the biography of Smith Wigglesworth. He was the editor of the Pentecostal Evangel magazine, spent a night in their home. When Witness Lee, brother of Watchman Nee was traveling in the United States, on one occasion he taught a Bible Study in her parent’s home. Also, in an encounter with the healing anointing of Oral Roberts which she describes in detail in her book, “God on Trial”, Jeanetta was cured of a terminal blood disorder, thus setting the stage for belief in the power of God to fill believers to overflowing and meet their needs – spirit, soul, and body.   At a critical point in her young adult life, she realized she would have to establish her own personal relationship with Jesus. Even though she was limited for a time by traditional religious ideas, she discovered that when she prayed God would answer and He had always been there for her. When she received the Baptism in the Holy Spirit her life was completely transformed as He guided her in a quest to know God personally.  Since that time, married to Tedd and mother to grown son Sean, she has continued to explore her capabilities. She is a graduate of Northwest Ministries School of the Bible, with an Associates degree in Theology. She sings with a crossover Gospel group called “Soul Bread”, and is a part-time chef at an exclusive ladies’ club in Medford, OR.  Since 1981 she has been submitted to the pastoral leadership of Arbee and Janie Freeman at Celebrate Jesus in Medford, Oregon. She is a prayer warrior, and gifted song-writer, singer/psalmist, and the Senior Editor of the Publishing Department.  Her personal experiences of God’s healing, provision, and love are a stunning testimony to the truth and power of God in the life of any believer who will take His Word at face value and settle for nothing less.", "related": [], "rank": 3966073, "title": "God on Trial: Is He a Healer or an Abuser?", "author": "Jeanetta Nipper", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Love 'em or hate 'em? Many readers love\nsequels because they're already invested in a world and its characters and want\nto see more and more. This is great for an author. Your readers are waiting\nwith bated breath for your next book and new readers are likely to want to buy\nthe previous books in the series.IFyou don't disappoint them! I'll bet you can think of several big name authors\nwhose series finally just ran out of steam. They keep writing but more and more\nreaders jump ship as they are expected to pay top prices for boring, badly\nwritten books. That's why many publishers don't want more than three books in a\nseries. The third book in myGenetic Attractionseries is calledDeceptive\nAttractionand it follows (chronologically)The Scientist and the SupermodelandGenetic\nAttraction. (You don't have to have read those other books to enjoy it\nand know what's happening.) Funny, I didn't start out to write a series. I\nwroteGenetic Attractionas a\nstand-alone book. But I was lucky enough to create some very compelling\ncharacters in that first book. Even I wanted to know why and how Jake and Roan,\nmy young scientist and supermodel, met and fell in love before they became a\nthreesome with Dr. Emmaline Silvay. So the prequel,The Scientist and the Supermodel, was born. In that book, up pops\nan amazing character -- Jake's younger brother, Caleb. Cal has some great\nscenes inThe Scientist and the\nSupermodeland suddenly he was crying out for his own book. Cal is the star\nofDeceptive\nAttraction,also a M/M/F ménage, but very different fromGenetic Attraction. My original trio\nappears importantly in this book, but Cal and his two lovers, a pretty boy and\na tomboy, are the central characters.Two things seem true to me about series. First, compulsion.\nWriting that next book should feel compelling and important. There need to be\ncharacters crying out to be heard and stories longing to be told. If the\nsequels are written just because it might sell more books, readers are going to\nknow and start to bail out. Second, new central characters are a pretty good\nidea. Trying to carry a series with one central character again and again is\nreally tough because the readers have no one else's point-of-view in which to\nbecome involved. Eventually, you know that lead character so well it can get\nboring. I wrotethe Scientist and the\nSupermodelfrom Jake's POV. Readers have begged to see the story through\nRoan's eyes, but I can't do that. The love story has been told. Their story is\ncomplete. They have their HEA and I won't mess with it. I don't like sequels in\nwhich complications are introduced to tear apart two lovers that you've already\nenjoyed getting together. I think it cheats the readers. Roan appears inDeceptive\nAttractionand there is a chance he will appear in yet another book,\nbut he will still be madly in love with his two scientists.Yes, it's true. There could be another book in theGenetic Attractionseries. There is a\ncharacter who is calling my name. Want to guess who it is? He's a minor figure\nin at least one of the books. I'll let you know if my publisher says yes!", "related": ["B00IO8HQ3O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.8571, "rating_total": 34.0}

Growing up in Miami Beach, Florida in a marbled-floor bayside estate Valery felt empty rather than enriched as a child. Wrapped in luxury with the country clubs and local high-profile parents she lost her sense of self, even her reason for being.  Her father, Dr. Michael Meyer Gilbert, was a world-renowned forensic neuro-psychiatrist - a playboy with a reputation for narcissism. Her artist Mother lived most of her life as a shadow of herself. Valery learned firsthand the paradox – and the emotional pain – that can come from life lived in the gilded cage. As an adult she became determined to transcend what Henry David Thoreau termed as “the life of quiet desperation” where one goes to the grave with the song still in them. Recognizing the restrictive impact upon her life as a result of her own problematic relationship with herself and money, Valery was determined to find a way out of her gilded caged life and inner angst. Through years of self-exploration, awareness and self-actualization she finally set her soul free. She experienced the joy and inner wealth that comes from an authentic life well lived, loved and appreciated. Her mission today is to teach others to do the same. Valery holds a Master Level Certification in Neuro-Linguistic Programming (CM.NLP), is a Certified CORE Multidimensional Awareness Facilitator (Emotional and Social Intelligence) and has a Certificate as a Sports Psychology Coach. As a scholar of the human condition, Valery continues a rigorous program of study in ongoing advanced level mindset transformational training. From personal experience, Valery knows what works and what doesn’t to achieve a sublime and extraordinary life, brilliantly expressed, enjoyed and valued from the inside out. Clients engage her for her wisdom, pay her for her heart’s conviction and trust her most when she shows up using both. Valery lives in Los Angeles, California, with her husband and two Zen Masters, both of them cats. Divinely comfortable in her own skin, she expresses today the intrepid essence of Auntie Mame, her childhood inspiration and the sublime reflection of her inner wealth. More importantly, she’s free – enjoying the satisfaction of significance using wisdom and wealth from the inside out.

Macionis was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He earned a bachelor’s degree from Cornell University and a doctorate in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania. John Macionis' publications are wide-ranging, focusing on community life in the United States, interpersonal intimacy in families, effective teaching, humor, new information technology, and the importance of global education. In addition, John Macionis and Nijole V. Benokraitis have edited the best-selling anthologySeeing Ourselves: Classic, Contemporary, and Cross-Cultural Readings in Sociology.Macionis and Vincent Parrillo have written the leading urban studies text,Cities and UrbanLife (Pearson). Macionis’ most recent textbook isSocial Problems(Pearson). John Macionis is Professor and Distinguished Scholar of Sociology at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, where he has taught for almost thirty years. During that time, he has chaired the Sociology Department, directed the college’s multidisciplinary program in humane studies, presided over the campus senate and the college’s faculty, and taught sociology to thousands of students. In 2002, the American Sociological Association presented Macionis with the Award for Distinguished Contributions to Teaching, citing his innovative use of global material as well as the introduction of new teaching technology in his textbooks. Professor Macionis has been active in academic programs in other countries, having traveled to some fifty nations. He writes, “I am an ambitious traveler, eager to learn and, through the texts, to share much of what I discover with students, many of whom know little about the rest of the world. For me, traveling and writing are all dimensions of teaching. First, and foremost, I am a teacher—a passion for teaching animates everything I do.” At Kenyon, Macionis teaches a number of courses, but his favorite class is Introduction to Sociology, which he offers every semester. He enjoys extensive contact with students and invites everyone enrolled in each of his classes to enjoy a home-cooked meal. The Macionis family—John, Amy, and children McLean and Whitney—live on a farm in rural Ohio. In his free time, Macionis enjoys tennis, swimming, hiking, and playing oldies rock-and-roll (he recently released his first CD). Macionis is as an environmental activist in the Lake George region of New York’s Adirondack Mountains, working with a number of organizations, including the Lake George Land Conservancy, where he serves as president of the board of trustees.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He bases his analysis on both primary and secondary sources, and the scope of the work as a whole is one of a region where violence built from one generation to the next. His research on the Balkan Wars (1912-13) is valuable, for while that series of conflicts has been told before, Mojzes (religious studies, Rosemont College) focuses on the killing between ethnic groups that is chilling and distinct from Great Power politics. From that point, it did not take much ignition from the Nazis to spark genocide in the region during WW II. Mojzes's discussion of the Jasenovac camps, both what the sources and the partisan politicians recount, is instructive. The author concludes with a glimpse into the genocide as Yugoslavia was breaking up, and the complexity of how to sort through such bestial killing both legally and morally. This study includes important details for scholars and students....Mojzes has written a study on which other scholars will be able to build. Summing Up: Recommended. Upper-division undergraduates and above.(CHOICE)The Balkan peninsula, with its crisscrossing mountain ranges, is divided into relatively small geographic regions and equally small religious and ethnic enclaves. Whenever the Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and, later, various Communist overlordships crumbled, the peoples of those divisions were free to have at each other throughout the last century. As Mojzes, a professor of religious studies at Rosemont College, indicates, the Balkans have earned “bragging rights” as a center of genocide and ethnic cleansing. Mojzes begins with a definition of terms, distinguishing between the often misunderstood differences between genocide and ethnic cleansing. He proceeds in a methodical, sometimes ponderous way to explain the causes and courses of these outrages while striving for fairness, since objectivity about such emotional issues may be impossible. Some of the events he reports, such as the cleansing and massacres during the breakup of Yugoslavia, will be familiar to most readers. Others, such as the mass expulsions and killings during the Balkan wars of 1912–13, are less well-known. A disturbing but important work about a still volatile region.(Booklist2011-10-15)With this book, Paul Mojzes has again put Eastern European scholarship in his debt....No other book offers such a thorough, careful, balanced treatment of the topic. The scholarship is sound: it is careful, even comprehensive (given the limitations of some sources), and as complete as could be hoped. This is the best book in the field. It is warmly recommended.(Religion in Eastern Europe)Author Paul Mojzes tests the application of the terms ‘genocide’, ‘ethnic cleansing’, and ‘holocaust’ to the twentieth-century history of South-eastern Europe. Mojzes is concerned about what he sees as the propensity for mass violence in the region in question, ‘if there were “bragging rights” for being a genocidal and ethnic cleansing area, the Balkans could claim championship status’, says Mojzes (p. 1). He looks for evidence of genocide and ethnic cleansing during the period of the Balkan wars at the beginning of the twentieth century (1912-1913) the Second World War (1941-1945), and the wars that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia at the end of the twentieth-century (1991-1999). . . To be sure, this is an important and worthwhile project.(H-Soz-u-Kult)Paul Mojzes is a well-informed and eminent historian of religion with a profound interest in the study of ethno-religion as the rationale for genocide. ... He offers his readers an excellent comprehensive and systematic, narrative of the horrific events that dominated the first and last decades of the previous century. ... His analysis and the interpretation of the different wars in the Balkans during the last century, and horrors they produces are very engaging. Mojzes' book adds greatly to our understanding of ethnic conflict and genocide. I highly recommendBalkan Genocidesto anyone interested in topics of ethnic cleansing, genocide, ethno-religious nationalism, ethno-religious warfare, and cultural vandalism.(Insight)Balkan Genocidessets out a history of conflict, mass violence, ethnic cleansing, and genocide in the Balkans throughout the Twentieth Century. It is an extremely useful text, providing an overview of such events during that period, and offers readers more of a contextual conception of conflicts in the region. . . .In writing this book, Mojzes is clearly driven by a passion for justice and truth — an acknowledgment of wrongs — as a way to move forward and attempt to clear the hostilities of the past. . . .Balkan Genocidesis a valuable contribution to the literature, and will be of use on the shelf of any scholar or practitioner in the fields of genocide studies, history, political science, international law, religion, socio-cultural anthropology, and sociology.(E-International Relations)In this long-awaited book Paul Mojzes finally puts in context and perspective the crimes of genocide in the Balkans in the troublesome twentieth century. Their pervasive and frequent occurrence and ubiquitous diffusion required an explanation beyond the existing isolated case studies, one-sided indictments and slanted accounts. Mojzes offers a new interpretation of the recent Balkan history informed by paradigms from genocide and holocaust studies. Its rich historical narrative is interspersed with theological and philosophical observations and personal reminiscences of a veteran Balkan scholar. I would recommend it to all who are puzzled by recent history of violence in the Balkans and unhappy about its shallow media coverage.(Bojan Aleksov, University College London)I have followed with much interest the continuing, careful, and highly-nuanced scholarship of Paul Mojzes regarding the genocides in the Balkan region, both historical and contemporary. His work is made all the more significant because of his familiarity with the languages of the region and his primary insight regarding ethnoreligion as the rationale for genocide in that under-explored area. As one concerned with the nexus between religion and genocide, I applaud Mojzes for this latest contribution and recommend it to the widest possible reading audience of all those concerned with this ongoing horror.(Steven Leonard Jacobs, Aaron Aronov Chair of Judaic Studies, University of Alabama)This book is both comprehensive and even-handed. It stands out as preeminent over everything written on the subject of genocide in southeastern Europe to date. It is, unquestionably, the premiere work in the field, without a doubt the best.(James Payton, professor of history, Redeemer University College)This is an extremely important book, which has no rival in print. It systematically covers all regions and puts late 20th century events in a much larger historical field. It is unflinching in its consideration of the parties involved and treats all victims with consistent empathy.(Christopher P. Parr, professor of religious studies, Webster University)As the Founding Director of the Master of Arts Program in Holocaust and Genocide Studies,Balkan Genocides: Holocaust and Ethnic Cleansing in the 20th Centuryis exactly the book for which I have been searching. There has not existed such a comprehensive, user friendly volume in this subject area. Professor Mojzes, a world authority on the history, political and sociological implications of the Balkans, provides precise scholarship, in a readable manner reflecting his many decades of research, scholarship and personal experience in that region of the world.(Marcia Sachs Littell, Richard Stockton College of NJ)Mojzes' comprehensive, systematic and well documented book shows how the Balkans in the 20th century finally became an integral part of modern Europe, shaped by the exclusivistic nation-state principle: a bunch of small, monoethnic, irredentistic states, of hostile neighbours instead of friendly and cooperative nations. This was achieved with the same horrific methods as elsewhere, whatever they are called: genocide, mass killings, or ethnic cleansing. All these were not caused by some ancient hatreds, ethnic and religious differences, irreconcilable national characters, or irrational mentality, but by a deliberate, well planned, and ruthlessly executed power politics. Mojzes' is not only a punctilious study of bloody episodes of the last century in the Balkans, but also a convincing warning from the recent past, what mistakes must not be repeated in the future, at all costs.

Whilst gifted  academically and musically, she was not encouraged to  further her  talents by attending university, and instead joined the  civil service  in Scotland as an assistant press officer. In 1946, she  married  Alastair Dunnett, who was at the time the chief press officer to  the  Secretary of State for Scotland. He went on to become editor of The   Scotsman newspaper, whilst she later worked on a statistics handbook   for the Board of Trade. After a brief spell in Glasgow, the couple   settled in Edinburgh where their home became a centre for hospitality   and entertaining, mostly in support of Scottish art and culture. Dunnett   had also taken evening classes at the Edinburgh College of Art and the   Glasgow School of Art, and from 1950 onwards she established a  prominent  career as a portrait painter, being exhibited at both the  Royal  Scottish Academy and the Royal Academy. She was also an  accomplished  sculptress. Her interest in writing developed during the  1950's. Her own  tastes took her to historical novels and it was her  husband who  eventually suggested she write one of her own, after she  had complained  of running out of reading material. The result was The  Game of Kings, an  account of political and military turmoil in  sixteenth-century  Scotland. Whilst turned down for publication in the  UK, it was  eventually published in the USA where it became an instant  best seller.  Other titles, such as the Lymond Chronicles and House of  Niccolo series  followed and which established her international  reputation. She also  successfully turned her hand to crime, with the  Johnson Johnson series.  He is an eccentric artist, famous for bifocals,  and of course amateur  detective. All of the titles in the series  somehow also feature the  yacht 'Dolly', despite ranging widely in  location from Scotland, to  Ibiza, Rome, Marrakesh, Canada, Yugoslavia,  Madeira and The Bahamas.  There is plenty of sailing lore for the  enthusiast, but not so much it  detracts from the stories genre; crime.  Each of them is told by a woman  whose profession explains her role in  the mystery and we learn very  little about Johnson himself, save for  the fact he is somewhat  dishevelled in appearance.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Then to find that there were numerous other stories....and that Clive was still alive and writing more...wonderful!

Most readers know me as the author of the \"Weddings by Bella\" series from Revell Publishing. Long before I penned that comedic series, I spent my days writing traditional inspirational romances like the one you will find in the Texas Weddings collection. These aren't as laugh-outloud funny as the Bella books, (and were never meant to be), but I truly believe the stories will inspire and uplift you! Why so many wedding-themed books, you ask? Well, if you've followed my publishing career for any length of time, you know that I'm the mother of four daughters. All four of them got married within four years of each other. Wowza! What blissful chaos! Many of our adventures became fodder for my wedding-themed books, which is why you see so many of them from me! Oh, and the whole \"Texas\" thing. . .well, that's a given! I'm a Texas girl through and through, y'all. I've lived in the Houston area most of my life. So, hats off to Texas. . .and hats off to weddings!", "related": ["B00KG252XM"], "rank": 731794, "title": "Texas Weddings (Books One and Two): A Class of Her Own & A Chorus of One", "author": "Janice Thompson", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 14, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 63.0}

I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories about knights, fey and a good old fantasy novel.\"Paranormal Romance Guild Review Team5 STARS, Reviewed by Danita Dyess for Readers' Favorite\"The False Gwenevere\" was a great fantasy novel with careful attention to detail. Shanken's impressive background in Ancient Religions and Arthurian legends was apparent. I loved the vivid descriptions of the scenery that incited all of your senses. I succumbed to the metaphysical elements of fantasy; I was transported to another time and place. Lancelot's philosophical quotes sprinkled throughout the book was thought provoking and comical. Even the sex scenes were artistic.  This book is highly recommended. Bravo!5 STAR REVIEW by Maria Beltran for Readers' FavoriteSuzanne Shanken is a gifted writer. Although I am already familiar with most of the characters here, she is able to enrich them in a way that is refreshing as well as exciting. Lancelot and Gaenor are the leading characters in this story and this gives a fresh take on the old legend that most people are familiar with. And as fairy tales go, this one has a happy ending with a twist that I certainly did not expect. Based largely on the ancient Celtic story of King Arthur,The False Gwenevere still manages to come out as an original.5 STAR REVIEW by Gayani Hathurusingha for Readers Favorite The plot of The False Gwenewere keeps the reader keenly interested through its authentic portrayal of a fantasy world which is far from being typical. The narration is extremely creative and it inspires vivid imagination akin to the epic world it portrays. A reader may find it difficult to disclaim his or her admiration of both the epic hero and heroine, as they are characterized as iconic figures. The novel never tires the reader as it contains such variety, fantasy and much to anticipate.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The Prologue description in my novel is pretty much as I remember the old house, editorially composited along with some fine old antebellum mansions with which I became acquainted while stationed at Barksdale AFB in Bossier City, Louisiana.  Sometime in the 1960's The Dallas Times Herald published a Sunday supplement featuring a full page photo of the old three story mansion starkly silhouetted against brooding gray storm clouds blowing off the cold Texas prairie.  Written in ghostly white letters across the top of the photo was the title \"Ghosts of Gross Road\".  The article described the mansion and history of Zachariah Motley and his family.It was rumored to be haunted because lights were often seen in the windows of the old mansion at night.  Young people would drive out on lonely Gross Road and park their cars next to the family cemetery for romantic escapades; the young men \"protecting\" their dates from the ghosts and goblins of Motley Mansion.   They would see flickering lights in the windows and hightail it off back into town, claiming they had seen ghosts.  It turns out the lights and noises were from the old caretaker who resided on the property, going about his rounds at night with his flashlight.  He was a relative of one of my equestrian friends, and he invited us inside the old mansion a few times.  I remember how dark and forbidding it seemed.  There were rumors of hidden passages and secret rooms.  Taken altogether, it was a spectacularly creepy old house, especially at night.It burned down to the ground sometime about 1970 in a fire allegedly set by vandals. The property was eventually donated by the Motley family to Dallas County, later to become the campus of Eastfield Community College.  The family cemetery was the only thing kept intact, and is found on the college campus today.  Descendents of the prominent Motley family still reside in and around Mesquite, Texas.", "related": ["B00KUT22PW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.8333, "rating_total": 23.0}

It was an American author friend who suggested that Lizzie turned her hand to writing, so she did, drawing a great deal on her mother's history; her mother was also a great story teller, plus she'd always had a great love of history, books and anything that stirred the imagination. Lizzie currently lives with her husband on a 46ft sailing yacht, dividing her time between Bath and the Med.

Katrina has a friend in whom she can confide and she realizes that her life does not have to be how it is; however, it is scary to make changes and requires a great amount of courage. Katrina's story is interspersed with scriptures throughout and this book can be very encouraging for someone who is in a similar situation to Katrina.", "related": [], "rank": 4181751, "title": "Lights, Camera, Mine!: A Short Story", "author": "Dominique Wilkins", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The verdicts don't flinch with failed treatments occasionally resulting in death (AIDS in Infected Tick and rabies in Rusty Nail. \"You Solve the Case\" scenarios use guiding questions to help readers solve medical mysteries on their own-though answers are included in the back of the books. Despite some inconsistencies, odd language choices, and typos, this set is exciting and informative.

This 3rd novel is a brand new novel idea that was developed from Sara realizing that the original 3rd novel had a 20 year leap from the 2nd novel. Sara realized that at least 3 novels needed to be written prior to that original 3rd novel so the development of the Karmikell Trilogies was from listening to a variety of songs. She doesn't write ordinary romance so she calls it mainstream adult fiction which is not erotica but still is not for those under 18. Writing is an obsessive emotional outlet that Sara uses to relieve stress. Sara's characters are developed from many people within her life. These characters come to life as the author develops an understanding of individuals and feed off of many attitudes, body language, and responses of those around her. She realizes that this gift of visionary creativity has been handed to her from the Lord above. She truly hopes you enjoyed reading You Are as she works on her next novel The Karmikell Trilogy 2: Cater 2 U My website: http://www.sarasknox.com Facebook Fan Page: www.facebook.com/sarasknox", "related": ["B00KBX5RB8"], "rank": 2297130, "title": "You Are (The Karmikell Trilogy Book 1)", "author": "Sara S.

As they say, some things never change. Now, as an adult, she divides her time between the sexy law men, mythical creatures, and kick-ass heroines that live inside her head and pursuing her bachelor’s degree in English. As it is for most writers, finding balance is a challenge. JC is a San Francisco Bay Area native, but has also called both Texas and Louisiana home. She was born to a pair of crazy amazing parents whom she often draws inspiration from and who have supported her no matter how flighty her ambitions may be. She is blessed with a sister, eleven years her junior, who she also calls her friend. With the support and encouragement of her parents behind her, JC set out to figure out what she wanted to do when she grew up. Most days, the jury is still out; but the thing that stuck with her no matter what she pursued was her love of the written word. JC writes adult, new adult, and young adult fiction. She dabbles in many different genres including science fiction, horror, chick lit, and murder mysteries; but she is most enthralled by supernatural stories-- and everything has at least a splash of romance.", "related": ["B00B8CKHRK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.2727, "rating_total": 47.0}

According to Gupte, a columnist for International Newsweek who was born and raised in India, Gandhi substituted vague socialist \"mantras\" for concerted economic transformation and looked the other way when her close associates engaged in wholesale corruption. Her \"paranoid attachment to power\" is held responsible for the fissure in 1969 of her Congress Party, which led to the disintegration of secular, centralist politics in India. Blending lively firsthand reportage with astute political analysis, Gupte draws up a useful scorecard of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty's missed opportunities for increasing productivity, distributing income and trimming a gargantuan bureaucracy. The book is also critical of Rajiv Gandhi's vacillating reign hobbled by corruption and maladministration.

As a teenager, she had several short stories published in literary magazines.  She completed writing her first novel at the age of 17.   Hadena graduated from the University of Missouri with a degree in European History with minors in German and Russian studies.  She has always wanted to be a writer so she also took several classes in creative writing. Hadena’s primary literary genre is action/thriller.  She currently writes two series, both use action/thriller.  “The Brenna Strachan Series” uses fantasy and the “Dreams & Reality Series” uses murder mystery as its secondary genre.  She continues to explore and expand her writing and hopes to soon produce a comedic action/thriller.  When she isn’t busy writing or running her business, Hadena enjoys playing in a steel-tip dart league.  She also loves to travel throughout North America and Europe. Her favorite cities are Chicago, Illinois and Berlin, Germany.  She is an avid reader, reading everything from the classics like Jane Austen to modern writers like Terry Pratchett.  One of her all-time favorite books is “Good Omens” by Neil Gaimen and Terry Pratchett.  She writes all of her books while listening to music and the bands tend to get “honorable mentions” within the pages. http://www.facebook.com/hadenajames hadenajames.wordpress.com", "related": [], "rank": 962978, "title": "The Dysfunctional Proposal (The Dysfunctional Chronicles Book 4)", "author": "Hadena James", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 25.0}

My tutor who was also trying to get a children's book published said I'd get there before him. He was a great tutor.Now , having spent time working in children's homes and with disenfranchised and special needs children I love telling the stories which will inspire children to read. First with and adult's encouragement and eventually by themselves. I think children love dialogue, playful and expressive characters and vibrant colours. They also have an acute eye for details and when I worked in schools were the first to spot if I lost an earing despite my long hair. I have tried to incorporate all these factors in my books plus a positive caring attitude towards other people which most children share automatically but a few need reminding of now and then.Children are my worst critics but also my most devoted ones and I will continue to write books for their enjoyment, since their delight is the greatest motivation any writer can have.Yours Viv", "related": ["B00AXXPN1U"], "rank": 2801038, "title": "Marianne the Mermaid (Book 5) - Mermaid's Magic", "author": "Viv Rosser", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Middle grades and high school principals serving in low-performing, challenging schools will gain great wisdom and insight for creating a high-touch, high-performance culture for students and teachers that will result in improved outcomes in attendance, performance, and student engagement. This book provides a vision for making parents a partner in the process, celebrating student and faculty growth experiences, and building healthy competition.\"(Dr. Gene Bottoms, Founder/Director)\"I’m in the Principal’s Seat, Now What?by Dr. Allan Bonilla is the kind of book that appears once in a decade. Bonilla became the principal of a large, failing school in Dade County, Florida, succeeded in turning the school into an exemplary school, remained in that school for fourteen years, and tells his story through evidence-based examples of team building, school culture, principal visibility and so much more. This book will appeal to any school administrator interested in leadership and practical options for helping a failing school become better to making a gifted school better and anything in between. It is destined to become a landmark book.\"(Mark F. Goldberg, Ph.D., Education Writer and Education Book Editor)\"In this immensely practical and powerful book, Dr. Allan Bonilla avoids the typical slogans about school culture and instead provides readers with the hard truths of leadership.  Although Bonilla is a successful turnaround school leader, this book is valuable for leaders of high-performing schools as well as those in need of significant change.  Moreover, both new and experienced leaders will benefit from the relentless emphasis on human connections in these pages.  I particularly appreciate the author's iconoclastic approach to leadership visibility, as he demonstrates that visibility in the lunchroom, hallways, and sidewalks is as important as visibility in the classroom.  Looking through the eyes of the student, Bonilla appeals to leaders to make a human connection, preferring relationships over checklists and impact over appearances.  Finally, this book provides an impressive mandate for the support of elective subjects, including arts and athletics, to save students from academic failure.  Bonilla poignantly reminds us that electives are not a competitor for academic achievement, but a necessary support for them.  The \"afterthoughts and reflections\" at the end of each chapter make this an ideal book for faculty book studies. I hope that it will generate vigorous discussions, constructive controversy, and as the author suggests, a few tears, all in the pursuit of a better understanding of helping our students.\"(Dr. Douglas Reeves)\"This book is sure to be a must-have for every beginning and experienced principal. With Allan's experience as a successful principal in a struggling school, combined with his knowledge of leadership coaching, readers will gain inspiration and solid strategies to be equally successful.\"(Karla Reiss, President)“As a veteran of twenty-one years in the principalship, I recommend this work to new and even seasoned principals who wish to continue to grow professional.  This is a thought-provoking work- one from which we can all learn.”(David G. Daniels, Principal)“I’m in the Principal’s Seat, Now What? provides a realistic, relevant view of how to be a principal in a changing environment.  The power of the ideas and strategies is seen in the success of the school!  This book is a must read for those studying to be a principal or newly placed in a principalship.”(Dr. Elizabeth J. Lolli, Superintendent)\"I'm In the Principal's Seat, Now What?is a structured recipe for what matters most in school turnaround. The significant strategies are a visual road map for leading change and providing a quality education and high achievement for all students.\"(Suzanne Link Gimenez, Retired School Turnaround Principal)\"It has been a privilege and pleasure over the past two years to listen to Allan as he shared with me his dream of writing a book that would assist in the transformation of low-performing schools. I quickly realized how much value this book would be to leaders of the many low-performing schools I was visiting as a turnaround consultant. I look forward to recommending this book to all my clients!\"(Mike Cave, MEd, School Turnaround Specialist and Certified Educational Leadership Coach)\"I'm in the Principal's Seat, Now What?is a practical, yet powerful book that provides valuable insight into time-tested principles needed to turnaround any institution of learning. This back-to-basics book is designed to help school leaders create a culture of academic excellence.\"(Eric Acosta, Ed.S., Principal)\"As a rookie administrator, I was placed under the supervision of Dr. Bonilla. I quickly learned that creating a positive culture, establishing a mission of academic success, and being visible are essential keys to being an effective school leader. Dr. Bonilla uses simple and pragmatic approaches to organizational leadership that promotes universal buy-in from all stakeholders. His experience and on-the-job strategies should be a guide for all school and/or district administrators.\"(Manuel Ferrer, Ed.D.)\"In his bookI’m in the Principal’s Seat, Now What?,Dr. Allan Bonilla has done a masterful job of depicting responsibilities and duties that a school principal faces on a daily basis in the performance of his or her duties. I consider this book a “must read” for every aspiring school principal who wishes to gain an insight into the role that he or she will play as a school principal.\"(Dr. Ada B. Hernandez, Retired Principal)\"For ten years I've had the personal and professional gratification of closely and enthusiastically observing Dr. Allan Bonilla \"walk the talk\" and \"be in the Principal's seat\" at Palm Springs Middle School in Miami. As his consultant on instruction, curriculum, and student learning, his leadership engendered one of the most exciting and productive learning communities I've encountered as a consultant, teacher, leader, and professor. This book,I'm in the Principal's Seat, Now What?is a 'must-resource' for every serious school leader!\"(Dr. Clint Bunke, President)\"'If you talk the talk, then you must walk the walk.' Dr. Allan Bonilla is one prime example of an administrator who did just that in turning around a school that was at the lower rungs of a ladder and elevated the staff and students through the prescription he set forth. The triad of relationships, collaboration, and team building are the key ingredients to changing a school's culture. Allan orchestrated and coordinated the faculty, the staff, and all of the stakeholders so the students could achieve their best. His plan was carried out daily by being visible throughout the day (morning, afternoons, evenings, & weekends) to parents, teachers, students, community leaders and this was accomplished before me as one of Dr. Bonilla's assistant principals. It is a prescription that will work at any school, any business, or at place where \"teamwork\" is the key to success. The principles Allan sets forth are the key ingredients for success in any setting where people working together can achieve anything if they work as a team. I, for one, am proud to have been a part of the success that Dr. Allan Bonilla achieved through his vision many years before this educational trend came into being.\"(Howard Popowitz, Retired Administrator)\"I’m in the Principal’s Seat, Now What? is a must read for all current and aspiring school site administrators. The book focuses on developing and implementing effective strategies that will transform schools from ordinary to exemplary learning institutions. The book was authored by Dr. Allan Bonilla who distinguished himself serving as Principal of one of the district's most challenging schools. Dr. Bonilla is recognized as an effective Principal, having received the Principal of the Year distinction from the nation's fourth largest school district.\"(Delio G. Diaz, Executive Director)\"Dr. Bonilla's book is a true and refreshing account and how-to guide. His extensive experience and knowledge result in a powerful combination that guarantees achievement and educational excellence.\"(Martha Montiel, Administrative Director)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And it seems that she's always searching for new ways to become even thriftier. Angela lives in a beautiful home on a half acre of land in a small role community almost 70 miles away from the nearest town with public transportation. She spends her time in her quiet abode figuring out ways to save money and writing books about her spartan lifestyle. For someone with such a public persona you would think she would want to live a little closer to civilization. But Angela says she actually loves her life the way it is. \"Living in a small town is great for my writing and my budget. Before my husband and I moved to our home, we did a little looking around first. Just 20 miles from where we live, in a slightly larger town with more shopping and entertainment, our house would cost twice as much with only a postage stamp size yard.\" While not bestsellers, Angela's books about her practical, day-to-day life enjoy steady sales. After all, who doesn't want to learn about managing household and saving money? More than one reader has written her to say how much of an inspiration she has been to their quest to live better and more practical life. Angela says that the key to the frugal lifestyle is to involve the entire family. It's important that your spouse be on board, and that you teach your children the importance of conserving their resources and saving money from an early age. Although Angela has been a penny pincher from birth, that's not the case for her husband. She carried her miserly ways into her marriage, and though they never earned big salaries they live debt-free and have even managed to squirrel away a sizable nest egg. She considers herself a savvy consumer who doesn't waste her time, energy, or money on nonessentials. She says that being in control of her finances puts her in control of her life. Now who can argue with that?", "related": ["B00HQKOQBG"], "rank": 4147963, "title": "Frugal Living", "author": "Angela Pierce", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As much as mothers deny the ``unhappiness at being born female in a world that prefers males,'' daughters pick up the signals. Faced with dishonesty, they turn to food to numb the truth that the Inner Self always tells. Healing, in Hollis's approach, does not mean blaming the mother or digging through the past for clues to why women are the way they are today. Instead, she promotes the Twelve-Step approach. She asks women to carefully moderate food consumption, to stop using food as a sedative, to seek the support of a sponsor who's had an eating disorder herself, and to begin the self-exploration necessary for self-acceptance, letting go, and rebirth. This book does not pretend that it can heal women all by itself. But it does offer the true stories of women's journeys; it directs women to outside help (including, conveniently, the Hollis Institute, of which the author is the clinical director); and it provides endless writing exercises to promote self-awareness. Interestingly, accepting-mother/accepting- self doesn't always end in a loving relationship; for some women it means realizing that their mothers just don't like them--not a bad thing, just the truth. Hollis offers the usual self-help lingo, realistically, if sometimes simplistically, examining issues of power and gender to offer a slightly different approach to eating disorders.

As a child her eyes were filled with wonder and inquisition as she searched for answers to questions that most never thought to ask.  Dubbed an old soul at the young age of twelve, Jasmynne always had a heart for others and dreamt of becoming a physician so that she could help heal the hurting.  But it was the first nutrition course she took in college that became fuel to the fire that was burning inside her, and it changed her path forever.  As a result, she has been a certified Nutritionist and Wellness Coach since 2001.  Through her company, Day One Nutrition, she has helped scores of individuals achieve their wellness goals by applying principles that she also uses herself.  Even still, it wasn’t until she relocated from North Carolina to Los Angeles that she got a glimpse of how far her helping hands could actually reach. In 2009 she made the bold decision to share her personal story of trial and triumph with the world through her autobiographical one woman show, Stepping On a Few Toes.  The show details hurts, pains and dark skeletons in her closet that would bring shame to most.  By courageously sharing her secrets, Jasmynne was unintentionally helping audience members fight their personal battles—and win.  It was then that she got a better understanding of how important her voice is and the kind of hurt she was put on this earth to heal.   Jasmynne prides herself in walking the walk as she’s personally dealt with abuse, depression, lack of confidence, and obesity; and she truly believes everyone has the power to overcome any obstacle thrown at them no matter its size.  And that’s the Jasmynne Shaye difference.  She is a person that has been there, battled demons, and won the war.  After a single conversation with her you know she is different and you know she cares.  She genuinely enjoys helping her clients tap into the goodness that lies within them as she takes an individual approach to helping them straighten the crooked roads they’ve been traveling.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It wasn’t long before she was flown from New York City to L.A. to shoot a television pilot. The pilot wasn’t picked up, but she quickly began guest-starring on such shows as “Seinfeld”, “Larry Sanders Show” and “Beverly Hills 20210.”  Then, in 2009, she decided it was time to integrate her love of cooking with her acting and wrote her one-woman food musical, “Cookin’ With A Right Smart Of Love.” When she work-shopped the production, so many people requested the recipes that she decided to write her own cookbook, and her first colorful cookbook by the show’s title was born.  Before she could even get her musical on it’s feet, the culinary director at Williams-Sonoma in Beverly Hills read her cookbook, loved it and asked Bobbi Jo if she would teach a series of cooking classes. She agreed and her classes sold-out. “My students began to refer to me as their Skillet Diva !” says Bobbi Jo.  She was a regular “guest chef” on E! Network and has just completed “The Skillet Diva Cookbook” with over 100 delicious recipes, color pictures and delightful stories. Please visit her website www.bobbijolathan.com or her facebook page  www.facebook.com/theskilletdiva . .Reviews For Bobbi Jo’s Cookbook: “ I believe that food is fun, food is entertainment, and food is theater. So does Bobbi Jo, and her new book proves it. Each recipe is right in line with the Chinese concept of “sik, heung, mei”:  appearance, aroma, taste. Bobbi Jo has written her cookbook with a passion for food and family that’s entertaining and irresistible. Keep wokking!” Martin Yan – “Yan Can Cook Show”   “With my own flair for ‘over the top’, I can tell you that Bobbi Jo is a hoot! Can folklore, humor and cooking live in the same pot? Bobbi Jo succeeds in making lip-smacking humor at the expense of a drumstick!” Christopher Lowell- “The Christopher Lowell Show”", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I came to Washington, DC, bought an Apple II Plus computer and learned how to program. In my first job out of college, I did economic consulting for clients such as the CIA, World Bank, IMF and the State Department. I only had one job out of college before starting my own business. I got a masters from John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) in Global Theory and History. After graduation, I backpacked around the world for a year and visited over 50 countries. When I returned, I started a software company named Gnossos Software. Gnossos Software was a database CRM software product company. I grew Gnossos Software to a few million in revenue and sold the company in 2004. I took a year off in 2005 and came up with 100 business ideas. In 2006, I started a few of them under the name Lifebushido. Lifebushido is focused on building a global network of people, working part-time from home, with flexible hours, using their unique talents. We have business, creative and social entrepreneurial ventures. We are global and 100 percent virtual. We have more than 100 staff members who all work part-time and refer to themselves as Ishidos. Our fantastic team provides part-time, virtual assistant and calling services to small business entrepreneurs with $100,000 to $10M in revenue per year. Best Agent Business is the primary revenue and funding source for Lifebushido ventures. Best Agent Business provides services to top real estate agents. Our target market is agents above $100,000 in GCI. In 2006, when I started Best Agent Business, I realized that out of 1,000,000 real estate agents, probably only a few hundred had sold over $1B in real estate in their career. We started to track down those people. I reached out and interviewed over 70 top agents and coaches and we published Billion Dollar Agent - Lessons Learned. Billion Dollar Agent was well-received by top agents and we continued to do research, and fund the research, with revenue from Best Agent Business. In short, Best Agent Business tests the business model theories from Billion Dollar Agent. It all works together smoothly. In the five years since publishing Billion Dollar Agent - Lessons Learned, we have conducted interviews with over 1,000 agents, completed over $1,000,000 worth of customer-driven research, built our Billion Dollar Agent Team to over 100 part-time assistants and callers from over 5,000 job applicants and worked with over 100 top agents as clients of Best Agent Business. We have over 1,000 pages of solid systems that we use to run Database Management, Lead Management, Marketing, Listing Management, Closing Management, Accounting, Calling, Agent Management, Agent Recruiting and Life Management teams. As Best Agent Business has grown, I have had over 1,000 30-minute phone call sessions with top agents doing over $100,000 in GCI. Detailed notes have been made during every single call. These notes have been fed back into our knowledge base and systems. We map out the patterns we see across different segments of the industry. Given the real estate crash in recent years, we delayed the next edition of Billion Dollar Agent because it would have been distorted by the crash, surge in REO and short sale business. For Billion Dollar Agent Manifesto, we decided to focus on agents doing more than $1,000,000 in GCI per year. We estimate this number to be less than 1,000 across the country or one in 1,000 agents. Since $1M in GCI is roughly $40 million in sales volume, someone doing those numbers for 20 to 30 years will get to one billion in closed sales volume for their career.", "related": ["B00HQOK0G2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Writing her own stories became inevitable, though they've taken many forms. The unspoken tales in her head, the adventures explored and told through role-playing games, a vast array of fiction (even, shockingly, fanfiction) which made its way to the internet over the years. Some of this she'll even own to writing, but 'Ragnarok' is the first story she'll call an actual book and send out to public eyes under her own name.", "related": [], "rank": 29468, "title": "Ragnarok (The Echo Case Files) eBook", "author": "C.S.

I've been writing adult oriented smut for some time but have just started to actually publish my work. For more detailed descriptions of my books, visit my blog at larryarcher.wordpress.comI have a number of stories that are in the pipeline and I'll release them as finished. I'm actively working on 15-20 stories so check back if you enjoy my work. The best thing is to sign up to receive an email notice of new books or check my blog.One of my failings is that often we get involved in a situation that spawns an idea for a new story so I will typically start writing the story so I don't forget the story line. This causes me to have a bunch of books that are partially complete and then I have to force myself to focus on a couple and get them out the door.Writing adult-themed (erotica) stories using situations we've been in as a base was a natural for me. I have a vivid imagination and find it easy to start with a scenario and develop that into a story. We travel a lot and have met numerous couples across the country, which provides me with more fodder for my tales.Now having said all those things, I need to offer a \"Don't try this at home.\" clause. The Lifestyle is not for everyone and nothing I say should be construed to mean that I want you and your spouse to try this. Every sport you undertake has certain risks and benefits. Just because it is right for someone else doesn't mean that it is right for you. I will not be responsible for any action that you take or the results from such action based upon anything I write or say. This is a grown up activity and as an adult, you are responsible and not the author.

I know it can sound strange but sometimes I feel writers who write about journeys and dreams can get a little too detailed. I don't want to go on for chapters about one or two small dreams; Patricia Leslie, however, does not do this and finds a fantastic balance. The book will appeal to a variety of readers, young adults and adults. I would highly recommend this read for anyone who enjoys the genre; you will not be disappointed.(Reviewed By Kathryn Bennett forReaders' Favorite)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her account is as captivating as a thriller, but unlike a thriller it is morally compelling. What elevates it to the ranks of the finest books is the skill of its author and the selfless urgency of her appeal. Many a prize has been awarded to books not half as deserving.” — Mark Helprin, Author of Winter’s Tale and A Soldier of the Great War“Escape from North Korea should be assigned reading for anyone—policymaker, academic, or journalist alike—who think they know anything about the Kim family dictatorship.  Melanie Kirkpatrick shows how “the new Underground Railroad” is not only providing an escape route from the prison camp that is North Korea, but something even more important as well.  She shows how that escape route, aided and expanded, can bring down North Korea’s despotic regime and free its entire people.  Kirkpatrick combines exhaustive reporting with insightful analysis in a powerful and compelling tale of repression and freedom.” — John R. Bolton, Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations“A riveting, meticulously researched account of the harrowing journey North Koreans must take to reach freedom. Kirkpatrick describes in detail the secret network of safe houses, transit routes and brokers that have emerged in China and other countries to enable North Koreans to escape. Similar to the Underground Railroad in the United States that liberated slaves, the network achieves inspiring successes and tragic failures. The book will interest both the general public and serve as a powerful tool for policymakers, academics and advocates interested in lending support to one of the world’s most persecuted people.” — Roberta Cohen, Co-chair of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

KILLER COUSINS and DEADLY REUNION, the second and third books in that series, well also well reviewed.  Her suspense, APPROACHING MENACE, is set in Florida during hurricane season, a season that Shaw knows well living in south Louisiana. Including a little brother who's severely ill in this story adds to the love and compassion of the main character--and what she will risk to save the young boy. Shaw writes INSTRUCTIONS FOR LOVE, a sweet romance set on a contemporary plantation. In it, North and South clash as never before--and need to learn how to let their defenses down and love again. Ms. Shaw has written other books, including the delightful HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR PET GHOST, which she's written with her granddaughter.

This autopilot exploration unearths the unconscious secrets our spiritual self keeps from our conscious, critical self.With his background in psychology and sociology, Leonard has a unique perspective on both himself and his fellow man. In his writings he ponders the feelings and emotions that people experience each day. From love and passion to guilt and melancholy, he seeks to understand the relationship people have with each other and with Mother Nature herself. When Leonard isn't writing, he enjoys nature and the sensory joys of the world. He has traveled throughout Asia and Europe to experience the natural and spiritual gifts different cultures offer. He loves photography and often takes pictures of nature's seasons and the monuments created by mankind.You can read more about Leonard at his website: leonardbelmont.com and discover for yourself the importance of spiritual self reflection and parapsychology through his works.", "related": ["B00HOZJICA"], "rank": 1899124, "title": "Thoughts and Reflections (Automatic Writings Book 1)", "author": "Leonard Belmont", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I wrote this in twelve days, then Erin's Christmas Wish, and finally, about ten-thousandmorewords in another story ... for a total of 82k words in less than thirty days.'Erin' was published the next month, but Holding Out For Love (aka the NaNo book for eighteen long months) sat around collecting virtual dust. Yes, I had so many other projects on my schedule it took forever to get around to the editing.But it's finally here, and I'm excited because thanks to some great reader suggestions, it's much better than the original version.
