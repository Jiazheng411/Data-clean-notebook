Devin is not a gentleman; he's crude, kind of mean but the same passion he uses when killing is exactly what he brings to the bedroom. Samantha Cruise's historical feast was more than just a well developed story with guns, danger, mayhem and delicious wickedness. Devil's Pact was a story that sucked me into the emotional upheaval of the characters. I was right there during the orgasmic interludes that left me sweating and anxious for more. I was with them as they attempted with their bodies to say what each found so hard to say with words. I can't say enough how much I actually loved this book, all 497 pages of it. A story that had me on the hook from the first encounter with Meg to the final culmination when finally a decision was made on if Devin and Megan could make it, if their passion was more than rabid frenzy lust but something life altering something meant to be forever. Caleb the third in the menage was just icing on a cake already flowing with goodies, but he wasn’t Devin: a man readers will go away loving or detesting. That is why I think Ms. Cruise did a great job no matter the impression you get, strong love or hate for some of her characters.

Although Alan doesn't contribute a piece, he does provide a succinct and perceptive introduction to each section. While some selections, such as those by Gene Wilder, Sid Caesar and Don Rickles, are too brief, the vast majority offer humorous, touching, informed and engaging perspectives on what it means to be born a Jew.Jerusalem Reportcontributor David Margolis laments the failure of his parents' generation to pass on a real knowledge of Judaism to their children. Faye Moskowitz (Her Face in the Mirror: Jewish Women on Mothers and Daughters) contributes a funny and moving portrait of her grandmother's magical powers as she kneaded challah or stirred a witch's brew of beets, sugar, garlic, salt, allspice and bay leaves into delicious sweet and sour borscht once a year. Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois congresswoman, explores how becoming an elected official made her more conscious of her Jewish identity.

Edward Balfour IV sat back in the burgundy leather chair that was two sizes too big for him now that the years had begun to shrink him, tented his fingers atop a generous belly and looked across the desk at his nephew. \"You're making a point with that gesture, aren't you, son? Do I get three guesses now as to what that point might be?\"\"No need for guessing. Let's just let these serve in lieu of a November progress report, why don't we? I'm sorry,Santa,but our fellow man is living down to my expectations again this year, rather than up to yours. Three good-hearted givers and fifteen bottom-feeding takers. I just got word that the last one, the youth counselor in Florida, took off for Vegas within three days of getting a cash gift. I warned you about cash gifts. Three, Uncle Ned, three out of eighteen. That's a new low.\"\"All right, I suppose I'll agree to accept that deviation from the usual monthly report. But please let me remind you, Sam, that the gift is always given with an accompanying note that instructs the recipient to do what he or she feels best.\"\"Right. And for most of them, what they feelbestis to keep their good fortune to themselves, and the hell with everyone and everything else. Kind of like the guy who grabs his bread from the middle of the loaf—and then leaves the bag open so that the rest of the slices get stale. Hey, as long as I've got mine, who cares about anyone else, right?\"\"And here I was going to add that I was wondering if thatnew low,as you call it, disappoints or delights you, Sam. But that would be only a rhetorical question, wouldn't it, son?\"\"It doesn't matter what I think, Uncle Ned. That's not the point,\" Sam said, not liking the defensive tone of his own voice. \"You've been doing this for nearly ten years now, and each year the numbers get worse. What's it going to take to convince you that people aren't what you'd like to believe them to be? By and large, we're a bunch of grasping, self-serving bastards, some of us putting a good face on for the world, sure, but all of us are really out for number one, and nobody else.\"\"And some of us may even be cynics,\" Uncle Ned said, his tone more amused than accusing as he sat forward in his chair once again. \"I agree, Sam, that the responses to this year's gifts have been fairly disappointing. When I began this, more than half of the recipients took their gifts and turned them into something good, something that served others rather than merely themselves.\"\"Yeah, I know—considering the greater good over the individual benefit. Terrific in theory, lousy in practice.\"\"Not entirely. You said there were three.\"Sam felt sorry for his uncle and employer. \"Look, you gave it your best shot, Uncle Ned. But let's just send the three who passed the test their million bucks, have them sign their confidentiality agreements and put this project to rest, okay? No party this year. It's senseless. Unless you want to invite all the others as well and watch their faces as Bruce explains the rules and only three of them get checks.\"\"You'd enjoy that, wouldn't you?\"Sam shrugged. \"Maybe. No. No, I don't think so. I mean, what's the point? As far as I'm concerned, the ones who react the way most of them do are the normal ones. Only an idiot gives away what he can keep. You know—don't look a gift horse in the mouth? You gave, they took. Why should any of them do anything differently?\"\"Oh, Sam. You're breaking an old man's heart here. You really are.\"Sam half sat on one corner of the large desk. \"I'm only saying what I believe. Besides, Uncle Ned, I've shown you the articles in the newspapers. That dame, that Leticia Trent, she isn't giving up. Word is getting out on what you're doing.\"\"Yes, yes, I know. The reclusive billionaire Santa Claus who gives out unexpected gifts so he can watch what the lucky recipients do with them and then awards the generous with one million tax-free dollars in their Christmas stockings. It's rather shocking, how on the money she is with her stories. But it's only rumors so far, remember, no more than speculation. I'm not worried. I'm rather flattered, in fact, to be seen as some modern-day Kris Kringle.\" He patted his stomach. \"I'm even working on the bowlful-of-jelly belly.\"Then his uncle sobered. \"This is what Maureen wanted, Sam. This is what she and I did those last few years before she was taken from me. This is her legacy. I'm not going to stop, not until the world has run out of good people, and I don't think it ever will.\"\"I understand. I'm sorry I brought it up,\" Sam said, reluctantly giving up the fight. Aunt Maureen had been bedridden for the last five years of her life, and the generous project had been her idea. She and Uncle Ned would scour the newspapers, the Internet, every day, looking for possible worthy recipients of unexpected gifts, be it the gift of money or something else of particular interest to the individual selected.If the person kept what was given, used it selfishly, that person was out of the running for the larger gift at the Christmas Eve gathering. The initial gift would have been earned, as Maureen saw it, but no additional gift would be coming to these people.Sam privately thought that Maureen and Uncle Ned were playing God with other people's lives, but he had always kept that opinion to himself. It was watching his uncle's generous heart being bruised year after year that made Sam want to see an end to the project.Sam also knew his uncle's arguments for keeping the project going.Uncle Ned had sworn that the searching, the choosing, the anticipation, the joy when people they'd chosen had done such magnificent things with their gifts, had kept his beloved wife alive long past the predictions of her doctors.Now maybe the project was doing the same for her husband, a thought that, when he admitted it to himself, scared the hell out of Sam. Because if Sam didn't believe in the goodness of man all that much, what he really hated was thereclusive billionairepart, as his uncle had been hiding from the world since the day Maureen died.\"Sam?\"\"Yes, sir,\" Sam said, picking up the invitations that would not be sent this year, intending to toss them in the trash.\"You might want to hang on to one of those.\" His uncle opened the top center drawer and pulled out a dark green file folder. Sam knew the drill. Green, forgiving.\"I've selected one more recipient for you.\"\"You don't give up, do you?\" Sam reluctantly took the folder. \"Even if this one works out, Uncle Ned, you'd still only be four for nineteen. You wouldn't consider that a good return on your investment if these people were stocks or bonds.\"\"But that's the point, Sam. People can't be toted up on a balance sheet. People can't be assigned to the profit or loss columns of a ledger. I wish you understood that. You worry me, son. Your poor opinion of people in general worries me, as you've no good reason to hold such low opinions. Anyone would think you grew up in a hovel, downtrodden and oppressed in every way, rather than here, which I would think even you would say is the lap of luxury.\"Sam smiled. \"I know. I almost developed a speech impediment, trying to talk with that entire set of silver flatware in my mouth.\"Uncle Ned tipped his head to one side and smiled at his nephew. \"Did you ever consider that it might be the company you keep that's colored your judgment, inside and outside of your business dealings with some of the less than munificent of corporate leaders? Not that they aren't all beautiful women.\"\"They are that, and always in it for what they can get out of it—or out of me. Thankfully, they're also disposable and interchangeable, rather like the corporate leaders. But we'll leave psychoanalyzing my inappropriate response to being born with a silver spoon in my mouth for another time, okay?\" Sam said, holding up the folder. \"I'll take this to Bruce and get him started.\"\"No, Sam, you won't. There's been a change of plans. This one you'll handle yourself.\"\"Me? Uncle Ned, come on. I handle the paperwork, the gifts, the funds transfers. I take care of the invitations—all three of them this year. I arrange for the damn million-dollar checks and the Christmas Eve party. Bruce takes care of everything else, the meeting, the greeting, the hosting and most especially the delivering of the initial gifts and the follow-up. Not my job, not my table, you know?\"\"You'll do what I tell you to do, Sam,\" his uncle said, his tone the one that had, in earlier years, been the terror of several boardrooms. \"This one's local. You won't have to travel or lose any time from your busy schedule of running my companies and sleeping with any pretty woman with a pulse. Although that redhead last month would have tempted a rock.\"Sam looked at his uncle in astonishment. \"Pardon me? What was that? You're keeping tabs onmeas well as your recipients? Wonderful. You'll have to excuse me now, so I can go find Bruce and break his nose for him.\"\"Leave Bruce alone. He only does what I tell him. Depressingly well in your case. I had to warn him not to bring me any more, shall I say,interestingphotographs of you and your interchangeable and disposable young ladies. Frankly, I'm surprised they don't all have constant chest colds, the way they dress. You're my sole heir, Sam, my brother's child. I love you. But I don't like what I'm seeing. You're turning cold and perhaps even hard. You may well be on your way to being auser,and will end up a lonely, disillusioned old man.\"\"And here I thought you liked me,\" Sam...", "related": ["B00CYUCQZQ"], "rank": 1703191, "title": "The Tycoon's Secret (Gifts from a Billionaire Book 1910)", "author": "Kasey Michaels", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Looking back from age 70, Sharp recalls growing up poor, awkward and lonely in her immigrant parents' North Toronto home, a lone island of Jewish life-a simulacrum of their native Poland-amidst a working-class Christian community. Smart, hard-working and imaginative, \"Rifke\" was stifled by no-nonsense parents, whose remaining family would vanish in the Holocaust, and the anti-Semitism of her insular neighborhood. Sharp recalls attempts to pass as a Gentile, her discovery of books and her introduction, at age 16, to future husband Isadore Sharp, then a young athletic man in the building business. From there comes marriage, travel, work and children-four handsome, intelligent boys-a full life that Sharp recalls in lucid, breezy prose. The heart of Sharp's tale is the loss f her son Christopher, at age 18, to cancer. The powerful sense of perseverance that pulls Sharp through that tragedy is further illuminated in carefully wrought chapters on the last communications from her European relatives and the story of Ozarow, Poland, her family's ravished hometown.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A cruel prince, accidentally sprayed with water by the animal, complicates Run-Run's already difficult life by giving him a gift that is really a curse–a white elephant. Somehow, Run-Run must take excellent care of Sahib, who is forbidden to work because he is sacred: Wash the hair at his ears! Brush it! Use no harsh words. Do not scold him. Treat him like an honored guest! the Prince's servant orders the elephant boy. If you value your own skin, you will be a servant to Prince Noi's gift…. Sahib surprises the boy, however, with his intelligence and bravery, and, in the end, enables Run-Run to seek out a more hopeful future. This young-reader-friendly book features ample margins and generous line spacing, short chapters, and full-page black-and-white illustrations that give visual information. Fleischman successfully immerses readers in this ancient culture, creating clever and believable plot twists that bring the story to a satisfying but open-ended conclusion.

Anyone that enjoys erotic horror will enjoy this collection of intense stories.\"\n\nNight Owl Romance Review by Danya:\n\n\"Selena Kitt has penned a fabulous collection of erotic horror short stories. Shivers consists of eight stories that rival Stephen King in dreadful anticipation while still containing steamy and seductive overtones. While all the stories lend themselves to the reader quivering in horror and shivering in delight, The Gingerbread Man stands out as my favorite. Selena Kitt has created stories that no fan of erotic horror should miss. But be sure to leave a light on after reading these, you never know when the Boogey Man might come calling and in Selena Kitt's world, he might just be tall, dark and handsome.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Intrigued by an Irish language memorial near his home that is dedicated to a republican militant assassinated in the Irish Civil War, he began researching the period surrounding Irish independence and partition in 1916-23 in 2006. He is particularly interested in the specifics of this often murky period in Dublin. He has worked variously as a bicycle courier, English language teacher and in assorted other jobs. He is currently studying in Masters’ course in journalism. He lives in Dublin, speaks Spanish to a reasonable standard and has a keen interest in the Spanish speaking world, especially Spain and the Basque country. Apart from history, he enjoys sport, especially cycling and football. He is a supporter of Shamrock Rovers FC, though as much out of personal nostalgia and social ties as sporting reasons.", "related": ["B00505CK2G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Toby is dismayed to encounter her frighteningly upbeat Fetch, May Daye, a magical doppelgänger heralding her imminent demise. Hot on its heels comes the discovery that Blind Michael, lord of the Wild Hunt, has kidnapped a number of fae and human children--including several whom Toby considers family--to replenish his riders. Determined to outfight or outwit Michael, Toby chases him down several increasingly dangerous Faerie Roads and through the streets of San Francisco, finding unexpected allies and new inner strength. McGuire adeptly plunders folklore, nursery rhymes, traditional ballads, and fairy tales for her framework, and fleshes it out with plenty of action and intrigue. With the addition of May, the cast finally clicks and the series really solidifies.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

However, it has only recently come to my attention (through a reviewer on Amazon UK....thank you X) that there are some issues with weird numbers. Upon inspection, I discovered those numbers to be the original pdf page numbers assigned to the book.As of March 30, 2011, those number issues should be cleaned from the MS and a small adjustment of English label chapter headings have been written in to help with the Table of Contents.I thank each purchaser of Pray for Reign and apologize for any formatting issues you may have encountered. I am working to ajdust the formatting and appreciate it when someone notifies me of any issues I can fix.Pray for Reign is an early book written when I was very much a history buff. I enjoyed the research and the places it took my mind when things were not offered as pure fact. For example: I read in my research that it was possible Anne might have met Leonardo da Vinci as they were at French court at the same time. I also found it interesting that one of Anne's wardresses in tower was surnamed: Coffyn.Most of the history is accurate: some is my own imagination.

The fundamental theme of \"needing help\" is the common thread among the stories, which range from the satirical to the peculiar to the humorous to the sad. Sometimes the \"help\" is administered in unusual fashion or never quite arrives at all, and each character is left to puzzle the complexity and edginess of life. One young man learns that sometimes a person is really telling the truth, despite evidence to the opposite. Another deals with having a girl mistake him for her boyfriend in a dark area at a dance and accidentally bestow upon him unexpected first kisses. One girl mourns the loss of her mother and tries to find evidence of the woman's spirit in every creak of the house. Another laments her inability to play golf, even against a frail old lady. Still another teen wishes desperately to turn around her family's terrible manners. These interesting characters placed in unique situations, and the thought-provoking endings, compensate for intermittent awkwardness in the telling. The occasional insertion of Spanish words is done skillfully so that even non-Spanish speakers will understand all aspects of the stories, which are similar in style and tone to Soto'sPetty Crimes(Harcourt, 1998).–Diane P.

His feelings change as he and Rebecca travel with the Graylins to Russia and Rebecca learns to overcome her fears and assert herself. A light, diverting romance, this is the author's ninth Regency.

As Showalter observes, women’s writing has been “closely allied” with the quest for not only women’s rights but also universal human rights and justice, as well as literary exploration and excellence. Showalter’s chronological survey of “the literary mothers of us all” takes measure of the great reach and splendid variety of women’s writing and how it has illuminated America’s continuing transformation and shaped American literature. Naturally, such pillars as Emily Dickinson, Louisa May Alcott, Edith Wharton, Zora Neale Hurston, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and Flannery O’Connor are present. But here, too, are versatile Lydia Maria Child, early African American writer Frances E. W.

This volume from the Master Musicians Series (which also includesJulian Budden on VerdiandMichael Kennedy on Richard Strauss) intermingles chapters on Bach's life with chapters on his music (also roughly chronological) in a delightfully clearheaded way. Boyd is perfectly willing to say whether he finds a piece of music to be substandard and freely takes issue with the scholarship of earlier analysts. Taking nothing for granted, Boyd disproves common assumptions about relative dates of compositions. The section on cantatas begins with brief notes on the genre, a few antecedents, and the subtypes of secular and sacred. Boyd then briskly reviews the surviving works, dwelling on a few for some enlightening and representative details. In \"Canons and Counterpoint,\" he sorts out theMusical Offeringin a remarkable few paragraphs before having a go atThe Art of the Fugue. Boyd's charts are very easy to follow (appropriate for a composer whose music is often compared to architecture), and his musical examples--especially in the chapter titled \"Orchestral, Instrumental, and Keyboard Music\"--are spectacularly well chosen. There is room for a few choice incidental observations (e.g., cantatas for the winter months were shorter, sparing the choirboys time in the unheated organ lofts). A 22-page work list (revised in 1997), a life calendar, and a brief chapter on numerology round out a highly rewarding volume.--William R.

She especially admires three wild horses just captured by the king's handlers: a blue roan mare, so called for the white hairs mixed through her blue-black coat, and her two foals. When the evil lord of a neighboring kingdom steals the foals, Syeira frees the mare and joins her quest to find her young. The relationship between Arwin and the girl deepens until Syeira has become like another child to the blue roan. Never anthropomorphized, the horses communicate with humans wordlessly, through a highly original language of smells and scent pictures. Lots of olfactory details enrich the well-realized, preindustrial setting. The story is overstuffed with interesting characters and situations, including an herbalist addicted to a memory-enhancing plant, hot-air balloons used as war engines, winged horses, a murderous small bird turned third-rate artist–and that's not even the half of it. Some of these great ideas sidetrack rather than enhance the plot, and the generally lyrical writing style breaks down in places, but overall this is an enjoyable fantasy from a new writer to be watched.–Beth Wright, Fletcher Free Library, Burlington, VTCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I am excited to be offering free information and an online parenting course. Oftentimes, parents are weighted down by the expectations of others and thus lose sight of their own existing skills. I have seen this hurt the children and the entire family. Like everyone else, all parents, children and families can benefit from improvement.  Parents can build on their skills, family goals, and their intention to be successful parents, and develop new and even more successful parenting solutions for their whole family. Just a few pointers, a heads-up to the pitfalls to avoid, and parents will be on their way to efficient parenting solutions.Some famous person of the past said something like, \"Information and knowledge is power.\" Information, knowledge and experience will definitely build confidence in ones abilities. The more successful and confident parents become, the more successful and confident adults the children develop into.

G. Griffiths is everything a thriller novel should be. Jessie and Angela are teamed together by their insurance company to investigate a stolen chip and have to determine whether or not the insurance claim is valid or has the chip not really been stolen. They are attracted to each other and spend a day at the beach to become better acquainted. From that day on nothing is going to be normal again. Golden Eagles, that have never been known to attack people, are suddenly violent and killing. The eagles go after several employees of the insurance company and it is up to Jessie and Angela to prove why. The search begins to find out more about these eagles and learn how they have been trained, by whom and, most importantly, why.Talonscan easily become the new classic to rival old standards likeJaws, The Birds and Ten Little Indians. It can easily be made into an award-winning movie. W. G. Griffiths has written a book that is scary, exciting, romantic and suspenseful. Talons is impossible to put down until you reach the very last page. I stayed up late into the night to learn what happens to Jessie and Angela. All of the characters are well presented and each one became very real to me. I highly recommend this book to all readers who enjoy a good Alfred Hitchcock type story that has twists, turns, and surprises throughout the story. W. G. Griffiths should be proud of Talons. It is a book that will be popular for a very long time. \" --Trudi LoPreto, Readers Favorite", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I started about eight years ago and got the first story I ever wrote, Herb’s Home Run, published in Writer’s Journal. I’ve been hooked since then. I lost my real job three years ago and after 600 resumes with no luck, decided I was going to make it as a writer, and here I am. Caribbean Moon was a labor of love, and writing it taught me more about myself than I cared to know. (My wife thinks I should keep my mind a secret!)

I’ve not made it yet, but I’m going to, and I want to be a living example that with hard work and God’s blessing, you can do anything.

Academician Chertok began his career as an electrician in Moscow before joining the aircraft design bureau of Viktor Bolkhovitinov in 1934. In 1946, he joined the newly established NII-88 institute as head of the control systems department and worked hand-in-hand with famed Chief Designer Sergey Korolev. Chertok became one of Korolev's closest aides in developing control systems for ballistic missiles and spacecraft, eventually becoming deputy chief designer of the famous OKB-1, the design organization that spun off from NII-88 in 1956 and was responsible for a remarkable string of space firsts of the early Soviet space program. Chertok participated in every major project at OKB-1, now the S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, until his retirement from active work in 1991. Among his many contributions to the Russian space industry, he was closely involved in the launch of the world's first satellite, Sputnik, on October 4, 1957 and the first human spaceflight by Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961. Following his retirement, Chertok served as a senior consultant at RSC-Energia and published a series of memoirs, \"Rockets and People,\" chronicling the history of the Russian space program.", "related": ["B0075GLYQG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science & Math", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This novel was finished in 1989. It was intended to be an admiring tribute to my father, who served in American Army counter-intelligence in Japan and China immediately after World War II. Occasional stories during my childhood about his experiences provided background for the novel and, for some reason, I had acquired part of a footlocker of part of his Japanese memorabilia and that and other material provided excellent and possibly unique background, as well.\nMy father usually liked my writing, technical or fictional, and he edited a good deal of it for me with patience and good humour. Unfortunately, he did not at all likeThe Japanese Observerand was quite abrupt about it, too. \"It wasn't like that at all\", was this only comment. Even more uncharacteristically, he made no offer at all to help improve it; I fancy I can still picture the disapproval on his face. So, thinking I'd gotten things terribly wrong and offended him, I filed it away and forgot about it.\nI was puzzled by his reaction at the time since I thought that my admiration for the main character was quite transparent. A decade later, I heard from my sister that Dad had had a very adverse reaction toSaving Private Ryan,apparently because he had trained, but not served, with an infantry unit that participated in the Normandy invasion. When he then dismissed theBand of Brothersseries also with, \"It wasn't like that at all\", I began to feel in somewhat better company and hoped some day to get a chance to revisit his reaction toThe Japanese Observer. That time will now never come - death waits for no man - and so I suppose I must first fully understand my own irrational anger when I watchHair,Platoonor similar period recreations before I can ever understand Dad's reaction.Perhaps history that is experienced by us personally is simply too intimate to ever be comfortably recreated by those who didn't experience it; perhaps it is simply survivors' guilt. The lesson is that it may be best to wait before writing historical novels until there is no one left who can say, \"It wasn't like that at all\".", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The chapter authors are first-rate scholars, with most of the chapters thoroughly updated and with important additions, such as the special circumstances of community colleges and the effect of technology and on-line learning on retention and persistence. This is a must-read reference for students, scholars, and (one can only hope)policy-makers contending with the immensely difficult challenge of improving institutional retention and student persistence for the sake both of our economy and of those students we are currently losing.(D. Bruce Johnstone, professor of higher and comparative education emeritus, The University at Buffalo; former chancellor, SUNY system)As a college president for forty-five years, I agonize over the issues of admission and retention since both impact so directly on finances and upon the ability of our higher education institutions to function effectively. This group of diverse specialists, under the lead editorship of Alan Seidman, has put together a master work on the subject of retention—from defining and measuring it, to determining its past history and future promise. It goes beyond the theories, so well-worn, to projected actions in policies, programs, and practices that institutions can adopt and which help students—and therefore colleges—succeed.(Joseph N. Hankin, president, Westchester Community College)For college and university administrators and faculty to successfully address their student retention challenges, they need to place their efforts in contexts beyond their specific institution. Seidman and colleagues, in a single text, provide a valuable historical, definitional, theoretical, empirical, financial, and practical context for framing retention strategy.(David Kalsbeek, senior vice president, enrollment marketing and management, DePaul University)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Located in the oak-studded foothills of the Sierras, it is also home to black-tail deer, her fiercest competition for the plants in her garden, and wild turkeys, that provide daily comic relief. A fifth-generation Californian, Susan ended up in the gold country after spending her youth in two very different valleys – San Fernando and Silicon. The Southern California of her childhood was peopled with family who built bungalows, who worked as actors and extras in movies with casts of a thousand, and who sat on their porches soaking in sunshine and the scent of citrus blossoms. The Santa Clara valley (yet to be named for a computer chip) of her teens and twenties was at that time an emerald green land, heady with blossoms of its own. When the last of the cherries and apricots fell to innovations charged with global-scale change, Susan and her husband wished well the haunts of their youth, packed up their sons, and made their way east to the haunts of the original 49ers. Susan received her B.A. in English and K-8 Teaching Credential from San Jose State University, and M.A. in Writing and Secondary Teaching Credential from Sacramento State University. She taught high school literature and composition as well as elementary school. She has never strayed far from her writing life, publishing personal and motivational essays, feature, and travel articles over the years. She currently joined the ranks of bloggers as well as published her first collection of essays. She is in the process of writing her second novel, which will be published later this year. Her website is: susanhartsnyder.com and blog is: theoverthinkerblog.com.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The wisdom they bring to their recommendation of the Christian intellectual tradition is biblical, seasoned, experienced, trustworthy, and encouraging. It is a book to enjoy both in itself and as a welcome guide to much, much more.”—Mark A. Noll,Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History, University of Notre Dame“David Dockery and Timothy George are among the preeminent Christian intellectuals of the current age. This book demonstrates why. The volume courses with biblical conviction, evangelical vitality, and a breadth that interacts with the great cloud of witnesses from every place and era of the church of Jesus Christ. I commend this book heartily to students, professors, and church leaders.”—Russell D. Moore,President, The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission; author,Tempted and Tried“In a clear and concise presentation of the great thinkers of the church, the authors of this book launch a new series that promises to provide students with an important key to unlock the treasure store of the Christian tradition. They show us once again how exciting Christianity is and why it has captured the minds of successive generations. At a time when our faith is being challenged as never before, this introduction to its riches promises to equip the saints of the next generation to claim their inheritance and extend it further to the glory of God.”—Gerald Bray,author,God Is Love“This appeal to Christian educators to take the great tradition of Christian thinking much more seriously, to find our place within it, and to renew it today, has arrived in the nick of time. For despite the common invocation of ‘integration’ language at our Christian universities, our schools are all-too-often led by pragmatists beholden to the forces of the market more than the life of the Christian mind. David Dockery and Timothy George herein remind us of our heritage, our very reason for being. I pray that God will use their efforts in the lives of countless students, teachers, and Christian college leaders, inspiring passionate commitment to the values and the virtues that attracted us to Christian education in the first place.”—Douglas A. Sweeney,Professor of Church History and the History of Christian Thought, Director of the Jonathan Edwards Center, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School“David Dockery and Timothy George have written a compelling volume that makes a strong case for the pivotal role that the Christian intellectual tradition should fulfill in a serious liberal arts education. Although the volume was written as a student’s text, individuals who care about Christian higher education (administrators, faculty, and trustees) will benefit from reading and applying the principles articulated in this thoughtful work.”—Kim S. Phipps, President, Messiah College“Don’t be misled by the modesty of this book’s title. While the book surely is a winsome and accessible introduction to the subject for any inquiring student, it has much more than that to offer. Its authors are two of the most eminent figures in the field of Christian higher education, and their book reflects the immense range of their learning and experience, even though it wears its learning lightly. The result is a compact but powerful work that will be an invaluable tool for all of us who wrestle with the great task of integrating faith and learning and of showing others how the good, the true, and the beautiful find their ultimate source and meaning in God.”—Wilfred M. McClay, SunTrust Chair of Excellence in Humanities, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga“David Dockery and Timothy George, two experienced and wise Christian educators, have produced the first volume of what promises to be an important series of guides—aimed at students—intended both to recover and instruct regarding the Christian intellectual tradition. This volume, and no doubt the series as well, meets a significant need, not only for students but also for ministers and academics who are charged with the responsibility of helping us all think and live faithfully as followers of Christ. In light of our deeply flawed world, every generation needs a fresh retelling—in literature, theology, the arts, philosophy, or public policy—of the central truths of all human and natural experience, as revealed by the one true and living God through his Son and as authoritatively and indispensably taught in Holy Scripture.”—Robert B.

The inspiration came from images while attending church services. It was clear that I had to finally experience something creative in my life. It challenged me early on initiated by a violent father and a fear of success. I had always wanted to write a book, but I never thought it would be a children's book. I went back to school at 50 years old and learned writing skills. Attending Regis University in Denver I obtained my Master's degree in Jungian Psychology. That prompted me to write a series of essays, poetry and a book on Psychotherapy verses Shamanism. Previously I was in the real estate business for 34 years and retired to go to school and began a career in counseling. I am a psychotherapist and have working with men in domestic violence for the last 14 years. I do group and individual counseling that has been a challenge while enjoying my first love, writing. I have four beautiful daughters, seven grandchildren and three great grandchildren. God is first; my family second, and lastly my work in counseling and writing. I look forward to a great career at my age of 72 years. Enjoy reading.

Read him. -- Bryan Appleyard THE SUNDAY TIMES 20120617 A fascinating and provocative book...Spector is a talented story-teller, weaving real-life accounts of identical twins into each chapter...This is an informative and thought-provoking tour of some of the most exciting areas in biology right now.

He lives in Omer, Israel, with his full-time partner, Esther, their four children, Michal, Lilach, Tamar and Yonatan, and the dog Elvis.  Kfir has published extensively in the professional and general press over the years. For almost four years he wrote a weekly “Patents” column in Globes (Israel’s financial newspaper). His non-fiction book, THE WORLD OF PATENTS, (a not-so-boring tale of what patents are about, in Hebrew) was published in 2002 by Globes Press. He is the author of several short stories but now mostly writes full-length fiction. His first novel, CROSSING THE MEADOW was published by Echelon Press (October 2003) and was voted “BEST HORROR NOVEL” in the 2003 Preditors & Editors Readers Poll. Kfir is an HWA (Horror Writers Association) and ITW (International Thriller Writers) member and also serves on the editorial board of The Harrow Press as Anthology Editor. His second novel, THE ODYSSEY GENE, was published by Echelon Press (July 2006) and was a finalist in the Indie Excellence 2007 Book Awards. He got the inspiration for his new thriller, “THE EVELYN PROJECT”, from an in-depth research into the family archives. You can visit Kfir’s web site and read his blog at www.kfirluzzatto.com.

It was selling well enough that Arcadia thought one about the town itself might also sell.\"Barnes sent out a call to the community for photographs, and set herself a December 2009 deadline. The Estes Park Museum, Jack and Lulie Melton, and other individuals contributed previously unseen photographs.Tonight`s program, part of a ongoing weekly symposium at the Baldpate, will be \"similar to entertainment from years gone by,\" according to Barnes. \"Though we use modern equipment, we`re really doing the kind of ranger talk that Dorr Yeager or Jack Moomaw would have presented to summer visitors in the 1940s, `50s, and `60s.\"Copies of \"Estes Park\" will soon be available in area bookstores and gift shops. The Baldpate, however, is the first business to have salable numbers of books on hand, and tonight is the only time a $2 discount will apply to those presenting coupons appearing in this issue of the Trail-Gazette. Regularly-priced copies can also be ordered online at arcardiapublishing.com, or toll free at 888-313-2665.Barnes, who served on the advisory board of the Estes Park Area Historical Museum from 1987 to 2007, and who continues working as a reference specialist in the Rocky Mountain National Park Library and as a volunteer at the museum, hopes her passion for preserving and presenting the past will encourage others to share their Estes Park memories, whether they are from the last century or last week. Her blog appears on estesparklife.com, and contact information is available there.", "related": ["B006FL74W0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has four children with her husband James, and they live in the Stillorgan area of Dublin.  Marita was always fascinated by the Famine period in Irish history and read everything available on the subject. When she heard a radio report of an unmarked children's grave from the Famine period being found under a hawthorn tree, she decided to write her first book, Under the Hawthorn Tree.  Published in May 1990, the book was an immediate success and become a classic. It has been translated into over a dozen languages, including Arabic, Bahasa, French, Dutch, German, Swedish, Italian, Japanese and Irish. The book has been read on RTE Radio and is very popular in schools, both with teachers and pupils. It has been made a supplementary curriculum reader in many schools and is also used by schools in Northern Ireland for EMU (Education through Mutual Understanding) projects. It was also filmed by Young Irish Film Makers, in association with RTE and Channel 4. This is available as a DVD.  Marita has written more books for children which were also very well received.  The Blue Horse reached No. 1 on the Bestseller List and won the BISTO BOOK OF THE YEAR Award. No Goodbye, which tells of the heartbreak of a young family when their mother leaves home, was recommended by Book Trust in their guide for One Parent Families.  Safe Harbour is the story of two English children evacuated from London during World War ll to live with their grandfather in Greystones, Co Wicklow and was shortlisted for the BISTO Book of the Year Award. A Girl Called Blue follows the life of an orphan, trying to find who she really is in a cold and strict orphanage. Marita has also explored the world of fantasy with her book In Deep Dark Wood.  Marita has won several awards, including the International Reading Association Award, the Osterreichischer Kinder und Jugendbuchpreis, the Reading Association of Ireland Award and the Bisto Book of the Year Award.", "related": [], "rank": 1619974, "title": "Safe Harbour eBook", "author": "Marita Conlon-McKenna", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Having secured her status as relationships pro, Jean launched her brand Flirtology in 2004 to deliver light-hearted, savvy advice on the social science of attraction. Through personal coaching lessons and interactive seminars, Jean reveals her ‘three methods of flirting attack’ theory. However, it’s her flirting and walking tours around London and Chicago which have singletons talking to strangers in a completely new way.

While working for the pharmaceutical industry, Dr. Liu authored twelve US patents, created and developed a number of new healthcare products. He has led multiple functional teams to conduct clinical trials for a number of top pharmaceutical companies during the last seventeen years. Currently at TechWorld Medicals, Dr. Liu continues his innovations and transforms medical sciences into practical technologies, and plays instrumental roles for gaining products approval/registration in US FDA and China SFDA. The clinical study published in 2011 verified what Dr. Liu originally hypothesized when he filed the U.S. patent application in 1997: physically removing viruses from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal cavities can be an effective method to treat and prevent infectious diseases, like the common cold. This book will help everyone on how we treat the common cold safely, quickly and economically.  Dr. Liu declared a war against common cold on October 28, 2011.

As a ministry, A Redneck's Guide books seek to help others know more about being a Christian and how to grow in their walk, to encourage others to step out of their comfort zones and become the person that the Lord wants them to be, and most importantly, to reach the lost that don’t know Jesus as their Lord and Savior.

For me the Chinese takeover was a refreshing\nchange from the alien and zombie takeover I see in many dystopian books. The\nChinese want to recover the money they are owed by the United States and they\ncommandeer the property of Americans and force people to work for them. The Ttruth's Blood is a commanding, richly textured piece of writing with substance\nand great moral scope to it.The author's descriptive talents let me see\nand feel the setting of the story. The book has well developed characters unlike\nmany dystopian books. I enjoyed every one of the four hundred and seventy plus\npages. Another writer would have split the story into two books but Tyler\nRoberts generously gave it to us in one volume.

MD, PhD. My doctoral thesis was my first literary experience of note. I spent most of my married and professional years on the east coast in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Delaware. As a baby boomer and retired physician I’m devoting my time to writing medical thrillers. My life as an author of fiction began in 2003 after several individuals consistently commented that my speeches delivered at Toastmasters International always captured the audience because they were presented as captivating stories regardless of the topic. “I should write a book” they all said. My wife encouraged me because she was sick of listening to me rehearsing my speeches.  “What should I write about?” I asked of my supportive spouse.  “Write about your patient from the Navy who brought back a bottle full of human eyes from Vietnam.”  Thus began my medical thrillers starting with THE EYEMAN. The sequel, THE DUTY CREW, chronicles the last Christmas Day of the Vietnam War in a Northeast Naval hospital. Like all my novels true lifetime situations are interwoven with suspenseful and intriguing storylines. My other thrillers also have medical facts as a backdrop to the story line–THE HELIOS RAIN, THE MYOSIN FACTOR, COTTER and THE ADJUSTMENT CLINIC. A crime drama WHO WILL WEEP FOR ME was followed by a paranormal fantasy, THE DRUID STONE, about chemical warfare in today’s terrorist climate. I live with my wife in San Antonio near my daughter and her family with four of my grandchildren. My first editor in 2003 told me to keep writing even if I’m not yet published. I devote 5-hours-a-day to my new books and promoting my completed ones.

First, I wanted a story that would be new to most readers. As Greek myths go, this story is relatively obscure. You won't hear much if anything about it in a survey course. The Greek sources on the story are lost or fragmentary. We have to turn to Ovid for a complete telling. Second, the myth is self-contained. The action centers on three characters during a brief time period and you don't have to know much about the world outside Tereus' castle to make sense of the character's motivations. Together, these factors make the myth of Tereus, Procne, and Philomela an ideal choice for a retelling.", "related": [], "rank": 4375466, "title": "Tapestries of Betrayal eBook", "author": "Jeff Chapman", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Patricia falls in love with the heroes she writes about each and every time she puts their lives down on paper. She loves sexy men and hates her villains more than the reader does. It helps to hate the bad guys. It makes the story so much richer. She realized a very long time ago that the world is filled with people who live diverse and amazing lifestyles and she tries to capture the beauty of such diversity in her writing.  Patricia has had a diverse career life. She’s been a jeweler, an AIDS hospice nurse and a “dreaded” mortgage broker. She hopes that the various walks of life she’s taken come out in her work. A busy mother of four and a “stage mom” for her youngest, she always seems to be in motion.

Our habits around health, relationships and\nmoney are largely a reflection of what we learnt about the world as children.\nFor many of us, however, the first we focus on our finances is years after we\nhave already established deep-seated poor financial habits that create\nunnecessary strain on every aspect of our lives.Money isn't everything - this is true and all the\nstudies that explore the relationship between life satisfaction and money\nsuggest that once you have an income that can provide you with a home,\nfinancial security and some discretionary money, additional dollars do not\nresult in additional happiness. The task, it would seem, is to reach that\nbaseline. That is exactly what Leanda's book has been written to\ndo. Based on sound neuroscientific principles and insights, it helps parents\ncreate a learning lab for their children to form solid, healthy money habits\nthat will enable them to achieve and maintain a financial baseline later in\nlife. It's an important piece of work and a wonderful gift\nto a generation of children who will thank her for it twenty years down the\ntrack.\"", "related": [], "rank": 2754967, "title": "How To Talk Money With Kids eBook", "author": "Leanda Kayess Dip FP", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Thompson to quit school three months shy of finishing the eighth grade. His mother sold the homestead down to the wood flooring, and at 13 years of age Paul Thompson left to find work in Texas. He found work on a ranch owned by a man in whom history and myth has so often collided: The very real and legendary Charles Goodnight.Of his employment under Goodnight, Thompson has remarked, \"Nowhere in the world did they feed the men better. At thirteen I received the same wages as the forty or so year-old man riding right beside me. It was none of this 'yer just a kid, you get half wages' as is said today. You did a man's work and got a man's pay. Then again, I don't know very many thirteen year-olds that know how to work, even if they're permitted it.\"Following his ranching employment under Goodnight, Thompson moved on to another brush with history that stands uncontested to this day. He rode for the XIT Ranch, which sprawling out at three million acres, was at one time the world's largest range under fence. Texas used the sale of the XIT to pay for it's red granite capitol, which remains the largest on the North American Continent while boasting of a dome standing seven feet higher than that of the U.S. capitol dome.Thompson moved on into working for other West Texas ranches and by the age of 17 had rode horseback from central New Mexico to Calgary, Canada. His travels via horseback have taken him all over New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and into areas of Utah and Wyoming.With the last vestiges of the West being replaced by a world of mechanization, the 22 year-old Thompson took stock of his life. Now married, the father of two children and by society's standards, uneducated, he had few employment prospects of any value. So once again he grabbed the reins of responsibility and took a placement test that enabled him to entered high school. Although it had been a little late in coming, three months later he graduated the 12th grade with straight A's. He went into Pasadena City College for two years and followed-up that with four years at UCLA. Thompson graduated with a Mechanical Engineering Degree.But even long-after his graduation, with the West relegated to little more than celluloid shadows of reality, Thompson was being beckoned by the call of the West--in particularly, the call of the Western lawman. He answered that call by picking up a deputy Sheriff's badge. His horse had become the automobile and the frontier was now the back streets and alleyways of Corrales New Mexico. But after 2½ years, and having almost bled to death from a gunshot wound, Thompson turned in his badge and hung up his six iron.Having recovered from his brush with death, Thompson made use of his degree in Mechanical Engineering by going on to serve as a consultant for numerous Electric Generating power plants throughout the United States. He retired early in order to concentrate on western epics based upon his exposure to and experiences in the now long-gone Wild West.Thompson reports that every location in his novels is accurate down to the detail.\"If my characters lead me off where I haven't been or don't remember,\" he says, \"I saddle the horse and go see for myself. In 1992 I rode horseback in the Mogollon, Gila Wilderness area of New Mexico and Arizona doing research on eight novels. This little trip took just over three months...\"Narrating in the authentically seasoned dialect of a southwestern storyteller, Paul L. Thompson is himself a tribute to the thrilling and heartbreaking hardships of our nation's western history. His depiction of the epic old west and the authoritative knowledge with which he writes will have you along for a ride in the 1870s. A ride that you'll swear has you atop a steed and racing across a sweeping panorama while colt dragoons are blazing hot in your hands right now!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was a gentle and patient surgeon and a unique leader of the team, maintaining quiet discipline and excellent interpersonal relationships.... This autobiography reveals the development, aspirations and internal self-searching of a great cardiac surgeon. It is essential reading for everyone who wishes to understand the inner workings of modern medicine. --Professor Mervyn Gotsman, previous head, Department of Cardiology, Hadassah University Hospital, JerusalemThousands suffering from life-threatening heart disease have gained many years of quality life and pleasure thanks to this unique individual with his skills, his open mind and his open heart. However, should a representative of the media interview him on the subject he would never take full credit for his success. It s not a one-man show, it s team work and without the contribution of every single member it would never work out. --Joram Rozov, former Associate Professor, Bezalel Academy of Art and DesignYou know, if I have never before understood exactly why I am in Israel, today I have the answer. I feel so much a part of the country. I feel I am contributing in the most meaningful way I can to the care of the wounded and to the welfare of Israel as a whole. I shall never again have doubts about our decision to settle in this small, developing land which is our own and which is so dear to Jews all over the world. --Dr. Joe Borman, phone call to his wife from Beersheba Hospital during the Six-Day War", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After marrying, she and her husband moved to Syracuse, New York, for his residency before returning to Minnesota. Soon after the birth of their daughter, Brockway started writing, became a master gardener for the University of Minnesota’s extension office, sat on the board of the Minnesota Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, and fostered dogs and cats for various rescue organizations—the groundwork for her daughter’s career; she is currently the director of an animal rescue, Secondhand Hounds. Today, as well as writing full-time, Brockway enjoys traveling, tennis, biking, fishing, and gardening; has taken tons of cooking classes; and has toyed with the idea of auditioning forMasterChef.

Zach has been dreaming up fantasy stories since he was very young and spent a great deal of time in that forest. He came to his mother one winter day in 2011 and told her that she was going to write a book and he was going to provide the story line. She insisted he had to help with the writing and the culmination of their efforts is titled Essarai, their first book.  Essendai is the second book in the Drasana trilogy. It follows the adventures of Lily and Tevarian as they journey across the Empire.

I have no excuse for that, sorry. As a boy I was fascinated by baseball and space travel. However, my career opportunities were limited in both fields, so I took up mathematics and physics, and eventually became a software engineer. That’s how I’ve made my living these many moons. However, being a wordy sort, I was moved to write, as well; no one I knew was willing to listen to me long enough to hear even the shortest of the stories floating through my head. So, at the tender age of sixteen, I blew my lawn-mowing money on a manual typewriter and, it being 1968, discovered the joys of carbon paper and correction tape. Nothing came of those early efforts, and after a couple of years’ fruitless struggles to interest the pulps in my adolescent narratives, I gave up the whole idea for a long time. Fast-forward to 1994. Desperate for something to deflect the angst of incipient middle age, I returned to writing, this time with a computer and a word processor. I’d become fascinated with a character idea: a young woman of great beauty, intelligence, and physical potential who’s been taken captive by a vicious biker gang, cannot remember her life before her capture, and must ultimately commit a murder to win her freedom. Her story, and the story of her exceedingly unlikely rescuer and mentor, became On Broken Wings, my first novel, which was completed in 1997. There have been many ups and downs since then. Conventional publishing houses have proved impervious to my semi-gothic supernatural fantasies, my science-fiction-for-readers-who-detest-science-fiction, and so forth. With the rise of electronic publishing and print-on-demand, my books are beginning to find a readership at long last. Apart from that: I enjoy a modest existence on the eastern end of Long Island in a creaky old ranch house, overfilled with books, that perpetually threatens to collapse on my head, with a wife of surpassing patience who claims still to love me, after many years and against all the odds. My personal vices are action movies, NHL hockey, Harvey’s Bristol Cream Sherry, the music of Glass Hammer, the military fantasies of Glen Cook, the Dragaeran adventures of Steven Brust, and the SF romances of Linnea Sinclair. My sole ambitions are to complete a few more books before dementia overtakes me, and never again to set foot on an airliner.", "related": [], "rank": 1315147, "title": "Freedom's Fury (Spooner Federation Saga Book 3) eBook", "author": "Francis Porretto", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I'm going to confess to\nthree. First,\nJoey Francisco, a fellow writing warrior, and sufferer of Post Traumatic Stress\nDisorder (PTSD), died a few days after reading the prologue. She was only\nforty-four years old, leaving a wonderful husband and a smart, loving, teenage\nson. She was the one I called at two a.m. when the nightmares were at their\nworst, the one who called me when she couldn't get out of the car. She knew\nexactly what the book was about, in a few short paragraphs. She is the reason I\ncompleted this novel, the one behind the driving force to keep going, even when\nlife throws some horrible curve balls. Second,\nI had to write about my own symptoms. For some of us, confessing to PTSD is\nhard, dealing with it even years after the inciting incident. Third,\nletting people into the world of living with PTSD. Every person who lives with\nhas their own path, symptoms, journey to find peace. It isn't \"in their head,\" nor\nis it easily overcome in a few short weeks. There is no \"one size fits all\"\ncure. Some manage to live in society quickly, others never do. Don't judge,\nlisten. It is the best thing you could ever do. For\nmore information about PTSD, and how you can help, go toptsd.org. Sincerely,TJ\nLoveless For those of you who\nalso live with PTSD: Every\nday you get up, and put your feet on the floor, is a victory. You count, you\nare worthy, you are not broken beyond repair. It is not \"just in your head.\"\nYou are my heroes. I'm here for you. ~ TJ", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 29, "rating_average": 4.7586, "rating_total": 138.0}
