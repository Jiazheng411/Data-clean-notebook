Laura's role requires lingerie, soft music and candlelight. Her job is to entice him, to determine if the suppressant tamps down his desires. Rather than cooling the flames of lust engulfing them, their \"antidote\" only heats them up . . . and there's only one scandalous way to deal with it!Suddenly long days of laboratory work are giving way to sizzling nights of sensual experimentation—and a different kind of \"chemistry\" that leaves Jay and Laura breathless and gasping for more! Their professional careers may depend upon a successful climax—and there are dangerous competitors determined to steal their research. And maybe their pleasure games have gotten a bit out of control.But who in her right mind would want to pull the plug on her man's libido when the loving is this deliciously hot?", "related": ["B00KFP9EPW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dan, an expert on Jewish mysticism and winner of the 1997 Israel Prize, carefully explodes several misconceptions. He begins by separating religion from mysticism. In current usage, he says, \"someone who prays is religious; someone who really means it is a mystic.\" But the basic attitudes of mysticism often contradict those of established religion: the mystic distrusts language, logic and thought, certain that those vehicles cannot lead to the revelation of God's nature. \"Mysticism is that which cannot be expressed in words, period,\" states Dan succinctly. He further distinguishes between mysticism and Kabbalah, noting that though many mystics were Kabbalists, Jewish mysticism began a thousand years before Kabbalah. Mysticism, he stresses, is a Christian term that has no parallel in Judaism; Jewish mysticism is the \"invention of contemporary scholars dealing with comparative study of religion.\" A comprehensive introduction explains the historical development of mysticism from antiquity to modern times, and delineates its leaders, texts and theology. Over 25 selections reflect the remarkable scope of Jewish mysticism, from the visions of Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Ishmael to the secrets of the Zohar; from apocalyptic, messianic and magical texts to the vibrant writing of four contemporary Israeli poets an unconventional inclusion. This volume will appeal to any serious reader of mysticism.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Answer: A lot. The Quotable Bitch celebrates these audacious women by gathering their wisdom and humor in a smart book filled with the words of Madonna, Gloria Steinem, Angelina Jolie, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Tallulah Bankhead, Joan Crawford, Erma Bombeck, Molly Ivins, and many more. Like the women emblazoned on its pages, The Quotable Bitch is a sly and straight-shooting collection of affirmations for women on the edge, divas, and goddesses ­everywhere. One part brazen humor and two parts bitchiness, The Quotable Bitch is an amusing and thought-provoking must-read for women of all ages.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The love that Wind (a teacher and minister in Germany) feels for her subject shines through her every word, but she never lets the book slip into hagiography. The portrait of the martyr that emerges is one of an independent, driven, tormented man, given to narcissism. Of particular interest to readers more acquainted with Bonhoeffer's life will be the accounts of his early career in Spain, Britain and the United States; Wind details the impact, for instance, of his time at Union Theological Seminary in New York, where he encountered racism. Ultimately, Bonhoeffer gave up a comfortable, safe teaching job in the United States to return to stand with his nation in its time of trial, speaking out as early as 1933 against the treatment of the Jews. Bonhoeffer's example continues to inspire, and Wind's book shows readers why. Well-researched and documented, using sources not available in English, and written in a breezy, conversational style, it should appeal to a broad audience.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We can't go anywhere without something poppin' off—and that includes just standing at the bus stop in the morning on the first day of school.\"What? Ain't nobody scared of you!\" Tyler snaps back, eyes blazing up at Billie—a girl who's six inches taller and fifty pounds heavier.\"Little girl, you better get outta my face,\" Billie growls, slipping off her earrings.My second best friend, Kierra, and I roll our eyes and stomp over to break it up before things get out of hand.\"Fight!\" One overeager chick, watching from the sidelines, screams out causing a stampede at the bus stop this morning. Everyone picks up the chant, \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\"There's no doubt in my mind that Billie can snap my girl in half without even thinking about it. She's just weighing whether giving Tyler a beat down is worth another trip to juvie.\"Come on, girl. Squash this.\" I clamp a hand onto Tyler's wrist and attempt to pull her away. But like always, Tyler has to put on a good show to save face.\"Get off me, Anje,\" Tyler shouts. \"I want to hear her talk smack in my face since she's so good talking behind my back! Up here trying to say I let some boys I don't even know run a train on me!\"\"Oooh,\" the crowd instigates.Okay. That is foul. Billie is wrong for that. A lot of these girls get Tyler twisted because being a semi-tomboy she has a lot of guy friends. It's messed up that people think just because you hang with guys means you're doing something with them.\"Let it go,\" I said, mainly because I'd like our first day to be drama-free, plus I can see our bus coming up the street.\"Yeah,\" Kierra says, brushing her long bangs out of her eyes. \"She's not worth it. Everyone knows Billie is a liar.\"\"Oooh,\" the crowd jeers.\"Who the hell you calling a liar?\" Billie says as she turns her hostility toward us. \"Everyone knows that the BFFs do everything together. You guys probably tag teamed up on Wayne and Freddie.\"Kierra twirls around with her hands on her hips. \"Ain't nobody studin' Wayne and Freddie. You're just mad cuz he dumped you cuz your kitty kat smells like fish!\"Billie swings so fast and so hard that it is amazing Kierra manages to duck the first blow. But after that, it is on. I throw my brand-new Wal-Mart book bag down and jump into the mix.Of course, so does Billie's crew.I feel a few punches land against my head and stomach and someone grabs a fistful of my microbraids. All in all, we hold our own—that is until the school bus arrives and our new bus driver, Mrs. Barksdale, takes over and directs the other kids to pull everyone apart.Mrs. Barksdale still buses us to school. When we get there, Billie is taken to the school nurse and Tyler, Kierra and I end up in the principal's office. Billie's crew gets off free and clear.Typical.Our first day at Maynard Jackson High, a day the BFFs officially becomes high school chicks, and this is how it goes down.So far, it looks like a repeat of junior high where the slightest thing sets Tyler off, sweet but clueless Kierra thinks she's too cute for school, and I, Anjenai Legend, worry about everything from grades to lunch money, and how to stop being such a disappointment to my granny, who's struggling to raise me and my four brothers.I'm not doing so good in that last category.Still, what am I supposed to do? You mess with one of us, you mess with all three of us. That's the rule. That's how it's always been. I look to my girls on my right and know that no matter what goes down, we have each other's backs. Best Friends Forever. No three words have ever been truer.While most chicks tend to have a different BFF every other week, that nonsense doesn't go on with us. We've been inseparable since our KidsRKids Daycare Center days. I remember momma telling me stories that whenever we got together, they'd called us the giggling babies trio.It's goofy, I know, but I don't doubt that it's true. However, our giggling days are long gone. The last fourteen years can only be best described as hell. Parents dying, parents locked up and parents who just flat-out jump ship has only strengthened our bond. Most times, it feels as if all we have are each other.That's still two more than what a lot of people have.The school bell rings, and I drop my head into the palm of my hands with a groan. \"We're going to be late for homeroom.\"Tyler just clucks her tongue and adjusts her ponytail. \"Chill, Anje. It's not like it's a real class or nuthin'.\"True, but Tyler is missing the point, and there's no point in me trying to explain it. Sometimes I wonder where Tyler stores all that sass and attitude. The girl is just five-foot nothing and not quite 100 pounds, but she has the thickest, shiniest hair you've ever seen on a black girl that didn't come out of a pack from the hair store. She's tomboy-cute and, like me, don't care too much for makeup and the whole nine.Kierra, on the other hand, has bought or stole every shade of everything from our local Rite Aid pharmacy. Words like Fuchsia Poplin, Bronze Rust and Raspberry Sugar flow out her mouth on the regular, to which Tyler and I respond with deer-caught-in-headlights stares. But I got to hand it to her, when it comes to fashion, my girl's got skillz. She can take a look, any look, out a those fancy fashion magazines and copy it—plus add her own dash of flavor—just by looking at it.She says she going to be a big-time fashion designer one day, and I believe her.Me? Well, I don't know what the heck I'm going to be. Right now, I just want to get through high school with as few trips to the principal's office as possible.\"Jeez. How much longer are they gonna keep us out here?\" Tyler whines, glancing up at the huge black-and-white clock high on the wall next to the bell. \"I don't even see how they can punish us for a fight that didn't even take place on school property,\" she continues to complain.Kierra finally lifts her nose out ofBlack Hairmagazine to agree. \"Me, neither. I can see it if we were on the bus or something, but standing outside our apartment complex? It's bullshit.\"I kind of agree and hope that our new bus driver, Ms. Tattletale, was overreaching her authority when she dragged us in here and told us to wait. We each folded our arms and waited to do battle with the powers that be, knowing full well that grown-ups like to make up rules on the fly and that we'd probably lose.A rail-thin woman with a pixie cut emerges from behind the long counter in front of us, standing up as she reaches for the stationary microphone and punches a button. Behind her, the intercom squawks.\"Morning students. On behalf of Principal Vincent and the teachers, I'd like to welcome you to the first day of the new school year at Maynard Jackson High School. Today's lunch special…\"I turn to my girls on my right and give them a crooked smile. It's official. We're now high schoolers.\"The last day to drop or change classes will be this Wednesday. You'll need to come to the registration desk in the principal's office…\"The door to my left busts open, and I jump in my hard plastic chair.\"In you go,\" a woman commands.Three girls with identical light-skinned olive complexions and silky straight hair march into the office.The obvious leader is tall with a fully developed body that I normally see dropping it like it's hot on those BET rap videos. Her thick, long hair is dyed a dirty, honey-blond and is iron-straight. She's pretty but wears a ton of makeup like my girl Kierra. The only flaw, in what would be considered a killer body, is her chest. It's flatter than a pancake, but that doesn't stop her swagger. She's pretty and she knows it.The two girls trailing behind her are also video knockouts with petite bodies (more endowed, though) and dressed in clothes that even I recognize from Kierra's latest fashion magazines.\"I wonder who they are,\" a breathy Kierra whispers in my ear. I literally feel her bubbling with excitement at the possibility of making new friends.\"Who cares?\" Tyler says loud enough for the mystery girls to hear.Goldilocks cast a bored, hazel-eyed gaze in our direction and rakes us over with obvious contempt.So much for making new friends.Kierra jabs an elbow into Tyler's side and hisses, \"Cut it out.\"Blondie and her cohorts round their attention to Tyler. But before any more words are exchanged, the woman behind the registration counter turns off the intercom and interrupts us.\"Phoenix, you're in here early. I thought surely I wouldn't see you until at least first period. That's about the time your brother shows up.\"As it turns out, this Phoenix even has perfect teeth, I notice, when she turns on her megawatt smile. \"Hello, Ms. Callaway. It's so nice to see you, too.\"Ms. Callaway's sarcastic smile vanishes from her lips. \"What did they do, Nance?\"The stout woman trailing behind the girls is wearing a dark blue on light blue uniform with a butch buzz cut. Security?\"Caught 'em smoking in the girls' bathroom upstairs,\" the woman says, settling her hands on her hips.\"You did not!\" Phoenix barks, pivoting toward the security woman with her hands on her hips. \"You walked into a smoky bathroom and jumped to conclusions. You have no proof that we were the ones smoking!\"\"I can smell it on you,\" the woman responds.\"I can smell it on you, too,\" the girl snaps back.Okay, I have to hand it to her. The girl doesn't take crap off anybody.\"All right. All right,\" Callaway says. \"Just go over there and sit down.\" She directs them to another row of chairs on the opposite wall from us. ...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kit Farr, a present-day Oxford graduate student, stumbles on reports of a real-life murder case--the unsolved butchery of Eliza Grimwood, a London prostitute, in 1838, a half-century before the Ripper crimes. Kit, who believes the killing may have been inspired by Bill Sikes's murder of Nancy in Dickens's Oliver Twist, enlists a new love-interest, mathematics lecturer Joe Leppard, in her researches. but the Grimwood case takes a backseat to Kit and Joe's budding relationship. That Kit makes a major mistake in her thesis doesn't reinforce her credentials as a sleuth. Romance readers will be more satisfied than mystery fans. (Nov.) (c)Copyright © PWxyz, LLC.

A prominent feature is the discussion of the folkways of various ethnic groups that came to this country. In the opening chapter, the authors identify seven major groups (and several smaller ones) that immigrated to British North America and how they helped create a pluralism that is one of the most important cultural characteristics affecting the history of the United States. They divide the country into sections and present gripping descriptions of lifestyles, along with statistics. The chapters that follow relate the day-to-day responsibilities and roles played by fathers, mothers, children, and servants and slaves. Excerpts from diaries, journals, letters, etc. are included, and endnotes follow each chapter. New interpretations of previously published studies prompt the authors to question older views of Colonial life, and they frequently use the word revision. Average-quality black-and-white photographs and reproductions are scattered throughout. The dense textual layout, the vocabulary, and scholarly references combine to make this book of interest to advanced students with some background knowledge of American Colonial history.–Patricia Ann Owens, Wabash Valley College, Mt.

Her novels have been published in seventeen countries* in eleven languages, and have earned critical acclaim around the world. Her non-fiction writing has appeared in The Australian Literary Review, Vogue, ELLE, The Australian Women's Weekly, SMH and The Australian, among other publications. She also finds time to write her own blog, The Book Post. Her next novel will be published in November this year.  Moss hosts the true crime documentary series Tough Nuts - Australia's Hardest Criminals on the Crime & Investigation Network, and as 'Ambassador of Crime' for 13th STREET Universal Channel, Moss hosts Tara Moss in Conversation where she interviews her fellow bestselling crime authors from around the world, giving an intimate look at what makes successful thriller writers tick. She also recommends crime novels at her online book club Tara Moss Recommends, on the 13th STREET Universal website. She previously hosted the international crime documentary series Tara Moss Investigates on the National Geographic Channel.  Writing has been a lifelong passion for Moss, who began penning gruesome \"Stephen King-inspired\" stories for her classmates at 10. She went on to an international career as a fashion model before pursuing professional writing, first earning a Diploma from the Australian College of Journalism in 1997, and in 1998 winning the Scarlet Stiletto Young Writers Award for her story, Psycho Magnet. Moss wrote her debut novel, Fetish, when she was 23. Her novels have been nominated for both the Davitt and the Ned Kelly crime writing awards, hit #1 on numerous bestseller lists, and made her Australia's #1 selling crime writer several years running. Her in-depth research has seen her earn her private investigator credentials (Cert III) from the Australian Security Academy, tour the FBI Academy at Quantico, spend time in squad cars, morgues, prisons, the Hare Psychopathy Lab, the Supreme Court and criminology conferences, take polygraph tests, shoot weapons, conduct surveillance, pass the Firearms Training Simulator (FATSII) with the LAPD, pull 4.2 G's doing loops over the Sydney Opera House flying with the RAAF, and acquire her CAMS race driver licence. Stopping at nothing to research and 'experience' scenes for her latest novel Siren, Moss was set on fire by Hollywood stunt company West EFX, and choked unconscious by Ultimate Fighter 'Big' John McCarthy. She has conducted hundreds of talks at literary festivals, schools and universities, discussing her research experiences and writing career.  Born in Victoria, BC, Moss is a dual Australian/Canadian citizen, and is the first writer to have a star on the Australian Walk of Fame. She divides her time between Sydney, Los Angeles and her hometown in Canada. When not researching and writing her next novel, Moss enjoys riding her 900cc Triumph Scrambler motorcycle, spending time with her pet python, Thing, and serving as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador (since 2007) and ambassador for the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children (since 2000). She is married to Australian poet and philosopher Dr. Berndt Sellheim.  (*Moss's novels have so far been published in the USA, Canada, UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, France, Russia, Romania, Hungary, Czech Republic, Croatia, Japan, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand.)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sales of painkillers, anti-depressants,\nrelaxants and mood elevators of all kinds are in the multi millions each year.\nDespite our best efforts to avoid misery, it is forced upon us sooner or later.Philosophically, we try to deal with the\nreality of suffering in various ways. \"You have to take the rough with the\nsmooth,\" is one popular approach we often hear. Still, we would prefer no rough\nat all, and when it comes we want to be out of it as soon as possible.Another problem with\nthe populist philosophy of roughness and smoothness is that it offers no answers\nas to why suffering is there in the first place. Especially when we consider\nthe suffering of the apparently innocent and good. We can usually accept that\nthe cruel and vicious deserve to suffer, and most people would like to see them\nget their just deserts. This explanation of suffering is reflected in the\nincreasingly accepted doctrine of karma, \"what goes round, comes round\", or\n\"you get what you give\". But how do we account for the sometimes terrible pain\nand suffering of those who seem not to deserve it at all, especially, for\nexample, children? The recent tsunami disaster was a poignant example. So many\napparently innocent children, and even religious people, swept away. The great\nwave made no distinctions in its path of death and destruction.In this book I examine a number of possible answers. Drawing primarily from the ancient\nSanskrit text,Bhagavad-gita, as well as from other scriptures, and\nlooking at the works of old and modern philosophers, I try to solve the\never vexing problem, 'Why do good people suffer?'I take it even\nfurther and look at why anyone suffers, why suffering exists at all. For me\nthere is an answer, a rational answer that is found in all the sacred\nwritings I have seen. It is my belief that suffering can be reconciled with the\npresence of a just and caring God, a person who is always with us and always\nacting only out of love. I hope to show that here, along with the ultimate\ninadequacy and failure of all alternative suggestions.As well as that I present what I have seen offered as the solution to suffering; a means to\nremove its root causes, once they have been properly identified. I hope to show\nhow we can change our very view of life's setbacks and reversals. Rather than\nseeing them as suffering, we can come to accept them as a springboard for inner\nspiritual growth.What I have\nunderstood from my research and personal spiritual search over the last 30 years is that we are not meant to suffer. Misery is not our natural, healthy\nstate. Our original and pure condition is one of complete and ever enduring\nhappiness. Surely our constant endeavour to avoid pain should be evidence\nenough of this truth, of the fact that misery is simply not natural to us.I certainly make no\nclaim to have a perfect understanding of the truth, but merely want to share\nwhat I have found to be a profoundly life-changing philosophy, one that\nencourages healing and self-development, gives us tangible tools to achieve our\ninner growth, and also the fortitude to face all difficulties with equanimity.\nI hope and pray that it will serve at least some of my readers in the same way.Krishna Dharma", "related": ["B00JF5X99K"], "rank": 227609, "title": "Why Me?: Making sense of suffering", "author": "Krishna Dharma", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It had taken me over two years and many pints of blood. It was three months to the day after 9/11, I'd been out of work for four and I'd just been told I didn't have cancer. So-I exhaled. I sat down at the desk and started making stuff up, just for fun. Pretty soon, I was writing a chapter a day and sending it to a friend on email so we could share it and howl.The book is wonderful to me because it's an example of what the story is about-the joys of improvisation. And it's wonderful because I'm madly in love with every major character in the thing. Except me. I play the fool, which I always do. I suspect I make my main characters idiots in the hope that the real me will seem dignified by comparison. But I have a huge admiration for the woman who was the inspiration for Nora and a hole in my heart to this day for the man who was the model for Nikos.His widow, in real life, doesn't like the book or the portrait of him and I understand that. It's surely a caricature-the whole book is a caricature. It's the most straightforward farce/satire I've ever written. But I caricatured something that was very real and for which I'm very grateful. My teacher (and second father) Papa Joe saw something worthwhile, worthy of consideration, in every person or thing that crossed his path. Even better, he saw the humor in absurdity that transformed the things that drive us all crazy into moments of pleasure, of grand tear-dripping cathartic laughter. If you were in his presence, he would force you simply by that pleasure  to see the world through those rich eyes of his. He bestowed that blessing on everyone who knew him. It's the essence of  art and the part of him that I miss almost every day (and that I hear  inside my head whenever I take the time to listen). So thanks Joe-maybe I'll get around to a better portrait someday. In the meantime, this one still makes me laugh.On that note, I highly recommend 'Sullivan's Travels.' Preston Sturges, Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake. No civilized human being-and certainly, no person who thinks 'seriously' about art-should live a life without seeing it at least once. Better on a movie screen, if you can find a theater that shows 1940′s films.", "related": ["B008L2KQP8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Since\nday one she had intended on dropping into Macy's--wonderfully impersonal\nMacy's--to see if she could wear any of the Fite line--but not in a\nRockridge boutique with the help of a starved Amazon with buttocks like\nhalved cantaloupes, and certainly not with him looking on.\"This one is totally the best for D cups. And up.\" The clerk held up a\nwhite bra that looked more like a very small, thick, short, sleeveless\nt-shirt.\"That's quite a lot of coverage.\" Bev took it from her. \"How do you get into it?\"\"You just have to kind of pull like really, really hard. Over your head,\" she said. \"I can help if you get stuck.\"\"That won't be necessary.\" Liam put his hand on Bev's shoulder and\nguided her towards the back of the store. \"The changing rooms are over\nthere.\"Alarmed he was following so close, Bev said, \"You can wait up at the\nfront. Or better yet, go catch your train. No reason for you to be\nhere.\"\"Oh, I think there is.\" The corner of his mouth twitched.Bev slammed the changing room door in his face and locked it. She kicked off her shoes and turned away from the mirror to pull off her\n jeans. The walls that weren't mirrored\nwere covered with artistic, enlarged photographs of naked athletes in\nmotion, just to drive home the message that you really, really weren't\none of them.Well, Bev wasn't falling for it; they wouldn't insult her into feeling\nbad about herself. She got her feet into the leg holes of a pair of\npants and tugged them upward, then unhitched her bra and began the\nstruggle to fit the compression top over her chest. At one point both\nbreasts were shoved nearly down to her belly button like stretched water\n balloons, but she reached down and pulled them up into the high-tech\nembrace of the sixty-four dollar bra and felt fairly confident she would\n be able to remove it herself.\"You all right in there?\" Liam 's voice was too close to the door for comfort. \"I heard noises.\"Just the sound of my breasts deflating.\"I'm fine.\" She jerked a\nt-shirt off the hanger and pulled it over her head. With her breasts in\ncaptivity, the slippery shirt slid down over her chest without a fight,\nand, bracing for the worst, she turned to squint at herself in the\nmirror.She groaned. Why did they put elastic bands all over the place? With\nwaistbands so low on her hips they would give a Rodin sculpture fat\nrolls?\"I don't think so,\" she muttered, turning to look at her rear end. \"Yikes.\" Butt cleavage was not a trend she was going to embrace, no\nmatter how many apparel companies she inherited.Liam rattled the door. \"Let me in.\"\"No! I already took it off.\"The doorknob turned. \"Then put it back on, because I'm coming in.\"The damn door came unlocked. She threw her body against it. \"Stay out there. What the hell do you think you're doing?\"\"If you don't want me to see skin, then put something on. I'm coming in.\"\"Damn it.\" With one foot pushing the door closed, she craned across the\ndressing room to grab the next top and pull it on. It was as tight as\nthe first, but only half as long. Her freakishly narrow waist--the one\nhe had been fondling earlier--was exposed no matter how hard she pulled\nit down. \"You gave me a kid's size!\"\"They don't have kids' sizes here.\" And then he was standing in the open\n doorway. Big and looming and looking her over. \"Interesting.\"She stretched up to her full height and glared at him. \"They need to fix the locks in this place.\"He continued to stare. \"Turn around.\"\"Liam--\"\"If you want to be in apparel you'll have to get over this prissy self-consciousness.\"\"Prissy? Tell you what. You put this getup on. Then we'll see prissy.\"\nShe pulled him all the way inside and shoved the door closed. At least\nthe rest of the store didn't have to see her.\"The rise is all wrong. Did you put them on backwards?\"\"The only problem is that I'm wearing them at all. Get out of here and I'll take them off.\"To her horror he stepped right up behind her, stuck his finger under the\n waistband right at the flesh above her hip, and pulled the fabric away\nand over to read the tag. \"And these are a large, too. They don't come\nin an XL.\"\"Yet another miscalculation. Not that extra width would do anything for\nme. They seem to have put all the fabric for the waist down at my\nankles.\" Her feet were buried under the flared legs. \"Am I supposed to\nwear heels with them while I'm doing my marathons? They seem a bit\nlong.\"Engrossed in the clothing on her body, he didn't lift his eyes to her\nface once as he continued his perusal. \"And the top is a bit short on\nyou too, isn't it?\"\"Maybe it's a hat.\"Again ignoring her personal space, he stuck his fingers under the bottom\n hem of the shirt and pulled. The rough tips of his fingertips brushed\nher ribcage and she shivered--not that he noticed. He stuck his hands up\nhigher, to the bottom band of the compression bra underneath, and\nwiggled his finger under that elastic. \"This bra is a best-seller. If we\n change it, even a little, we get complaints,\" he said, then abruptly\npulled his fingers out and stepped back. \"Jump.\"Unnerved by the shock of his hands on her body, she blinked. \"What?\"\"Jump. Something high-impact. Don't worry, there's a hospital just down the street if you pass out or break something.\"\"I am not going to jump.\"He narrowed his eyes. \"Jump, or I tell the design team you've got the muscle tone of a Cabbage Patch Doll.\"\"I'd fire you.\"\"It would be worth it,\" he said. \"Jump.\"To hell with him. Just because she hated exercise didn't mean she was\nincapable. She bent her knees and sprung upwards, did it again just to\nshow him she could, then stood with her hands on her surprised hips,\nglaring at him.But he was smiling. And from the way he was pinching his lips, she saw\nhe was on the verge of laughing. \"Thank you. That was great.\"She jabbed him in the shoulder. Hard as a rock, of course. \"Now get out of here.\"\"Could you do it again? You moved so quickly--really, quite a blur--I didn't get to see if the bra worked on you.\"\"Out.\"Shaking his head, he leaned over and took another pair of pants off the hook. \"Now try these on.\"\"Face it, Liam, the company just doesn't make clothes for average women. They're not even close.\"\"That's what I'm afraid of. Though, let's be honest, Bev--you're hardly\naverage.\" He thrust the pants into her arms. \"We've been getting returns\n on these for being too big. Act like the businesswoman you're\npretending to be and try them on please.\" Then he turned around and\nfaced the door, crossing his arms over his chest.\"You aren't staying in here--\"He unhooked a hand and looked at his wrist. \"I've only got another ten minutes.\"She stared at his back. He thought he could intimidate her. Never\ndropping her gaze, she bent over and wriggled out of the pants.", "related": ["B00DK41PRA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 14, "rating_average": 3.9286, "rating_total": 55.0}

Beginning with a mere 25 people, he saw God bless his simple, yet consistent style of teaching straight through the Bible. Today Calvary Chapel draws over 20,000 attendees weekly. With a genuine heart for the lost, Pastor Chuck made room in his ministry for a generation of hippies, surfers, and drug addicts. This generated a stirring of the Holy Spirit which spread from the California coast to the Atlantic and beyond. This movement was instrumental in bringing thousands of young people to Jesus Christ during the 60s and 70s in what was known as the Jesus People Movement. As God expanded his ministry, Pastor Chuck s visionary leadership saw the birth of other ministries such as: The Word for Today, a publishing/radio broadcasting ministry which is heard worldwide; Calvary Distribution, a wholesale Christian book and resource distributor; and Calvary Chapel Outreach Fellowship, an international organization with over 1,500 Calvary Chapels participating. A noted speaker and the author of over 25 books, Pastor Chuck can be heard daily on television, radio, and webcasts throughout the world Chuck Smith is the senior pastor at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, California, and has been a Bible teacher for more than sixty years.

Each book can be read separately and is designed to be a full story on its own. They can be read in any order, but to get the full picture of everything that has happened over the course of several hundred years, you will need to read all of them. I have fallen so desperately in love with these characters that I can't stop writing about them.I do hope that you, the reader, will enjoy reading this tale as much as I have enjoyed penning it. All that I ask is that you please take the time to leave a quick review. Knowing how my readers feel about the storyline and the characters not only helps me to decide which direction future stories will go, but also gives me the much needed encouragement to keep writing.Thanks so much for taking a chance on me and my work.

Before she could get a divorce, her husband had run up a $300,000 debt to a high level drug dealer, and the man is now after her for the money. To hide, she left her empty Hollywood life for her late father's home in the hills of Arkansas. Moving in with her Aunt Rudy, she tried to get over her fear and restart her writing career. Ben Hatfield is a widower. When he learns of Katherine's situation, he can't help but want to protect her.This is a great romance. Nothing is rushed in the growing relationship. They slowly learn about each other and how to open up to someone again. Katherine's marriage had been a disaster as her soap opera actor husband slipping further and further into drugs. Ben's last memory of his wife was their fight just before she drove off and died in a car accident. I like the way Ms. Murphy brings them back from their pasts. They both need to start living again to be able to appreciate each other.Ben's closest family, the grandfather who raised him and is now dying, and his police officer cousin, Kenny, are secondary characters who bring great reality to the story, especially Ben's relationship to his grandfather. The book is about romance, not sex, and Ms. Murphy does it very well. You'll really come to care for Katherine and Ben as their personalities come through and they learn to love each other. The action at the end of the book is also very well done. This is one that I'm marking as a keeper to reread. I know you'll enjoy it.Overall rating:Sensuality rating: Mildly sensualReviewer:Kathy F.June 24, 2011", "related": ["B00HPZTU7M"], "rank": 3134390, "title": "Kinfolk", "author": "Lee Ann Sontheimer Murphy", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The possibility of bloodshed at any moment keeps the story at an elevated level of suspense. Even the more languid moments move with a searing undertone.

It's clear Fleming has done his research and it shows in the seamless dialogue and the ease at which he tackles the task of conveying the wartime ambiance. This is a must-read for history buffs - although I feel strongly everyone will enjoy the rapid pace and captivating suspense. Fleming is a writer deserving of many accolades.\" SAN FRANCISCO BOOK REVIEW\"In Dynamite Fishermen, Preston Fleming depicts heedless violence as a way of life from the perspective of an American intelligence officer. The story falls during a lull in the long running Lebanese civil war, a period plagued by daily car bombings, civilian shootings, artillery attacks and other mayhem. As many details of this conflict continue to reverberate today, this intelligently written novel provides a compelling page-turner and a memorable story.\" PACIFIC BOOK REVIEW\"An intelligence officer who has dodged making decisions\nand cleaning up his messes is forced to face the consequences, showing resourcefulness\nand decency...at last when he must. Fleming does know how to spin a\nyarn... his fiction has more verisimilitude than many others in the genre.\" BOOKPLEASURES.COM", "related": ["B00DY9J6SQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 63.0}

I live in PA with my husband and college student daughter, a mini dachshund and a sun conyer parrot. I would like to tell you a little about myself. I came to writing by a circuitous route, starting out as an avid reader of JANE EYRE and WUTHERING HEIGHTS and GONE WITH THE WIND and REBECCA and any other similarly themed books I could find. I first worked as a teacher and then graduated from law school when I desired a more lucrative and independent career. I had always been discouraged from pursuing a writing career by the volatile nature of the business and the relatively poor chance for success. But the realization that I needed a focus for the future encouraged me to do what I had always wanted to do. I sold my fledgling novel to the first editor who read it, and I have been writing ever since. I have written all types of books for all types of people, but my favorite literary pursuit is and always has been romance. Nothing is as rewarding as hearing from my readers, so please use my website to communicate your thoughts and criticisms, as I am always eager to learn from you.    A romance novel rarely disappoints me: in an uncertain world filled with tragedy and sadness, reading about an appealing woman finding a strong man to love her and share her life is the perfect escape. I like to read and write stories in which the main characters overcome obstacles to get together, and then stay together because their mutual devotion cannot be denied no matter what else is happening around them. They always HELP each other and reinforce the quaint but enduring notion that love conquers all - at least in the fictional universe of my imagination. So pull up a chair and take down a book- or pick up a Kindle- and join me in a world where the heroes are tough and headstrong but never boorish and the heroines are feminine and sympathetic but never helpless.", "related": ["B00EW40SVG"], "rank": 381887, "title": "The Raven and The Rose", "author": "Doreen Owens Malek", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Man's car gets T-boned by a hit and run driver. Wife dies but man survives, though he suffers extensive brain trauma. Man, after ten-plus years of grueling therapy and multiple surgeries, miraculously regains the same IQ he had prior to the accident. This reads like a storyboard treatment for a film that Simon Lewis might have produced. The story is Lewis's own, however. Prior to the wreck that left him without a third of the right hemisphere of his brain, Lewis was a respected member of the Hollywood establishment, even though his roster mainly included B-movies (C.H.U.D. 2anyone?), and a film that was originally slated to go straight to video, but Lewis wisely championed,Look Who's Talking. Handily beatingField of DreamsandBorn of the 4th of Julyat the box office, it made then has-been John Travolta a household name again, ensuring that his Scientology dues would be paid on time. Despite its cinematic qualities, which author Chris Colin dutifully points out in this captivating Kindle Single about Lewis's recovery, this really is ananti-Hollywood story. Life is messy; it doesn't always have an ending you can tie up with a neat little bow. And, as much as you'll marvel at the enduring (and endearing) spirit of Simon Lewis,Blindsightwill have you equally awed at the almost \"science fiction-like\" capabilities--of the human brain. --Erin Kodicek", "related": ["B00IGDSWYO"], "rank": 537345, "title": "Blindsight (Kindle Single)", "author": "Chris Colin", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 3.9, "rating_total": 39.0}

That is, of course, if you count the two minutes between her and her identical twin. After many moves around the country she now lives in Winter Park, FL with her husband, two daughters and three dogs. Kathy enjoys playing tennis, gardening, and reading, though she’ll admit she was not a big reader until after graduating high school. “My mom read all the time and never understood why my sisters and I would much rather play then read. When I no longer used my imagination for play, I used it to drift away into music and books.”  Life changed dramatically for Kathy on January 12, 2009. Although the day started out like any other with the normal routine of getting her daughter ready for school and walking her dogs, it was interrupted by the swirling thoughts of a high school musician, the Vietnam War and rock and roll. Not exactly sure of what to do with the scenes being played out in her head, Kathy sat down at her computer and began writing. One year and 75,000 words later, her first novel IMAGINE was born.  As a first time writer, Kathy has experienced many days filled with doubt and confusion. She says God finds away to send her a sign to keep going. Whether it be a chance meeting with an elderly gentleman in a supermarket who turned out to be a self taught piano player, the e-mails from parents expressing how their teenage son or daughter never read a book in its entirety until they read IMAGINE, giving the opportunity to the students of Barrington High to create the cover design, or the many requests for a sequel, which is entitled SIMPLE MAN. Creating a world for TJ Hanson and his friends in IMAGINE and SIMPLE MAN has given Kathy the opportunity to incorporate her love of classic rock, her knowledge of the music industry gained from her years as a personal secretary to the Rolling Stones, and the desires of talented musicians, into a story she hopes will inspire people to follow their dreams.", "related": [], "rank": 5114643, "title": "Simple Man (IMAGINE Book 2)", "author": "Kathy  Picciano", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I was never one of those kids scribbling stories in a notebook, or submitting to the school paper. But I’ve always been a voracious reader. A few years ago, I realized I had some of my own stories to tell. I’ve been lucky enough to have participated in some fabulous crit groups, and to have attended the Taos Toolbox Workshop. I love reading. I love stories of adventure, stories that grab me and won’t let me go. Stories that will stay with me for years. Old and new, paper books, digital and comics – anything with a good story is fair game. And I love writing, telling stories, creating worlds and people and histories… and then doing terrible things to them! My background is in medieval history (Spanish manuscripts of the apocalypse, if you were wondering), but as I’m fond of being able to pay the bills, I work at our local university, as well some freelance work as a web designer. I live in Las Vegas, New Mexico (the smaller, older, and much quieter one) with my husband and our two cats and two dogs.

Kaplan has been right in the middle of these developments.

In addition to pushing the asset-allocation debate forward with his research, Dr. Kaplan has helped develop products and tools for institutions, financial advisors, and individual investors that have made it practical to put the concepts of asset allocation into everyday use.InFrontiers of Modern Asset Allocation, Dr. Kaplan brings together twenty-seven of his best articles and interviews. He divides the book into four parts—Equities; Fixed Income, Real Estate, and Alternatives; Crashes and Fat Tails; and Doing Asset Allocation—examining everything from how asset classes should be defined to whether they should be represented by market value–weighted indexes or other principles. The book also includes interviews with industry luminaries who have greatly influenced the evolution of asset allocation, including Markowitz, Roger Ibbotson, and the late Benot Mandelbrot.Frontiers of Modern Asset Allocationis essential reading for institutional investors, wealth managers, financial planners, and academics. It includes three appendices that put theory into action with technical details for new asset-allocation frameworks, including the next generation of portfolio construction tools, which Dr. Kaplan dubs \"Markowitz 2.0,\" in honor of the father of Modern Portfolio Theory.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book is definitely an attention grabber. The time spent reading it flew by as I became absorbed in the story, only putting it down when I reached the delectable ending. Brimming with complex characters, secrets, mystery, passion, wit, intrigue and romance, this beautifully written book has it all. Computer expert Fig and feisty nurse Roxie is a well matched couple and the chemistry between them is explosive. Unlike the heroes in many romance novels, Fig is not an alpha, but he is ideal for Roxie. Fans of this series are also reunited with Victoria and Kyle from the previous book, ONCE A GOOD GIRL. Although this story is part of a series, it can be read as a standalone. But for additional entertainment, do not miss the other books in this series; WHEN ONE NIGHT ISN'T ENOUGH and ONCE A GOOD GIRL. ~ Romance Junkies Blue Ribbon Rating 5.0", "related": ["B00D4MWFNG"], "rank": 1904704, "title": "The Nurse's Not-So-Secret Scandal", "author": "Wendy S.

His standards of reason and knowledge illuminate the hidden causes of many problems confronted by individuals and by societies collectively. His insights into the nature of sound reasoning have remained largely unappreciated because he expressed them in rich literary forms that make frequent use of enigma and ambiguity. My goal in this book has been to clarify his standards and explain the reasons for the pervasive ambiguities. Ironically, he used these devices to achieve clarity about the nature and limits of knowledge. It is my conviction that awareness of his standards of reasoning can contribute to greater rigor and practicality in our individual thinking and also in our collective dialogue.Herman Melville's Geniuswas written concurrently with my historical novel,Buried: The Discernment of Pagans in Ancient Rome, and though it's not obvious, the two books share similarities. The novel is set in the Roman world around 400 AD, but it investigates many of the themes used by Melville. It's my view that Melville's mature writings were deeply influenced by pre-Christian writers including Homer, Sophocles, Aristotle, and Zeno of Elea. Melville saw and appreciated the clarity of their worldview--which is inconsistent with the Christian worldview--and transferred that ancient wisdom from Homer's fleet of vessels on the wine-dark Mediterranean to the great sailing vessels on the Atlantic and Pacific during the nineteenth century. I examine his exploration of this topic throughout his works but focus onMoby-Dick;Pierre; \"Bartleby, the Scrivener\"; \"Benito Cereno\";The Confidence-Man;Clarel; andBilly Budd. All of these works consistently pursue the same theme and dramatize it using a remarkable range of literary tones, styles, and genres.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She believes that in return they should be treated with kindness, love and respect.Unlike many people, her love of animals did not begin in childhood, but began as a young married woman.\nShe describes it this way . . . As a child, we were never allowed to have animals, so I really didn't know much about them until I had children of my own.When we were a young couple with small children, we owned several cock-a-poos and went through all the joys and traumas that come with having a pet - including the loss of one when he was hit by a car. It broke my heart!The last dog we had with the children was a very small, black cock-a-poo with long wavy hair. He was so adorable, and particularly attached to my youngest son.\nOne very scary day, Brock, age 4, was suddenly nowhere to be found. We searched frantically around the house and yard, finally expanding the search to the neighborhood. Fortunately, we found him sauntering down the side of the street with his little dog following right behind him. It was a sweet moment filled with great relief and one that I will never forget.Wish I had a picture to share.Brock never lost his love for animals and is now a grown man, married, with two dogs and two cats, who all live in harmony with his high-energy three-year-old daughter.My more recent love affair with a pet has made me realize that training is critical (something we did not do with the earlier pets).

She wrote a series of unexpectedly popular books about her hobby of knitting under her maiden name Tessa Lorant, and patented two knitting aids. She is featured as one of a handful of knitters in Richard Rutt’s seminal A HISTORY OF HAND KNITTING. After her husband died of cancer Tessa wrote, at his request, her first non-knitting book, A VOICE AT TWILIGHT. This takes a look, not always solemn, at the experience of living – and dying – with the Big C. Tessa won the Oddfellows Social Concern Award for this book, and the prize was presented at the House of Commons. As family members kept telling her how like her husband the book sounded she thought she might be able to use that skill to write fiction. Tessa has now published six suspense novels and a family saga – a trilogy – set in North Germany and based on her mother’s family.  And she’s busy writing more books, both fiction and non-fiction.", "related": ["B007408GMI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Born and raised in Long Beach, California, I moved from that area at age 36 and spent the next 17 years near Sacramento, California.  In 2006, I transferred and moved to Texas. My adult working career began with seven years in retail banking starting as bookkeeping clerk and working through the various positions to operations officer.  Following that I worked three years in truck leasing starting as rental agent and moving up to district manager.  I finally started making a livable wage in 1982 when I went to work for a major oil company as an operator trainee at an oil refinery.  In 1989, I left the refinery to work at a cogeneration power plant and remain in that line of work today.  My industrial plant experience has included two years as shift supervisor, four years as operations supervisor, and two years as the operations manager of three facilities.   I’m currently an operator technician by my own choice and not because of any demotion.  I resigned from the operations manager job, spent some quality time with my kids, and then hired back in as a “B” operator.  That’s my preference at this stage of my life. With a total of fourteen years of management experience in three different industries, I’ve spent many years on both the “us” and “them” sides of the workforce and have thus formed my general opinions of management-types and the real workers, as I like to call them. I’m not an expert on safety and I’m not a safety professional.  I’m just a power plant operator that would like to see safety taken more seriously than what I’ve witnessed at some plants.", "related": ["B005RTXFTW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book begins with a brief history of the river from its discovery by Hernando de Soto in 1541.

He was seen as a champion of individualism and a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society, and he disseminated his thoughts through dozens of published essays and more than 1,500 public lectures across the United States. Emerson gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of Transcendentalism in his 1836 essay, Nature. Following this ground-breaking work, he gave a speech entitled The American Scholar in 1837, which Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. considered to be America's \"Intellectual Declaration of Independence\". Considered one of the great lecturers of the time, Emerson had an enthusiasm and respect for his audience that enraptured crowds. Emerson wrote most of his important essays as lectures first, then revised them for print. His first two collections of essays – Essays: First Series and Essays: Second Series, published respectively in 1841 and 1844 – represent the core of his thinking, and include such well-known essays as Self-Reliance, The Over-Soul, Circles, The Poet and Experience. Together with Nature, these essays made the decade from the mid-1830s to the mid-1840s Emerson's most fertile period. Emerson wrote on a number of subjects, never espousing fixed philosophical tenets, but developing certain ideas such as individuality, freedom, the ability for man to realize almost anything, and the relationship between the soul and the surrounding world. Emerson's \"nature\" was more philosophical than naturalistic; \"Philosophically considered, the universe is composed of Nature and the Soul.\" While his writing style can be seen as somewhat impenetrable, and was thought so even in his own time, Emerson's essays remain one of the linchpins of American thinking, and Emerson's work has greatly influenced the thinkers, writers and poets that have followed him. When asked to sum up his work, he said his central doctrine was \"the infinitude of the private man.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There is a wealth of information, a keen examination of theory, a critical disposition, and above all it  is interesting and engaging.\"Femi Oyebode, Professor of Psychiatry, University of Birmingham and National Centre for Mental Health, The British Journal of Psychiatry\"Overall, this is a book well worth acquiring. Voices occur within real people (with all their complexity), as books come from real authors. When we attempt to indulge the fantasy that we can talk of one without the other, we do a disservice to all concerned. McCarthy-Jones recognizes this and has written a book that has much to inform the reader and, most important, induces respect and empathy for those in our communities who are voice hearers.\"Dr Pádraig Collins, Community Adult Mental Health Services, PsycCRITIQUES\"This work invites the reader to consider and integrate evidence from history, neuroscience, psychology and voice-hearers: an endeavour which is made enjoyable by the engaging narrative and sometimes humorous commentary of the author throughout. McCarthy-Jones appears equally committed to thorough research, scientific evidence and the well-being of voice-hearers. This work is an indispensable resource for voice-hearers, carers, clinicians and researchers. Highly recommended.\"Psychosis\"... an epic, systematic and comprehensive treatise which is both fascinating and  informative ...\"Nick O'Connor, Australasian Psychiatry", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His stories are filled with unique fantasy elements, challenging vocabulary, humor, and mysteries that weave their way through all of the books in the Guardians of Elestra series.  His website, www.guardiansofelestra.com has more information about Elestra, including snippets from books in the library, prophecies, menus from Glabber's Grub Hut, and contests which allow readers to submit stories and artwork which may be displayed on the website and in a printed book. He will be adding a science fiction series (\"The Galactic Gourmets\") which finds spaceship captain Hugo Fitzboris in a race to deliver gourmet food throughout the galaxy while battling the cheese creatures under the guidance of King Gouda.  And, really, how many starships have you seen with a take-out window near their landing gear?

Chief Insp. Neil Paget (after 2008'sBreaking Point), Paget looks into a series of unsolved burglaries that have baffled the authorities in Broadminster. Before Paget can make much headway, someone bludgeons to death Laura Holbrook, co-owner of an engineering company, in the course of a break-in. When the victim's husband, Simon, acts suspiciously soon after getting the tragic news, Paget and his team begin to examine the possibility that Laura's murder was planned. There's no shortage of possible killers, including Laura's sister, who had her sights set on Simon, and Simon's attractive assistant, who was displaced when Laura joined the company. Another murder narrows the field a bit, but puts added pressure on the police to close the case. While many readers will identify whodunit before the inspector does, clean prose and credible characterizations keep the action moving smoothly to the end.(Apr.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I write adult and young adult urban fantasies, science/fiction and paranormal romances.  I've been an avid reader since a young child.  I began writing for personal enjoyment in college, where I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a degree in accounting.   My debut novel Concilium was published in July of 2012 followed by the sequel, Concilium: The Departure, in November 2012. Both are published through Museitup Publishing in e-book format. My debut young adult novel, PODs, is a post-apocalyptic, science-fiction romance and is available for Pre-Order now in paperback and e-book formats. It is published through Spencer Hill Press and will be released June 4th, 2013. My second title through Spencer Hill Press, Milayna, is a paranormal romance and is scheduled for release in paperback and e-book formats in March 2014.  I'm addicted to Reese's peanut butter cups and eat way too many while I write. I'm trying to kick the habit. So far I've tried replacing them with Twizzlers, but developed an addiction to Twizzlers and I'm still addicted to peanut butter cups.  I have a weird obsession with hoodies and can't write without wearing one. I hate to cook, but love to watch cooking shows. I love happy endings. There are too many sad endings in life. I'm an unabashed romantic. I love a swoon-worthy happy ending that will give me butterflies for days. I was born and raised in Flint, Michigan.  I now reside in a small community outside Houston, Texas with my incredibly supportive, not to mention gorgeous, husband, four amazing children, a 125-pound lap dog, and a cat that thinks she's queen.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

First published in 1916, this engaging classic tells the tale of a thin, pale 9-year-old orphan named Elizabeth Ann who is whisked away from her city home and relocated to a Vermont farm where her cousins, the \"dreaded Putneys,\" live. The Putneys are not as bad as her doting, high-strung Aunt Frances warns, however, and Elizabeth, who had been nurtured by her aunt like an overwatered sapling--positively blooms under their breezy, earthy care.Elizabeth Ann's first victories are small ones--taking the reins from Uncle Harry, doing her own hair, making her own breakfast--but children will revel in the awakening independence and growing self-confidence of a girl who learns to think for herself... and even laugh. Along the way, \"citified\" readers of all ages will get a glimpse into the lives of people who are truly connected to the world around them--making butter (\"We always bought ours,\" says Elizabeth Ann), experiencing the \"rapt wonder that people in the past were really people,\" and understanding the difference between failing in school and failing at life. Fisher is a wise, personable storyteller, steeped in the Montessori principles of learning for its own sake, the value of process, and the importance of \"indirect support\" in child rearing. She also captures the tempestuous emotional life of a child as few authors can, crafting a story that children will find deeply satisfying. And in the end, readers will have grown as fond of the happier, stronger \"Betsy\" as the gentle, unassuming Putneys have.Loving care was dolloped on this 1999 reissue of an old favorite--with sweet new pencil illustrations by Kimberly Bulcken Root, and an introduction and afterword by Eden Ross Lipson that offer a historical context for the book and its author.

My personal favorite story was 'Please Hold' and it had me laughing like a hyena at the end. If ever there was a case of someone getting what they deserve . . . But I digress.Old Friendsis sub-titled \"13 Coffee Break Stories\" because so many of the stories herein can be read during a typical work-day coffee break. If you are someone who likes to read during your coffee break, this will make an excellent addition to your collection of coffee break books. Beware, though: your co-workers may wonder why you are sitting in the corner laughing all by yourself! I stated above that my personal favorite is the story 'Please Hold', but in all fairness I have to confess that all the stories are potential contenders for the enviable designation \"favorite story\".Sally Jenkins was born to write. She is a natural story-teller, with an almost supernatural talent for the proverbial \"twist at the end\" of her stories. Having very recently read both of her short story compilations (to date), I can recommend her without reservation. She will entertain and amuse you with each tale she has written. You will understand why so many of the tales she has written have won awards; they are all good, commendable examples of the writer's craft. Get a copy of \"Old Friends\" today, and prepare to be entertained.", "related": [], "rank": 3035131, "title": "Old Friends - 13 Coffee Break Stories", "author": "Sally Jenkins", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I am an experienced manager who has had the problem of having delegated tasks bounced back to me - now I know what to do if that happens again.I would recommend this book to all new managers who want to learn to delegate and to experienced managers who want a quick refresher.Practical and relevant to the workplace - George 633A clear, concise guide, logical in its layout, that allows you to plan how to delegate in any workplace. Good use of real situations that help the reader to transfer into their work environment. Easy to read, it made me pause and consider how I can change my thought process. As I speak, I am creating a 'what task can I delegate list' in my head. Read it, this makes sense for a small investment in time and money.Interesting and helpful short guide - AlisonI found this short guide to delegation easy to read and it took no longer than 10 minutes to do so. It was well structured - the points and steps approach made it easy to digest and also to return to any sections if it was necessary to think again about a specific area. I particularly liked the way it made the manager think very carefully about what to delegate and to whom.  The emphasis on drawing in the member of staff so that they could see the mutual benefit of delegation was also good.A very helpful short guide both for new and also for experienced managers.", "related": [], "rank": 259561, "title": "Learn in Just 10 Minutes...How to Delegate.

She grew up in the big city of Des Moines, Iowa as the oldest of four kids.  While she didn't live on a farm, and in fact has never even been on a farm - she knew that every place had a purpose, every person had a story.  She wanted to tell those stories about all those places and people.  And while she was at it, give them all a happily-ever-after to boot. As life happened, she put aside her day dreams of writing those stories, but they were never too far away.  20+ years of marriage and two kids later, she decided it was time to put those stories on paper. Besides writing, Emleigh works a full-time job in a boring office but is still married to her wonderful husband with a beautiful daughter in college and a genius son still at home.  In her spare time, Emleigh reads obsessively - romance, of course - and spends time with her family.", "related": ["B007H9BATC"], "rank": 2819870, "title": "Trapped in My Dreams", "author": "Emleigh Walsh", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Together with “My Antonia,” “O Pioneers!” is the novel for which she is best known. The book takes place on the plains of Nebraska in the late 19th Century as the Prairie is settled be Swedish, Bohemian, and French immigrants trying to eke out a living from what appears to be a harsh, inhospitable land. The heroine of the book is Alexandra Bergson, who inherits her father's farm as a young woman, raises his three sons and stays with the farm through the harsh times to become a successful landowner and farmer. The book speaks of being wedded to the land and to place. In this sense it is an instance of the American dream of a home. It also speaks of a strong woman, of thwarted love, of the difficult nature of sexuality, and of human passion. There is also the beginning of what in Cather's works will become an increased sense of religion as a haven and a solace for the sorrow she finds at the heart of human endeavor. Above all it is a picture of stark life in the Midwest. There is almost as much blood-letting in this short book as in an Elizabethan tragedy. Cather's picture of American life on the plains, even in her earliest books, is not an easy or simple one. Some readers may quarrel with the seemingly happy ending of the book, though Alexandra’s happiness is not only bittersweet, but dearly bought. “O Pioneers!” is a thoughtful, well written story of immigrant life on the plains and of the sorrow pain, and strength of the American experience.", "related": ["B00BNBTG8C"], "rank": 1420427, "title": "THE SONG OF THE LARK (illustrated romance books)", "author": "Willa Cather", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He also co-authored several books with the masterful Clive Cussler including The Sea Hunters I and II, Golden Buddha and Sacred Stone - all New York Times best sellers. One of six children of an Air Force Colonel, Dirgo grew up on air bases in the United States and England before finally settling in Colorado. A part-time job washing and waxing classic cars led to meeting Clive Cussler, acclaimed author and founder of NUMA National Underwater and Marine Agency, a non-profit historical research foundation. When an opportunity arose to co-author a book about NUMA, Cussler asked Dirgo to take on the task. The result was the New York Times best seller, The Sea Hunters. This was followed by Clive Cussler and Dirk Pitt Revealed and The Sea Hunters II. While working with Cussler, Dirgo also began writing on his own and soon thereafter published his first John Taft adventure, The Einstein Papers. Taking some time away from ocean adventures and writing, Dirgo formed several small businesses, moved back to the mountains he loves and concentrated on skiing and hiking. In 2010-11, he skied 115 days thus achieving a lifelong goal of skiing more than 100 days in a season. In 2012 Dirgo published his first eBook novel, Gunnison Grit, a work of historical fiction set in Gunnison County, Colorado. He followed this work with re-issues in electronic format of The Einstein Papers and The Tesla Documents (originally published in paperback under the title Tremor.) Dirgo has several new projects on the drawing board, including a new John Taft action/adventure. Dirgo lives in The Rocky Mountains of Colorado.

Willie wants the world to know his story, maybe so he can clear his conscience or maybe so he can help others avoid the mistakes he made. But Willie has a big problem. He can barely tell his story in proper English, let alone write it down. Enter Christine Keleny, author and compassionate soul. She spends countless hours with Willie to decipher his attempts at his own notes and listens to his stories. The result is this incredible book, which is a true collaboration between a lost soul trying to find his way and an insightful, skilled writer able to present Willie's life to us in his unique \"Willie\" voice. She does the work of organizing his story, narrating parts of it while translating others, asking questions I wanted answered, and sharing her reflections about her journey with this man so different from her. Through Keleny's gift of knowing when to let Willie do the talking and when to let her own voice shine through, I came to understand the roller coaster life of a drug addict and a convict. I found him both admirable and despicable, endearing and aggravating; in other words, Keleny made him human. This was not an easy book to read, but it was an important book to read. Willie's story is one that we rarely hear told so honestly. Poverty, violence, misguided searches for love and acceptance, drugs, crime, recovery, broken support systems, falling back into destructive patterns, finding hope in the smallest of places...these are the pieces of Willie's life you will read about. But there is another reason to read this book. It illustrates the best in humanity--the kindness that one person can offer to another by giving the gift of time and talent to make an unlikely dream come true. Because of Keleny's willingness to do the hard work of collaborating with a man who didn't make it easy, that man's dream of having his story told to the world was realized. I truly hope the world gets to hear his story. --AmazonPlease meet Willie Lee Triplett. To say he is a character is a bit of an understatement. He is a genuine soul with a wry sense of humor, a tell-it-like-it-is attitude and is wise well beyond his fifty years. Willie has been homeless, been in jail, in prison and lived in halfway houses. He is a classy dresser, a hard worker and likes the ladies. He grew up in a family where \"drinkin' and druggin'\" were a way of life and is fighting like hell to stay clean and sober. Willie has been through inpatient and outpatient treatment for his addiction, and gone through AA, NA and other twelve-step programs. He has seen and learned alot and has much to share. Willie wanted his story told, hoping it could help other people battling addiction. A set of coincidental circumstances connected him to Christine Keleny, author of this, Willie's memoir. She has done a magnificent job. I like how well she blended Willie's own words with her insight and sometimes witty observations (providing welcome levity in some cases!). That Keleny and Willie were able to develop such a good relationship is testament to the warmth and heart found in this book. Their clever bantering back and forth almost makes them seem like siblings at times. This book will shock you, more than once. It may make you angry. It may make you laugh at some points, and it may make you cry. Every reader will feel and take what they need from this book. At the end, it left me a better person for having had a glimpse into Willie's life, and a healthy respect for those battling addiction of any kind. I'm rooting for you, Willie! --AmazonChristine Keleny has done a remarkable job telling Willie Triplett's story, not just because she's a good writer, but because she is able to bring understanding and compassion to a very difficult subject. --Amazon\"Living in the House of Drugs\" which I won from Goodreads Giveaways is a gritty, unabashed story of a recovering addict and alcoholic Willie Lee Triplett told through his words and writings, and given voice through his interaction with the writer. Willie candidly recounts his battle with addiction which began from the earliest years of his childhood when he was introduced to beer and \" a funny cigarette\" by his uncle. Living in a poor neighborhood with an uneducated mother who couldn't help him with his homework and was addicted to weed, Willie's beginnings are fraught with crime, and a downslide into an addiction that's difficult to recover from. Although this a heartrending story of a black man's fall into heavy drugs, his obsession with sex and the cost of their possession over his life, it's also about his struggle as he tries to resurrect his life from the ashes of his dependency. Through all the ugliness and despair Willy puts up a valiant fight wanting more out of life than the seductive control that drugs and loose women give him. Throughout the story the reader gets a glimpse of the man Willy could be; hardworking, humorous and affable. But these traits are undercut by a darker side that's seductive and controlling and leads him to continually relapse into his old habits. I liked the Willy that hides behind a proud swagger ,coarse speech and flirtatious spirit; the one that openly reveals his vulnerability, his insecurity, loneliness and lack of self-esteem as he reaches out for the life that sobriety and freedom from drugs can bring him. But it's the street smart petty criminal and his darker side that I have to come to grips with as a reader; the ongoing misdemeanours that lead to jail time and then probation, his quick temper that leads to fights, the abuse of his body with hardcore drugs, the illusion that weed and alcohol are a temporary substitute, and his sexual appetite which results in his ongoing relapses. Yet underneath the offences, the addiction, and his base desires lies a fifty year old man who strikes a chord in the heart of the reader as he struggles to clean up his life, to acquire a full-time job, to be educated and even to find out what love really is. It is Willy's tenacity , his dogged determination to turn his life around that endears him to those who want to help him. Through all the depravity and darkness of Willy's life he has always clung to a spark of hope through a faith I don't think he fully understands but nonetheless has kept him seeking sobriety. I admire the writer Christine Keleny for giving Willy the forum to tell a story that would probably resonant with many addicts. Although the book is hard to read at times because of Willy's graphic descriptions and his street language, it's well-worth exploring and I recommend it. --GoodreadsChristine Keleny has done a remarkable job telling Willie Triplett's story, not just because she's a good writer, but because she is able to bring understanding and compassion to a very difficult subject. Willie is the kind of person we love to hate - uneducated, drug addict, offender, homeless person - but Christine has reached down, past all those labels, to expose his humanity. Although the book is tiresome to read in some places (Willie tends to go on and on) it is important to look beyond the surface and really listen to what Christine and Willie have to say. Christine, through her skillful writing shows us that all people have value, that we must put aside our prejudices and look deeper to appreciate the human being that God has created. Willie, despite his rambling, also has moments of wisdom in which he points out the similarities between himself and the rest of the world. He says we're all looking for the same things - love, acceptance, a sense of importance - and we look for them in all the wrong places. --Amazon", "related": [], "rank": 2042778, "title": "Living in the House of Drugs eBook", "author": "Willie  Triplett", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Not only are people set free from the poison and bondage of sin, condemnation and all kinds of intimidation, (upheld, strengthened and reinforced by age old religious ideas born out of ignorance and deception,) but many are brought into a closer more intimate relationship with Father God, as Daddy, through accurate teaching, and unveiling of the gospel message, prophetic words, healings and miracles.  Rudi & Carmen are closely knitted together with several other effective Christians, church fellowships, and groups of believers who share the same revelation and passion to impart God’s TRUTH; to make disciples, and to impact the world with the LOVE OF GOD.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sandom founded the nation's first digital ad agency (Einstein and Sandom Interactive—EASI) in 1984, before launching an award-winning writing career. He is the author of nine thrillers and mysteries, including THE GOD MACHINE, GOSPEL TRUTHS and THE WALL STREET MURDER CLUB, plus the eco-thriller THE WAVE. Kirkus Reviews called THE WALL STREET MURDER CLUB \"A Big Apple Deliverance, endowing New York culture with all the corrosively dehumanizing power of Dickey's wild nature . . . Slickly entertaining right down to the last, inevitable twist.\" And Booklist said, \"(Sandom) writes with stunning elegance and nearly poetic beauty . . . A sure hit with any suspense reader.” [THE WALL STREET MURDER CLUB was optioned for Warner Bros. by Lee Rich for theatrical development; screenplay by Ronald Bass, with Joel Schumacher scheduled to direct.] Booklist called GOSPEL TRUTHS \"a splendid, tautly woven thriller . . . (and) an intelligent mystery of tremendous spiritual and literary depth.\" And Library Journal termed it, \"A masterful first novel, based on a true incident, which spins a complicated web of corruption, greed and deception.\" Caroline Thompson (author of Edward Scissorhands) said, \"Move over, Dan Brown . . . All hail J.G. Sandom . . . (THE GOD MACHINE) is a thrilling and breathless, rapturously-written and mind-blowing read. It’ll keep you up all night, turning pages as fast as your little fingers can manage.\" And the Historical Novels Review said, \"History galore, violence, and intrigue fill the pages of this tightly plotted, twisting and turning adventure story . . . THE GOD MACHINE is a very impressive historical thriller!” Kirkus said, \"Sandom’s strength lies in the verve of his story, with writing that has both muscle . . . (and) brains . . . (THE WAVE) races from improbable to crazywild, all in good fun, with Sandom always one step ahead . . . A story with enough manic energy to be worthy of a nuclear explosion.\" While known mostly as a writer of thrillers and mysteries, Sandom is also the author of several Young Adult (YA) novels, including the award-winning KISS ME, I’M DEAD and CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BODY SNATCHER. The Washington Post said, \"(Sandom) writes with a precision and delicacy unusual for YA fiction,” and called KISS ME, I’M DEAD “a subtle gem.” The author is currently working on a sequel to THE WAVE.

But through Blake's eyes, readers quickly learn that places like\nCharlotte, NC can be as gritty as they come. It's in these streets of this oft\noverlooked world where Blake portrays murderers and thieves alike as believable\ncharacters. Without judgment, he weaves humanizing back stories that serve up\ncompelling reasons for why a drug dealer might choose a life of crime. Readers of his work, speak\nof the roller coaster ride of emotions that ensues from feeling anger at\nempathetic characters who always seem to do the wrong thing at the right time, to\nkeep the story moving forward. In terms of setting, Blake's\nstories introduce his readers to spaces they may or may not be used to -\nstreetscapes with unkept, cracked sidewalks where poverty prevails, times are\ndepressed and people are broke and desperate. In Blake storytelling space,\nmorality is so curved that rooting for bad guys to get away with murder can\nsometimes seem like the right thing for the reader to do - even when it's not. Readers who connect with\nBlake find him to be relatable. Likening him to a bad-boy gone good, they see a\nstoryteller who writes as if he's lived in the world's he generously shares,\nreadily conveying his message that humanity is everywhere, especially in the\nunlikely, mean streets of cities like Charlotte.", "related": ["B00G9IYA5I"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 28, "rating_average": 4.8214, "rating_total": 135.0}

Few deep integrationists exist today though the desire in business and scholarship for these individuals and informative approaches is strong.  Deep integration provides the base of knowledge for this book. Deep means the author has held positions in finance, counseling, investing, community work, and education, among others. This allows him to present cross-disciplinary approaches that solve problems.  The work on social resistance training (Mystery wheel)  is the result of a 7 year study. His team of scholars included those from Harvard/Brandeis, Loyola, U Penn, MIT, the Project on Negotiation, and Cornell. This began a transformation within the field of conflict management. This turns every leader who wants to compete, and even win, into a coach of the main social powers outlined in this book.  Dr. Smith accesses the work of dozens of scholars in goal attainment, neuroscience, philosophy (but makes it simple), and nearly every other discipline to create a new story of life. That story is a simple \"into-great-ion\" of all we've learned since the beginning of the enlightenment.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She took a notebook with her on the train to make best use of her commute to work and wrote two historical novels before receiving an offer of publication for the second.

When she first began writing , she worked for a daily newspaper - \"The Cleveland Press\" - writing mostly community news. However, over time, she has graduated first to business publications, such as CBC Magazine and \"Crain's Cleveland Business.\" More recently, she has taken her journalist ventures on line, having her own blog http://htramer.com And she has also been doing a radio show on bbsradio entitled \"Reaching for the Gold.\" This program deals with aging, but that term is interpreted as broadly as possibly to create a wide interest. This book - Racing to Heaven - represents her first major foray into fiction writing. However, she has also written a text - Rounding the Circle of Love: Growing Up As She Grows Old - that focuses upon care giving for the elderly. As an instructor, she has gone from teaching classes with as many as 100 students to teaching strictly on line. And she has come to believe that the latter has some definite advantages in that it allows students to communicate their thoughts without feeling intimidated as might be the case in a more traditional classroom setting.  The schools where she has taught include: Cleveland State University, Cuyahoga Community College and the New School. She has Masters Degree in both Urban Studies and Communication.", "related": [], "rank": 5041725, "title": "Racing to Heaven", "author": "Harriet Tramer", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
