With more than 450 newspapers and his biweekly Newsweek column, Will may be the most influential writer in America.Will began his syndicated column with The Writers Group on January 1, 1974, just four months after The Writers Group was founded by Ben Bradlee and Katharine Graham. Two years later, Will started his back-page Newsweek column. In 1977, he won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary, for his newspaper columns, and garnered awards for his Newsweek columns, including a finalist citation in the Essays and Criticism category of the 1979 National Magazine Awards competition. He was also the recipient of a 1978 National Headliners Award for his \"consistently outstanding special features columns\" appearing in Newsweek. A column on New York City's finances earned him a 1980 Silurian Award for Editorial Writing. In January 1985, The Washington Journalism Review named Will \"Best Writer, Any Subject.\" He was named among the 25 most influential Washington journalists by the National Journal in 1997.Today Will serves as a contributing analyst with ABC News and has been a regular member of ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday mornings since 1981.Eight collections of his Newsweek and newspaper columns have been published: \"The Pursuit of Happiness and Other Sobering Thoughts\" (Harper & Row, 1978); \"The Pursuit of Virtue and Other Tory Notions\" (Simon & Schuster, 1982); \"The Morning After: American Successes and Excesses 1981-1986\" (Macmillan, 1986); \"Suddenly: The American Idea Abroad and at Home 1986-1990\" (The Free Press, 1990); \"The Leveling Wind: Politics, the Culture & Other News 1990-1994\" (Viking, 1994); \"The Woven Figure: Conservatism and America's Fabric, 1994-1997\" (Scribner, 1997); \"With a Happy Eye But ...

Kennedy School of Government at Harvard in 1981; \"The New Season: A Spectator's Guide to the 1988 Election\" (Simon & Schuster, 1987) which prefaced the 1988 presidential campaign; and \"Men at Work: The Craft of Baseball\" (Macmillan, 1989) which topped national best-seller lists in the number-one position for over two months. His book titled \"Restoration: Congress, Term Limits and the Recovery of Deliberative Democracy\" (Macmillan, 1992) argued for the need to limit politicians' time in office.Kindle blogs are fully downloaded onto your Kindle so you can read them even when you're not wirelessly connected.

In separate chapters, he examines  the philosophical and political contributions to the New Left of  five people: Dwight McDonald, C. Wright Mills, Paul Goodman,  William Appleton Williams, and Arnold Kaufman. The book's  preface discusses McDonald's writings after he left the  Communist Party in the 1940s and especially his ideas on  pacifism, \"radical individualism,\" and \"communitarian  anarchism.\" Against this backdrop, Mattson analyzes the thought  and political actions of Mills, Goodman, Williams, and Kaufman,  all of whom were instrumental in starting up New Left political  action movements, such as the Vietnam War protest  demonstrations, the university teach-in movement, and the  formation of SDS (Students for a Democratic Society). All four,  however, were repelled by the gratuitous confrontational tactics  SDS and similar groups adopted, and eventually they  disassociated themselves from their own creations. In the last  two chapters, Mattson outlines the decline and demise of the New  Left as a political movement, but he expresses a hope that the  New Left's main ideas will once again take root in \"a viable  democratic left,\" although he offers little explanation of how  this will happen.

You get a no-frills resource that is both easy to understand and highly informative. As with many such manuals, it's not necessary to read cover to cover (especially when the book's only shortcoming is its slightly repetitive tips and strategies) but, rather, to read the chapter about whichever personality causes stress in your life, from the anxious to the passive-aggressive, bullies, and narcissists. Whether the problem person is a chronic complainer, a fount of insults, or a perpetual martyr, you are guaranteed to find in-depth analysis, including what they do, why they do it, and strategies to help cope with that person in a positive, healthy way. The authors also have advice for people who recognize bothersome traits in themselves. McGrath and Edwards have avoided scientific jargon and created a handbook people can put to use immediately. There's nothing difficult about this book, except for the subject it gracefully explicates.(Mar.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After thirteen years I left NASA and joined a consulting firm in San Rafael CA, working mainly on air pollution issues for the EPA. By then I was irrevocably committed to the use of computers and the development of software. In 1999 I left the environmental field entirely and became involved in developing software for biotechnology and medical applications, which I continue to do part time. Starting in 2002, however, I decided to pursue another interest, that of writing fiction. I also joined a Taiko drumming group 15 years ago and have enjoyed playing since then.

As a volunteer, he supports community services to improve others' living conditions. As a counselor, he \"counsels\" in the traditional sense: advising, directing, and nudging--or pushing--others into facing and resolving their issues.Mr. FitzMaurice has a variety of formal and advanced training in counseling, which includes Addictions Counseling, Family Therapy, advanced Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), Transactional Analysis (TA), and over 1300 hours of diverse training for continuing education units (CEUs). To make the best use of that extensive training, he takes an integrative approach, grounding himself in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and using the other theories to build upon that one core theory, rather than focusing on multiple theories and mastering none of them.After more than twenty years in counseling, Mr. FitzMaurice has worked four years in the substance abuse field, directed two community mental health programs, and spent fourteen years counseling in private practice. In that time, he has refined many principles for and methods of counseling. He now puts those principles and methods into book form to share them with a wider audience, so more people can benefit than he can reach in person. Currently, he has more than twenty books written, most of which are available worldwide as e-books from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Sony, Google, Kobo, and Apple.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She is drawn back to midcoast Maine, where she attended Migawoc Girls' Camp as a child. Migawoc is now a memory, as is Myra Huggard, the neighbor who donated a boat to the camp but who was unsocial to all except Sarah. Sarah has inherited a boat from Myra, but it is in need of extensive repairs. Sarah's boat paves the way for her to become reacquainted with the residents of Maine. She discovers that Myra was murdered, and little does she know that her forty-year old memories may make her a threat to someone she knew back when. As she begins digging, it is evident that she has alerted the murderer of her movements:Just then, the headlights behind her grew again, filled the car with a dazzling glare. A sudden thud rocked the Explorer. Sarah yanked at the wheel, struggling for control as a truck swept by inches away and cut in front. She swerved, the road fell away, and her car shot into the woods.Lawrence Rotch does a masterful job of setting the scene for this unusual mystery. Maine is a wonderful backdrop, with its anti-government poor. The struggle of essential survival adds a layer all its own to this powerful mystery. Add to the fact that the mystery is rooted in a thirty-year old history, and one can easily see this tale set in a movie theme.Rotch adds a rich layer of legitimate and compelling characters, each of whom might have a motive for murder. The result is a chilling page turner with an eerie tone. Rotch uses dialogue and character to completely mislead the eager reader. He manages to hide the real killer long enough to set up yet another action-packed sequence for Sarah to have to endure before truth rears its ugly head. Naturally Maine's coastline and boat building play a huge role in this original mystery. Boating often emerges as the primary source of action. But whether it's boating or murder, Rotch succeeds in engaging the reader. --Midwest Book Review, May, 2008Newly divorced Sarah Cassidy returns to Maine, where she learned to sail 40 years earlier at Migawoc Camp for Girls. While she's staying the summer with the camp's former owners, Sarah is working on restoring her classic wooden sailboat, Owl, hoping to sail it. The boat was once owned by Myra Huggard, a curmudgeon who lived near the camp and with whom Sarah had a friendship of sorts.Myra died at age 94 and shortly after that her friend and sometime caregiver Cathy Leduc disappeared. Police speculate both women were murdered, even though Cathy's body has not been found, and have questioned Cathy's boyfriend Eldon Tupper. Another police theory is that Cathy murdered Myra and then took off.Sarah just wants work on her boat but finds herself drawn into the puzzle of Myra's death. As it turns out, Myra was a thorn in the just about everyone's side. That includes some new - and much resented - outsiders who are building McMansions all over the coastline. Sarah and boat builder Oliver Wendell team up to get answers to some thorny questions and, in the process, unearth long-buried secrets.Lawrence Rotch has populated Gravely Dead with wonderful Down East eccentrics with terrific names like \"Pearly\" Gaites and \"Ziggy\" Breener, and plunked them down in a beautifully written mid-coast Maine locale. The story's pace was a bit slow at various points but that wasn't enough to decrease my enjoyment of the characters, setting and story. Sarah Cassidy is a great cozy heroine and her relationship with Oliver Wendell is rife with potential for future books and more mysteries to solve. --Mystery News, August-September 2008", "related": [], "rank": 684926, "title": "Gravely Dead: A Midcoast Maine Mystery", "author": "Lawrence Rotch", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In a sense, my writing is autobiographical, as it reflects my own gratifying, but at times, difficult journey of emotional and spiritual recovery.On the long road of my journey, I slowly learned that, even when I don't have answers, I must strive to find forgiveness and self-worth and to connect to the good in the world.

A selection  of fiction and nonfiction, weighted more heavily toward the latter, the stories answer questions about the personal thoughts of those who heal by knife and those who can relate all too uncomfortably to a psychiatric patient’s secrets. How does a physician’s training affect one’s attitude toward death? What does it feel like as an intern to have someone’s survival hang on the fragile thread of your freshly minted medical diploma? Further, the fictional stories are no less poignant for their authors’ scientific dispassion, maybe more so. In toto, Kaminsky’s superior anthology is like an impressive menu or a fine wine list; it leaves readers  wanting to sample more by the authors of these satisfying offerings. --Donna Chavez", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ball, Ph.D., is an independent entheogenic researcher, writer, novelist, and musician.

Martin earned his Ph.D. in Religious Studies in 2000 with an emphasis on Native American traditions, shamanism, comparative mysticism, entheogens and religion, Buddhism, and the philosophy of science and religion.  He began his independent writing career with Tales of Aurduin in 2003, applying much of what he had learned as a student of religion and culture in shaping a vast fantasy epic.  It took several years to complete the four-book project, complete with invented languages and glossaries.  From there, Martin branched into writing non-fiction works on entheogens and spiritual/mystical experiences where he has documented his own explorations and insights.  Recently he has focused primarily on a nondual interpretation of entheogenic experiences and their use as tools to reach unitary states of awakening and personal transformation. Martin's books are challenging, entertaining, insightful, and often radical.  He's not afraid to be himself and call it as he sees it, always pressing for deeper clarity into truth and personal awareness of the unitary nature of being.  His fiction works on multiple levels simultaneously, melding philosophy, spirituality, and dynamic storytelling, all told through the lives of engaging characters that defy conventional categories.  With the release of Beyond Azara, Martin is excited to be returning to the fictional worlds and ideas he first explored with Tales of Aurduin.", "related": [], "rank": 3857652, "title": "The Fifth Temple (Tales of Aurduin Book 4) eBook", "author": "Martin W.

I hope and believe that this book will find its way to not only entomologists and parents of budding entomologists everywhere, but also to the bookshelves of the birders of the world—who would have their eyes and ears opened to another major group of nature's singers. (Ronald R. Hoy, Professor of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University)I could literally feel the obsession of John Himmelman for these animals, and it is contagious. This wonderful, engaging book brings us up close, in terms of the sensual, intellectual, and historical aspects of night-singing insects and the people who love and study them.Cricket Radioprovides many points of contact and will open up a new window to the natural world that is available to almost everyone, everywhere. This book is a real treat. (Bernd Heinrich, author of The Nesting Season)In this ear-opening book, John Himmelman shows us not only how to identify the songs these insects have sung for 250 million years but what those songs mean and how they are made...He writes about the effect of these songs on human dreams; about theEnsifera(the night-singers: crickets, katydids and the like) and how the sounds they make stimulate the human brain...We humans have shut down our listening skills to survive in a confusingly noisy world. Learning to listen to these songs is nothing less than soul-stirring. (Susan Salter ReynoldsLos Angeles Times2011-03-06)[An] engaging, knowledgeable portrait of \"night-singing insects.\"...Cricket Radiois filled with stories of collecting trips in which the author finds previously unseen animals or identifies a species far outside its known range. In these moments,  Himmelman's enchantment with the entomological soundscape is so complete that he can turn the most unpromising site--his Connecticut backyard, for example--into an insect lover's terra incognita, shimmering with possibility. (Hugh RafflesWall Street Journal2011-03-15)At a time when night-singing insects have slipped beyond our notice--indeed, are more likely to be heard as previously-recorded NatureSounds than in a backyard--John Himmelman seeks to reconnect us to creatures whose songs form a part of our own natural history. On warm summer evenings, night-singing insects produce a whirring, chirping soundscape--a calming aural tapestry celebrated by poets and naturalists for millennia. But \"cricket radio\" is not broadcast for the easy-listening pleasure of humans. The nocturnal songs of insects are lures and warnings, full of risks and rewards for these tiny competitive performers. What moves crickets and katydids to sing, how they produce their distinctive sounds, how they hear the songs of others, and how they vary cadence, volume, and pitch to attract potential mates, warn off competitors, and evade predators is part of the engaging story Cricket Radio tells. Himmelman's narrative weaves together his personal experiences as an amateur naturalist in search of crickets and katydids with the stories of scientists who study these insects professionally. He also offers instructions for bringing a few of the little singers into our homes and gardens. We can, Himmelman suggests, be reawakened to these night songs that have meant so much to the human psyche. The online insect calls that accompany this colorfully illustrated narrative provide a bridge of sound to our past and to our vital connection with other species. If you enjoy night-singing insects you'll enjoy this book! (Ian PaulsenThe Guardian online2011-03-13)Warm summer nights resonate with the chirruping of crickets and other night-singing insects. Amateur naturalist and writer John Himmelman seeks to reconnect us to these often-unseen musical creatures by mingling tales of his own searches for grasshoppers, cicadas and katydids with the latest professional research investigating why and how they sing, to attract mates and ward off predators. (Nature2011-03-10)[Himmelman] has written the most exuberant, thoughtful, and heart-felt work on singing insects ever published--a detailed assembly of scientific information blended with personal witness and nature writing the likes of which we rarely see...Eleven years in the making,Cricket Radio: Tuning In the Nightsinging Insectsnot only tells you all you'd ever want to know about the biology of sonic insects, but also about the author's experiences in stalking these wild and wonderful sounds for many years. He teaches us how to listen precisely on a cricket-stalking expedition, to move silently in the night woods, cup our hands to tune in to the source more accurately, and move closer to the quarry to capture the singer and figure out exactly who he is. (David RothenbergOrion2011-07-01)Pity those who live with the ceaseless surf of urban noise and are denied the surround-sound pleasure of crickets and katydids winding their watches and shaking their maracas through languid summer nights. That music is the quintessential soundtrack to shooting stars, backyard barbecues, and quiet nights on docks and porches. Amateur naturalist John Himmelman understands the ancient allure of the night-singers, and hisCricket Radiois a work of obsessive and rambling scholarship that offers appreciation and information in equal measure.

His scenic invention and use of cinematic techniques culminated in his 1926 staging of Gogol's The Government Inspector as well as reinterpretations of classics such as Pushkin's Queen of Spades. Braun, a drama professor in England, sees Meyerhold as a supreme director-poet for whom the theater was designed to shatter the audience's complacency. Decked out with 145 photographs of set reproductions, costumes and posters, Braun's vibrant study restores Meyerhold's radical legacy for contemporary theater. This revision of a work first published in 1979 draws on a wealth of newly discovered writings by Meyerhold, as well as KGB files released since 1989 that tell the full story of the director's arrest, torture and execution after being falsely labeled a foreign agent by Stalin.Copyright 1995 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She lives in the small town of Tabor City, North Carolina (close to the North and South Carolina shore) with her husband Kelly and their two beautiful children, Olivia and Keaton. Amy loves reading and writing Young Adult because she finds young people inspiring. She appreciates how teens are able to look at the world with a fresh perspective and willingly open their minds to the endless possibilities that life has to offer. She particularly enjoys writing strong heroines who face problems head on, learn, grow and mature into the type of people who do the right thing. When Amy isn't reading and writing, she teaches high school theater arts and dance. To say that Amy has a flare for all things creative would be an understatement, just don't ask her to assemble anything that requires instructions or sadly, you will be out of luck!

So there's probably no one better to write a breathless appeal for the Mets' shelling out whatever it takes to retain Dominican-born shortstop José Reyes. The perpetually affable Reyes, as it happens, is in the midst of a career season, finally realizing the potential for which he's long been lauded, and (ironically) suddenly up for free agency. Span argues that the beleaguered Mets front office should set aside its money troubles and Madoff woes and just \"pay the man.\" While admittedly writing for \"an audience of largely Mets fans,\" she nevertheless illustrates the historically dicey prospect of betting big money on baseball players' future performance, providing those of us who don't eat, sleep, and breathe the game with plenty to learn from this impassioned plea. --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B00CK8CL0W"], "rank": 1649670, "title": "An Arm and a Leg (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Emma Span", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was dragged south across the border by his parents when he was too young to protest and has lived in California the rest of his life. He entered the military right after high school, then attended college and began a career in business. His military work and forty-five years in various business management positions had him traveling to many parts of the world and he remembers well the beauty (as well as the poverty and unrest) of so many places. He retired early and moved from the city to his quiet country place in Twin Oaks, California. The loudest noises now are some howling coyotes, the wandering cattle and a million raucous birds. The rabbits and quail have come to recognize that Shiloh (the ranch) is a sanctuary for them, so they hang around every day looking for handouts. Jim just hangs around the ranch trying to be a hermit (at least that's what a lot of people think.) He does still manage to get shaved once in a while and can look half-way presentable when someone comes up the driveway (if given enough warning.) Jim's work now appears to be writing. SANCTION took about ten years to finish, as it was written in bits and pieces. Now THE LESSER EVIL and COP have joined the bookshelves, and more are on their way. Jim would love to hear from you. Give him a write some day, ask questions and swap stories. After all, he doesn't have anything else to do. You can catch him at JimMagwood@aol.com. (And he does answer his mail.)

The essays stress theoretical and clinical pluralism, striving to bring a higher synthesis out of a century of competing theories. Organized into five sections, the essays consider the history and philosophical milieu of psychoanalysis for contextualizing therapeutic action, especially legacy of the Enlightenment; conflict, fantasy and insight in therapeutic action; analytic love in relational experience and mutative dynamics; unconscious communication, internalization and non-verbal processes in mental experience and therapeutic action; and a retrospective on dogma and clinical flexibility by a 101-year-old psychoanalyst.\"“This inspired collection of essays written by faculty members of the Los Angeles Institute and Society for Psychoanalytic Studies (LAISPS) reviews core issues of psychoanalysis through new lenses while having the energy and passion of discussions behind it. Of immediate use to many in the field while offering a major contribution to psychoanalytic studies, the book clearly celebrates this distinctive psychoanalytical society while bringing the renewing visions of West Coast psychoanalysis to the world of psychoanalysis at large.”\"Diamond and Christian have assembled a rich array of thoughtful and evocative clinical papers. The book is a marvelous collection of deep and thought provoking chapters, some of which alone are worth the price of the volume and more. Several chapters read like wonderful literature while at the same time adding significantly to our clinical understanding, while other chapters are so convincingly written that I found myself almost able to embrace ideas different from my own.”“Europeans are used to thinking about North American psychoanalysis as an archipelago of groups rather isolated from one another. In this innovative and very interesting text, we see influential Californian psychoanalysts accomplishing a great choral work to integrate the different theoretical-clinical trends with convincing and deeply harmonious results.”“Diamond and Christian's timely and well organized volume brings together a collection of thoughtful and engaging reflections on the nature of therapeutic change that take into account intrapsychic and intersubjective factors, insight and relationship, and the uniquencess of the individual dyad. This book will deepen our study of these healing processes.”“This unique, timely, and up to date collection of original papers on the therapeutic action of psychoanalysis by renowned senior clinicians and theoreticians from Los Angeles is the only volume of which I am aware that has under a single cover such theoretical and clinical richness on the vital importance of the rationale for and conduct of our lengthy, painstaking, and ambitious method of treatment.”“The papers in this volume provide one of the best available overviews of contemporary thinking about therapeutic action. This book will engage and inform anybody who is interested in the current state of clinical theory in psychoanalysis and dynamic psychotherapy by challenging us to think about what we do, why we do it, and what effect we are having on our patients.”", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When writing, I can almost feel the bond between the reader and myself, which gives me a stronger desire to take them beyond the action of reading my books, to actually make them feel like they are a part of my stories.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Only 4 percent of the known cosmos is composed of regular atoms. The balance is made up of antimatter, dark matter and dark energy. So 95 percent of the universe is made up of stuff that is rather alien to us humans. Scientists think about 13 billion years ago, the universe came into being. One theory (Big Bang) hinges on the notion that everything came into existence all at once. Along with matter and antimatter, even time and space itself came into existence as a result of the 'explosion' of a single point of infinite density. But which subatomic particles were created first? Atoms are stable to an extent-yet we know that the converse is also true. So this essay is my muse about how matter is on a structural voyage back to whence it came-possibly nothing. Just why is matter such a small fraction of the universe? Perhaps this has something to do with why cosmic expansion is accelerating?

Born in the Bronx, Bob attended West Point and earned a BA in psychology with honors and then served as an Infantry platoon leader, a battalion scout platoon leader, and a brigade recon platoon leader in the 1st Cavalry Division. He joined Special Forces and commanded a Green Beret A Team. He served as the operations officer for 2nd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) and with Special Operations Command (Special Projects) in Hawaii. Later he taught at the Special Forces Qualification Course at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg, the course which trains new Green Berets. He lived in Korea where he earned a Black Belt in Martial Arts. He's earned a Masters Degree in Education. Bob Mayer grew up in the Bronx. After high school, he entered West Point where he learned about the history of our military and our country. During his four years at the Academy and later in the Infantry, Mayer questioned the idea of \"mission over men.\" When he volunteered and passed selection for the Special Forces as a Green Beret, he felt more at ease where the men were more important than the mission. Mayer's obsession with mythology and his vast knowledge of the military and Special Forces, mixed with his strong desire to learn from history, is the foundation for his science fiction series Atlantis, Area 51 and Psychic Warrior. Mayer is a master at blending elements of truth into all of his thrillers, leaving the reader questioning what is real and what isn't. He took this same passion and created thrillers based in fact and riddled with possibilities. His unique background in the Special Forces gives the reader a sense of authenticity and creates a reality that makes the reader wonder where fact ends and fiction begins. Mayer's military background, coupled with his deep desire to understand the past and how it affects our future, gives his writing a rich flavor not to be missed.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My father was a pilot, flying Lancaster Bombers in World War Two, then VC10s for BOAC. When he retired we moved to New Zealand and settled on a small farm in Northland. I was eight years old at that time. It was a very beautiful place, close to the ocean and next to a tidal estuary. I spent many days swimming, surfing, fishing and horse riding with my siblings.  I had a love for writing and began writing short stories when I was twelve. English was always my favourite subject. When I finished high school, I studied law at Otago University. After I graduated, I spent almost ten years as a barrister, or court lawyer, practising in the areas of criminal defense, family and employment law. During that time I continued to write and sold some short stories and started my first novella, The Control Sickness. In 1998, I left New Zealand and traveled. I spent about nine years in China and wrote, The Fake Celebrity in China and also Bali Fungus.   My interests and hobbies include writing, surfing, blackjack gambling, chess, movies, running and I also like watching sports on TV, especially rugby, UFC, boxing, tennis and cricket. I am about to start a sequel to The Fake Celebrity in China and then will start the first part of my autobiography, which will end when I started practising law. At the same time I am writing Faith, a series in the horror and occult genre.  https://twitter.com/FakeCelebChina", "related": ["B00I863WMG"], "rank": 2589738, "title": "The Control Sickness", "author": "Robert Black", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The director of Stephen King's movie Sleepwalkers and small-screen adaptations of The Shining and The Stand, Garris makes good use of his movie-making experience in the title story. A disillusioned horror film director purchases a deformed infant from her mother, then features the \"monster\" in his new film. The narrative, which is alternately comical, surreal and graphic, sets the tone for the tales that follow. In \"Baby Shower,\" a man finds his septuagenarian parents center stage in a sexually overactive retirement colony, and \"Forever Gramma\" culminates in a retch-inducing act of necrophilia. \"Starfucker\" pokes fun at nostalgia for old Hollywood when its main character pays $100,000 for a sexual encounter with a resuscitated but crumbling Jean Harlow. \"Flesh and Fantasy\" is a kind of bonus; a screenplay based on one of the stories, \"Chocolate,\" in which a man's mysterious psychic connection with a female stranger leads him to stalk and kill her. Although readers with delicate constitutions might want to steer clear of Garris's work, fans of scary movies and sci-fi fiction will relish his stomach-turning plot twists. Garris does not have Stephen King's sophistication, but he does create and sustain a compelling, colloquial narrative voice, with a witty, informed skewering of the film industry. (Dec.) Forecast: A limited edition with an introduction by Stephen King, an afterword by Tobe Hooper (director of the classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and illustrations (not seen by PW) by Clive Barker?

But her dreams of being a teacher die, and her life begins a downward spiral, when her mother, diagnosed with AIDS, is taken to a hospital in the capital city of Niamey. As the oldest of three children at home, Haoua is given even more chores by her father, who forbids her returning to school despite the entreaty of her teacher. Haoua’s only support is from her older brother, Abdelkrim, a soldier stationed in Niamey, who does what he can before the unrest that follows the assassination of President Mainassara. At 12, Haoua becomes the third wife of her father’s brutal cousin, with dreadful consequences. Weston’s first novel captures a time and a place, from the beauty of Niger’s vistas to the inhumanity of its patriarchal culture. The latter will arouse outrage, as will the restrictions posed by an NGO that is there to help. This is fiction that conveys truth more vividly than fact could. --Michele Leber", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The idea of writing occurred to Gary, while he lay in a hospital bed after suffering a serious auto accident in 2002, where in a desperate effort to save his life, his right leg was amputated. His recovery was described as difficult with multiple follow-up surgeries. Feeling frustrated and isolated, he decided to occupy his mind with writing. The outline to “Rainbows Shed Tears on the Sunset” was completely originated while staring at the ceiling of his hospital room for sixty-seven days. Once discharged and having access to a keyboard, the story was set in motion. Gary, is the father of two grown daughters and has been married for the past 28 years. He credits his recovery and inspiration for all things in life to his family, who tirelessly stood by his bedside and motivated his speedy recovery once he returned home. This entire novel was typed on a laptop computer while working as a part-time nighttime security officer for a gated community in the Fort Lauderdale area. Gary further returned to his regular day-time job while also working overnights on the weekend to complete this story. He stated it was the only quiet time he could manage to concentrate on writing as his day-time job often required he take his work home during the week, and of course the hectic nature of running a household, would not afford the quiet time needed to work through the details of the complex characters in this novel. Gary plans on seeking another overnight weekend job to complete his second novel, due in the near future.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Writing in 1904, Conrad invented a complex South American country with a turbulent history and a potentially explosive population, ranging from the wealthy gringo running the Sulaco silver mine to the poorest worker loading cargo on the docks. Although the story teems with lively characters, the dazzling figure of Nostromo eclipses them all. A natural leader?brave, handsome, and incorruptible?he naturally becomes the epicenter of the revolution that soon devastates Sulaco. With characteristic eloquence, Conrad has focused on the dramatic action of the revolution to explore challenging themes: capitalism, imperialism, revolution, and social justice. Unfortunately, this audio program, read by Frederick Davidson, is disappointing. Despite fine dramatic characterizations, the narrator's posh British accent is so pronounced that it often detracts from the text. Since Nostromo has also been narrated by Frank Muller (Recorded Books) and Wolfram Kandinsky (Books on TapeR), perhaps this version may not be the best choice.?Jo Carr, Sarasota, Fla.Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B005W39PY2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He received a strict upbringing and was educated for a life in the church, graduating from Harvard in 1852. After leaving Harvard, Alger, to his father's disappointment, took a job as a historian in Middlesex County, Massachusetts and later worked as a teacher at a boys' boarding school in East Greenwich, Rhode Island. He traveled in Europe for a year, and then returned to the United States in 1857 to complete his studies at the Cambridge Divinity School. In 1864 Alger was ordained a minister at the First Parish Unitarian Church of Brewster on Cape Cod. Sixteen months later, however, he was dismissed from the pulpit after being accused of engaging in homosexual relations with two boys. After his dismissal, Alger began to focus on his writing career, which spanned more than three decades and 110 books. He wrote mainly children's books about boys and girls who rise from rags to riches through hard work and faith in the American dream. His first major success came with the publication of his eighth novel, Ragged Dick in 1868. Other popular novels include Luck and Pluck (1869), Tattered Tom (1871), and Strive and Succeed (1872). Alger also wrote several adult novels, including A Fancy of Her's (first published as The New Schoolma'am in 1877) and The Disagreeable Woman (1895). Alger, who never married, spent the last decades of his life living at his family home in South Natick, Massachusetts, where he died in 1899.", "related": ["B002HMCIBI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although Emma was a very precocious child, it took another fifteen years before she began working with her mother. The result of that collaboration was a book. IceFlight is a brand new arrival in the sci-fi/romance genre and the first part of a trilogy, The Iron Altar. The second book is set to hit the shelves in late 2013, and another series set in the IceFlight universe is already under way.   Shelley Lea (pronounced 'lee') was born on a snowy June day, near the bottom of the world, in Invercargill, New Zealand. Reluctant to supply a date of birth, she would rather claim several decades of maturity, but only a few days of actual wisdom. Those decades have covered a range of jobs, a couple of degrees (including English Lit), one great husband, plenty of travel, two gorgeous daughters, several scatty cats and one idiotic dog. They've also included an on-going struggle to put pen to paper in any spare second. This has led to some dire poetry, some eyebrow raising children's stories and finally to something resembling a novel. This languished in a sadly disjointed and hand written form until...   Emma Casey inherited her mother's love of books and the ability to string two sentences together (sometimes three). She proved to be the missing link in trying to actually finish a manuscript. Younger, savvier and able to turn on a computer without causing it to explode, she picked up the book and ran with it. Emma is also studying graphic design and happily provides Casey Lea's cover artwork.", "related": ["B00JMUQJ5O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 3.8889, "rating_total": 35.0}

With such a distinguished background how could he be anything but a great writer?  That's what I thought when I was 18, but like most things people think when they are 18, it was dead wrong. I did manage to excel to the extent that I was the first of my kin to graduate from college, though that only got me an invite from my draft board to the Vietnam War. Fearing that I would be too large a target as an infantryman I opted for a 'voluntary' enlistment and ended up a translator/interpreter in Thailand.  Then it was back to the States and a year of unemployment before I stumbed into Computer Software Development and Systems Analysis, which kept me busy for 30 years.  Finally at age 60 to writing.  Since I no longer wanted to be famous I could start small with some short stories.  Then a collection of stories from my military days became \"Tales of Ramasun\" in honor of the signal intelligence gathering base in (then) remote NE Thailand where I spent most of my soldiering time.  Having shucked the burden of fame, writing has become fun, and relatively easy.   I spend my winters at my Thai wife's place in Thailand and summers at our small, Spartan Minnesota lake cabin.  A cabin no unlike Col. Jack's place in \"Money Troubled\".", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Artist Abby Warren has left her past\nbehind her and moved to St. Louis to escape her guilt, blaming herself for her\nbest friend Holly's death and wondering about Holly's rape that preceded it.\nBut then fate intervenes and Abby's world becomes unglued. When Abby's father\nis hospitalized, she has no choice but to go home to Mill's Pond, Kansas, to\nhelp out with the family's lumber yard business. With much reluctance, Abby\ntakes her new found feline friend and heads to the place she once called home.\nNow Abby must confront her past and the two brothers who will reenter her\nfuture. One brother cares about her while the other is eager to bring up the\npast and send her packing. Now Abby has to confront her past memories and face\nthe man who turned a town against her. But when things get dangerous, Abby\nfinds herself a renewed target. But just who is out to get her and why? \"Sticks & Stones\" by Glenna Thompson is a love\nstory with a mystery in the mix set in Kansas. Glenna Thompson has a natural\nway of describing small town life and the close-knit community that binds\nfamilies together through the good and the bad. Abby's story is really touching\nand she is a great character to get to know. A good read by a talented writer.D. Pollock, Illinois- Wow, just finished reading this book. Fantastic!

If he grew up at all, it was in an airline family in St. Paul, Minnesota. Mr. Goldbarg attended The St. Paul Academy, which was then a tiny, all male, prep school of the military sort. For a time, he sojourned in the hapless Humanities Department (which was soon eliminated through no fault of Mr. Goldbarg’s) of the University of Minnesota. Mr. Goldbarg then steeped himself in History, but it just wasn’t the same. Mr. Goldbarg’s parents taught him that crime never pays, but criminal defense may, and criminal prosecution does with clockwork regularity. Keeping their wisdom in mind, Mr. Goldbarg worked in criminal law as an investigator and writer of ingenious briefs and appeals. Then his weakness for old stuff seduced him into dealing antiques. When Mr. Goldbarg discovered that he really wasn’t committed to a life of endless dusting, he returned to writing, determined to portray several of the amazing criminal characters he had once known. The happy results are his story of action, adventure, and treasure, THE GOOD SCOUTS The Treasure Of The Copper Scroll and his comedic crime novel, A SELF MADE MAN Bootleggers On Ice.  Regarding his literary antecedents, Messers Walt Kelly, Max Shulman, Will Cuppy, Erskine Caldwell, Nikolai Gogol, and William Shakespeare all influenced Mr. Goldbarg profoundly in his youth, but died coincidently before claiming the credit. Mr. Goldbarg denies culpability for every one of these sad demises, and claims to have an air-tight alibi in each case. Don’t they all?  Mr. Goldbarg spends more than half of his year in St. Paul. However, when the weather turns white, he tends to scamper southward accompanied by his enthusiastically appreciative audience and wife, the ever vivacious and charming Phyllis.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Since then, Kenneth Copeland Ministries has grown to include not only its headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, but offices in Canada, England, South Africa and Australia as well.  Best known for his exuberant proclamation that \"Jesus is Lord!\", Kenneth Copeland has introduced people the world over to the saving message of faith. However, the vision of KCM includes more than simply introducing people to Jesus Christ. Theirs is a vision of taking believers on to maturity in the principles of faith, love, healing, prosperity, redemption and righteousness.  Every day that vision becomes more of a reality through Kenneth Copeland Ministries daily and weekly television broadcasts, monthly magazine, books, teaching tapes, gospel music recordings, meetings and conventions. Through these KCM outreaches, every day thousands of believers from Jacksonville to Johannesburg are moving from defeat, self-doubt and discouragement - to a life of God-given victory.", "related": ["B00EUQTTLG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With eight short stories, this collection runs the gamut from a very surprising and unexpected murderer, to the stressful disclosure to her sister that a woman's boyfriend doesn't really exist. Between those two very different tales are 6 more short stories, each with some kind of unforeseeable twist at the end, serving to make each story that much more entertaining. Although different in content, all of these stories have a couple of things in common: all are very well written, and all are exceptionally entertaining. Sally Jenkins knows how to build a story. She takes the mundane, and makes it intriguing. She hooks the reader, and reels him in. She proves her talent in each of these eight short stories, making this collection one you will be glad you read.At the start of each story, the author lists the award(s) that particular story has won. When you have finished reading these stories, you will understand why she has won so many awards for her fiction. Sally Jenkins has a fertile imagination, where the seed of an idea develops into a full-blown and consequential tale. It would seem her creativity knows no bounds. This book tenders proof of that conjecture, as the range of topics she explores covers the full spectrum of possible subjects. However, her capacity for twisting each tale's ending is nothing short of phenomenal. I believe most fiction readers will find her writing to be a source of great joy and fulfillment.", "related": [], "rank": 2522848, "title": "One Day for Me - 8 Coffee Break Stories: Tales of Crime, Romance and Trickery", "author": "Sally Jenkins", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Initially they established their company Goodness Me to sell their gluten free bread and baking mixes made according to a secret family recipe, but over the next few years they developed so many tasty recipes for baked goods they decided that writing a cookbook was the best way to share their secrets and Goodness Me it’s Gluten Free is the result.", "related": ["B00GP34AWK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His experiences in Bangkok and India later inspired his thriller VENOM, and his adventures in the jungles of the Golden Triangle of Burma and Laos were also filed away for later, the basis of his OPIUM series about the underworld drug trade. He later moved to Australia and worked in advertising, before moving to Sydney where he freelanced for most of Australia’s leading newspapers and magazines, as well as working in radio and television. He started publishing in 1984, mostly humor and young adult fiction, but with the publication of VENOM in 1990, he became a full time novelist. He has published over 40 books in print. HAREM was an enormous bestseller in Germany and THE NAKED HUSBAND was ranked #9 in Australia on its release. AZTEC stayed on the bestseller lists in Mexico for four months. He is a bestseller in Europe and his work has sold into translation in 23 countries: Brazil, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech republic, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Indonesia, Korea, Macedonia, Montenegro, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Turkey. He lived for many years in the beautiful Margaret River region in WA, and helped raise two beautiful daughters with his late wife, Helen. While writing, he also worked in the volunteer ambulance service for over 13 years His marriage ended in tragic circumstances, a story he has told in ‘The Naked Husband,’ and its non-fiction sequel, ‘The Year We Seized the Day,’ written with a writing partner, Elizabeth Best. He travels regularly to research his novels and his quest for authenticity has led him to run with the bulls in Pamplona, pursue tornadoes across Oklahoma and black witches across Mexico, go cage shark diving in South Africa and get tear gassed in a riot in La Paz. He also completed a nine hundred kilometre walk of the camino in Spain. He did not write for over five years but returned to publishing in 2010 with the release of SILK ROAD, and then STIGMATA the following year.

The principles of \"developmental reparenting\" are spelt out throughout each chapter of the book. Adoptive parents and foster carers are encouraged to look at their own attachment history to make sense of their relationship with their children. Readers are encouraged to \"practice\" changing their mindset to PARCEL ( being playful, accepting ,responsive, curious, empathetic and loving) when parenting traumatised children.

Their plan involves a diversion using some of their cellmates as a distraction. Things seem to be going well until something gets in their way. It's time forPlan B. As we see the story unfold through the eyes of not only the inmates but also a homeless man who witnesses what can only be described as bizarre, we begin to see that things aren't as they seem. This little story has it all: suspense, intrigue, mystery, and humor. It is brilliantly written with an unexpected twist that will have your jaw dropping and your smile widening.I absolutely loved Preston Randall'sPlan B. I loved it so much that I am going to read it over and over again just to see how Randall pulled off such amazing storytelling. It had me on the edge of my seat the entire time I read it. When I got to the last couple pages and began figuring things out, I was practically falling out of my seat from the unexpected surprise. What this author did in 13 pages was pure genius. I was so completely entertained that I had to run to the other room and tell my husband what I just read. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a combination of suspense and humor. Even if you usually don't, check this one out. Trust me. You won't regret it. If you need me, I'll be busy reading the rest of Preston Randall's books.", "related": ["B00E1A2KSA"], "rank": 26797, "title": "Plan B", "author": "Preston Randall", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I became another part of a poor but somewhat loving family that lived in Brookhaven Mississippi. Times were hard so my dad moved us all over Mississippi from job to job to support us. After spending a chunk of my life in Mississippi I decided to move to Texas to seek my own life. While living there I met the woman who I thought was going to be the answer to my dream. But like most of my dreams that dream faded quickly away. Then one day in 2002 my Dad called and told me my Mom had had a stroke. So I gave up my good job and packed and moved back to a small town in Mississippi to help my Mom and my then 72 year old Dad. Then came Hurricane Katrina and destroyed our house. But we survived and \"lived\" in a FEMA camper for about six months until our house was rebuilt. We moved back in and thought things would be good now, but I guess I forgot how life is. In the first part of 2008 my Mom was diagnosed with uterine cancer. But fortunately she got a hysterectomy and that took care of that, or so we thought. In early 2011 she was diagnosed with bladder cancer. She had a tough time, after all by then she was 73 years old, but in September 2011 after a few hitches she had her bladder removed. After recovering from the surgery she then had twenty-five treatments of radiation. On July 7th 2012 she passed away. As for me, I take and make it day by day and help my Dad, who is now 82, as much as I am able to help him.", "related": [], "rank": 4163705, "title": "Catfish Trailer Park", "author": "Roger Harrison", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

On May 25, 1948, therefore, he renounced his US nationality at the Embassy in Paris publicly declaring himself a “citizen of the world.”  He was exercising his inalienable right of political choice, he claimed, to address his - and our - problems which had become global such as war itself. With no national documents however, he was considered stateless by France and ordered to leave by September 12th or be detained in jail.       Unable to enter another country, the morning of Sept. 11th, 1948 he “entered” the new “international territory” ceded to the United Nations by the French government and claimed “global political asylum” from the UN.     The general public endorsed the idea of world citizenship at once, writing to him to “join.” And so the movement was born. . On Nov. 22, 1948, the World Citizens led by Davis interrupted a session of the GA “in the name of the people not represented here...”  Claiming that the UN, composed only of states as the former League of Nations, “divided us and led us to the abyss of total war...” they called for “one government for one world...” If the UN could not transform itself, then we, the people of the world, would do so “For we can be served by nothing less.”      On Dec. 10, 1948, the General Assembly proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a “Common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations.” Art. 21(3) provided: “The will of the people shall be the basis for the authority of government.”      On Jan. 1, 1949, Davis called upon the general public to write him if they wanted to be registered as World Citizens. And so the International Registry of World Citizens was born. Over 750,000 from over 115 countries registered in the next 14 months.      On 9/4/53, Davis declared the World Government of World Citizens from the city hall of Ellsworth, Maine, USA. In Jan., 1954, its administrative office, the World Service Authority, was opened in New York City,. The WSA is presently a Washington, D.C. corporation registering World Citizens and issuing global documents based on articles in the UDHR. see www.worldservice.org.", "related": ["B00CELK4IQ"], "rank": 4808107, "title": "Views From My Space (Book II) eBook", "author": "Garry Davis", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Honestly, if you are a person with a trace of logical thinking and the desire to learn, you can do everything discussed in this book. When you're done, you can be confident that you are able and ready to pursue and master advanced programming topics with every reason to expect complete success. The vocabulary you will need is developed in a methodical, thoughtful process by relating techniques to results. It is not a memorization exercise. My personal preference is C#, probably because I started working with \"C\" at AT&T; Computer Systems when \"C\" was in its infancy. For a beginner, VB is a little less demanding and accomplishes the same job, just a little differently in terms of syntax and a few key words. Remember the old saying \"Monkey see, Monkey do\"? It should say \"Monkey see, Monkey do, Monkey learn\" The text is very focused . . . Almost every sentence is an instruction to do something . . . or explains very pointedly the expected results of what you are going to do. In most \"Teach Yourself books\" you read many, many pages and get (forget) concepts confused before you put them to work. Forgetting or being confused by waiting will not be your experience this time. Concepts are presented in bite-sized units that make immediate use of the ideas. The focus is \"doing\" I'll say it several times before we're done . . . If you're not making any mistakes, you're not trying hard enough! Experiment and learn. I progresses rapidly through the fundaments of developing and testing applications that work, with minimal discussion of issues of little or no immediate use. The vocabulary is kept to every possible extent, to plain English. The examples are written with the idea that they will be used as reference and \"copy and paste\" code for other application the reader will develop on their own, later. Neither time nor effort is wasted filter", "related": ["B005NRXU0W"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There, I was able to spend precious moments with my Marine Corps father before he was dispatched to the World War II Pacific Theater. In his absence, my mother and I moved back to my grandparents' home in Roanoke, Virginia, where we lived until my father's return in 1945. Then, as a young family, we moved to Salem where I lived for the next seventeen years. In 1962, I left Salem to attend Bridgewater College. In 1964, my uncle invited me along with his daughter to attend the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Because my uncle was a national committeeman, he was able to get credentials for my cousin and me to be seated on the convention floor. For me, the experience was an awakening. There I met freedom riders and listened to their stories. I heard speeches delivered by Hubert Humphrey and Robert Kennedy, and on the last night of the convention, my cousin and I gave up our credentials so that the Mississippi Freedom Delegation, rejected by the credentials committee, could be rightfully seated. The highlight of my experience there occurred on the steps of the convention center where I shook hands with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Over the next four decades, I taught school, raised a family, and became a volunteer EMT on Lake of the Woods Fire and Rescue in Wilderness, Virginia. It was there that I wrote and had published my fi rst two books, EMT: BEYOND THE LIGHTS AND SIRENS (a portion of which was printed in Reader's Digest) and EMT: RESCUE, based on my experiences serving as a medic and an EMT Instructor in my community. I received several community awards and was the recipient of the 2001 Outstanding Virginia Prehospital Care Provider. It was in 1996, while in Salem assisting in the care of my ailing father, that I took evening courses at Hollins College, and it was in my creative writing classroom that Coralee", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His stories tend to explore how people react under immense psychological pressure and emotional strain (see, his psychology degree was actually useful). Rich uses all of these attributes in Echo Rising, his first novel, to tell the story of how fifteen-year-old Carson Turley’s comfortable teenage life is ripped away from her as she and her father become fugitives on the run from Echo, a clandestine division of the CIA.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He saw the need for informative picture books for children from the age of 5 to 10.  Married to Mary Ellen, they are the busy parents to four boys, Simon, Will, and the twins Jack and Thomas. Books are typically the first exposure to learning and art that children get which urges one to make the very best books possible. He understands just how important books were to his childhood. With them, he feels as if transported to some parallel universe, a world of grace, hope and wonder. Lionel said, “The boys want more than just picture books they also want to learn things they can tell their friends about.  Jack in particular loves learning new things.  He was sick of story books and wanted something a bit more challenging”. As the author of a few heavy historical novels he started writing children’s books for the boys not long after Will was born.  Being boys they wanted adventure and scary dragons. But after Jack and Thomas arrived Jack wanted to read ‘real’ books about ‘real’ things, not pretend stuff.  Not being able to find suitable books written to the capacity of a 4 or 5 year old, he started making little flip books on his computer and using pictures from magazines and photographs in his collection. He sent one of these books to his publisher who thought this a great idea and has since commissioned a series of books for this age group.  With the help of the boys he is currently working on several picture books about our land and sea animals. Lionel lives with his family, Billy the bitser, cats Ghost and Patch and assorted lizards and insects in Ho-Ho-Kus, a suburb of New York (Northern New Jersey-Long Island).", "related": ["B00EORE04W"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.8571, "rating_total": 34.0}

The book is an autobiographical journey which is written in four parts. The first part depicts the author's life from his childhood days up to high school. The second part is about the author's life after high school up to his first job assignment. This book - again like the first - reveals the author's passion for music and it speaks of romance and adventure.The author's university years are hilarious and fun, filled with romance and adventures. The book gives an insight into the author's love for music. That passion runs through the background of the whole book. All the songs are linked to the recorded version on Sound Cloud where you can hear the songs being played. There are a few poems, too, which the author has penned. The poems interspersed with lyrics and text make it an exciting read. The book can be seen as the author's trip down Memory Lane. Of the many poems written in the book, the poem 'Thoughts' is contemplative. Much of the author's thinking and musing is penned as poems. The song lyrics are breezy. The second part is poignant and speaks about the author's love and zest for life.The style of the second book is also, like the first one, simple, informal and light. The book ends with the author taking up an overseas assignment in Algeria.", "related": ["B00DDX8W6A"], "rank": 3874265, "title": "Expat - Part 2", "author": "Raji Abuzalaf", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was always an adventurer.  In the 80's he staked an Alaskan homestead of forty acres and built a log cabin that next winter.  He and Janice and their adopted daughter, Reyna, braved a winter in the cabin in the middle nineties.  They learned survival skills and David learned that long dark winter nights are a good time to reflect on the things of God.  Some of the ideas for this book series were formulated in his mind way back then. Our author has a passion for God, and has studied the Word concerning the happenings in the 'last days.'    Inspired by the great authors that write fiction depicted at the end of time, David has captured this same spirit but in the culture and life of Alaska.     Izzy and Geo meet under very unusual circumstances, become friends and set out to save the world.  Well, maybe just their corner of it.  The Northern Force, as a group, is formed in Book One:  The Beginnings.   God's power is revealed to each member during this time shortly after what we call 'the Rapture.'  The book depicts this group of Christ followers as they begin their first 2 years in what the Bible calls 'The Tribulation.\" David is a graduate of Bethany Bible College, Scotts Valley, CA, and received his    Master's of Ed in 2007 from Jones International University.  He is married and has six children and six grandchildren.    He and Janice teach school and reside in Pittsburg.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Mein Spezialgebiet ist der Boxsport, in dem ich im meiner Jugend als Kämpfer und bis zuletzt als Punkt- und Ringrichter meine Erfahrungen sammelte. Der Kampf ist für mich Schlüssel zum Erfolg, egal, ob im Boxring oder im Leben. Das Leben analysiere ich seit über 40 Jahren berufsbedingt. Als Kriminalbeamter bemerke ich seit Jahren gesellschaftliche und politische Fehlentwicklungen, die ich zunächst in meinem Erstlingswerk \"Politiker in den Ring\" aufgriff. Das Buch hatte erfreuliche Resonanz und landete als einziges politisches Sachbuch in der TOP5-Liste des Literaturwettbewerbs \"Der Neue Buchpreis 2012\".

Top Pick! I didn't need to know anything about hockey to thoroughly and completely enjoy this awesome romance. Rob's dedication to the sport he plays is fantastic, but his ability to get behind a cause he believes in is even better. I love the caring that came across the page between so many combinations of people. Watching a romance develop between two totally different people was a heartwarming. When I finished this story, I didn't want to leave the world that I had been visiting. It was comfortable and incredible. -- Night Owl ReviewsAn excellent follow up to Should've Known Better (Storm, #1). Carr does a remarkable job making the characters feel realistic; showing their growth and experiences. She also does a tremendous job describing her characters thoughts and emotions. The reader really feels in tune with the characters.-- Diane Lynch's Book ReviewsHockey and romance combine beautifully in a compelling and delightful read. With realistic and believable characters, Underneath It All is a character-driven romance that draws you in and keeps you hooked to your e-reader right up to the very end.-- The Jeep Diva[The book] diverges from the \"cookie cutter\" model of a romantic novel to provide the reader with a plot that is intriguing and characters that are very believable. I also enjoyed the amount of detail the author includes about ice hockey. This installment in the series is thoroughly enjoyable without having read the first book. An outstanding sexy romance I thoroughly enjoyed, so much so I plan to read the first book because I don't want to miss anything as I follow the series.-- Manic Readers", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 4.375, "rating_total": 70.0}

Her garden is brimming with hummingbirds, heirloom tomatoes, one hundred varieties of roses, parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme and one zucchini plant.

His summers were spent exploring nature and the library. He would pore over the books in the 599 section (remember the Dewy Decimal System?) searching for answers to the questions he had about the things he'd seen out in the woods. John's love for animals continued and expanded in college where he got a degree in animal science and Teaching Certification. For the next 8 years he taught high school Science and was one of the school's favorite teachers. During that time, he lived in a tiny log cabin he built himself in the middle of the woods. He had no running water, no electricity and no TV. Every day he would journal about his life and the animals around his cabin. Much of this series will be based on his love for nature. Now, John gets to pass on a life-time of love, learning and teaching to people all over the world through his books. He truly hopes you are inspired to appreciate this beautiful world we live in.", "related": ["B00CCTFQL0"], "rank": 1256609, "title": "Baby Animals!

After trying out one method she found that she was driven to do further research to perfect her craft. As this was a hobby for her the progress was slow but she did get through it all and found that by combining a number of techniques from different jewelry making guides, she was able to produce jewelry that she not only liked but could sell as well to make some extra cash. She also saw the need to put some sort of text together that would more advanced than a very basic outline of how to create jewelry but not as complex as the more advanced texts that can be found on the market today. Janet was interested in creating a text that would be easy to understand and also provide a bit more than just the mere basics. What she has presented is what she has tried herself.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It began when I was about seven or eight years old and I don't know why.  My father wasn't career military, though he served during World War Two.  My uncle Jim was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Green Beret and while I respected him and looked up to him, he didn't have a strong influence in my life, living all the way out in California and I growing up in Chicago.  I think I just had an innate proclivity to the military.    Growing up, I was a quirky kid.  When most kids were reading stories of the \"Harry Potter kind,\" or not reading at all, I was reading books on military history.  I would stay up into the wee hours of the night, laying in bed, reading about the great military campaigns and naval battles.    I was in my late \"teens\" when I read Rear Admiral Richard O'Kane's book, Clear the Bridge!  Being young and impressionalbe, O'Kane became a hero for me.    After high school, I entered the United States Naval Academy and graduated with the class of 1984.      I'm not sure why I started writing this novel.  It just kind of came to me.  Therefore, and lacking any other reason, I give all credit to God.    I hope you enjoy The Last Patrol and that it is a blessing for you.

The\nvillain (Hugh Verad) is uncomplicated and relentless, roving about almost like a demon,\ninflicting his wrath upon those he feels that have caused him unnecessary\ntorment.The two protagonists, Detective George Caites and Sheriff\nBenjamin Decoto are in \"react mode\" as they deal with this man. Their natural\ninstincts prevail over knowledge, training, and experience.This is something I thought would be a short story but then\nslowly but surely it evolved into more of something in between a novella and a novel.\nAny attempts to bulk it up would have would have negatively impacted the\ntension. As of this posting, it is only available on Kindle and-or Kindle\nconverting applications.Routine, as with\neverything else I have done, is about several ideas coming together. I had an\noutline for a tightly-packed thriller set in a Pacific Northwest town and I\nneeded a motive for Mr. Verad to let his dormant personal issues take over and embark\non his mad descent. Many years ago my regular grocery store changed its entire\nlayout. I remember walking the aisles and overhearing customer after customer grumbling\nand complaining about how they couldn't find anything in this new design. They\nwere really bent out of shape over this seemingly innocuous change to their\ndaily routine. I made a note of it, and flash forward, and there is the trigger\nfor Mr. Verad--he's right on the edge anyway being so isolated with his\npercolating insanity and the disruption caused by the construction project is too much for him.As withCultus Maximus,\nI wanted to drop the reader straight into a particular and expeditious moment\nin time. The difference here is the time frame is more compressed and intense as\nwell as linear.I wonder if the Egyptology fromCultus Maximushad an influence onRoutine. The \"release\" of Hugh Verad upon the population of\nGoldenville is quite similar to the aftermath of the tampering of a mummy's\ntomb in those tales. The first movie I saw in a theater was a matinee showing\nof the classic movie, \"The Mummy\" with Boris Karloff...so maybe it goes all the\nway back to that.Independent writers have to do a lot of extra heavy lifting,\nand so I thank you for your support, feedback, and reviews. It is all greatly\nappreciated.Stephen T.

I am extremely glad my fans demanded their full story. I have penned a full 298 page novel to allow you to see their journey and obstacles. If you are familiar with the series you know these stories center around five African-American friends, Derrin, Marcus, Calvin, Jared and Ennis.  The first story, Derrin's Hot Pursuit parallels Marcus and Kenya's story in time and progression. For that reason, I purposefully wrote two of the same scenes into each book, but the perspectives of the scenes were altered. If you are new to the series, read the stories in this order: Marcus' Dreams Fulfilled, Derrin's Hot Pursuit and Calvin's Trick or Treat.  I am hoping to release Jared's Midtown Meltdown and Ennis' Seductive Surrender in 2014.I will admit that this series is not a sweet romance. It is also not a street literature story either.  I enjoy contemporary romance with erotic love scenes minus the derogatory references and negative stereotypical drama.  Are there curse words? Yeah every now and then.  Will you read a name calling scene? Perhaps depending on the incident.  Is any of it mean spirited and a bad reflection on our culture? Nope.I hope you enjoy this story and my Chasing Love series.  Happy reading!Tucker", "related": ["B00KBX5RB8"], "rank": 1351595, "title": "Marcus' Dreams Fulfilled (Chasing Love Book 3)", "author": "Tucker Davis", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.625, "rating_total": 37.0}

She can usually be found with headphones in and deep into the worlds she has created. There is this thing about her pens if you touch them you might receive a smack to the hand and the well-known glare of destruction.  As a child all her stories involved horses, horses and more horses. There might have been a slight obsession. Writing became more serious in her early twenties but she never dreamed of publishing until much later. Mariana participates yearly in the international event called NANOWRIMO. She has even been known as a Municipal Liaison for that crazy event. There is nothing like the feeling of encouraging other writers, she would say. Outside of writing one of her favorite places to sit and read are the sunny beaches of Florida. At home in Washington State her favorite activity is riding horses up on the mountain trails. She has an awesome group of family and friends that keep her in coffee and encouragement. Then there is her best buddy Tony, her little dog. She suspects he will try and take over the world someday.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.4286, "rating_total": 31.0}
