He doesn't need a partner, he needs a hormone transplant.  After all, Lilah's known Clint for forty years; since she was a toddler.  They helped each other bury their spouses and watched each other become grandparents.   Lilah knows there's no woman in Green Tomato, Oklahoma good enough for Clint. So she decides she needs to distract him, channel his energy until this mid-life crisis is over, until sanity returns and Clint realizes that dating and romance just aren't proper for people their age. The problem is, in devoting all this energy to distracting Clint, Lilah's learning a thing or two about being a forty-something woman in the 1990's instead of the 1890's.  She's learning all kinds of things about sex and seduction, to say nothing about make-up and body sculpting.   The next thing she knows, she's wearing Lycra and riding a mountain bike.  And having very different feelings for her childhood friend.   Now, if she can only turn Clint into a 90's man...Wow, does Cait London have a way with a story!   You won't want to leave Clint and Lilah, or Green Tomato Oklahoma anytime soon! Warning: don't read EVERY GIRL'S GUIDE TO... if it embarrasses you to be caught laughing outloud!

There's a great  little B movie here. First published in 1968, this is a reissue  of the fifth book in the series featuring Evan Tanner, \"whose  sleep center was destroyed in Korea\" but who remains \"not merely  conscious but energetically and productively awake 24 hours a  day.\" It reflects its era of anti-war protests and violent  political activism. Tanner is a jack-of-all-spycraft, member of  (almost all) subversive groups; a man of many guises who hops,  skips and parachutes around the globe on errands from those who  wag the dog. \"The Chief\" has asked him this round to investigate  the Cuban Pavilion at the Montreal Expo. Rumor has it that the  Cubans are using it for something nasty, which proves to be an  understatement, indeed. The first nasty thing Tanner observes at  the fair is the kidnapping of his daughter, Mina. He is unable  to go to the Mounties, since they kicked him out of the country  as a suspected terrorist when he first arrived and are now  hunting him for sneaking back in. He turns for help to some  Quebec nationalists, especially a bright and beautiful young  woman named Arlette, who has a problem of her own. The more  militant of her group want to blow up the Queen of England on  her state visit to the fair. Naturally, she and Tanner team up  to sort out the Cuban plot, rescue Mina and frustrate the  militants, all with a dazzling display of wit and skill. Like  most of Block's books, this is full of humor and high spirits, a  treat for established fans and new readers alike.

Schiff's book is also very timely; exactly ten years after the signing of the Rome Statute, the ICC is now in full operation, but its every move is still formative and carries lasting implications for its future. While the Court stands as a symbol of progress for humanity, it is also the target of criticism from skeptics who argue that the highly politicized institution remains plagued by inefficiency and institutional deficiencies. Schiff's presentation of the Court and its beginnings allows the reader to evaluate these criticisms against an informed and comprehensive picture of the institution and its functions. From the outset, Schiff himself is explicit about his concerns that the practical limitations and political nature of the Court present potentially insurmountable challenges. But he also demonstrates the importance of the Court's work and gives many reasons to be optimistic about the Court's potential. Without advocating for a specific viewpoint, Schiff balances optimism and realism in a way that allows the reader to form his or her own conclusions about the potential and the limitations of the ICC.\"Beatrice Lindstrom, New York University Journal of Law and Politics\"Drawing from multiple strands of international relations theory, Benjamin Schiff examines the creation and operation of the International Criminal Court. He takes a hard look at the political past and future of this new international organization. This important book covers extensive ground and is essential reading for a public concerned - as it should be - with the interplay between law, politics, tragedy, and justice. It is only by studying the International Criminal Court that its work can be improved. By illuminating the path forward, Schiff has done us all a tremendous service.\"-Mark A. Drumbl, Washington and Lee University\"An insightful study of an unprecedented international institution. Ben Schiff, in a clear and flowing analysis, blends history, law and political science into a work of lasting significance.\"-M. Cherif Bassiouni, DePaul University\"A superb systematic examination of the International Criminal Court - the 'streams' of ideas and actions that shaped it, the challenges of building a new, functioning organization; the handling of the first four situations referred to it; and the ongoing tensions between peace and justice and political and judicial choices it faces.  Given its scope, Benjamin Schiff's book is invaluable for both scholars and practitioners; its clear prose also makes it an excellent choice for graduate and upper-level courses in human rights, international law, and international organization.\"-Margaret P. Karns, University of Dayton\"The tensions in the establishment and operations of the ICC are masterfully examined in this comprehensive work by Schiff.  Particularly fascinating is the dilemma between justice and peace in the inaugural four African cases on the docket.  Grounded in international relations theories, this book is a 'must read' for scholars and students of international law and organization and international human rights.\"-Karen Mingst, University of Kentucky\"...a highly readable and perceptive analysis...In his stocktaking, Schiff demonstrates a particular knack of amalgamating all the political and juridical dimensions that challenge this unparalleled institution...To sum up, it can be said that Schiff's book not only provides its reader with internal insights into the origin, architecture, and policy of the youngest and probably most ambitious global institution:  it also develops an implicit vision of its role as a global political player.  Despite an enormous density of information, Schiff manages to tell a fascinating story about diplomatic entanglements, power interests, and international co-operation during the emergence of a new global institution.\"Henning Hahn, Department of Philosophy, University of Kassel, Development in Practice\"A richly detailed, insightful, and engrossing account of the establishment and evolution of one of the world's most important new institutions, this remarkable book is a historical document of major significance.

It has been revered as an aphrodisiac and feared as a cause of leprosy. Populations rise dramatically wherever it is introduced, but reliance on it “ensnares more people in poverty than it lifts out.” Reader traces the evolution of the potato from poisonous Andean weed to global staple, offering adept disquisitions on whatever captures his attention: the mysterious origins of agriculture, the economic history of Peru, the domestic arrangements of the Irish. There are glimpses of the Reign of Terror, when the ornamental gardens of the Tuileries Palace were planted with potatoes, and the Great Potato Boom of 1903 and 1904, when an investment bubble grew as a result of false claims made for a potato strain known as Eldorado. This is a story of invisible systems and unintended consequences, concerned with how the New World transformed the Old.Copyright ©2008Click here to subscribe to The New Yorker", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This is a time of discovery for the inquisitive redhead, who befriends a smart-alecky half-Indian boy, a brain-damaged, unintentionally violent adolescent and a veteran who lost both his legs in the Pacific theater. Terry yearns to explore the Florida swamps with the disabled Deke, and when his mother forbids him, he turns for help to a gypsy conjurer. Moving among adults, he observes but doesn't fully understand sexual relationships, latent racism and the terrible reports from Europe. The oversimplified wonderment Richards gives her young hero often reduces his childhood to an innocence more evocative of nostalgia than wisdom. But she has a strong ability to portray her natural setting and tell a story, although that story often resembles a teenager's adventure novel.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The gift holds treasures the likes of which Leah has never seen: costume jewelry, a pink silk bed jacket (\"like what rich white women wears b'fore bed at night,\" her grandmother tells Leah and her sister), pink satin slippers, nail polish, lipstick. A letter of apology from Leah's aunt to Leah's mother occasions a visit to L.A. with her mother, grandmother and younger sister, and Leah revels in the luxuries of her aunt's privileged world, a stark contrast to the subsistent lifestyle the child knows. Exposure to the freedom from segregation that exists south of the Mason-Dixon line also makes a dramatic impression on the heroine. After the girls' parents perish in a hurricane and the siblings move into the elegant home of kind Olivia and her husband, the youngsters want for nothing. Yet Leah's thoughts of her parents and past haunt her constantly: \"It felt like I was a million miles from Sulphur and crayfish, cotton fields and hand-me-down clothes, a one-room schoolhouse, segregation, and Jim Crow. But I knew one thing. I knew that I would gladly give up this new comfort and freedom to be in my mama's arms, to feel the tenderness in my daddy's touch one more time.\" Though the repetition of similar reflections occasionally slackens the pace of Woods's narrative, she creates some memorable characters, especially Leah, and probes historical events in a personal context that may open many readers' eyes.

He's a sentient AI, capable of creating solid 3-d objects. He's a salesman, and he's damn good at what he does. So good he gets a little bit of leeway when it comes to the boss, who hates him. But when Joel's moodiness pushes his boss a little too far, an unexpected hero steps in to save him--but what will it cost sweet Claire? Once again, Damnation Books provides readers with an excellent short story. The First Angry \"Man\" is an interesting, well-written science-fiction story that reminded me of Phillip K. Dick's short stories. The twist at the end is surprisingly--you definitely don't see it coming! The First Angry \"Man\" is a short, quick read with a lot of depth. King's writing is smooth and easy to read. He paints a great picture of the mundane daily life, and then peels away the layers to show the reader the darker spots.THE PEN AND MUSEThe First Angry Man Author: Samuel King Genre: Science Fiction, short story Publisher: Damnation BooksReviewer: Denise Alicea What I liked: A very interesting and great short story tale of science fiction portions. King describes the future with the question of what would happen to the intelligent creations that the human race creates? The tale follows a man/creation dealing with his past, but will he come to terms? King can certainly describe the future well with a ton of technological advances, but gets into the raw emotions of his human characters.

Although the book lacks the sprightly wit of the incomparable Austen, Collins does successfully capture U.K. courtship rituals of the 1860s. The first match runs rather smoothly: Jessica Courtney, Reverend James Courtney's daughter and manager of the Pemberley Parish School, falls in love with widower Julian Darcy, whose unfaithful wife, Josie, died after a scandalous affair. Julian, a scientist headed for Africa on a research trip, courts her with frequent letters. The second couple is more problematic: wealthy Darcy Gardiner, Julian's 26-year-old nephew, is a sought-after bachelor besotted by school teacher/governess Kathryn \"Kate\" O'Hare. Not only is Kate from a lower class, but she has a secret connection to Gordon Hartley-Brown, the cousin of her former employer Lady Denny, that could threaten her future with Darcy. Collins painstakingly recreates pitch-perfect Austen period notes which her fans will relish, though her story can drag.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Applebaum does all of this while simultaneously not shying away from offering a form of ethical responsibility that is fueled precisely through the recognition of the social ontology and ineluctability of racist complicity. This is racial theory and critical pedagogy born of fearless speech and fearless listening. (George Yancy, Duquesne University)Applebaum has put together an impressive array of theoretical resources in this meticulously argued account of white complicity and its attendant pedagogical challenges. She intricately weaves together her analysis of poststructural subjectivity and agency with philosophical discussions of complicity to articulate a new form of moral responsibility no longer reliant on blame but robustly concerned with responsibility. (Cris Mayo, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)Applebaum’s argument is ultimately a cautionary one, providing no doubt an important corrective to white social justice advocates who think they can somehow bracket or, even worse, move beyond their privilege. Applebaum makes this point extremely well. She also details a very thoughtful model for responsibility under complicity that offers some important broad guidelines for how we ought to think differently about our privilege, and about how we ought to teach about diversity issues.(Journal Of Philosophy Of Education2011-07-01)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I strongly recommend this novel to readers searching for spiritual enlightenment or a bona fide read. --C.

The focus of that first book centered on helping guys to overcome their super-sized fear of being rejected by women while trying to hook up.  We're talking about a paralyzing fear. Fear of rejection was the problem that Mike personally suffered from while growing up, which ultimately left him barren of any social life whatsoever by the age of 25. During those dark days he somehow found a way to turn things around... literally just boot-strapping himself up out of the social gutter.  Step-by step he made small but vital breakthroughs... asking a girl out, going on a date, trying for a kiss.  Fighting his way through the self-hatred and endless recriminations that followed every rejection, Mike finally made it beyond the prison of toxically-shamed affection needs to ultimately overcome an incredible case of rejection phobia. Repeatedly failing at the dating game can cause a man to develop bad social habits or odd public behaviors which make him unappealing and unattractive to women.  This keeps him locked in a deadly, never-ending cycle of failure, rejection and withdrawal that can last for a lifetime if not challenged and interrupted. Mike understands this and his books lay out a plan for turning a guy's luck around women immediately.  He shares the insights, solutions and work-arounds that he managed to develop to eliminate the types of typical problems that shy and introverted men everywhere have had to deal with in desperate silence for too long. Mr. Pilinski's careful comprehension and treatment of these deeply unsettling issues are what makes his work stand out among the sea of boring, repetitious, copy-cat writing in the dating field.  You'll also enjoy Mike's humorous and irreverent writing style.  You'll laugh, cry, pound the wall... but most of all thrill to a journey of self-discovery that you will never soon forget.", "related": ["B00HI0L8YC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Now living out her final days with her socially prominent, but emotionally distant, daughter in New Orleans, Catalina is prompted by her grandson, Wayne Olaf, to record her oral history before it’s too late. In the telling, Catalina reveals a person far different from the frail, incapacitated shell she has become. As a child and teenager in Batista’s Cuba, a headstrong, adventurous Catalina journeyed between two worlds—the American enclave provided to executives of the U.S. sugar company that employed her father, and the impoverished barrios where her friends and caretakers lived. By listening to his grandmother’s tales, Wayne Olaf is emboldened to forge a radically different life for himself than the one his parents had planned. Inspired by her own background, Cuban native Wainwright pens an evocative depiction of a country and family in crisis and transition. --Carol Haggas", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Well, mostly because I'm a creature of habit. I started buying the Frommer's and Let's Go guides years ago because they focus on budget travel. Let's Go is great for backpackers and those on a really tight budget. Frommer's is a bit more mature but still budget-minded (think hotels rather than hostels), and I like their ''Suggested Itineraries'' section and their maps (Frommer's maps are among the best). But now that there are so many other guidebooks to choose from, I buy Frommer's mostly because I can be in and out of the store in minutes rather than hours and I know I'll come home with a reliable guide. Then, just this past month, everything changed . . . I discovered something new . . . You see, when I went to the bookstore to pick up guidebooks for my upcoming honeymoon, I got an idea . . . Why not, I thought, buy five different guidebooks (from five different publishers) and compare them to find my favorite. So that's what I did. I bought one brand for each stop and then, on my way out, I saw a little Paris guide I'd never seen (or heard of) before. So I picked that up too. (I go to Paris at least once a year so I can never have enough Paris guidebooks.) Here's what I found . . . and it surprised me: My favorite book of all for both pre-trip planning and on-the-ground support —isThe Little Black Book of Paris. The other guides I bought are all divided into sections this way: Where to Stay, Where to Eat, What to Do. ButThe Little Black Book of Parisis divided by area. And each area has its own fold-out map (which, to be honest, blows the Frommer's maps out of the water). While the guide doesn't have an entire history or culture section like most of the others do —Lonely Planet, TimeOut, Fodor's, etc. —it's well written and there's an overview of each area at the beginning of each section. I liked the guide so much I went back to the bookstore to buy more.'' --Lori Appling -The Travel Writer's LifeBest Travel Series of the Year, 2008''We select theLittle Black Travel Booksas our travel guide series of the year. The main reasons for designating these guides as best of the year are their portability and user friendliness. (The spiral binding allows the reader to keep the book open to a certain page.) Individual volumes are small enough to fit into a pocket, but in terms of helpfulness, they are twice their physical dimensions. The other reason these guides are so worthy of praise is the fact that each volume has a neat, tidy, and nicely detailed foldout map to the particular area under discussion. The chapters in each volume correspond to the geographical areas into which the authors divide the city for the tourist. Each chapter gives basics on places to see, available art, and entertainment venues, places to eat and drink, where to shop, and where to stay. You can study a range of guides before your actual trip, but this is definitely a commendable candidate for carrying with you on site.'' --American Library Association", "related": ["B008GWMH3M"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They speak to each other in Star Trek code, know all the tricks in every arcade game and can talk about anything while sitting under one specific traffic light at a quiet intersection. The only problem? They've both recently fallen in love with Ellen Trumbull, the most beautiful, most popular girl in school. When Ellen takes a fancy to Bob and introduces him to her rarefied social milieu, Pete is left on the margins. Bob finds that he has no one in which to confide his anxiety about all the new experiences related to having his first girlfriend; to his adolescent dismay, he also has no one to brag to. While Pete builds a life without him, Bob discovers that all is not as perfect as it seems in the upper echelons of high school society. Although the jocks and prom queens present a veneer of coolness, the suicide of one of their own, golden boy Todd Woods, has thrown their assumed invulnerability into question. As Bob and Pete strive to reconnect after Bob's romantic betrayal, they discover that everyone, even the wealthiest and the prettiest, suffers from the same emotional growing pains. Taylor channels the thoughts, feelings and perspective of the male teenager so effectively that the reader may experience acute nostalgia--whether positive or negative--for his or her early teen days....

The odor of tent tarpaulin, campfire smoke and river water seeped into my senses and memories far too deep to ever be removed. I have been married to the love of my life, Elsa for thirty-five years and we raised five children, four sons and one daughter surrounded by the same tall hills that grabbed my great, great, great, grandfather and held him with their magical beauty. I attended Morehead State University where creative writing quickly overshadowed all other studies nullifying other academic desires. At Morehead State, I had the opportunity to study writing under a very special group of professors that became my friends from the beginning. I am an avid tennis fanatic and enjoy being on the court almost as much as writing. There is something about the one on one challenge of an individual sport that strikes the refuse to lose chord in my heart. Tennis, like writing, is all about understanding, toiling, digging deep without fear and a willingness to learn from each outing to become the best you can be and to produce as many wins as possible.", "related": ["B00E0D0JZ4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When Shahnaz refused to accept the abuse, she was plunged into violent conflict with her family, who condemned her for bringing disrespect on their name by trying to win her independence. They repeatedly assaulted and humiliated her to make her toe the line. After she left her second husband to get away from the beatings, they imprisoned her in her own bedroom. When they later tricked her into joining them in Pakistan she was beaten, stripped of all her possessions, threatened with shooting and drowning and put under house arrest. It was only through her intelligence and extraordinary courage that Shahnaz was eventually able to win her freedom and her family's respect and start building an independent life in England with her daughter and third husband.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In any event I only completed it this year. And you know what? It's not a magnum opus. It's not a work of great genius. It's just a really good thriller following in the steps of far greater writers than I. But I still love it. I still think its good. I still enjoy reading it - and lord knows I have read it at least twenty times from start to finish! I'm not a great writer. But I am a good story teller. I would be content for that as my epitaph. One day if I live long enough, I hope to complete the second Drew Ransom book, A WARM FROST. I hope that any readers of A SHORT LIFE will hope I do it too.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Like most people, I grew up in very humble beginnings. My father worked, my mother was a housewife and I have two sisters who eventually grew to be heroes in my life. In my younger years my family was far from wealthy but we were together and we were happy. It was after my first seven years that my parents separated and my life began its journey of being the amazing story that I like to think it's become. From that very young age, due to interesting circumstances, my family of three, sans my father, began to grow and kept growing until it expanded into an extended family of over a dozen. These years captured the events that inspired my creative mind. I started writing when I was twelve years old but it was about fifteen years ago when I considered the real possibility of sharing my stories with people other than those closest to me. Over the years, I've written and or developed concepts for dozens of short stories and novels. My family and friends provided experience, my God given old soul gave me insight and extraordinary life events conceived a mind to write and express my words in exaggerated style.  Some of my experiences are unforgettable and I'll cherish forever and others are ones that most people would rather sooner forget. But no matter how bumpy or unfortunate things were, I wouldn't ever want to forget them. I've grown to learn that the common saying everything happens for a reason is one of the truest phrases ever spoken. God blessed me with the talent to embellish and exaggerate real life experiences to create them into interesting and vivid fictional situations. With that, I present a selection of my short stories that I call Bootlegs and Antidotes.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Oliver Keaton is sure he is about to get a baby brother. Much to his chagrin, baby Julie arrives, on Groundhog's Day—a good metaphor that sets the tone for the story. He attempts to trade his well-behaved baby sister for a brother. He discovers that his friends' baby brothers cry all day long, or are up all night, and scraps that option, but Oliver continues his quest to find the perfect one. In one funny scene, he notices a sign at the zoo that says, \"Change Babies Here,\" and figures this would be the perfect place to exchange his sibling; crying babies go in, and happy babies come out. He goes inside, and the odor has him running for cover. Observant Oliver becomes quite insightful and discriminating as he compares and contrasts Julie's positive qualities to those of other babies, and a strong, protective bond develops. Then Mom and Dad announce that they are expecting again and Oliver imagines the fun \"guy\" activities he will someday share with his new unborn brother. How will he feel if it's another sister? The watercolor illustrations include cartoon characters with a lot of expression and an adorable Julie always dressed in pink. Some pages use ellipses, which will keep readers guessing and turning pages to get to the next plot point. The ending of this tale is heartwarming and satisfying. This wise and humorous selection is a winner for storytime or sharing one-on-one.—Anne Beier, Hendrick Hudson Free Library, Montrose, NYCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After thirty years of government contract work with the CIA, Jack called it quits, while his friend Nathan continued to work inside the Agency. Jack returns to his hometown of Kaleheo, Kauai, to enjoy his retirement, but quickly finds himself immersed in helping NASA divert an errant, Soviet satellite from Los Angeles.While in Kauai, Jack learns that his father had spied for the Office of Naval Research prior to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor.

He enlists the help of his friend, Jason Kamoto, who received numerous construction contracts from the U.S. Government to build new CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. Jason is financially set for life having inherited his father’s construction business in Tokyo. Little does Jack know but that Jason is working secretly with the CIA to kill Jack and save Japan and the U.S. the embarrassment of colluding to start World War II.Jack falls in love with Julie Stinson, who unbeknown to him is an undercover CIA operative intent on retrieving the precious documents or killing Jack. After saving her life from an attempted suicide, Jack and Julie join forces to combat the Agency’s desire to save the American President from denigration and deceit. Jack relies on Nathan’s surveillance expertise to place him safely in Geneva, the site of the upcoming G-7 economic summit. Jack’s intent is to go public and force the United States to acknowledge its complicity with Japan to bring about World War II. The President’s political and military advisors are hell bent to kill Jack, but at the last moment Nathan foils the government’s plan to murder Jack and Julie.The romantic pair escape Geneva to return to Washington to brief Senator Josh Ralston, chair of the Senate Oversight Committee on Intelligence. With Nathan’s help a secret videotape of Jason Kamoto’s admission of the documents brings down a U.S. President and his devious plan to join with Japan to control the Eurodollar and imports coming into Europe and the U.K.This fast-paced novella is set on the beautiful island of Kauai with its luscious vegetation, mild climate, and sensual beauty.

In the Size Of My Life Karen leaves no leaf unturned as she tells you just how life was for her, living with the inability to understand her own needs and feelings. As I read her story I thought, such courage, because she bares it all. Having experienced the alienating effects this can have, I see Karen has taken the risk of losing everything to help herself and others. Her vulnerability gives any reader who is seeking recovery, real effective insights for how they too can break out of an eating disorder. Thank you Karen for writing this book, it illustrates well that a considerable part of recovery is about understanding how we feel. --Esther Willson, an Amazon.com Kindle Verifired PurchaserLiving Life Beyond The Struggles Of Size, Karen Cigna writes from the heart, and she does it with grit, determination, and guts. Defying the publishing industry's decree that a funny and well crafted memoir of a regular person did not make commercial sense, Karen Cigna has constructed a unique triple threat that is equal parts painfully honest memoir, how-to for picking up the pieces of a shattered life, and educational material on emotional and eating disorders. Taken as a whole, The Size of My Life is an enormous success, a fitting tribute to its author and her family --Amanda W. Doll, an Amazon.com Kindle Verifired PurchaserBrave, funny, and heartfelt, Karen Cigna's The Size Of My Life is part memoir, part self-help book, and part companion for difficult times.

The questions in this quiz are\n similar to the CPP exam questions. I have just separated the questions\nin to subcategories to help focus the attention. I also provide more\nquestions in my series than the CPP asks in their rigorous examination.If\n I had encountered this book before I took the CPP exam, I would have studied it to understand the technical aspects of photography that I really understood, and those aspects that I needed to study more. I am amazed at the amount of learning that I soak up each year as I study, teach, and put into practice in my professional photography business.I\nencourage you to use all available resources to learn about photography.\n These 101 series books will help to develop your knowledge, but you will need to consult\nother sources of knowledge to learn and understand some of the concepts\nincluded in the quiz questions. I consulted many sources as I grew as a\nphotographer and studied for the CPP exam.

But, while the traditional Disney\nanimation style is still widely admired, Pixar's computer-generated\nimagery caught the imagination of an entirely new generation, and\nconverted many of the older generation as well.\nHis NeXT Computer company, which he founded in 1985 after the first\ntime he left Apple, was considered by many to be producing hardware\nwhich was far superior to anything that was commercially available at\nthe time. And even though NeXT machines did not sell in huge quantities,\n the technology eventually formed the basis of Apple's resurgence when\nJobs returned to the company in 1996. Moreover, it was on a NeXT\nworkstation that Tim Berners-Lee first developed the World Wide Web,\nwhile working at CERN. *", "related": [], "rank": 2192698, "title": "Pioneers of the Computer Age", "author": "Abdul Montaqim", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A thirty-five year veteran of the music bizz, \"Lonesome\" is a singer/songwriter/guitarist whose pinups are rhythm'n blues artists the likes of which once graced the halls of Chess, Sun, and Motown Records. He's also a big fan of the immortals Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Sara Vaughn, Dinah Washington, and kin. The list goes on. From Blues to Jazz to electric to eclectic and back. I suppose he's a bit of a history buff. But if you ask him, he'll just smile and say he's more of a stick in the mud. Since he was knee-high to a toadstool, \"Lonesome\" has dabbled in writing. He'll tell you that he likes words, but at the same time, he'll tell you that he likes a good story even better. I can attest, right here, he's always got a ball of yarn ready to unravel. He might string you along, but trust me, you'll enjoy the ride. Just don't ask him about Raymond Chandler or Dash Hammet. He'll go on forever about them. Or Erle Stanley Garder, either. Erle Stanley, an ex courtroom judge, was the guy that came up with Perry Mason. \"Lonesome' can talk up a storm about ol' Stanley. As we speak, \"Lonesome\" is working on two new projects. One is entitled, Celestial Meanderings (the ultimate coffeetable book, with or without the coffee or the table) It's a frank and often humorous testimonial to the strange and wonderful goings on, as it were, in between all the ordinary, day to day affairs. There are lines in there that will make your eyes pop. I know, he's let me have a peek. He's also working on another Leon Strong novel. If you thought Fission Factor was wild . . . Well, I'd like to spill more, as \"Lonesome\" would say, but I've been asked to keep a lid on it. The true mystery man, you see, is truly a man of mystery. But stay tuned, something tells me the fun is just getting started.

Where did you get the idea for Time Reich?A.It's hard to say where stories come from. But I do know how Time Reich got its start. The first catalyst was a trip I took to Germany back in 1991. I was there to visit friends, but they worked, so during the weekdays I traveled and saw the sights. My favorite city turned out to be Munich--beautiful and friendly, there was a party every night at the beer halls. One day I decided to take the S-bahn out to Dachau to visit the infamous concentration camp. There was no particular reason other than that I've always been a history buff, and that was one of the few World War II-related sites I had come across. For the most part, though the memory of the war was still fresh, there was little in Germany to acknowledge the war had even taken place.Q. What was Dachau like?A.It was a cold, raw day. The camp was basically being allowed to fall into ruin, but there was a good museum and interpretive center to tell the sad story of what took place there. The weedy grounds and crumbling brick buildings made quite an impression and, needless to say, my writer's imagination went right to work.Q. How did that experience evolve into a novel?A.The second impetus for Time Reich came years before that trip, when I met the wonderful author William Styron. His book Sophie's Choice had come out not long before. He told a group of aspiring writers like me how he had become obsessed with the idea of writing a Holocaust book and flew to Poland to visit Auschwitz. The idea for his iconic character grew out of that trip.     Years later, visiting Dachau, I understood what Styron meant about the power of place. But there would be a final catalyst for Time Reich in the form of news articles about some of the last Nazi war criminals being brought to trial. When I was working as a news editor at a daily newspaper, these stories would come across the Associated Press wire. There was a flood of arrests in the 1990s brought on by the fall of the Iron Curtain because old war records were suddenly made available from many of the Eastern European nations that had been liberated from Communist rule.      More than one former camp guard who had been living in obscurity, maybe working a factory job in one of the Rust Belt cities in America, had finally been found out when this windfall of wartime records revealed his true identity.     Some additional research into the Office of Special Investigations and an interview with an agent there helped me understand OSI's role in bringing war criminals to justice. Thus, OSI agent Kate Crockett was born.Q. How long did it take you to write the book?A.All these pieces of a story had been floating around, and now page by page, scene by scene, Time Reich came together. I wrote most of the novel while I was an MFA student in Creative Writing and a lot of the book went through the workshop process. Ultimately, there would be a number of changes, a lot of revision, a lot of putting this story down and coming back to it later. In some ways it's a story that has been twenty years in the making, but for me, sharing Bram McCoy's story has been worth the wait.", "related": ["B004U2USMY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He graduated as one of only seven men, from a beginning-class of 57 enrollees. Dave spent four years in the Navy, stationed in Coronado, San Diego with the UDT/SEAL teams. He made one tour to Vietnam/Westpac. At the end of his 4-year tour Dave moved to Los Angeles and started a commercial diving business, mostly performing underwater maintenance on yachts. Gold prices were going up dramatically during late 1979, and Dave began to consider that he might be able to use his diving ability and experience to recover gold from the bottom of California s rivers.

After reading all of the available literature on underwater mining, they found the information was not much more than instructions on how to assemble the equipment. Dave and his partners had a very difficult time of it in the beginning, trying to figure out by themselves workable methods of locating gold deposits. It was several months of severe hardship before Dave and his partners located their first commercial-grade gold deposit (about $60 a day), which was enough to pay expenses and feed them. Dave s partners lost interest before the spring-thaw, and departed with the dredge, truck, and most of the other equipment they were using together. After his partners left, Dave found himself alone in the forest, living in a tent, with very few resources to get by on.

While our family has followed this counsel for years, it wasn't until early 2008 that I became familiar with the term \"prepper.\" My view of preparedness is mostly concerned with practical preparedness or, put another way, self-reliance through the wise use of resources. While there is a place for tactical and hardcore wilderness survivalist topics, it isn't a focus of my writings. My belief is that small-scale personal disasters, like a job loss or illness, are much more likely than the large-scale end of the world catastrophe, and those more personal disasters should be the focus of our preparations.", "related": ["B009MRLVEQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was an 8 x 11 coffee table book of 40 pages with antique colors framing the black and white photos. They were not seen before because they were glass plate negatives stored in the basement of an old home and forgotten by the family. The family sold the home and as it was being cleaned out, a friend of mine recognized the photographic plates and asked to have them before they went to the dumpster. They are a unique look at town life in the time from about 1890 to 1905.In researching for the captions I met many wonderful people and saw parts of town I never noticed before. So this project has brought to me a richness I  never could have imagined.The Needham Farmers Market is today a reality. The photobook is still a part of the project as it continues to gather interested people to take notice of the market, buy a few vegetables,  and make a little donation too.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She was always telling stories, so it came as no surprise to my family that as soon as she learned how to form letters, she started writing stories. Her first attempt was very predictable, but it also showed a gift for description and character development. From that point on there was no stopping her.  Outside of writing, Elizabeth has a passion for art. After designing her own covers, she received such positive feedback it wasn’t long before she started creating covers for others. A self-proclaimed “techno geek”, she loves cell phones, computers, tablets and all things technological. The internet has to be the greatest invention since the wheel, in her opinion. She lives in a quiet subdivision with her husband, three cats, and far too many electronics. She has a near crippling Facebook addiction, dwarfed only by her addiction to Dr. Pepper. She enjoys making jewelry and costumes. She’s always loved Halloween because it's the one day of the year that you can be what ever you want.", "related": ["B00EU59P7U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 4.375, "rating_total": 70.0}

The second edition has been revised and updated throughout and includes a new foreword by Mark Allan Powell.\"In my opinion, Roger Stronstad'sThe Charismatic Theology of St. Lukeis perhaps the most important biblical studies book ever written by a Pentecostal. Truly a seminal work, this slim volume caused a seismic shift in the terrain of pentecostal biblical scholarship, changing forever its fundamental character while sending tremors beyond the tradition in all directions. I am delighted that this exceedingly important piece will continue its well-deserved shelf life, extending its availability for readers old and new. My commendation to Baker Academic for issuing this valuable new edition.\"--John Christopher Thomas, Pentecostal Theological Seminary\"The most influential work on Lukan pneumatology of this generation! Twenty-five years ago, Stronstad solidified my earliest convictions about the activity of the Holy Spirit. Today, my students echo the same refrain. Those familiar with pentecostal/charismatic teaching on the Spirit-filled life find fodder for fresh reflection and exploration. Those not familiar receive a challenging invitation for renewed pursuit of the Spirit. I could not be happier that this book has been revised and will remain in print.\"--Martin Mittelstadt, Evangel University\"With the publication of Stronstad'sThe Charismatic Theology of St. Lukein 1984, pentecostal scholarship on Luke-Acts introduced itself to the academic community. By tracking plot patterns and considering Luke's storytelling techniques, Stronstad found Luke's understanding of the mission of Christ and the church, and the nature of Spirit empowerment to effect it. In our graduate curriculum, this book is the cornerstone of our 'pentecostal distinctives' course. With this updated edition, the book's contribution will live on, hopefully until the mission is complete.\"--Van Johnson, Master's Pentecostal Seminary, TorontoPraise for the First Edition\"This work is a solid contribution to pentecostal theology and successfully answers the critics who claim that pentecostal theology is exegetically weak. I recommend this book highly with the suggestion that it should be in the library of any serious student of the Holy Spirit and the Word.\"--Gary M.

However, when Edward goes missing on a trip abroad, she and Julian develop a begrudging friendship that soon blossoms into more. With the deadline to be wed looming, Cassie must decide whether following her heart is worth risking everything she’s ever cherished. Marks’ second historical romance, following Miss Quinn’s Quandary (2008), portrays Regency-era social mores that will appeal more to traditional romance readers than fans of Marks’ contemporary romances, Geek to Chic (2006) and Honeymoon Husband (2007). While her characters are feisty and engaging, Marks’ attempt at period-appropriate language is stilted at times. But she will have a chance to perfect her style: a third historical romance is in the works. --Aleksandra Walker", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 42.0}

This isn't one of them. Let's get that out of the way upfront. The truth of the publishing industry is that selling your first book is always a bit of an uphill struggle. For many authors, that's true for the next book and the one after, too. My promise to you is not that you'll be a millionaire overnight - if I could make millionaires at the click of my fingers why would I be giving that advice away for a low price when I could be making millions instead? So the promise is simple but far more real: I'll give you the platform to sell your books online successfully. Let's take a look at what that means. Publishing is a brutal game. Not everywhere, mind you. If you wanted to publish in Oman last year, you'd have had a grand total of 7 competitors. They're not all that prolific in Fiji either, where the sum total of published works just slipped past the 400 mark. However, don't forget that in those markets there's a limited number of readers for your work, too.The holy grail for English language writers is to crack the US and UK markets. The bad news is that everyone else is trying to do just that. Bowker's estimates for 2012 show that there were nearly 15 million ISBN numbers issued for those markets. If 15 million competing products weren't enough - my own ISBN number is registered in Switzerland, and I sell in those markets too. I know there are many others in my shoes.If you want to make sales; you need to stand out from the crowd. I think you need three things to get there: great writing, a little bit of luck and a solid online presence. That's where I come in. You deliver the writing, the universe delivers the luck and I show you how to build your online portfolio for sales.You can then stop relying on your book to sell itself (sadly it almost certainly won't) and you can ensure that you start getting that \"word of mouth\" that drives readers to read your book.Is this an effort-free process? No. It's a 90 day practical program to building an amazing author sales and promotion platform. You know you can write and engage others, you know you're interesting - my book helps you take those skills and become your own marketing team.", "related": ["B00CMMFSPG"], "rank": 1701097, "title": "How to Build a Powerful Writer’s Platform in 90 Days eBook", "author": "Austin Briggs", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.3, "rating_total": 43.0}

As an integral part of innate immunity and critical mediator in homeostatic and inflammatory processes, the human complement system has been identified as contributor to a large number of disorders including ocular, cardiovascular, metabolic, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases as well as in ischemia/reperfusion injury, cancer and sepsis. In addition, complement is often involved in adverse immune reactions to biomaterials, cell and organ transplants or drug delivery systems. Although the complement cascade with its close to 50 extracellular protein targets has long been recognized as an attractive system for therapeutic modulation, the past few years have seen a particularly strong boost in interest. Fueled by novel research insight and the marketing of the first complement-targeted drugs, a plethora of highly creative treatment approaches and potent drug candidates have recently emerged and are currently evaluated in disease models and clinical trials. The chapters in this book cover a wide range of topics related to the development of complement therapeutics, ranging from the molecular and functional description of complement targets to the presentation of novel inhibitors, improved treatment strategies as well as examples of disease models and clinical applications. The broad and up-to-date overview on a highly versatile and dynamic field renders this book an indispensable source of information for researchers and clinicians dealing with therapeutic and disease-related aspects of the human complement system.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In a country built on meritocracy and populated by the world’s unwashed masses, a caste system of old, powerful, and somewhat batty aristocratic families persists. InThe Red Cadillac: The Mysterious World of Old Money, Peter W. Cookson Jr. unveils America's aristocracy through autobiography. Cookson’s mother and father, two bohemian actors, divorced early in his childhood. Their paths diverged wildly: his mother plunging into poverty and alcoholism, while his father remarried an heiress. Cookson describes growing up part West Coast wild \"Apache,\" and part East Coast Old Money hanger-on. As American political debate crescendos around taxes for the super-rich, this a refreshing dip into the (shallow) gene pool of a secretive subgenre of the wealthy. Cookson browns a nice little roast on this bonfire of the vanities. --Benjamin Moebius", "related": [], "rank": 1028407, "title": "The Red Cadillac (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Peter Cookson", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He grew up in the city of Wellington, renown for its high winds and the almost magical ability of rain and sleet to be lifted off the street and blasted into one's face.  After eighteen years of suffering the cold and wet, he was finally blown away in a particularly bad storm to settle far away as a student, for more years then most would ever admit to. Then finally when the universities pronounced him done he became an overqualified and underpaid worker in the health sector, (aren't we all). He has lived in the city of Rotorua, one of the very few places in the world where people have actually chosen to reside beside active geysers and breath air that reeks of sulfur, for the past fifteen years. He works by day for his daily bread by speaking to people about their various diarrhoeal illnesses. While at night he toils away on his books. When not engaged in his great passions of reading and writing science fiction and fantasy, drinking strong black coffee (some call it tar), and consuming copious amounts of chocolate (dark naturally), he lives a quiet life of contemplation as the high priest to his two cats. His duties include worshipping them with regular gifts of food, the occasional grooming and providing them with a warm dry place to sleep. They in turn look down upon him with typical feline disdain, but occasionally deign to bring him gifts of headless vermin - as a warning. In a desperate bid to understand the meaning of his life, he has recently started studying philosophy, particularly metaphysics, and come to a startling conclusion. God is a cat!

The thick shaft felt\nheavenly spreading his lips apart, and the smooth skin that was wrapped so\ntightly around the hardness felt even better to his tongue as he caressed it.\nHe would have loved to envelop the handsome erection all the way and give deep\nthroat, but he had to resist the temptation. That would almost certainly have\nawoken the sleeping man, with possible dire consequences. Instead, Lester kept\nhis lips wrapped around the very welcome and very hard dick for a few seconds\nbefore slowly raising his face again. He\ndid not completely remove Stanley's cock from his mouth, but kept the head\nnestled between his lips again and licked it some more. It felt even better than\nit had the first time he had touched the man like that, and his lips and tongue\nrejoiced even more as he once again engulfed the hard dick as far as he dared.\nStan's body was still squirming on the bed, but his movements seemed to be\nstronger, as if he were ready to climax into the pussy that was most likely the\ncenter of his dream. Lester\nhoped not, at least not too soon, because he was having such a terrific time\nsucking the sleeping man's cock in and out of his mouth. He even dared hope to\nget a nice, big gusher of cum, but he wanted to enjoy the sensation of a\nmouthful of man-meat before he got a mouthful of semen. He was quiet as he\ncould be and extra careful to avoid doing anything to wake up the man whose\nstiff cock was providing him with so much pleasure, but he was not careful\nenough.", "related": ["B00KFKXV10"], "rank": 2525980, "title": "Dicks in the Dorm (Dormitory Slut Book 1)", "author": "George Boxlicker", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 2.0, "rating_total": 16.0}

Shauna, his new assistant, will accompany him interviewing couples--including a BDSM Billionaire and his beautiful submissive--who will introduce her to a larger (and more compelling) world of relationships than she has ever known. From the use of all the tools of BDSM, to the many types of punishment and how a professional Dominatrix uses Humiliation--each of the many couples teach Shauna something new--about herself.When the Alpha Dominant Dr. Jacob Desmet begins to pressure Shauna to move their relationship from detached professionals to violate all research ethics by becoming his submissive, there is no easy choice for her to make. How willing is the virgin Shauna to risk her future career by answering her own questions about love and sex by crossing a forbidden line if she responds to her mentor's advances? (A Coming of Age heroine who learns about life from a BDSM Billionaire and many others in a novella of over 24,000 words so steamy your Kindle may fog over.

If she had not heard him breathing, she might have thought he had left her alone in the room. She felt an aching need for him to continue, now that he had brought her so far.

He played with both of them in this way and then sucked a nipple into his mouth, clasping it between his teeth and lower lip. It was all she could do not to move--not to cry out. He released her from his mouth, and then ran his tongue in a slow spiral around her breasts. His warm saliva turned cool in the circulating air.", "related": ["B00D4V1X94"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We are at our most vulnerable when naked, when giving ourselves unreservedly to another human being, and I love to explore and describe the dark and dangerous themes thus engendered. An erotic story, I believe, should say more than who did what to whom - it should say something about what it is to be human. We should learn something from it. When our physical needs are in conflict with society's constraints, a fertile fictional furrow is sown and it is surely the writer's duty to consider the resulting harvest. Written almost exclusively in first person, my stories may include references to an adulterous partner, and the protagonist often uses this as a springboard/justification for his/her own amorous adventures. Indeed, my own impetus to write has sublimated from real and often debilitating heartache. Having four older brothers and having enjoyed the diverse delights of several talented, intelligent and passionate lovers, I feel equally comfortable writing from either the male or female perspective. Such has been the importance of men in my life, it does not surprise me that the majority of my stories are told with their words and are seen through their eyes.I love stories where any sex that occurs is 'forbidden' (but not underage or incest, as they are anathema to me) and there is inner turmoil. I need to know what the characters are thinking, why they are there, what drives them. And I love the sex to be graphic, touching and honest, rather than porn mag fantasy: I try to make my characters real people with real insecurities, failings and doubts. In so doing, I believe their experiences will appear more believable while being, at the same time, even more remarkable.If you enjoy my torrid tales, my naughty shorties, or have any comments or questions whatsoever, please feel free to contact me.", "related": ["B00GKP6KYO"], "rank": 3814856, "title": "Sensual Ghosts", "author": "Alexandra Amalova", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His love for animals prompted his study in Biology at University of North Carolina at Greensboro. After graduating from college, he searched for a career he could enjoy. Keeping fish aquariums both as a hobby and a job seemed like the ideal solution; Laurren opened an aquarium service company and began servicing aquariums in the Greensboro area. Immediately his phone started ringing with simple fish-keeping questions. Laurren felt the area needed a knowledgeable aquarium store. Armed with ambition, no money and a baby on the way he decided to create one. In a family-owned space, the tiny fish store materialized. Since these meager beginnings, Aquamain's Fish World grew into one of the largest aquarium stores on the east coast. Laurren grew his small retail aquarium store of 1,500 square feet into a 10,000 square foot superstore. After 25 years, Laurren left Aquamain's Fish World, taking with him the aquarium service clients and opened a new aquarium service company to pursue a different adventure. He has spent many years teaching and training his customers in the experts' way to keep fish, plants, invertebrates and corals healthy and thriving for years. His desire and passion is to share his knowledge so that anyone can be a successful hobbyist. He is the aquarium expert at answers.com as well as creates informative educational products for the pet industry and aquarium hobbyist.

It's packed with misunderstandings, mishaps, bizarre exchanges and loads of laughs. Along with other books about these three stooges, yarns about this zany trio are rapidly becoming a cult series from an author with a seemingly endless fund of crazy ideas and themes. Strongly recommended if you enjoy a good laugh.Laughter starts on page one and continues with zany, Pythonesque characters. Suspect that many of them are a montage of some real life loonies, just as some of the crazy impressions ring true to outrageous characters  that we've all come across from time to time and which the author has accurately captured. This collection of hilarious, short, comic whodunits will appeal to those who enjoy the surreal - the plots showing mercurial twists and turns, each one crazier than the last but retaining the thoroughly enjoyable dialogue from sketch to sketch whilst enabling the reader to dip in or short periods without losing the plot or the sense of the bizarre.  These\nstories are plain entertaining. They remind me of the Goon shows.The characters are the most interesting part: you can sense the good\nchemistry between the three police officers as they go about solving the more\nor less improbable crimes.The 3\npolice officers in Death in the Outback are a crazy team that\nsomehow solves crimes. It's improbable and laughable but what's\nnot improbable is the characters they reminded me of people I know. Yes, they talk in clichés but people do. I can see this being filmed and the team would become people that\nthe audience love to hate.", "related": ["B0093ARGLE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Terry and Pam were energetic in seeing their children grew 'straight' However, Terry and Pamela discovered that sometimes the unexpected changes the expected outcome. The lessons they learned through their struggle when their oldest son became a prodigal and then killed himself taught them great lessons and gave them greater compassion for all God's children in any circumstances, anywhere.

Her mother, who knew Karen very well, turned to her and said, “You know, Karen, you keep talking about these stories, but you never write them down.

Being a teenager when you happen to be a Shifter, when the universe is your playground, when you live with vampires or your world is under siege by demons is even more complicated. Or at least, that’s what Angela’s characters tell her; her own teenage years were fairly uneventful… and still, rather complicated at times, too. She grew up in France, the quiet, bookish, geeky older sister to an athletic younger brother, and started at fourteen to put down on paper the stories that were playing in her head. Her first story was a sci-fi short set in space... and was probably sufficiently inspired by Star Wars to trigger a lawsuit! Her next effort was a longer, also sci-fi story that earned her the first place in a novella contest in her high school. Her parents' stunned expressions upon receiving an invitation to attend the prize ceremony were interesting...although really, what did they think she was doing, typing on her electronic typewriter for hours every night? Switching to writing in English was a process, and for a time Angela focused on more adult stories, but her first loves have called her back for too long to ignore them any longer...

Unlike us though, they're uniquely equipped to explore those loves and lusts in their (sometimes) most extreme forms...Does power always corrupt? Does privilege always jade? And what happens when those who have everything find that the one thing that can't be bought is the only thing that really matters?If you'd like to read more about this world, please see the list below.

Hadassah has two cubs, Tadashi the male and Sakura the female, who are named after the nearby lake where they lived. Apart from the dangers of the Siberian Tiger, who is a threat to this leopard family, the real threat comes from the poachers who hunt these animals for many purposes. One day the cubs see their mother being killed by the poachers. Sakura follows the men who take away the lifeless body of her mother. Tadashi is caught by one of the Earth-Watchers and the story is a poignant tale of Tadashi and the Earth-Watcher John. Will Tadashi meet his long lost sister Sakura one day?The story conveys the beautiful message of preserving endangered animals and all animals whose contribution is vital for the continuation of our planet. The story is simple and the illustrations are colorful and they give these snow leopards and other characters a personality. I found the book very educational for children because it speaks to them about the mysterious wildlife that exists in the Himalayas and about the dangers faced by the endangered wild cats there who are hunted down by poachers, thereby reducing their numbers.The book also told me what Earth-Watchers are and what they do. The corruption and greed that exist among people and the destruction caused to the environment because of that is also another theme that the author conveys through this story.", "related": [], "rank": 1631764, "title": "The Snow Cat: The Earth-Watchers", "author": "Lester Ferguson", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Gan forms many alliances as he rises to power over the peoples of the region. He links up with the Rose Priestess Sylah, a war healer; Tate, a soldier from the past time of the \"giants\" who must keep her origin a secret; and Clas, who becomes Gan's ever-dependable friend and fighting instructor. Together they battle evil in all its forms, ultimately challenging the sadistic King Altanar. McQuinn ( Targets ), a retired major in the Marine Corps, graphically informs his epic with a solid understanding of military tactics. And he includes much that could lift the tale out of the company of Conan the Barbarian , such as a dose of feminism and conflicting allegiances to church, state and personal interests. But these elements are secondary to the well-worn story of a male hero fulfilling a violent destiny of conquest. \"Like the stars above, he had his course.\" And, for the most part, it's one we've seen before.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
