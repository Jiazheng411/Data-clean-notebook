In 1920, however, his luck changed when Scribner bought his first manuscript, This Side of Paradise, and introduced him to the world, which welcomed him warmly. This latest Library of America volume includes that first novel plus several works written during Fitzgerald's younger and more vulnerable years: Flappers and Philosophers (short stories, 1920), The Beautiful and Damned (novel, 1922), and Tales of the Jazz Age (short stories, 1922). The short stories include such gems as \"Bernice Bobs Her Hair,\" \"The Ice Palace,\" and \"A Diamond as Big as the Ritz.\" Though all this material is readily available, and, one hopes, always will be, it's wonderful having Fitzgerald's fledgling works together in a quality hardcover.

He felt no anger, no concern, just a desire to get back to work. He was no stranger to threats— e-mailed, snail-mailed or otherwise. He'd received them from his father; from recently fired and subsequently pissed-off employees of his family's media empire, AMS; from women, past lovers who had refused to accept the end of a relationship.The threats were irritating, yes. But impactful?No.The thirty-one-year-old media mogul knew who he was and what he wanted—in business and in life—and no amount of outside influence was going to change that.Trent signed a stack of contracts as outside the floor-to-ceiling windows to his left, the sun crept up the horizon bringing with it a hot new August day and an office building buzzing with activity.\"Good morning, Mr. Tanford.\"Trent's door was open, as it usually was before 7:00 a.m. He nodded at one of his new young executives as she passed by, a pretty and brilliant redhead who had just graduated New York University the previous year. He glanced at the clock on his monitor. \"Six-thirty. Good for you.\"\"Yes, sir.\" She smiled an ultraprofessional smile and moved on.Trent went back to work. She was pretty, but he never dipped his pen into the company ink pot, not to mention the fact that she was way too young. But he did like redheads. In fact, he had a date with one tonight. A woman who was just as pretty, but not nearly as brilliant. Which was fine. Trent sniffed as he recalled their date the previous evening. The woman had spent twenty minutes assuring him that Mitt Romney was no politician, but was in fact a famous baseball player.Trent grinned. He loved women. He loved the way they laughed, smelled, moved—each so different, yet so similar in their belief that she was going to be the one to change him, the one to bag him, the one to make him so deliriously happy he'd forget all about that ultrastrict dating code he'd followed for the past ten years: four weeks maximum then all ties cut.Why didn't they get it? Why couldn't they understand that he'd never come to heel? He'd never be bagged. In his past experience, Trent had learned the hard way that in four weeks a woman could become more than a casual distraction, and going there again was unacceptable at this point in his life.Trent moved on to his computer and the must-see lineup for the following year. He was no insensitive ass when it came to his view of relationships. He was always up-front about the four weeks, and whatnotto expect from him. It wasn't a personal attack on anyone; it had nothing to do with a woman's beauty or her personality. It was simply a fact, a rule of order…and, maybe, if Trent was forced to admit it, a way for him to have his cake and his ice cream and his steak and his candy and eat it, too—without getting a raging headache afterward. A relationship headache that would keep him from his one and only desire—his ascent to president of AMS when his father retired.Now, much to Trent's chagrin, his father subscribed to a very different view on the matter of relationships. According to James Tanford, a wife and children stabilized a man, made him stronger. A family made a man more open to power and in turn made him respected by his peers and competitors. In the man's 1950s view of things, a wife took care of the details and let the husband focus on the real issues.Unfortunately, the senior Tanford believed this so completely that after several failed attempts to coax his son into settling down, the older man had resorted to memos referencing the subject. This last one Trent held in his hand. The memo had been placed—by one of his father's faithful minions, no doubt—under one of Trent's computer monitors, a warning that James might decide not to step down as head of AMS until Trent was settled into matrimonial bliss.Or matrimonial hell, Trent mused darkly.Yes, threats came to Trent's office in all shapes, sizes and media.All in a day's work.Trent tossed the note from his father into the trash, watching as it settled beside another crumpled ball of BS on the bottom of the trash bin—the one that demanded he wire a million dollars into an untraceable, offshore bank account on Grand Cayman Island if he didn't want certain unsavory actions from his past revealed.Something as likely to happen, he mused, as überbachelor Trent Tanford taking a bride anytime soon.It was Sunday brunch in the Big Apple. A sacred event for most Manhattanites, who worked sixty-hour workweeks and used Sunday midmornings to continue to decompress before they started it all over again on Monday.Normally Carrie Gray celebrated brunch with pastries, eggs, bagels, schmear and, if it were appropriate, booze. Unfortunately, she'd been too tired to set up such a feast for her friends that morning. Hell, she'd barely had enough time to stick her long, brown hair up in a ponytail. And forget about contacts. It was glasses all the way today.After a late night working on a few sketches of a logo concept for a graphic design job she was trying to land, she'd been woken up by another member of \"Trent's Troops.\"Trent being Trent Tanford, the dark-haired, blue-eyed, dimple-cheeked tall drink of water who lived in the apartment next door, a man who had constant guests of the female variety coming and going at all hours of the night. These were his \"Troops.\" The name had been invented by Carrie and her two girlfriends, Amanda Crawford and Julia Prentice, who were good enough friends of Carrie's to allow her to bitch about her annoying neighbor.The problem was that some of Trent's lady friends hadn't learned how to read yet and were mixing up Carrie's pad, 12B—the Upper East Side apartment she house-sat for European businessman and prince, Sebastian Stone—with 12C, Trent's apartment at 721 Park Avenue. And last night around 1:00 a.m., another of Trent's size-zero glamazons, complete with red hair and plump lips, had come knocking.\"Again, I'm sorry about the spread,\" Carrie told her two beautiful blond friends as they sat around the glass-and-wrought-iron coffee table in Sebastian Stone's uncluttered but artfully furnished three-bedroom apartment.Amanda's gray eyes flashed in a friendly, teasing way as she crossed her long, thin legs. \"No worries. Coffee and doughnuts are classic.\"Julia touched her growing belly and added, \"And these glazed ones are my baby's favorite.\" Four months pregnant, Julia had occupied apartment 9B in Carrie's building, until she moved in with her fiancé, Max Rolland, last month. Now her previous roommate, Amanda, had 9B all to herself.Relieved at her friends' forgiving words, Carrie watched the pair as they downed their doughnuts in ten seconds flat, then reached for another. It was so funny. Julia and Amanda couldn't have been more different from herself. Both blue bloods, both graduates of the chichi Ivy League school Vassar, both impeccable dressers.And then there was plain old Carrie with her green eyes and mop of dark hair, her big breasts, curvy hips and a very anti-high-fashion tie-dye hippie dress. She was okay, cute maybe, but nothing like her stunning, fabulous friends. And she was fine with that. Carrie had no insecurities about her looks or background. She was who she was. And Julia and Amanda couldn't agree more. The socialite and the event planner didn't care about Carrie's lack of looks and breeding or her lack of funds. They just wanted her friendship.\"Besides a chicken sausage quiche and an arugula salad I really wanted to make cinnamon rolls,\" Carrie told the two women in between sips of coffee. \"But the dough's rising time and mine didn't mesh well today.\"\"It's no big deal, Carrie, really,\" Amanda assured her. \"Did you have a late night?\" She grinned, her makeup-free face model perfect. \"A date, maybe?\"\"No,\" Carrie answered with a laugh, as if that was the silliest question in the world. And then she stopped and wondered why that would be so silly, and how long it had been since she'd had a date. Had it been in this millennium? Sure. A year, maybe, before her mom was diagnosed…Her blue eyes narrowed, Julia broke into Carrie's thoughts. \"Let me guess. Another late-night visitor?\"\"She said she didn't have a date, Jules,\" Amanda said, reaching for another doughnut.\"I didn't mean a male visitor,\" Julia clarified. \"I was talking about a member of the 'troops.'\"Amanda nearly choked on her doughnut. \"Oh, no. One of Trent's ladies came by?\"\"Yes,\" Carrie said, falling back into the beautiful oak Glastonbury chair.\"The blonde again?\"\"Redhead.\"Amanda shrugged. \"At least the guy's versatile.\"But Julia wasn't about to be so relaxed about the whole thing. The woman may have been petite in stature, but she had the temper of a protective tigress when she saw injustice. \"Carrie, this is total insanity. You need to confront him.\"\"I know,\" Carrie said evenly. And she did know; it was just that—\"Or at least put a sign on your door,\" Amanda joked, pouring herself another cup of coffee, her short blond hair falling about her face.Julia shook her head. \"You swore if another woman came looking for Trent, you'd—\"\"I know, I know,\" Carrie said quickly. She was just embarrassed at her own lack of fortitude in the situation. \"I've never had a problem with confrontation before, but this guy…Trent Tanford…he's like…I don't know, too good-looking. Those cute dimples on such a fierce face…it's off-putting. He's like the boy in high school you had a massive crush on and made sure you wore your blue eye shadow and Love's Baby Soft perfume for every day in case by some miracle he noticed you.\"Julia lifted a brow. \"The boy you had a crush on? Trent is like the boy you had a crush on, Car?\"\"I just mean that he's that good-looking, that charismatic, that crush inducing if ...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

M. L. Rhodes's deep characterization made it easy to care about both Will and Ethan, and I was very moved by their deep love for each other. They face serious obstacles in the story, but I never stopped rooting for them. Each step in the story brought me closer to the characters. I laughed, cried, and rejoiced right along with them as the book unfolded. One of the best things about the story was the way Will and Ethan grew and changed. Ethan begins the story self-assured and outgoing, but after his ordeal, he emerges much different. Will starts out shy and biddable. Near the end, they had somewhat of a role-reversal, and yet they were still essentially the same men they had been before--just with more facets.

'How is he?' he demanded, when his father's servant A'waan greeted him with a bow.'Sleeping, sire—the doctor gave him a sedative and instructed that His Highness should be allowed to rest,'A'waan murmured, hovering anxiously in front of the door leading to the King's bedroom.'It's all right,A'waan, I have no intention of disturbing him,' Zahir assured the servant. 'The news of Prince Faisal's death has been a great shock to all of us, but especially to my father.''His Highness is deeply saddened. He is not properly recovered from the virus he contracted recently, and I fear that the news will prove too much for him,' A'waan said gravely. 'Your father's one glimmer of joy is the discovery that he has a grandson—a child who is now an orphan.'Zahir's jaw clenched as he fought to control his emotions while A'waan continued.'It is His Highness's dearest wish that you should travel to England and bring the child back to Qubbah.''I am well aware of my father's wishes,' Zahir said tightly. He crossed to the window and stared out over the stunning formal gardens and the ornate fountains that splashed into an azure pool. Within the grounds of the palace the desert had been tamed, but beyond the walls of the twelfth-century fortress it stretched outward in an endless sea of scorching golden sands.The setting sun was suspended like a huge golden orb, the sky around it streaked with shades of pink and red. He remembered the times he and Faisal had raced their horses across the sands, or released their falcons and watched them soar across the dense blue sky. More than brothers, they had been the best of friends, but the bond between them had been broken—and all because they had both fallen in love with the same woman. Zahir's brows drew together in a slashing frown.Love, he had discovered,was a destructive emotion and he would never allow it to rule his heart or mind again.A'waan spoke again. 'As you know, your father always hoped to be reconciled with his eldest son, and that, on his death the Prince would return to Qubbah to rule. But now Prince Faisal is dead, and there is unrest in the kingdom while the people wait for the King to announce his successor. Forgive me for my presumption…'the elderly servant shifted nervously beneath Zahir's narrow-eyed stare '…but I know His Highness longs for you to appoint a deputy to head your business interests in America, so that you can settle permanently in Qubbah—and take a wife. Now, more than ever, it is your duty, sire.'Zahir threw back his head proudly and glared at the servant. 'I do not need lessons from you on my duty,' he snapped coldly. 'You forget your place, A'waan.' He understood only too well that his brother's death meant that from now on his life would no longer be his own. He would not shirk his responsibility to the kingdom his family had ruled for generations—but marriage was a different matter. 'If you remember, I was about to be married six years ago, to a woman of my father's choosing—and what a debacle that turned out to be. I will marry when I am good and ready.' He swung abruptly away from the window and strode across the room, pausing briefly to glance back at the servant. 'When my father wakes, tell him I have gone to England.'Ingledean House—North Yorkshire Moors'Erin! There's a Gordon Straker here to see you,' announced Alice Trent, cook and housekeeper at Ingledean House, when Erin walked into the kitchen. 'He says he's Faisal's solicitor, and he mentioned something about the will.''Oh, yes.'Erin nodded. 'I spoke to him on the phone a couple of days ago and he said he would be travelling up from London.''Well, he's waiting in the library.'Alice paused in her task of peeling potatoes and stared at Erin's dishevelled appearance. 'What on earth have you been doing? You look as though you've been down a coal mine.''Clearing out the big spare bedroom.'Erin glanced ruefully at the streaks of dust on her jeans. 'Kazim's nursery is too small to store all his toys now that he's sleeping in a proper bed. The spare room will make a perfect playroom. I need to keep busy,' she added defensively, when Alice's brows lifted.It was fine when Kazim was awake, keeping a lively three-year-old entertained took up all her time, but she had come to dread his afternoon nap—an hour of peace and solitude that gave her time to think.It was almost three weeks since Faisal's funeral. His death had been expected—he had told her a year ago that the tumour on his brain was inoperable—and she was glad that he was now at peace, perhaps reunited with his beloved Maryam. But he had been her friend; she missed him, and she could not stem the feeling of panic that regularly swept through her whenever she thought about the future. Kazim's well-being was totally her responsibility now, and she was terrified that she would somehow let him down.She turned to watch the toddler, who had preceded her into the kitchen and was now busy pulling open the cupboards and investigating their contents. Kazim was singing 'The Wheels on the Bus', and Erin's heart clenched at the sound of his innocent, high-pitched voice. He'd asked for Faisal a few times, but had seemed to understand when she'd gently explained that Daddy had fallen asleep for ever.It had been the hardest thing she had ever had to do in her life, and the memory of Kazim's grave little face as he had sat on her knee still brought tears to her eyes. But, although he had been a little more clingy than usual, he seemed to have accepted the news remarkably well—perhaps because he was too young to comprehend that he was now totally alone in the world.But he is not alone, Erin thought fiercely. True, he had no living relatives, but he had her, and she would love him and protect him for as long as he needed her—just as she had promised his father.'I've made some tea.'Alice's voice broke into her thoughts. 'If you want to take it up, I'll keep an eye on Kazim.'Erin glanced at the tray. 'Why have you set out three cups, Alice?''Mr Straker has brought someone with him. Gave me quite a turn, actually, when he walked through the front door—for a moment I thought he was Faisal's ghost.' The cook gave a self-conscious laugh. 'I expect it was just a trick of the light.He's obviously from the Middle East—rather gorgeous; you know, tall, dark and indecently handsome. And his features did remind me of the master,'she added slowly. 'Do you think he could be a relative?'An inexplicable feeling of unease settled in the pit of Erin's stomach. 'Faisal had no family,' she explained quickly. 'I don't know who this man is, but he's probably one of Faisal's business associates. I'd better go up and meet them,' she said, picking up the tray.Alice cast a disparaging look at her old clothes. 'I would suggest you go and change first, but there's no time. It's snowing again, and I know Mr Straker is anxious to get back to town before the weather closes in.'Erin hurried out of the kitchen, and as she crossed the oak-panelled hall she caught sight of her reflection in the mirror and grimaced. Her faded jeans and tee shirt were grubbier than she'd realised, and her hair, which she had secured in a long plait, had worked loose, so that riotous stray curls were framing her face. But it was unlikely that Gordon Straker or his companion would have any interest in her appearance, she told herself as she balanced the tray on one hand and opened the library door—coming to such an abrupt halt that the delicate bone china cups rattled precariously on their saucers.A man was standing by the window, staring out over the bleak view of the moors. For a few seconds her heart seemed to stop beating, and she understood what Alice had meant when she'd said she had thought she seen Faisal's ghost. The stranger's profile was achingly familiar, as was his silky black hair and olive-gold skin. But then he turned his head—and common sense replaced her wild flight of imagination.This man was no spectre, he was very much alive. And his resemblance to Faisal was simply due to his dark colouring and exotic looks, she told herself impatiently. He was wearing a superbly tailored dark grey suit that accentuated his lean, hard body, and Erin was immediately struck by his height, estimating that he must be five or six inches over six feet tall. Impressive broad shoulders indicated an awesome degree of strength and power, but it was his face that trapped her gaze and caused her heart to thud painfully beneath her ribcage.His hair was cropped uncompromisingly short, and his eyes were as dark as midnight beneath heavy black brows. His nose was slightly hooked, but that did not detract from the perfection of his sculpted face with its sharply delineated cheekbones and square, determined jaw. He was the epitome of masculine beauty, she thought helplessly, her breath catching in her throat. He was so gorgeous he was almost unreal, as if he had been airbrushed to perfection—but he wasn't an image from a magazine. He was a flesh-and-blood man, and she was startled by the effect he had on her.The man subjected her to a long, cool stare and Erin felt herself blush. 'Hello, I've brought some tea.You're probably freezing. The central heating system here at Ingledean is antiquated.'Black eyebrows winged upwards and her cheeks burned hotter. The man's resemblance to Faisal could not be denied— but her feelings for Faisal had been based on friendship and affection. Neither he nor any other man had ever evoked this shocking, wildfire sexual desire that was coursing through her veins. She felt unnerved by the stranger's raw masculinity, and she realised that she was gaping at him. Forcing herself to breathe normally, she walked across to the d...", "related": ["B00KJ3LFAM"], "rank": 503259, "title": "At the Sheikh's Bidding (Surrender to the Sheikh) eBook", "author": "Chantelle Shaw", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She had not expected it to be so beautiful, and perfumed with the scent of herbs basking under a hard blue sky.'You will be expected to hit the ground running, Miss Carter. Signor Amato rarely makes allowances for anyone— especially not an interior designer!' Plump, neatly suited Eduardo leaned forward and tapped on the glass separating them from the limousine's chauffeur. He issued a curt order in Italian and then settled back into the cream leather seat beside her. 'Signor Amato must visit his city office later this morning and he is attending a dinner given by an Australian delegation this evening. His day operates to the second. As his right-hand man at the Villa Antico, I must ensure that we reach there on time.''I'm sorry my flight was cancelled. I was supposed to land yesterday.' Katie's fingers gripped her briefcase. Of all the days to get caught up in a security alert. This dream job was really important to her. Giovanni Amato had a reputation as the world's most reclusive billionaire. When the Marchesa di San Marco's personal recommendation had secured Katie the job of restyling his ancestral home north of Florence, she had hardly been able to believe her luck. Everything had been planned down to the last detail. She had arranged to stay overnight in Milan, to make sure she was fresh for this morning meeting. Then all her arrangements had collapsed like a house of cards. Instead of being cool, calm and collected, Katie was stiff and overtired after a night spent in the airport. Her palms were suspiciously damp and her heart was racing, too. This was not how she was supposed to arrive on her first day in heaven.Working in a place like this will be no hardship at all, she thought as they sped through rolling countryside dotted with pretty little stone and tile villages. Eventually the sleek black Amato limousine turned in at an enormous pair of wrought iron gates. The chauffeur lowered his window and checked in to security. Obediently the gates slid open. Then the car set off down a long avenue of lime trees. Katie gasped as a classic Tuscan villa loomed into view. It was only slightly smaller than Windsor Castle.An intense young man in Armani emerged from the house as the car drew up. He opened Katie's door before the vehicle stopped, breaking into its air-conditioned comfort. The heat enveloped Katie like a thermal blanket.'My goodness, what lovely weather,' she began, but Antico staff were not chosen for their small talk.'Signor Amato will see you in the White Office, Miss Carter,' the butler said to Katie, then turned to Eduardo. 'She is late.''Show me the way and I'll run,' said Katie.Giovanni Amato was standing with his back to the door. Windows stretched from floor to ceiling in his cathedral-like office and silhouetted his tall, muscular frame. From that first moment, Katie knew he would be a force to be reckoned with. A commanding figure in beautifully cut linen trousers and a crisp white shirt, he made a gesture of acknowledgement as she entered the room. Then he went back to pouring a flow of eloquent Italian into the tiny mobile at his ear. Katie had to wait until he finished his call before she got her first proper look at him.'I hope I did not disturb you, Signor Amato,' she said as he turned, then stopped. He had a face that men could fear but women could not resist. One look into those intense grey eyes and she might have been lost—but for his expression. Momentarily it looked as though he had the weight of the world on his shoulders. And then the handsome, regular features broke into a practised smile.'Not at all—it's Miss Carter, isn't it? I'mpleasantly surprised to meet you. The contractors Mima usually recommends are tough Neapolitans!' he said in perfect English. Raising one hand, he ran fingers through his thick dark hair. There was no need. It was cut short enough to remain tidy without attention, but that did not stop him. He flexed his shoulders, and the cut of his shirt hinted at powerful muscles beneath. Then, stretching his left arm with lazy elegance he inspected the silver Rolex on his wrist.'I was told you would be late, but five minutes? That is nothing.' He smiled again and for a moment there was an air of devilment about him. 'Sometimes my staff worry too much, but I am not about to criticise them. When they are working well, my days run smoothly. That is all I ask.'Katie was speechless. He was absolutely charming and his easy manner continued as he walked around his workstation and perched on the edge, facing her.A desk puts up such a barrier between people, don't you think?' Reaching behind him, he picked up a chinaViolamug, tasted the contents and pulled a face. 'Cold cappuccino retains all of its caffeine but none of its pleasure. Excuse me while I ring for a replacement.'Katie looked around the spacious office as he rang down to his kitchens. The Villa Antico's faded splendour was obvious here. All Giovanni Amato's high-tech equipment had been plonked in the centre of a gracious room full of peeling paintwork and threadbare carpets.'The kitchens have bad news, I am afraid, Miss Carter. I am supposed to leave in ten minutes for a meeting in Milan and my super-efficient PA suggests we don't linger over coffee.' He laughed, shaking his head.'Er…yes—ok…' Katie floundered. This man was as serious as he was good-looking. There was clearly a time limit to this audience with him. 'Right, well, I'm Katie Carter…''I know. You come with the highest recommendations from my friend the Marchesa di San Marco. I don't know how much she has told you, but I inherited this place from my father a while ago. When he was in residence it was allowed to decline into the pitiful condition you see all around you. Now I have decided it is time for the Villa Antico to rise again. I want to restore the high standards of the past, so all traces of its most recent occupancy are to be swept away. With no time to restyle it myself, I need a specialist. All my staff here work to the highest standards. Contractors are expected to have the same attitude.' He was lost in thought for a moment and then his lips flickered a spark of amusement at her. 'Do you know, I've just realised that in some small way I envy you, Miss Carter. Here you are—a self-made woman, Mima tells me, who has fought her way up from nowhere. You are responsible only for yourself. It makes me wonder how far I could have taken Amato International if I had started from scratch. Family loyalty and tradition are my driving forces, and there's no doubt I have the killer instinct necessary to protect the old firm, but what are the qualities you needed to start from nothing, I wonder?'He gazed at her appreciatively for some moments, a half smile playing around his lips. Katie could only guess how devastating its full power might be, but his expression soon became serious again.'The fact is that I need a base where I can retire from public life, Miss Carter. I don't intend to entertain here—that takes place on my yacht or in one of my city apartments. But when Mima visited, she was so full of the wonders you had worked at her Villa Adriatica she thought you would be good for this old place. I have never yet disappointed a lady and I was not about to begin with Mima. So here you are.' He spread his hands in a gesture of welcome.Katie said nothing. She knew that clients always had strong ideas about what they wanted. She expected such a successful, busy man to have a list of requirements. She waited for him to reel them off. Instead, his smile remained immovable. He could have the most beautiful eyes in the world, Katie thought, if it wasn't for one thing. They were dove-grey, long-lashed and perfect—but there was a hint of something dark behind them. What was it, she wondered—pain? Suspicion? The way he shifted slightly when he mentioned his father hinted at some sort of friction in his past. There were secrets beneath all that easy, designer-dressed efficiency. Katie could sense it.Their exchange was interrupted by the arrival of Eduardo, with a message that it was time to leave. Launching himself from the table edge, Giovanni pulled his jacket from its hanger in a cupboard and slung it over his shoulder.'I am due in Milan, Miss Carter. Do you know the Amato building? They serve the mostexcellentrefreshments there.' He turned to his PA. 'The young lady and I will continue our meeting on the flight, Eduardo. As we go downstairs we will be passing one of the first areas for improvement, Miss Carter. It has not been redecorated for at least thirty years, to my certain knowledge.'He held the door open for her and they passed from the office into a warren of halls and wood-panelled passages. Katie was awestruck at the size and splendour of the place. It would take her a lifetime to find her way about. She was booked to be here for only thirty days. At the end of the long passageway, Giovanni seized the polished brass handles of a pair of double doors. As he opened them, a gust of warm air hit them. It was perfumed with beeswax polish. Katie followed him into a vast room. Shafts of sunlight from tall windows fell across ancient floorboards that centuries of polishing had given a rich golden glow.'When you need to find this place again, it is called the Smoking Gallery,' he said, answering one of her questions before she could ask it.'Then you are a smoker, Signor Amato?'He chuckled. 'No. My great-grandfather saw some interesting architecture while visiting England a century ago. When he returned, he ordered his men to recreate some chimneys of the type he had seen there. Unfortunately, because they do not draw smoke upwards from the fire, it always blows back down.'He walked over to a great black marble fireplace on one side of the room. Positioning one foot carefully on the fender, he pointed up at the chimney-breast. Ancient wooden panels hung there, illustrating the Amato family tree. It was decorated with brightly coloured coats of arms and ancestral flags and descended from t...", "related": ["B00CYUCQZQ"], "rank": 292305, "title": "Pregnant by the Italian Count (An Innocent in His Bed Book 1) eBook", "author": "Christina Hollis", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The author immediately captures the reader's attention when he introduces a mysterious stranger who arrives in a small town. His character and purpose in this new town is slowly unraveled throughout the story. The author keeps a good pace throughout and never leaves any portion of the plot line unresolved. Each chapter has appropriate length and leaves you wanting to know what is coming next. I enjoyed the author's use of imagery, which put me in the shoes of the character. This is representative in lines like: \"He sat back breathing hard; his adrenaline flowed like a river. It gushed into his heart, making him weak as a baby.\" Another good use of imagery is in this narration: \"Her heart was pounding like a bass drum into her head and pleasure was engulfing her.\" The author did well with the character development in that the reader obtains intimate knowledge of Belinda, Noah, and Jeremy--the main characters. We learn more than just facts about their lives; we are given insight into their thoughts, emotions, and desires. The ending is great. It is surprising; yet at the same time falls completely in line with the prevailing fashion of the story.

The author refers to liberalism both in its classical and modern sense, emphasizing its commitment, from its emergence to the present, to the two goals of liberty and equality. Despite the title, the book takes a primarily historical approach, surveying a multitude of liberal thinkers from John Locke to John Rawls—drawing especially heavily on the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill—applying their theories to both historical and contemporary political issues. The author uses the frame of liberalism to examine terrorism, globalization and the politics of religion. Wolfe ruminates on conservatism's hand in the Hurricane Katrina debacle and, in his musings on globalization, focuses on how liberalism prescribes a philosophical commitment to global welfare rather than parochial concerns or national protectionism. More a work of political theory than a policy text, this book will strongly appeal to readers interested in the tradition of Western liberal thought.(Feb.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It's no  wonder Lily, a brainy middle-schooler, is both lively and  lifelike, much more robust than her counterparts in other  religious-themed fiction. The problems she faces tend to be  staples of girls' series: in Ask, for example, Lily starts an  advice column in her school paper and ends up needing a dose of  her own counsel. When she turns into a \"rebel,\" Lily becomes  interested in Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi and goes  overboard with her desire to improve students' treatment at  school. But Rue develops these conflicts with imagination and  sympathy for her character. Lily's parents and her stalwart  friends redirect her to prayer and God. Fortunately, the parents  are free-thinking enough that their responses may catch readers  off-guard once in a while. A hallmark of this series is its  nonfiction tie-ins; companion volumes offer straight, candid and  Christian advice on topics related to the novels' themes. For  these novels, there will be The Blurry Rules Book: It's a God  Thing ($7.99 paper -70152-X) and The It's MY Life Book: It's a  God Thing ($7.99 paper, -70153-8), both by Rue.

This book develops a framework for analyzing the impacts of disease on state capacity—'health security,' as Price-Smith aptly dubs it—and lucidly illustrates these connections through a number of valuable case studies. Even those well versed in infectious diseases will find new and thought-provoking material in this book.\"—Stephen S. Morse, Professor of Epidemiology, Columbia University\"Andrew Price-Smith has written a primer, both sophisticated and accessible, for all who are interested in global health policy. He draws from diverse and multidisciplinary sources, and convincingly links growing public health challenges to the fragility of our contemporary world order. His book deserves a wide readership and careful attention.\"—Louis W. Pauly, Director, Centre for International Studies, University of Toronto\"Andrew Price-Smith has contributed a fascinating perspective on epidemics (historical and modern). He brings numerous disciplines to the table to thoughtfully knit the best thinking in political science, economics, sociology, and public health together. The book expands our view of how epidemics and pandemics change our lives and history.\"—Ann Marie Kimball, Department of Health Services, University of Washington, author ofRisky Trade: Infectious Disease in an Era of Global Trade", "related": [], "rank": 1740039, "title": "Contagion and Chaos: Disease, Ecology, and National Security in the Era of Globalization (The MIT Press)", "author": "Andrew T.

I'd been on quite a roll for the past few years, writing full-length science fiction novels, and I was ready for a little diversion. My goal was to see if I could write a literary novel in the first person, present tense. I made it a \"pet project\" that I would pick up and work on when I got tired of writing science fiction. Since writing this novella was only a part-time job for me, it took me 25 months to complete it. In January 2009, Blind Fool Running was a finished manuscript. As the book reached novella length, I realized that the story was being told at novella length (17,500 to 39,999 words is the publishing industry's accepted range for a novella). Stretching it out to novel length would have done the story an injustice. As a novel, it would have been laborious and redundant for the reader. But, as a 31,000-word novella, it's a comfortable read. \"Blind Fool Running\" is my first very attempt at writing literary fiction and my debut as Jonco Bugos, my literary pen name and alter ego, so to speak. Joncomeans \"John\" in English and Jonco Bugos (pronounced YONK-oh BOO-gosh) was the Slovak name of my maternal grandfather, John Bugosh. Because of this book's metaphysical themes, experimental real-time story line, and the down-to-earth but philosophical personality of its main character,\" Blind Fool Running\" was difficult to classify. It's definitely literary fiction but it also contains elements of science fiction. That's why Blind Fool Running, the literary novella by Jonco Bugos,became the seventh addition to the \"Science Fiction for Thinkers\" collection.", "related": [], "rank": 4697824, "title": "Blind Fool Running eBook", "author": "Jonco Bugos", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's edgy, compelling, and funny! You don't get that combination often, and rarely is it so well balanced with a core character who is an icon... a novel well worth reading!--Denyse BridgerThis book really is a non-stop observation of human weaknesses, strengths and the thirst for more, always more. It's populated with dark human characters, Goth musicians, villains that make you really want to see them brought down - and struggling in the midst of it all, a vampyre that is legendary for dark and evil trying to change what he is, and in the end makes a choice that some might find surprising. You also meet fascinating gypsies, a wizard who appears both seer and magician; he is the one responsible for the sleep into the 21st century.While the book is riddled with humour, the real core of it for me, the thing that makes it a novel I will read again, is the sharp edge with which the author draws his characters. It is not a predicable novel, therefore a rarity in this genre. The statements it makes are sometimes blatant and unavoidable, other times you have to read a little deeper and find the less overt observations. Through it all, you are entertained and intrigued. At the end you want to start over and enjoy it all again, with a better understanding.I highly recommend VAMPYRE BLOOD: EIGHT PINTS OF TROUBLE! It's edgy, compelling, and funny! You don't get that combination often, and rarely is it so well balanced with a core character who is an icon. So, congratulations to George Earl Parker on a novel well worth reading!!

Donaldson obliges, following his subject through prison stints, jobs, and relationships with women. Sub-Saharan black Kevin loves white girls, always has, and the book follows his partner, the pseudonymous trim blond woman Karen Tanski as well. Donaldson has a dubious capacity for entering the mind of his subjects, and his tone ranges from purple to pulp (Sure, Margaret favored light skin when it came to beauty, but when it came to sexual attraction, a light-skinned man couldn't do anything but show her where to find a black man), accented with descriptions of nature and historical tidbits.

The majority of Hood's performance is quite pretty and highly capable. Occasionally, some voices engaged in conversation sound exaggerated and forced as a result of infusing them with too much drama, but, overall, the vocal development of setting and conflict suit the audiobook.

The drink count. The roe deer, bats and spiders. Sales figures and gossip. Complaints and snipes. Serious illnesses and personal triumphs. Grand flights of philosophical reflection and meticulous observations of mice. Real estate prices and the bricks and mortar of literary composition. Famous writers and neighbors down the road . . . The reader of Fowles feels somehow invited to enter a clearing made by language, a privileged and charged place . . . With such access comes an opportunity to understand but also to accompany, to witness. As a result, finally the reader of these journals feels lucky to have been granted entree to the life of a man brilliantly using words to illuminate a life beyond what the words of even a great writer like ‘John Fowles’ can suggest.”–Joseph Di Prisco,San Francisco Chronicle“Absorbing, from beginning to end . . .

There is much pleasure to be had from pursuing the various narrative strands, material and spiritual, of a life laid bare . . . His main inspiration, practically his raison d’être, is his love of nature and knowledge of ‘animals, plants, birds, insects,’ which suffused the first volume and continues here.

Each chapter is written with that sort of person in mind, but with something for C64 veterans as well, especially those who haven't spent much time outside of their own niche interest (the C64 music remixer who knows little about the games she remixes).Accessibility is key. I offer tips on getting specific programs running smoothly in emulation and point out any anticipated hiccups (say, for example, if the game only runs in NTSC mode and your emulator defaults to PAL).I've written game and product reviews in a way that I hope will be of interest even to veterans. Tips and tricks for gameplay, advice, and interviews with personalities in the C64 community were written for consumption by old and new fans alike. I also hope that you'll enjoy my personal insight and stories!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Born in Massachusetts and educated at Fisk, Harvard, and the University of Berlin, Du Bois penned his epochal masterpiece,The Souls of Black Folk, in 1903. It remains his most studied and popular work; its insights into Negro life at the turn of the 20th century still ring true.With a dash of the Victorian and Enlightenment influences that peppered his impassioned yet formal prose, the book's largely autobiographical chapters take the reader through the momentous and moody maze of Afro-American life after the Emancipation Proclamation: from poverty, the neoslavery of the sharecropper, illiteracy, miseducation, and lynching, to the heights of humanity reached by the spiritual \"sorrow songs\" that birthed gospel and the blues. The most memorable passages are contained in \"On Booker T. Washington and Others,\" where Du Bois criticizes his famous contemporary's rejection of higher education and accommodationist stance toward white racism: \"Mr. Washington's programme practically accepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races,\" he writes, further complaining that Washington's thinking \"withdraws many of the high demands of Negroes as men and American citizens.\" The capstone ofThe Souls of Black Folk, though, is Du Bois' haunting, eloquent description of the concept of the black psyche's \"double consciousness,\" which he described as \"a peculiar sensation.... One ever feels this twoness--an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\" Thanks to W.E.B. Du Bois' commitment and foresight--and the intellectual excellence expressed in this timeless literary gem--black Americans can today look in the mirror and rejoice in their beautiful black, brown, and beige reflections.--Eugene Holley Jr.", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After a brief stint in the Army, part of which I served overseas in Germany for a year, I came back home to Twin Falls, Idaho, and enrolled in the College of Southern Idaho. I knew I wanted to major in English, and, after receiving my Associate of Arts Degree, I went on to Boise State University. I graduated with a BA in English, Writing Emphasis, in 2005.     During those years in college I continued to work on The Exxar Chronicles outside the classroom while honing my writing skills in class. After leaving BSU I returned to Twin Falls to write full time, and in fall of 2008 I finally completed the final draft of The Erayan. After two years of rejection from numerous literary agents, I decided to self publish via the Amazon Kindle Store. You'll find those links on The Books page.     Since I am still struggling to make a living from my writing, I fill my days by teaching full time at an elementary school. I'm a computer assistant, which means I teach basic computer skills to the students for their 5th block specials.

You see patterns written, then when you hear them on the CD it  opens up all sorts of understandings leading on to new ideas. The book  is well laid out, too, and well structured with a coherent progression. I  can't recommend this book enough for beginners, and for experienced  drummers who want or need a refresher course. Five stars and worth every  one of them! --Amazon.co.ukVery well laid out, 7 April 2005 By alext2001 Great book for the first time drummer, it is very basic at the beginning but covers some good fills and grooves. I found it very well explained and was great for me to go back over the old stuff and correct or re-affirm what I have learnt so far. If you have just received your first drum kit THIS is the only book I would buy, when you can play it through then move on, if you have reached intermediate stage it's a pretty good book to go back over before moving onward. --Amazon.co.uk", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He and a fellow musician, Jimmy Yakamoto, had been trapped in Japan after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and forced to join the Japanese army, although they were still loyal to America. Jimmy had been killed by ruthless Major Nakamura for refusing to shoot an American prisoner, and Teddy had then carried out the very command his friend had died defying. He has never been able to confide these details to his wife or sonbecause she was Jimmy's widow and their son is actually Jimmy's child. A chance sighting of the major offers Teddy the prospect of revenge and redemption, but it seems the major has likewise been waiting all these years for a similar encounter. Wiley's first novel is a work of exceptional power and imagination, especially in his portrayal of his protagonist's \"listless remorse\" and cross-cultural alienation. Although the weight given Teddy's living hell is disproportionate to that given his eventual resurrection from it, Wiley's debut is an auspicious one nonetheless.

In her version of the fountain of youth, Morgan Mandel has fashioned an intriguing story about an experimental pill that promises to transform the user's body back in time to an age the user specifies. In Forever Young: Blessing or Curse, the protagonist, a 55-year-old widow named Dorrie, chooses to recreate herself as she looked when she was 24 years old.Despite the excellent results, Dorrie faces a host of problems brought on by the novel's antagonist, known as Angel Man. As you might surmise, Angel Man proves to be anything but an angel, and we learn there is a dark force at work that threatens even Angel Man himself.Morgan Mandel does a nice job providing intrigue and suspense with just the right amount of foreshadowing, making the reader reluctant to put the story down before reaching the ending. It's a fast read, enjoyable and has a satisfying ending. For a self-published book, Forever Young is well done with good editing and a marvelous cover.\" - John M.

She currently works at the Press Office of the Prefecture of Evros, in the Region of Thrace and Eastern Macedonia.  After high school, she attended Art History classes in Oxford, UK for two years. She returned to Greece during the early days of (the period following the fall of the military junta), and lived for five years in Thessaloniki, inside the Academic community of the city, her spouse working as Architecture Assistant Professor. During that period she attended various lectures on subjects of Architecture, Sociology and Political Sciences.  Late seventies she returned to her hometown with her spouse and their two daughters, and a few years later she was engaged as civil servant at the Prefecture, in Alexandroupolis. She initially worked on projects related to illiteracy of adults and older people, and she also helped Evros village populations in numerous initiatives and government programs to bridge diversity, help minorities, protect the natural habitat, and help create the necessary conditions for a sustainable future. In about the same time she appeared weekly on national radio (approx. 2-3 years) to inform audiences about local tradition and the role of the woman.  In her encounters with the locals she heard numerous stories from the mouth of the elderly about traditional life and habits and customs in the Evros area. Those stories inspired her profoundly and she later made the decision to write them down, as many as possible, in the literary form of short stories. She has written about a hundred so far, aiming to pass the legacy to the younger and future generations.  Through the years, she's been regularly invited to chair book presentation events and review new literary works of well known authors. Among those were Rhea Galanaki, Lena Divani, Dimitri Konstantaras, Stelios Kouloglou, Paul Matesis, Seraphim Phyntanidis, George Skampardonis, Peter Tatsopoulos, Eurydice Trisson, and others. Between 1995 and 2008 she has been instrumental in organizing annual Pan-Hellenic Journalist Congresses in Samothrace, where journalists from the whole of Greece assembled to exchange and express their ideas, criticisms, opinions and viewpoints.  Since early last decade she has been regularly publishing her stories in the literature magazine \"Periodiko tis polis\" (Alpha Media Group). Late 2011 she published some of her work (short stories, chronicles, poems) in the form of print and electronic books. Such became recently available via popular Internet based bookstores.  Her stories and poems, often using common Evros dialect forms and expressions, are intriguing, emotional, mysterious, full of innuendos, often laden with torrential momentum brought about by sequences of rich nouns and powerful adjectives, utmost passionate and exciting. Indeed, passion and search of the soul in all things surrounding her, be it alive or simply lifeless objects, are the crucial elements of her personal philosophy.", "related": [], "rank": 4691113, "title": "Feelings", "author": "Maria Toloudi", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Innocuous expressions for activities such as, \"haircuts\" and \"general meetings\" would generate fear and anxiety in the residents. Public beatings and humiliation were standard occurrences. Negative changes in the demeanor of Mr. Kernochan and the residents of the Elan School can be observed chapter to chapter due to the horrific atmosphere which is dramatically illustrated by the understated and honest writing.

To preserve the homestead, one of the Tucker boys must live on the ranch for 365 days. Cody drew the short straw and will have to face his demons while turning the ranch's finances around. Little does he know that waiting for him there are his former love, Shelby, and a nine-year-old surprise. While Cody may have wanted to forget that Sweet Plains existed, Sweet Plains hasn't forgotten the Tucker boys, and Cody is welcomed home by everyone—everyone but Shelby. As Shelby and Cody rediscover their past attraction and sort out a nine-year-old misunderstanding, someone is trying to run Cody off so that the brothers' inheritance is forfeit. Who is behind the trouble at Tucker's Crossing? Can Cody move beyond his difficult past and live there for at least a year, or will the past pull him and Shelby apart again, leaving Shelby and the ranch to fall into another's hands?Adair's debut novel is the first in a trilogy about the Tucker boys and their family home. She has built here the foundation for a great contemporary Western, with great characters and an intriguing story set in a small town. You'll want to visit Sweet Plains and the B-Cubed for some biscuits and to meet the locals; they'll make you feel right at home.—Lisa Jordan, Gardner Neighborhood Library, Johnson County Library, KS", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 34, "rating_average": 4.4412, "rating_total": 151.0}

His hands were plunged in the pockets of his dirty jeans, with his elbows tightly clamped on each side of him; he stood as if he were freezing.Sydney swallowed as his unresponsiveness began to make her nervous.

From India, he went on to serve in Germany, Switzerland, China and Hong Kong.

His book traverses the cut and thrust of trade diplomacy, with anecdotes about dignitaries and other folk who touched his life. It offers insights into life in the Foreign Service, evoking a good belly laugh whenever it can. His observations attack the senses in a delightfully readable way, bringing to life the pungency of India, the guttural, ordered society of Germany, the Maosuited throngs and ringing cycle bells of China as it opened its doors to the West, and the frenetic business climate of Hong Kong. He also explores deeper issues, like the demands a Foreign Service career can make upon marriages, the ever lurking danger of trade protectionism and the challenge of building new trade alliances and winning new markets.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Both will be coming out in English shortly. In addition to that, I am also writing fiction. Jesus Christ passed on his teachings in parables that were easy to read and enjoy. As a writer, I try to follow His approach, bringing ideas through fiction. “The Amazon Shaman,” is a thriller involving the shaman initiation and Shamanism, which according to Jung, is historically and symbolically the basis of modern psychotherapy. At Stanford University, I completed a Masters in Engineering Mechanics (1967), a Masters in Industrial Engineering (1968), both of them with the highest GPAs of the class, and a PhD in Economic Systems Planning (1969).

Vampires, he learns, aren’t what Bram Stoker, Anne Rice and Hollywood said they were. For example, the folklore suggests that only newly made vampires are nocturnal, meaning that older ones should be harder to spot—though one of Steven’s professors notes that in 1992 Yugoslavia, it might be hard to tell the vampires from the thugs: “Haven’t you seen all the black jeeps and limousines with darkened windows? If I were a vampire, that would be the ideal way to travel around during daytime.” As Steven delves further into crumbling archives and into an underground labyrinth hiding vampiric secrets, he and his friends get caught up in a perilous confluence of events. Steven must confront his past, his loss of faith and how he might regain it, and his attraction to a mysterious, dangerous woman. He learns the truth about his professor Slatina, who in turn faces a crucial decision that will affect not just vampires but all of the Balkans. In the glut of vampire-themed novels now on the market, Lyon’s debut stands out for its skillful integration of authentic, fascinating myth with the political events of the early 1990s. Linking the horror of the supernatural with the horror of human violence is an inspired idea, and Lyon executes it perfectly. He evidently knows the area, its history and its languages, giving the reader vivid details not just of long-ago history but of the 1990s Balkans: socialist-chic shabbiness, ever-present cigarette smoke, the way every Serb that Steven meets has a cousin in Chicago, and the corrupt Milosevic government. “Slobo keeps prices low so people won’t complain,” a character nicknamed Bear says. “It’s okay if we don’t have gas, just so the gas we don’t have is cheap.” Steven can be irritatingly slow on the uptake, and the ending is less satisfying than it could be, since Lyon is apparently leaving room for sequels. Still, it’s a highly promising start with an engaging cast of characters.No capes, no glitter: a vampire novel for readers who value sturdy mythology and a sophisticated understanding of history, along with warmblooded, human connections.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 3.9091, "rating_total": 43.0}

He started writing because he was having trouble finding books he wanted to read or was disappointed by the best sellers he purchased. He loves reading books from different genres but began to get bored with the formula approach that so many followed; murder mysteries were always too serious; science fiction was getting too weird and gay fiction always portrayed gay people as either miserable, camp or victims or, worst of all, as miserable camp victims! Having served his time sending off books to agents and collecting rejection slips, he kept on writing and refining his stories. He loves good stories that don't just follow a typical formula and he loves books that are easy to read; not simple but focusing on the story line and the characters rather than proving how clever the writer is using English! He loves how enthusiastic Kindle and Amazon are towards new writers; so different from the 'go away and die' approach of so many agents. His first book, Nice People, is a classic gay novel based around the growing relationship between two men from very different backgrounds whose past experiences constantly affect their future together. The second, Country Life, is a new take on the English country murder mystery where the main focus is the community, not just the crime. It is the first volume of the Gemini & Flowers mystery series. The second book, Family Life, was published in February 2013. The third book, In Real Life, came out in August 2013. The fourth book, After Life, came out in February 2014. He has also published a future history novel, The Stone Age, in the classic English science fiction tradition.

Manley and Hawkins have compiled a superb and much-needed book on schools that work for all students. They provide a groundbreaking guide for educators who want to translate a commitment into effective action. Their unique perspective, developed as leaders in school districts and college institutions, makes their book a must-read for practicing and aspiring educators. (Kevin N. McGuire, professor, Center for Educational Leadership and Accountability, St. John's University)This is a book school leaders will find very useful. Manley and Hawkins adopt a pragmatic approach using mini cases or relevant situations they have experienced as school leaders and scholars in the field of educational leadership. Although the book is about American public schools, educators from other countries will find the issues discussed to be quite universal—as the experiences in China and India described in the book illustrate. (Carlos Omar Trejo-Pech, professor and academic chair of finance, Universidad Panamericana at Guadalajara, Mexico)This deeply insightful book reflects a strong understanding of how things really work in secondary school systems in the United States. The authors focus on the right outcomes for study—this is of critical importance. Some material may even be appropriate for use in improving higher education outcomes. This is a very useful—if not essential—tool for any high level secondary school administrator or aspirant. (Bruce A. Heiman, assistant professor of international business, Department of International Business, San Francisco State University)The authors have distilled the literature and research on school district organization, governance, leadership, and instructional practice while embedding their own personal experience into a comprehensive and functional guidebook. This valuable resource will be of interest to aspiring administrators, building principals, superintendents, and board members because it provides a framework for understanding the operational nature of schools. Manley and Hawkins attack the premise set forth by NCLB to test excellence into school systems but offer a glimpse into what twenty-first-century schools might become with appropriate leadership. (Edward J. Zero, superintendent, Eastern Suffolk Board of Cooperative Educational Services, New York)Superintendents, board members, teachers and public policy makers all have something to gain from readingDesigning School Systems for All Students. The authors draw upon their rich experiences, as well as those of other educators, to illustrate how to integrate curriculum alignment, testing, professional development, and character education into a system that achieves and rewards success. Stories link theory and successful practice with research. The result is a practical toolbox filled with specific strategies that will inspire the reader to take the actions necessary to improve America's public schools. I only wish this manual for success had been available when I began my career in administration. (Candee Swenson, executive director of the Suffolk County School Superintendents Association; former superintendent of Longwood Public Schools; S)Manley and Hawkins are skilled educators whose practices are guided by deep understandings of systems. They are also, as evidenced by this work, skilled writers who, in very practical language, allow us to benefit from their knowledge and upgrade learning opportunities for all. Excellent!

I was raised Roman Catholic and later in my late teens chose to step away and into the less doctrine world of a Protestant.  Throughout my years I married 3 times, 2nd & 3rd to the same woman; we were divorced again 7 years later, a total of 26 years with both marriages.  Go ahead laugh, I do!  Both women I was married to were great moms and gave to me 2 awesome children; a boy and a girl, both grown now.  Later in life and after moving to the state of Oklahoma for a job transfer, after that 3rd divorce and after making many mistakes in my life with my marriages and my children; my heart, soul and spirit began searching for a new identity; a grounding of my life, so to speak.  It was during a sojourn down one of those lonely roads I rediscovered my guiding light; my North Star I had been searching for; my strong faith in God; that I for a long time had discarded.  Along this journey of rediscovery of my faith; God would bring to me an extraordinary woman; a woman who would bring sunshine into my heart and love into my soul.  Together we would ride our Harley motorcycles through the highways and byways; falling in love and marrying.  Tragically, this extraordinary woman’s life would be cut short nine months after our wedding.   I have chosen to write Faith-Navigating The Clouds without a GPS not only to help heal my heart and soul but more importantly in hopes my words; based on my experiences of traveling this lonesome journey, my deep love for my wife and my awesome devoted faith to my God; will help at least one person who may be going through difficult times to know that faith; faith in God can lead us through the most tragic moments in our lives.  All we have to do is ask Him!", "related": [], "rank": 4421668, "title": "Navigating The Clouds Without A GPS: 'Faith'", "author": "Don Bunna", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A well educated individual with a unique and diversified background. Upon his return, he released (Dezirae Pathways of Exploration) a short erotic story. An erotic fantasy that not only obtained five star ratings from the get go, but left women longing for his attention, and questioning a second release. Landing on second base was his latest release that quickly grabbed attention (Best Sellers Defamation). A heart pumping, suspenseful, action, thriller that gives a creative look to certain aspects of his life. Tension continues to build around the debut of his upcoming release of (Silent Train Deaths Quietest Invitation). The future novella is sure to leave any reader questioning how one perceives everyday life. Mike does an amazing job at grabbing the attention of readers. His vagueness kept me guessing about any work in progress, but he did state that one of his long-term goals is to write a complete novel, and here are a few words from Mike himself. \"You could expect anything but typical from me. I am simply a guy that enjoys writing when I am not working or out with friends, family, and others involved in my life. I do not have a specific niche, and I could care less if I had one. I do not care for so-called industry standards or what is considered normal. I simply write about whatever comes to mind. I do not anticipate becoming a famous author, but I can say this about my work. If any piece of work produced by me whether it be past, present, or future were to become extremely popular it would be Silent Train. I believe that it stands a very good chance at not only hitting New York Times as a best seller, but it very well could end up in a theater near you. I do not write with, nor do I have any expectations or boundaries. Wouldn't it be more rewarding to write freely while remaining true to yourself? I would not only encourage, but would challenge a writer to do so. Who gives a damn what others think? It is your work, your story, so remove any expectations or boundaries you might have and just write. Think of it this way. Whether you write for passion, pleasure, or the pure thrill of it, treat it like your favorite sports car. Get in, turn the ignition on, and enjoy the ride while ensuring you finished whatever got that car started.\" Photography credits: Urteen White", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This is the perfect first book for aspiring philosophers, thoughtful minds, and precocious souls of any predilection.

The play takes an ancient theme--that of a woman falsely accused of unfaithfulness--to brilliant comedic heights. Claudio is deceived by his jealous cousin into believing that his lover, Hero, is unfaithful--a plot unveiled by the bumbling constables Dogberry and Verges. Meanwhile, Beatrice and Benedick have \"a kind of merry war\" between them, matching wits in clever repartee that anticipates other playfully teasing literary couples. Each is tricked into believing that the other is in love, which allows the true affection between them to grow. Both couples are united at the end, after Hero's simulated resurrection from the dead. In this play Shakespeare eschewed devices of obvious magic or disguise of sex, which he employed in other comedies; the wit and ambiguity of the dialogue and the exquisite pacing of the action sustain the play, which remains popular in repertory.  --The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

During his four, carefree years in high school, he majored in sports and minored in grades.Now, eighteen year old Rail is leaving the comfort and protection of home to venture into the world of college. Of course, Master McClain has no idea what he wants to do with his future, only what his society-conscious mother has designed for him. To say that Rail is like most other American boys his age, is like saying lemons and watermelons taste the same.   Rail is independent, opinionated, and headstrong. He also contains a very large dose of frivolousness and facetiousness. Some think of him as lazy. However, in his defense, his caring grandfather often chuckles as he remarks, 'Rail's just blowing in the wind'.Nevertheless, having what you might deem to be a few good qualities, and also a few bad ones, in reality Rail McClain is as naïve as hell.           It only takes him one year at Marquette University to crush his mother's dream of his becoming a dentist. Then, to his parent's dismay, Rail announces that he has decided he wants to be an actor. He convinces them to allow him to attend a drama college in Hollywood, California. Once there, he begins to receive a very juicy taste of life.", "related": ["B00CCRJS7K"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The gay man's ass was tighter than any place his cock had ever\nbeen, and he was afraid he might hurt Les if he plowed it in too fast or too\nhard. His second thrust drove an inch of his shaft into the tight place. He\nbelieved he was far enough inside that he would no longer need to guide his\ncock, so he placed his hands on the soft cheeks of his sex partner and started\ngently kneading the flesh. The succulent mounds felt almost exactly like the\nass of a young woman, except that so many of them had objected to being fondled\nthe way he was doing to the gay man's cheeks. \"Mmmmm,\nI like that,\" Lester murmured and his body started squirming on the bed from\nthe presence of the cock in the place that wanted it so badly and from the\nunexpected ministrations. Lester\nmust have encouraged Justin, because another thrust of the cock into his ass\nstretched the sphincter and the attached channel and massaged his prostate\ngland, which he thought of as his clit. With a fourth surge, the contact became\nstronger, and Lester's entire form started squirming happily as the waves of\nexcruciating pleasure rocketed through his body.  \"Oh,\nthat feels so good! Keep doing that,\" he urged his partner. Justin\nwas glad to hear that, and he was happy to be bringing pleasure to the person\nhe was almost thinking of as a girl friend by that time", "related": ["B00GMX514O"], "rank": 571136, "title": "Dormitory Slut Part 2", "author": "George Boxlicker", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Separated into five chapters, each volume begins with a section about inspiration and ends with information about getting published. Lists of contemporary and classic literature, as well as movies, give readers plenty of models to help them create their pieces. The organizational strategies and writing exercises are user-friendly. The books are narrated in such a way that readers are treated like real writers no matter their age. Sidebars tackle additional topics. Unfortunately, there are no illustrations, only the occasional design element. Resources specific to each genre and places for writers to look into publishing are given. The age-level appropriateness varies by title; Romance and Horror contain disclaimers at the top of their recommended genre reading lists.α(c) Copyright 2011.

All these installments are also available to purchase separately if you wish.The Monday Collection, Volume Twowill be released in the fourth quarter of 2014 and will include the final four parts of the Jake Monday saga:Rainy Days and Mondays,Can't Wait for Monday,Mad Mad Monday(July 2014), andMonday Bloody Monday(September 2014).I get the question from time-to-time:what inspired you to write this story?\n With Jake Monday, my inspiration came from a multitude of sources.\nAuthors like Ludlum, LeCarre, Fleming, and Follet come to mind. Also, I\nenjoy watching series on television: \"Alias,\" \"Heroes,\" \"Lost,\"\n\"Supernatural,\" \"The X-Files,\" and \"Hannibal.\" All of these have\nelements that influenced my writing.The\n Jake Monday Chroniclesbegan in 2003 when I wrote a short story about an\nassassin named Jake Monday. I had no plans, really, but I had a sentence\n running through my head. The sentence that launched this series began:\n\"Jake Monday hated Mondays more than any other day of the week.\"The\n idea that a high-profile assassin would be unhappy, unsatisfied, and\nstruggling with his past and future, is not unique. I wanted to explore new\n areas of this theme. I thought of family, of a past hidden, of the\nmoral challenge of an individual that finds himself caught in a massive\nglobal conspiracy while grappling with the choices he has made,\nwillingly or not.So, Jake Monday is my Jason Bourne. Hallie is\nmy Sidney Bristow (from Alias). My villains...well, they are all my own.\n I love to draw villains who are deep, believable, and scary. Not\nbecause they always represent the antithesis of the hero, but just the\nopposite: my villains are not much different than all of us. I do not\nbelieve in \"grey areas,\" but I do believe the line between good and evil\n can be narrow. One wrong move and even someone like Jake Monday can be\nheading in the wrong direction.", "related": ["B00INZMHHS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Anyone who knows her sees a bright and uplifting human being with a love for life and an undeniable sense of outward concern for others. Born in Toledo, Ohio, Cathy Gehr ventured out of the United States in the mid ’70s to begin her journey as a volunteer non-denominational missionary. Her endeavors included feeding the poor, counseling youth, teaching the underprivileged, fund-raising, songwriting, concert venues, radio shows and recording studios, which led to a career as an executive for an international publishing company. With a passion for children’s educational materials, Cathy’s work has sold millions of copies worldwide. All proceeds have been donated to charities. Her tenure included rubbing creative shoulders with guitar virtuoso and former founding member of Fleetwood Mac, Jeremy Spencer. Having lived in over 20 countries around the world, Cathy is rich in culinary and cultural experiences — including an in-depth wealth of knowledge in health, cooking, skin care, fitness and emotional intelligence. Over three decades of collaborating with like-minded educators and researchers, she possesses a wealth of information in the field of wellbeing, and passionately delves into natural and alternative remedies. A true advocate for healthy living, Cathy walks the walk and talks the talk when it comes to spiritual, physical and mental fitness. Also included in her credentials is a Doctorate in Theology, which is foundational for her practical and positive viewpoints in all aspects of her life. Now an active Wellbeing Researcher and Nutrition Advisor, Cathy embraces health and fitness as a way of life rather than an alternative, a fact of life rather than a point of interest.  Her passionate perspectives towards achieving long-term health and beauty have attracted the attention of many who recognize the living, breathing example of this youthful campaigner for natural and affordable wellness solutions. Intrinsically involved in the inception and content of this book, husband and soul mate, Peter is equally passionate about a healthy lifestyle.

Readers have commented that my writing is controversial, compelling, descriptive and evocative, and they become involved with the characters. What more could a writer ask for? I am unable to restrain myself from becoming emotionally involved in humanitarian issues, as well as with my clients, readers and it comes through in my stories. I currently live in my hometown in Auckland, New Zealand and love to travel to other countries and have been to Europe many times, as my very talented partner Harald,who designs my covers,is from Germany. This has given me the opportunity to fall in love with historical landscapes and their cultures, and also indulge in three of my passions, good food, wine and great conversation. I have gleaned many ideas and settings for my stories by traveling to well known cities in Europe, and also through the small villages, each with their own special story, which have enabled me to create believable and sympathetic characters. Currently I teach English to Muslim immigrants from Iraq. Both of these experiences were so enlightening, giving me an insight into the spirit and courage these people, whom I admire tremendously and respect, portray in their everyday lives.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Marileenow sees six red stripes on\nthe pretty little cow's curvy ass. Just before the young visitor movesout of\nsight, the two little cows hold a glance brimming with hunger and promise,\nhoping no oneelse can see.\"Syringe,\" the doctor orders briskly as the door closes.\nThere are sounds behind her, Marileedoesn't know what is going on. But then a\nknuckle strokes her pouted girl-lips, making herinsides tremble. A strong\nfinger eases slowly inside, gradually, so as not to upset the little cow,and\nprobes around. She can tell it is gooey, probably with the lotion. The finger\nis slowlywithdrawn, which makes Marilee so disappointed, but then it starts\nback in, and this time itbrings a friend. The girl wiggles happily, arching\nher young body for more, more.\"Get her a little opened up for the injection,\" the doctor\nsays softly. The low tones of his voicesend a tingle to her perked teats. Two\nbig man fingers slither deep inside and her hips buck.\"Wooo,\" Says Marilee.\"Whoa,\" says the doctor. Good thing we have this one\nrestrained.\" As his fingers probe hermost sensitive parts from the back end,\nMarilee closes her eyes and lets her hips gyrate, archingher back which also\npushes her breasts into Nurse Reardon's stroking hands.But little Marilee becomes sad again, as the fingers gently\nwithdraw. After a minute there issomething else pressing in back there, she\ncannot turn enough to see and when she tries to closeher knees she gets a\npowerful slap from a big hand. Something is on the way in! Whoops! It isbig,\nand slippery, and very warm! A blunt thing probes among her feminine secrets\nuntil thedoctor breathing right on her bottom is satisfied. Marilee is getting\nthat way too.\"There,\" he says with satisfaction, \"we have cervical lock.\"\nHe presses a button and the thingbegins a humming vib-vib-vib-vibration that\ngoes right through her! She feels warm creamy goooooze from the tube into the\nvery center of her womanhood. Mostly though, she is happy withthe wicked\nshudderings of the thing inside her.Nurse Reardon, still tweaking Marilee's nipples, speaks\ngently into her ear. \"By now you arefeeling more relaxed, you may even be\nenjoying this a little bit. What we're giving you now isyour first daily\ninjection of hormone cream to your uterus. It provides many of the hormonalsignals your body would get from having a baby inside you. Between that and the\nlotion, it willtell your breasts to begin lactating.\"Marilee can only look at the nurse's big brown eyes, as she\ngrunts softly, easing her hipsbackward to engulf and grip the fat syringe. The\ndoctor sees Marilee's clenching anus, keeps agood pressure on, steadily\nholding the vibrating applicator to bathe Marilee's womb in thehormonal serum.\"This will make you feel a bit different, little cow. You\nwill be very content, mostly, except thatyou might feel sexier than usual.\nThis is normal, and you can always talk to me about it. Butremember, you\ncannot speak unless spoken to. If you want to ask me something, you have tonudge me and say moo. Got that? Can we give it a try?\"Marilee nods, and nudges Nurse Reardon's large breast with\nher head. It was the only partwithin reach. The nurse laughs. \"Yes, little\ncow. Is there something you want to say?\"\"You're smexi,\" Marilee says woozily. Her eyes are not in\nfocus. A fleck of drool forms on herlip as she grunts back against the stiff\nwarm syringe the doctor holds firm in her deliriousvagina.\"Ah, my sweet little cow. The serum is affecting you\nalready. It can be a bit like a rave drug, sokeep that in mind. Don't tell\nanybody you love them, that's an order. We're going to take verygood care of\nyou here on the farm. I'm sure you will like it.\"The doctor gently removes the syringe, tidies her up with a\nwarm moist towel, and leaves theroom.\"We're almost ready to take you to the barn, but first you\nmust choose your petname.\"", "related": ["B00JYQ9ZNY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Such as sci-fi, medieval fantasy, some romance, and some action and adventure novels. As an animator I have a lot of stories in my head, so I decided until I get the job I want why not put the stories in my head down on paper.I began to right my first sci-fi novel, The Sovereign of the Hucens. To my surprise I found that I love to write stories, seeing my imaginations come to life on paper did something to me. It was like being born again, and for almost two years I have continued writing. Now I have published my first novel, and I seek to publish many more in the future. I hope you enjoy my stories, and please give me your input.

Bev left her cool-sounding but dispiriting entry-level position at a Manhattan publishing house to follow her boyfriend to the Midwest. Bad move. Now she’s back in New York, single again, and temping. Amy was once famous for her work at a hot website-or maybe she was just notorious: ‘[N]ow that she was neither, it mattered less which one it had been.’ She’s been working for three years at Yidster, ‘the third-most-popular online destination for cultural coverage with a modern Jewish angle,’ but is basically just floating through life on a diet of clicks and tweets, hoping her boyfriend will move in with her so she'll be able to keep paying the rent on her lovely brownstone apartment in Brooklyn. When Bev gets pregnant on a hilariously dreadful first date, the women are forced to confront their differing dreams and priorities. Plot takes a back seat to Gould’s razor-sharp humor and observations about life in New York among a class of young people who know more about how they’d like to live than how to pay for it. It’s also a delight to read a novel that places female friendship at its center; we watch Bev and Amy manage their fluctuating feelings of love, jealousy and sometimes disdain for each other. ‘It seems improbable that this hasn’t happened to us before,’ Amy says when she learns that Bev is pregnant. ‘Us?’ Bev replies. ‘Are you going to start saying ‘we’re pregnant’? . . . We’re not a couple, Amy.’ They’re not, but they are, and Gould brilliantly charts their ups and downs.” —Kirkus(starred review)“Gould’s novel is admirably, readably realistic—she knows these girls and the world they live in (including the omnipresence of technology and the way that it pervades relationships) . . . Gould nails the complex blend of love, loyalty, and resentment that binds female friends. It is worth reading for the richness of its details (at one point, Amy is overwhelmed by the desire to put an engaged coworker’s wedding ring in her mouth), and it offers new insight into the experience of young women.” —Publishers Weekly“I readFriendshipwith great pleasure. Emily Gould re-creates with wit and insight the New York I know: a place full of fame and money that’s not yours, where friends become family and lovers become ex-lovers, and the big questions about your life stay unanswered, and unanswerable, for a long time.” —Chad Harbach, author ofThe Art of Fielding“Truth-teller Emily Gould hurls her heart and her mind into this hilarious, bittersweet tale of the urgent, everyday need for connection between women.” —Jami Attenberg, author ofThe Middlesteins“Friendshipis a moving, focused, highly readable, very funny novel, told with a calming amount of perspective by a trustworthy, precise voice. It is intimate and insightful regarding two decades of life (early twenties to middle age), and on the topics of endurance (emotional, financial), relationships (work, platonic, romantic—human), and jobs (temp, Internet, freelance art) in New York City.” —Tao Lin, author ofTaipei“Friendshipis especially honest about professional insecurity and personal uncertainty, which makes it an especially funny novel. And Emily Gould’s prose sounds so admirably up-to-the-minute because it so faithfully observes classical principles of transparency and directness.” —Benjamin Kunkel, author ofIndecision  Praise for Emily Gould: “[Emily Gould is] massively talented, just as good at devastating us with an emotional truth as she is at amusing us with a clever joke.” —Curtis Sittenfeld, author ofPrepandAmerican Wife", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From this popular, otherworldly premise comes a tale of quickly formed relationships strained by secrecy.The novel is arranged in two books, each of which serves as an entertaining introduction to the main character's suitors. The first book features Byron, a technophobic, talented guitarist imbued with \"cool aloofness.\" With a deliberate break, the second book turns toward Elon, a Princeton graduate assistant filled with \"unrestrained exuberance.\" Genna's attraction to both young men lays the foundation for a dramatic plot that emphasizes pursuit and evasion, both in the game of flirtation and through life-threatening events.Starcrushdraws from expected features of the genre--including extraordinarily handsome love interests and the frisson of dialogue laced with deeper intentions--yet avoids simplistic portraits of perfection. Despite their more than human capacities, each of the main characters possesses deeply human concerns. This book is an exuberant take on the timeless search for acceptance, with cinematic twists.\"-ForewordClarion Reviews", "related": ["B00DY07HYU"], "rank": 2720147, "title": "Starcrush eBook", "author": "Justine Erler", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Walker was born in 1971 in the suburbs of Seattle, WA. His family was a little bit on the hippy side and they enjoyed traveling around Washington State to camp, fish, sightsee and party. During his teen years, Erik discovered a love for black and white photography and spent many hours a day in the darkroom that he and his father built in a corner of their workshop. While in his early twenties, Erik felt the mountains calling him and moved to the central Cascades to live in a tent, along the Stilliguamish River. There, he acquired a deep understanding of Mother Nature, while perfecting his campfire cooking skills. In 2002, he married his wife, Tina Monique, in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2004, they purchased ten acres in rural Walla Walla County, Washington, near the Snake River. They named their land Walkers Ranch, and have transformed it from nothing but tumbleweeds and dust devils into a beautiful oasis in the desert. That is where they still reside, with their many animals, and where Erik writes his books and a column for the local newspaper. You can always find them at www.walkersranch.com. Erik has authored several other books, including “In Pursuit of the Perfect Burger” (It’s sort of a cookbook, history book and novel all rolled into one!), \"Excellence Everyday\" (A ten point guide to living an excellent life) and \"The Hangover Cure (A Beer Soldiers guide to all things beer).", "related": [], "rank": 769552, "title": "Shipwrecked", "author": "Erik Walker", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

To this they add an extensive discussion of biblical material relating to human hope and responsibility. Many Christians will find this book a helpful approach to serious problems of our age.\" (Rev. Dr. John Polkinghorne, KBE, FRS)\"What a wonderful book. There isn't anything quite like it. Biblical scholar Moo and natural scientist White join hands to pen this compelling book on hope--authentic biblical hope--in a time of increasing despair. This book is both an honest and lucid presentation of the ecological challenges before us and an insightful and articulate discussion of important biblical texts such as Romans 8, 2 Peter 3 and Luke 12. I found myself again and again saying, 'That is exactly right' and 'Well said.' Perhaps the highest compliment I can give is that I intend to use this book in teaching my college and seminary classes. Take up and read.\" (Steven Bouma-Prediger, Hope College, author of For the Beauty of the Earth)\"This powerful book is full of godly wisdom. Jonathan Moo and Robert White have given us an authoritative account of the current scientific data together with an inspirational review of a wide range of profound biblical resources. It is truly important reading for anyone seeking for hope in our troubled environmental times.\" (Peter Harris, A Rocha)\"This book shows why The Cape Town Commitment, from the Third Lausanne Congress, Cape Town 2010, was absolutely right to say that 'we cannot separate our relationship to Christ from how we act in relation to the earth. For to proclaim the gospel that says \"Jesus is Lord\" is to proclaim the gospel that includes the earth, since Christ's Lordship is over all creation. Creation care is thus a gospel issue within the Lordship of Christ.' To be able to make such an affirmation requires that we have a fully biblical vision of what the gospel wholly and actually is, and this book richly provides such a vision with extensive biblical support. It takes us through the whole Bible story, from creation to new creation, and shows how our attitudes and actions in relation to the earth must be shaped by what God has done and will do for all creation through the Lord Jesus Christ. The book presents and explains the sober facts of our present ecological crisis. But, as the title makes clear, it does so not to induce despair, but rather to show how radical and transformative is the hope for all creation that is truly part of the 'good news' of the biblical gospel.\" (Christopher J. H. Wright, Langham Partnership; author of The Mission of God and The Mission of God's People)\"If your mailboxes, physical and digital, are like mine, they are filled with apocalyptic rantings. Religious groups point to the signs of the end times. Environmentalist groups warn us we must act now, before it's too late. Here's a different message. While not every reader will agree with every perspective in this book, all of us can be provoked by its winsome engagement with tough issues from a biblical perspective. Whatever your position on matters such as climate change, this book will prompt you to think through how your biblical hope intersects with the problems of the day.\" (Russell D. Moore, president, Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, Southern Baptist Convention)\"[Let Creation Rejoice] is a marvelously lucid study of Scripture and current ecological concerns. Those skeptical about the magnitude of the threats facing the earth will be challenged by the sober, balanced account of climate change and related issues; those skeptical of Christianity's relevance to such concerns will equally be challenged by the elegant exposition of the Bible's affirmation of the created order. I cannot imagine a more clearheaded and timely treatment of the topic.\" (Sean McDonough, professor of New Testament, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary)\"[Let Creation Rejoice] is an extremely valuable addition to the literature and theology of creation care. Where evangelical Christianity has tended to see in eschatology an excuse for avoiding environmental questions altogether, White and Moo take the opposite approach. It is in the hope that is in Jesus' promised return to restore all things that they see our biggest reason for acting now. Yes, we live in an age of potential despair--but what hope there is in these pages. The honest, careful and encouraging exegesis here should bless all who read it.\" (Rev. Ed Brown, Care of Creation Inc.)\"This is a book that speaks to a great need of our time, the need for hope that does not depend on illusion. It takes very seriously both science and exegesis. It has the potential to mobilize authentic Christian hope in fearful and perplexing times.\" (Richard Bauckham, FBA, FRSE, professor emeritus, University of St Andrews)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

T. Browning was born in 1969 to a 16 year old girl who had no choice but to put him up for adoption and hope for the best.  The best was what he got in terms of family, love and happiness.  He was adopted by a loving couple, of which both had come from very large families.  His father was the baby of eleven and his mother the baby of nine.  Fortunately, for B. T. or perhaps for them, he was the only child of the couple.  The rambunctious boy caused them many hours of worry and happiness.   B. T. started writing after dropping a typing class because \"ASDFJKL;\" just didn't make sense to him.  So, he started writing and the words flowed into the fantasy and science-fiction novels that he loved so much.  However, it was the Saturdays spent slaying dragons and saving those in distress within the role-playing games he and his friends enjoyed for many years that inspired this series.", "related": ["B00COPB6DO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Acknowledging you were a victim is the first step in laying down the misplaced shame that keeps people in silence. Millions of people around the world have been affected by sexual abuse. Statistics show that 1 out of 3 women and 1 out of 6 men are victims of some form of sexual abuse.

The Age\n of Adventure was first signaled around 1992 (ADR, their\nSavillCt3calendar) with an incredible act of stealth unheard of since\nthe days of the heroes millennia ago (see Three Minutes to Midnight). I\nspent a lot of time examining things that were going on in late 1995-6\nwhen the curse lying over the Percentalion (the Land of One Hundred\nCastles in my world) was finally lifted. A band of despised adventurers\nwas a big part of that wondrous deed, you meet them in this tale. So\nyes, history pivots on the events set down here, and all the other tales\n I've published come later, largely because of them.But there was another character, just before that time, one everybody\n knew as The Man in Grey. I saw Solemn Judgement first, even before I\nsaw the Lands of Hope. The image of this grim, erudite, reserved and\nskillful pariah was always clearly before me, more than thirty years\nago. Everywhere that things went wrong, wherever adventurers argued\nabout the best solution while \"regular\" folk moaned about the good old\ndays, there he was; stalking briefly in and out again, a few words, a\nfew blows, a miracle, and then gone. No hesitation, no explanations, and\n nobody sorry to see him leave, to resume his mysterious walkabout\nacross an entire continent.But he never left my mind. Before I go any further, let me reassure\nyou- my lovely wife is very knowledgeable about all manner of mental\nproblems and keeps a close eye on me. If she ever says I need to put on\nthe looonng sleeved cardigan, I will; just let me out for an hour a day\nto write some more, because that's the only way Solemn Judgement leaves\nme alone.My entire adult life I have worked in some way to placate him.\nLike him, every stitch of my clothing is a shade of ash, slate, charcoal\n or steel. Though much older than he, I feel a kinship now that my hair\nis coming to match the outfits. But these gestures do little to put him\noff, year in and year out- in my mind he is always standing there, not\nsaying a word but only looking on me with that serious face that clearly\n says \"what should be done\".So I have done it. This is literally his tale, the story of how he\ncame to the Lands and what drives him to be the way he is. Against all\nodds, against nearly everyone he meets, Judgement is determined to do\nwhat is needful. A mighty river of other peoples' lives flows in one\ndirection, but only he can swim, and chooses to fight the current.\nNothing deters him; as he pressed on against undead and demonic foes, so\n too he bore down on my mind all those years. And as his story finally\ncomes out, Judgement wins, over endless enemies and feckless friends\nalike. But if I know him, it will merely mean another task, more\nadventure that needs doing, and then needs telling.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
