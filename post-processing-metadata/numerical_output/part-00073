Is it blood, environment, education or simply hauteur? The late, prolific Cookson deftly explores these questions in this dizzying upstairs-downstairs \"romance of adversity\" set in rural Edwardian England. Annabella Lagrange is a lovely 17-year-old lady-to-be... or not to be, whose aristocratic childhood comes to a crashing halt when her womanizing papa, who has just bankrupted his wife Rosina's glass factory, reveals that Annabella is actually the daughter of a local whorehouse madam. Manuel Mendoza, a predictably dark and handsome self-made workman, helps Annabella begin a new, humble life as a farmhouse maid with an invented past. Cookson liberally heaps mental anguish and cruel twists of fate upon her heroine as Annabella tentatively navigates \"life as lived by the majority of people.\" Over the course of a trying year, Annabella keeps her ladylike dignity—and virginity—as she entangles herself in the bonds of love. Is it truly possible for \"the upper class to come down and the working class to come up and meet in the middle\" in the realms of love and business? Despite some heavy-handed foreshadowing and spell-breaking asides about the social limitations of the Edwardian era, Cookson proves herself a seasoned storyteller, whose plentiful list of titles keeps historical women's fiction fans in the hardcover aisle years after the author's death.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At the very least, it seemed like discrimination against brunettes. Trent had dated a brunette a couple of months back, he was certain. Almost certain.The regular sounds of Matheson Racing's race car prep- aration—the clang of metal on metal, the hiss of the air guns, the whine of the welding torch—ceased as everyone except Trent looked up at the TV. Then Rod Sutton, Trent's crew chief, said,  \"She's blond, for sure. But not your kind of blond .\"Trent hit the Send button that would transmit his e-mail newsletter to thousands of NASCAR fans all over America, then checked out the TV high on the wall at the far end of the workshop. The sound was off, but sure enough there he was, his face blown up large behind the woman. Like Rod said, she was blond. Pretty, but awkward-looking. The on-screen caption read Kelly Greenwood, Sport Psychology Consultant.\"Not another one,\" he muttered. Another expert with an opinion on what made Trent Matheson a winner. He shook his head—he'd rather spend his time answering the dozens of fan e-mails that had come in today than listen to what other people said about him. Then a picture of Danny Cruise flashed up on the screen alongside Trent's face. Cruise was his number-one rival for the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series.\"Turn up the sound, will you?\" Trent called to Rod. When the volume came up, the camera had panned back to show the TV network's traveling prerace studio. Kelly Greenwood was one of four guests being interviewed by host Chris Spires. Trent recognized the other three: a regular race analyst, a former Cup champion who wasn't racing this year and a retired crew chief. All male.\"Okay, folks, let's have your picks,\" Chris Spires said.\"Trent Matheson won last week's NASCAR race here in Charlotte—can he do it again this Sunday?\"The analyst spoke up first.  \"Cruise is good, but I'm picking Trent Matheson .\"\"Matheson, without a doubt,\" the retired driver agreed.A cheer went up around the Matheson Racing workshop. Trent flashed a grin to his team.  \"Smart guys, huh?\"The ex-crew chief took a little longer to make up his mind. He sounded reluctant when he said,  \"It'll go down to the wire, but Matheson will win it .\"A grumble ran around the workshop, but Trent waved it away with good humor. He knew the ex-chief's reluctance stemmed from the fact that Trent had dated his daughter, then ended it when she refused to accept what he'd told her all along, that he wasn't after a serious relationship. The old guy just plain didn't like him. But he couldn't deny Trent was the standout driver in this year's field.\"What about you, Kelly?\" Chris Spires turned a smile on the blonde.For a bare second, she froze. Then her tongue came out to moisten her lips, and she cleared her throat. She lifted a hand to push a stray strand of hair behind her ear, but her watch tangled in the cord of the microphone clipped to her shirt. There was a brief, inelegant tussle that had the guys in the to the TV and hit the off button before she could sentence. He turned to the assembled company.  \"What say we invite her to join me in Victory Lane after I win tomorrow?\"There was a chorus of support from every corner except the one that mattered. Chad Matheson, who sometimes forgot he'd been Trent's older brother for thirty-one years and his boss for just five, was rubbing his chin as if he actually lent some credence to the garbage that woman had spouted. Chad said,  \"She's right, you did crash out twice in a row .\"\"Eight million Americans could have told you that,\" Trent snapped.Thanks for the vote of confidence, bro.\"You did that last season,\" Chad said.  \"You won two, lost two, won two, lost two .\"Deliberately, Trent stayed where he was, next to the life- size poster of himself pinned to the wall below the TV set. They'd sold thousands of those posters when Trent won the NASCAR Busch Series. he'd autographed so many, he'd practically gotten carpal tunnel syndrome.  \"I finished top- three the next five after that, and I won the Busch series. For the second time,\" he reminded his brother. He knew what Chad would say to that.\"The Cup is different .\"Bingo.Chad continued,  \"There's more pressure, you don't have the same experience in the series .\"So what if Trent had been the highest-performing rookie in the history of the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series on his debut two years ago? So what if last year he'd set the fastest lap time more often than any other driver and had finished fifth in the series, leaving everyone to predict another quantum leap in his performance this season? Chad wouldn't be confident of victory until he was standing next to Trent in Victory Lane, helping hold up that coveted sterling silver trophy.\"I'm ready for this,\" Trent told his brother. The two men locked glares for several long seconds. Chad looked away first, and it was as if a spell had been broken, freeing the crew to return to their work of setting up the Number 186 car for Sunday's race.Trent let a confident swagger into his walk as he did the rounds of the workshop, checking on the cars, cracking jokes and giving the guys the encouragement that helped bond them into an unbeatable team.He planned to win on Sunday. No sport psychologist was going to tell him otherwise.KELLY GREENWOOD popped the top of her soda and set the can down on the coffee table. She sank into the comfort of her leather couch. What more could a girl want than a Sunday spent watching the most exciting motor racing in the world? Even better, it counted as work.She switched on the TV just as the NASCAR theme music played. Along with the 170,000-odd people at the track, she closed her eyes for the invocation, then sang along to the national anthem.And when the grand marshal said those time- honored words,  \"Gentlemen, start your engines,\" she felt the familiar lurch in the pit of her stomach. Who needed to go to the race, when watching it at home was as good as being there?Who am I kidding?She'd have loved to be at the race track, rather than sitting here in the condo she'd rented for the duration of the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series. But insulting Char- lotte's favorite homegrown race driver had made her Public Enemy Number One. Who knew Trent Matheson had so many fans?And who knew one little TV interview would make Kelly instantly recognizable to the complete strangers who'd up- braided her this morning at the mall, at the park, even in church?Turning up at today's race might start a riot. She should never have been so rash as to predict Trent Matheson wouldn't go more than half of today's four hundred laps.I'm a psychologist, not a psychic.Kelly huffed out an anxious breath that lifted the bangs off her forehead. Maybe she'd gone too far. But Suze, her friend who was a production assistant on the network's NASCAR show, had warned her to make the most of this opportunity to stand in for Don Carson, motor racing's foremost sport psy- chologist, after he had a minor car accident.\"Don't say 'uh.\" Don't fiddle with your hair. Smile. Talk in sound bites.\" Suze had fired instructions at Kelly as an as- sistant applied makeup that felt heavier than normal, but would apparently come out okay on TV.  \"Whatever you do, don't go along with everyone else—say something different .\"Which sounded fine, until Kelly heard who the other guests were.\"Those guys have a combined experience of about a thousand years in NASCAR,\" she said, horrified. How could she, a longtime fan but with zero professional involvement, contradict them?When they all picked Trent Matheson to win, that's exactly what she had to do. If a snappy sound bite would help estab- lish her as a sport psychology consultant in NASCAR—well, she wasn't about to blow it. She'd been knocking on the doors of the top racing teams for months, getting only dumb jokes about shrinks and offers of driver autographs for her trouble. No use at all to a woman who had to resurrect her career before her family discovered just how badly she'd failed.She'd done what she had to.Trent Matheson is a casualty of my ambition.Kelly chewed on the thought then spat it out. Matheson was the poster boy of this year's NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series. Never without a pretty blond girl, always with a charming smile on his lips— maybe he'd spent a fortune on dentistry and didn't want to waste the results—Matheson had the ego of a champion.And the brain of a—well, put it this way: Trent Matheson wasn't the sharpest tool in the box.She could tell from the way he gave long consideration to the most inane of the journalists' questions, always delivering his eventual answer in a drawl punctuated by  \"uh's\" and  \"huh's .\"Kelly's comment would have slid off him like a race car off a wet track.She watched as the cars circled the track in their starting order. In any case, she was probably about to be proved com- pletely wrong. Matheson was starting this race in pole position, thanks to an outstanding performance in Friday's qualifying, and he had a record of being hard to catch off the pole.Kelly winced as they showed once more that clip of her saying  \"not a chance\" and predicting Trent wouldn't last two hundred laps. Couldn't they just start the darned race?Suze had assured her after the interview that it didn't matter if she was wrong. Viewers had been phoning and e-mailing the station, some to agree with her, more to disagree.  \"We love that,\" Suze said.  \"I'm certain you'll be invited back .\"\"Which means,\" Kelly told herself aloud now,  \"it's fine by me if Trent Matheson runs all four hundred laps without a problem.\"But if something goes wrong—nothing that might hurt him...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Of course I really enjoy watching the guys and gals get up there and take the shit seriously. The home for karaoke in my town (Denton, Texas) is the notorious and glorious Sunset Bar & Grill. A redneck lite-beer-drinking crowd, always boisterous and always belligerent, peppered with the most flamboyantly gay and vocally gifted host and his alternative lifestyle crew. \"Where my gay boys at? Where my lesbians at?\" he screams. The redneck/gay boy/girl combo is always a great time leaning toward the bizarre.

IIToni Braxton Unbreak My HeartMetallica St. AngerBob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band Turn the PageThe secret to great karaoke is to choose a song that means something to you and means something to the people around you. That's why Justin Reynolds and I chose to perform Limp Bizkit's timeless \"Nookie\" at a Korean karaoke bar in the Summer of '06. Because it's raw, because it's honest, because it's vital.Patrons ruminating over which dreary standard to bang out got more than they bargained for that night, as two juiced-up bulldogs crisscrossed the stage like Hogan and Warrior in their prime, spitting those words that meant so much with a venom belying their comfortable upbringing and moderate success with women.That's what karaoke's about.

Our crew was called JJ's Van, referring to my parents' minivan in which I would cart my friends around through the streets of New Orleans. We would write rhymes about how much money we had, how many girls sweated us, and, of course, our pimped-out minivan. We were the trailblazers for today's mainstream, shitty rap. This was before the days we could afford a home studio, so we would record our songs on a Sharper Image karaoke machine over other people's music. None of it could be released, obviously, because we were actually recording over the full instrumentals from well-known top 40 artists. This was my first introduction to everything from recording to karaoke. People tend to stick to the song they're supposed to be singing, but even to this day I pull out the old school JJ's Van rhymes when tearing the roof off of the local karaoke bar. They're still not very good, but hey, karaoke isn't supposed to be good.GEOFF RICKLEYSinger, ThursdayTOP 5 FAVORITE KARAOKE SONGS TO PERFORM AT A TIKI RESTDanzig MotherBruce Springsteen Born to RunMeat Loaf Paradise by the Dashboard LightDon McLean American PieLed Zeppelin Stairway to HeavenWhen my best friend, Alex, was running Eyeball Records out of his house in Kearny, New Jersey, we used to take all our bands to a Hawaiian Island-themed karaoke place for its tiki-flavored ambiance and 3000-proof Zombies. The owners apparently didn't understand the notion of indie rock, so they treated us like Bon Jovi. We would rage to \"Born to Run\" by the Boss and \"Mother\" by Danzig. The unwitting middle-age couples would get a choir of drunken hardcore kids backing them up on \"American Pie.\" Then suddenly the dream was over. Alex was closing out the night with \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light,\" sung from the balcony. A mini-riot broke out between a bunch of Jersey bodybuilders in the back. Piebald, My Chemical Romance, and the rest of us were suddenly in the middle of a movie style smashup, complete with splintered bamboo and broken walls.PATRICK STUMPSinger, Fall Out BoyTOP 5 FAVORITE KARAOKE SONGS TO PERFORM AND WHYBobby Brown On Our OwnMichael Jackson Rock With YouNew Edition Boys to MenJourney Any Way You Want ItR.

I don't remember being born, but I remember everything about this time.One evening the call came, as it did most every night, and I was given the address of some place on some street downtown and a time to show up. I mentioned MC Chris before -- well, at this time he was sleeping on an air mattress on my studio apartment floor writing his second record, and I told him to put on his shoes and come with me. I've never been good at showing up alone.Upon finding the location we were directed to an eight-foot-by-eight-foot room in the back, crammed with about twenty people, none of whom I knew, and Sarah. It turns out the occasion for celebration was the birthday of one Lawrence Lewitinn, who, being the honored guest, decided that upon entering the room you must immediately pick a song and sing, no questions, go. I must be honest, I knew what karaoke was, but I'd never done it, I'd never wanted to, I didn't want to then....A little-known fact about me is that I can sing any Frank Sinatra song as well as Ol' Blue Eyes himself; I am so good it's embarrassing. I mean, I've got to be honest with you, I scare myself, I'm so good. So I walk in the room, I punch in song number 4736, and for the first time ever I sing \"Night and Day\" in front of twenty perfect strangers. I did it so well that I got a boner and pooped in my pants a little.Since that night, I sing that song every day, in the shower, and Sarah, Lawrence, and Frank are forever some of my favorite people. I love most every song Frank Sinatra ever sang.Copyright © 2008 by Sarah Lewitinn", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His constant preoccupation, other than survival, was to be free of the serf conditions into which he was born. He shows very well the gratuitous capriciousness of the serf-owning gentry, which placed him \"at the mercy of whim and chance.\" In a unique career, he learned how to read and write, became a teacher, and made some powerful friends, who in 1824 sought to free him from his owner the richest man in Russia, who regarded his appeal as \"not worthy of attention.\" An intriguing account, with a most useful introduction by Peter Kolchin, contrasting contemporary Russian serfdom and black slavery in the United States.

When former soap-opera star Sydney Vail lands on his doorstep all keyed up, Shep figures he should help the damsel in distress, going so far as to agree to baby-sit her companion, a very intelligent chimp named Kikora. Problem is, Sydney doesn't return, and soon Shep learns that she stole Kikora from a drug-testing laboratory and is being sought in connection with the murder of the lab's head scientist. With the help of close friends, a very persistent investigative reporter, and one crotchety old attorney, Shep decides to help defend Sydney, all the while becoming enlightened about the plight of laboratory animals. This second installment in Light's Shep Harrington series presents a respectable balance between the mystery and the cause, never turning preachy yet always making clear Light's stance on the issue.

Instead of being filled with pride of position, he humbly lays out the principles of leadership the Lord Jesus has taught him during a lifetime of service. Read these pages and you will not only learn how to lead others in the right direction, but how to equip others to do the same.  Dr. David B. Wyrtzen Pastor/Teacher, Midlothian Bible Church, Dallas Theological Seminary --Dr. David B. WyrtzenWhen I met Tom Atema, he was directing the radio stations in North Carolina that were founded by Dr. Billy Graham. I asked Tom to think about how he could help EQUIP, my non-profit ministry, expand its impact around the world. He immediately moved into action, raising tens of thousands of dollars from his listeners to train leaders in limited access nations and volunteering to travel every six months to Lebanon to teach leadership. I had no idea at that time that Tom would eventually join the executive team at EQUIP as our Vice President of International Ministries and Strategic Partnerships. He and I have traveled together in many nations of the world, and I have watched him in action. As you read Tom's compelling story of how he learned to lead effectively, you will understand his passion to raise up other leaders to fulfill the Great Commission.  Dr. John C. Maxwell Best-selling author and Founder of EQUIP --Dr. John C. MaxwellFor most of my career, I have been drawn toward leadership practitioners instead of leadership professors. While I value research, trends, data, and case studies, I benefit more from the leaders who actually get up every day and lead something and more importantly, lead people. I want to learn the real life lessons from those who hire, fire, fix, fail and make decisions without the security of tenure. I am attracted to leaders who risk, reward, go without a paycheck if it advances the organization, build something out of nothing, make constant marketplace adjustments and perhaps, most important to me authentically want to make the lives of their employees, partners, vendors, and customers better! Because I celebrate and study that kind of leader and leadership, I like this kind of book.  My friend and colleague, Tom Atema is a leadership practitioner. In the years I have worked with Tom as EQUIP s Vice-President of International Operations and Partnerships, I have personally witnessed and been helped by his world-class leadership. Leadership in Blue Jeans is one-hundred percent Tom Atema! While he weaves leadership lessons around his life, family and work from leaders God has placed in his path, he shares the good, the bad and the ugly of what it means to make hard decisions, choose seasons of sacrifice, and be fully dependent upon God. Tom reflects upon a group of leaders with whom he has served and loved and passes along to us what he learned from each of them. From his father who taught him the basics of ethical business practices and money management, to a national youth evangelist who mentored him in vision and passion, to a world-renowned evangelist who gave him a platform to share the gospel with a lost world, to a leadership development expert who gave Tom the tools and the opportunity to multiply Christian leaders to effectively fulfill the Great Commission, every one of them and others have shaped his life and leadership. Leadership in Blue Jeans is a transparent script of a life that has had its share of challenges to overcome, pains to process, disappointments to work through, joys to smile over, opportunities to embrace and victories to celebrate. I enjoyed this book not only because I know the man who wrote it, but also because I get to see him live out his life and leadership every day in the EQUIP arena. This book is about a person who has grown to become a wonderful leader of people not only in the office, but all over the world! Start at Page 1 and see how God has developed Tom s leadership and be encouraged that He desires to develop your leadership too!    John Hull, President/CEO of EQUIP --Dr. John D.

It is a rich history, however, and one that also has a place in the history of private life, the family, and community relations. If it is a neglected history, however, it is also an undervalued one, especially in the history of health and medicine. Private care for the sick by family members and neighbors has always been the primary form of nursing care, and it remains so in poor countries. Care as a gift relationship lies at the core of family life in most cultures, and care as a fundamental human relationship is the subject of Emily K. Abel's fine book, Hearts of Wisdom.Abel writes her history from the perspective of those within these care relationships, working from diaries and letters, both private correspondence and public letters of pleading to governmental agencies and care institutions. The words are largely those of the caregivers rather than those of their patients, although one important voice in the book makes the painful transition from caregiver to dependent. Abel's is a partial story, confined to the testimony of the few who wrote diaries and letters that passed down to posterity, but it is no less valuable for that. Not all her correspondents and diarists are comfortable with literacy, however, and neither are all of them admirable women; on the contrary, some are all too human.Abel recreates the world of private care, especially as it existed far from professional help in remote, pioneering communities. The poor and the isolated depended on each neighborhood's or community's having at least one woman who was good at delivering babies, nursing the sick, and laying out the dead. Many women did become very handy in the sickroom, skilled at the feeding, toileting, and bathing of invalids and even at the management of catheters and drains. Abel is quick to quell any romanticizing of lay nursing or midwifery, but there is no question that many women possessed a natural flair for both the physical and the emotional care of those who were suffering.However, the time span of this history -- 1850 to 1940 -- also encompasses the ending of this world of private care as a result of the rise of biomedical expertise, the professionalization of nursing, and the growth of hospitals and asylums. Private care gave way, not always willingly, to professional care. The disinterested expert trained in the universal, standard care of the universal, standard patient supplanted the voluntary caregiver recruited to the task through familial or community bonds. The appeal of biomedicine, of course, sprang from the reality that even before antibiotics, nursing care did have something special to offer to the sick and injured: supportive care of the sick so that the natural powers could effect healing. This is another neglected area of the history of medicine. Abel pays some attention to the actual tasks of home nursing, such as bathing and turning, but more needs to be said generally about the improvements in nursing care by the end of the 19th century that were really beginning to save lives.Nurses in hospitals and trained private nurses working under medical direction could be very skilled in keeping dangerously ill patients alive. This care was astonishingly intimate and emotionally charged. In the days before intravenous drips, constant verbal and physical encouragement was needed to keep patients sucking ice, sipping stimulants, and swallowing morsels. Catheters and drains, especially before the invention of rubber, required constant vigilance. Enemas (including nutrient enemas), douches, and irrigations took considerable skill. Patients had to be turned, washed, powdered, and rubbed with methylated spirits. Poultices were complicated; suppurating wounds had to be dressed. All of this required touching and talking, and even in hospitals, nurses often \"specialled,\" forming a powerful commitment to particular patients, and the touching and talking were often vital to recovery.What Abel tells well is the story of the influence of germ theory on care in the home, and wisely, she chooses tuberculosis for her case study. No contagious disease caused as much private anguish as this one, once it was discovered that people with tubercular infection were dangerous to those around them. The accounts of struggles between officials who sought to isolate infected patients from their families are painful to read. So also are the accounts of interactions between institutional authorities and mothers of those who were deaf, \"feeble-minded,\" or epileptic.Abel's Hearts of Wisdom is more than a history; it is also a moral reflection on the meaning of caregiving in private life. If the welfare state in its various forms was initially needed in part to provide a safety net of care for those without families, its rise may also have diminished the moral value of private care. Throughout her book, Abel emphasizes the moral growth and emotional enrichment that caring induces in most of us: it is one of the most important things that make us human, and we neglect it at our shared peril.Janet McCalman, Ph.D.Copyright © 2001 Massachusetts Medical Society.

When not writing, he works as a lab technician at a telecommunications company and is self-described on his resume as a \"technology professional\" who has worked with cellular &amp; IP infrastructure, biomedical equipment, emergency two-way radios and computer hardware. Tom began to produce weird writings back in 2000 while working the graveyard shift. The nightly edits were emailed to a small collection of coworkers who looked forward to something unusual to keep them awake or humored. This practice was ended when he was moved to a different shift. Sadly, his enjoyment of writing was forgotten for several years, until the autumn of 2007, when old friends received a \"blast from the past\" email with the recognizable words, \"Hello All\". The strange writings and short stories had resumed and a personal website was soon to follow. In autumn of 2009, Tom published his first book, Freaked out Horror (a collection of short stories), through Create Space and was soon available on Amazon and Kindle. The work has been temporarily unpublished and will be re-released in 2011 with many additions, revisions and improvements. In a commitment to produce higher quality writings, Tom no longer produces daily short stories on his website, but keeps in touch with his readers by posting to his blog, daily. Check out his website that includes the blog at: http://sites.google.com/site/tomraimbaultwritings/ Tom is always open to new friends on Facebook where he shares photos from his nature hikes, family vacations and any random thoughts throughout the day.

Despite clever word craft, poetic political satire and biting humor on every page, vague characterization and a meandering plot push this polemic too far toward the abstract and oblique. Even the most adventurous and prose-focused readers will struggle to engage with Schulman's discontinuous style at this length; the only hope is to treat it as poetry, or perhaps modern art.(Sept.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lexie comes to realize that she must allow Glenn the freedom to take chances and to make his own decisions. She must allow him the same right she has demanded for herself.The Widow Maker by Amy Gallow is a thought-provoking tale.

H. Edgar. As an infant he wasadopted by George Freeman, a porter at Billingsgate fish market. Aged eleven, Wallace sold newspapers at Ludgate Circus and upon leaving school took a job with a printer. He later enlisted in the Royal West Kent Regiment, beforetransferring to the Medical Staff Corps, and was sent to South Africa. In 1898 he published a collection of poems called The Mission that Failed, and subsequently left the army to become acorrespondent for Reuters.South African war correspondent for The Daily Mail followed and hisarticles were later published as Unofficial Dispatches. His outspokenness infuriated Lord Kitchener, who removed his credentialsas a war correspondent. He thenedited the Rand Daily Mail, but gambled disastrously on the South African Stock Market. Returning to England, he at first reportedon crimes and hanging trials, before becomingeditor of The Evening News. It was in 1905 that he founded the Tallis Press, publishing Smithy, a collection of soldier stories, and The Four Just Men. The latter waspublished with the ending removed as anadvertising stunt and he offered £500 to readers who could successfully guess the ending. Unfortunately, many did and he was almost bankrupted. At various times Wallacealso worked as a journalist on The Standard, The Star, The Week-End Racing Supplement and The Story Journal. In 1917, he became a Special Constable at Lincoln's Inn and also a special interrogator for the War Office. The Daily Mail sent Wallace to investigate atrocities in the Belgian Congo, a trip that provided material for his Sanders of the River books. In 1923 he became Chairman of the Press Club and in 1931 stood as a Liberal Parliamentary candidatefor Blackpool. mHis first marriage in 1901 to Ivy Caldecott, daughter of a missionary, ended in divorce in 1918 and he later married his much younger secretary, Violet King. Along with countlessarticles, some 23 screenplays and many short stories,Wallacewrote more than 170 books, which have been translated into 28 languages and sales of which have exceeded 50 million copies. Over 160 films have been made from his books - more than any other author. In the 1920's one of Wallace's many publishers claimed that a quarter of all books read in England were written by him. His sales were exceeded only by The Bible.

He was a peacemaker who sought unity among Protestants, and yet he was a highly independent thinker and at the center of every major controversy in England during his lifetime. Born in Rowton to parents who undervalued education, Baxter was largely self-taught. He eventually studied at a free school, then at royal court, where he became disgusted at what he saw as frivolity. He left to study divinity, and at age 23, he was ordained into the Church of England. Within the Anglican church, Baxter found common ground with the Puritans, a growing faction who opposed the church's episcopacy and was itself breaking into factions. Baxter, for his part, did his best to avoid the disputes between Anglicans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and other denominations, even convincing local ministers to cooperate in some pastoral matters. Among his more than 200 works are long, controversial discourses on doctrine. Still, he believed society was a large family under a loving father, and in his theology, he tried to cut between the extremes. Baxter also found himself as a peacemaker during the English Civil Wars. He believed in monarchy, but a limited one. He served as a chaplain for the parliamentary army, but then helped to bring about the restoration of the king. Yet as a moderate, Baxter found himself the target of both extremes. He was still irritated with the episcopacy in 1660, when he was offered the bishopric of Hereford, so he declined it. As a result, he was barred from ecclesiastical office and not permitted to return to Kidderminster, nor was he allowed to preach. Between 1662 and 1688 (when James II was overthrown), he was persecuted and was imprisoned for 18 months, and he was forced to sell two extensive libraries. Still, he continued to preach: \"I preached as never sure to preach again,\" and he wrote, \"and as a dying man to dying men.\" Baxter became even better known for his prolific writing. His devotional classic The Saints' Everlasting Rest was one of the most widely read books of the century. When asked what deviations should be permitted from the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, he created an entirely new one, called Reformed Liturgy, in two weeks. His Christian Directory contains over one million words. His autobiography and his pastoral guide, The Reformed Pastor, are still widely read today.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

(He even writes poetry when no one is looking.) When Fred dies mysteriously in bed, it comes out at his funeral service that he had another, more interesting, life: he was secretly engaged to at least two women, to the surprise and consternation of each. Suicide is initially suspected, but the coroner's discovery of strychnine in a cup containing the remains of coffee and bourbon points to murder. After one of the fiancees turns up dead in Fred's apartment, having drunk another poisoned Irish coffee, things start to get complicated. Snappy dialogue touched with humor propels the plot. Readers are unlikely to solve the puzzle, but will have a lot of fun trying.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 1142054, "title": "Irish Coffee: A Mystery Set at the University of Notre Dame (Roger and Philip Knight Mysteries Book 7)", "author": "Ralph McInerny", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When some of those stories didn't provide the loser's side, she took it upon herself to provide one. Toward that end, Ms. Dahl has written three complete novels so far in her career, the first two of which are self-published through CreateSpace and are also available for the Amazon Kindle. With a fresh opinion on what really caused the downfall of the Catholic Church in Tudor England, 'Evil's Own Trinity' introduces the reader to the real witch responsible for Henry's failures as a king, a husband, and a father. In 'This Lesser Earth', Ms. Dahl's foray into Kansas life in the 1870s, a widower finds a runaway whore in a collapsed sod house on his Kansas ranch. She's there because she's running from the living; he's there because he knows running away from the dead is impossible. The two of them together have to find a place to stand their ground. With a style strongly reminiscent of Daphne duMaurier, Jennifer Dahl delivers a dark story filled with passion, intrigue, love, hate, obsession, and manipulation from beyond the grave. At no time is there any guarantee that there will be a happy ending. Turning for a time to the history of her own family, Ms. Dahl researched her genealogy and published a collection of family stories and recipes under the title 'Best of Our Best: All-American Recipes of an All-American Family from All Over the World'. She was not particularly surprised to discover she was descended from William the Conqueror, and credits her bloodline for her creative focus. Ms. Dahl spends her free time taking care of her husband of thirty-five years, her menagerie of rescue cats and dogs, and working in an insurance agency. Most of her waking hours are spent listening to the voices of the characters inside her head tell her what she's gotten wrong and how she can make it right. She is currently at work on her fourth novel, Fort Ruby, which introduces us to the challenges facing a woman doctor in her efforts to make her place in a small military town in Nevada's Old West.", "related": ["B009ABTDSU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

To cover everything from the origins of the Russian people to the collapse of the Soviet Union in one short book requires great skill, but Paul Bushkovitch is one of the leading experts on Russian history in the world and he manages this task with great insight and panache.\"  - Dominic Lieven, Trinity College, Cambridge University\"This is a lively and readable account, covering more than a thousand years of Russian history in an authoritative narrative. The author deals perceptively not only with political developments, but also with those aspects of modern Russian culture and science that have had an international impact.\"  - Maureen Perrie, University of Birmingham\"If you want to understand Russia, and the story of the Russians, you can do no better than Paul Bushkovitch's A Concise History of Russia. Bushkovitch has performed a minor miracle: he's told the remarkably complicated, convoluted, and controversial tale of Russian history simply, directly, and even-handedly. He doesn't get mired in the details, lost in the twists and turns, or sidetracked by axe grinding. He tells you what happened and why, full stop. So if you want to know what happened and why in Russian history, you be advised to begin with Bushkovitch's masterful introduction.\"  - Marshall Poe, University of Iowa\"Both learned and accessible, this short history of Russia's troubled passage to the present tells a story of a state and a people who created an empire that much of the world saw as a threat. Whether as the 'Gendarme of Europe' or the 'Red Menace,' Russia and its Soviet successor (even Putin's Russia today!) have been as much misunderstood as they have been feared. Paul Bushkovitch brings us a sober reading of Russia's difficult rises and falls, expansions and contractions, reforms and revolutions. Rather than seeing the preceding millennium as a prelude to the seventy years of the Soviet Union, he gives us a rounded portrait of a country hobbled and humbled by its own geography, institutions like autocracy and serfdom, and grandiose plans to create utopia. Judicious in its judgments, this gracefully written work ranges from high politics to music and literature to open a window through which a reader might begin or renew an acquaintance with the enigmas that were Russia.\"  - Ronald Grigor Suny, University of Michigan", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The sheer heft of it, along with the sturdy slipcover; the fine, coated stock; and an unusually intoxicating new-book smell, commanded attention. And when a trailer truck packed with 1,300 copies was hijacked during a cross-country run, I was secretly thrilled that discerning thieves had thought40worthy of a heist—and that the book would soon be showing up on the street at people's prices.No such luck. The unloaded truck was eventually located on an interstate off-ramp, presumably abandoned in disgust. I've tried to imagine the reaction of the hijackers' supervisor when he broke into the trailer and discovered 13,000 pounds ofDoonesburywhere palettes of hi-def TVs should have been. Let us hope no one was hurt; it was an honest mistake.Still, after all that excitement, you'd think that the digital reimagining of40would be a letdown. Not so; we can now invite more people to the party. I've come to appreciate that many readers prefer to forego the risk of herniation while picking up a book—no matter that the risk is slight if you push up from your knees and have someone spot you. There was also the problem of where to display the book once consumed, as standard bookshelves could not accommodate it. We briefly considered shrink-wrapping it with four attachable legs, but then worried it might bump us into Amazon's Home and Kitchen category.Clearly the answer lay in rendering the collection in ones and zeros. And to further facilitate the reader experience, we divided the book into four easy pieces—each covering a full decade's worth of strips. Everyone has a favorite decade, although let's face it, it's never the '70s. Especially in my case. Not to wave the reader off, but my opening decade was filled with the uncertain stops and starts of a rank amateur learning his craft in full public view. I was wildly unready, but as the syndicate salesmen assured me, that was the point. The young had hijacked the culture, and with that standing, our voices—raw, impassioned, ungovernable—were in high demand.Besides, all journeys need a beginning, and the early wheel-spinning is part of the fun. To paraphrase the Dead, it's been a long, strange strip, and40comprises the long of it, it ought to retain the strange as well.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The poet is in fact an American, born in England and resident there and in Wales for most of her adulthood but raised in the U.S.  And with generations of American heritage. Moreover, she writes with the same clarity and incisiveness about New England as about Welsh and Cumbrian landscapes, so vividly that the places are imaginatively smelt and tasted as well as seen; see the first section of this book, \"The Way You Say the World.\" (Note, however, that despite that section title, \"Prologue\" includes the poems specifically concerned with the way of saying, the art of poetry.) In the present climate of opinion, it is odd that Stevenson isn't better known, too, as a preeminent poet of the family. The second section here, \"Seven Ages,\" contains poems of the life cycle, from birth to terminal doddering, that are firmly anchored in mothers caring for children and adult children for aged parents. But then, Stevenson isn't expressly religious, though severe Calvinism heavily informs the first, nineteenth-century part of \"Correspondences: A Family History in Letters,\" which is a veritable novel in verse of the utmost craftsmanship and interest. The concluding section, \"In Memoriam,\" demonstrates that she is one of the most natural and intelligent contemporary elegists. No lover of poetry in English should not know Stevenson's work.Ray OlsonCopyright © American Library Association.

Patrique, a leader in the French Resistance, had been presumed dead for some time, the result of an enemy ambush. During the quest to find his brother, Pierre once again encounters the beautiful Jasmyn, his former lover, who betrayed him with a Nazi officer, but now she appears to have information on Patrique's whereabouts. Although full of intrigue and adventure, this tale, book two in \"The Destiny\" series, relies heavily on the predictable and clich?d, along with an intrusive Christian message. Its appeal will be to those wanting a superficial, fast-moving story with few surprises and little subtlety. Ron Varela reads with conviction, breathing life and believability into the characters. Despite excellent audio quality, this program is a marginal purchase.ANancy R.

Torr is therefore proud to help John Wycliffe translate the New Testament into English. Based on fact, this story combines elements of religious history with the qualities of a mainstream thriller, which makes for especially exciting reading.

I played basketball in high school and was in the concert band. At Florida State University, I was drum major of the Marching Chiefs. In the Marine Corps, I played in the Parris Island post band, and became interested in fitness and martial arts; I was a member of the weight lifting and judo teams.  I have two hundred skydiving free-falls, countless scuba dives and I’ve competed in numerous equestrian events. I’ve enjoyed water and snow skiing. I joined my church choir as a teenager and have sung in various choirs for fifty years. As a member of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus under Robert Shaw, I participated in three performances at Carnegie Hall. I was an Eagle Scout as a boy and a scoutmaster as an adult. For ten years, I mentored a boy through the Big Brothers of Atlanta program; he’s now a father.  I’ve been a farm laborer, plumber, electrician, soldier, door-to-door salesman, singer/musician, lab technician, personal trainer, bouncer, ballroom-dance instructor and dilettante. I’ve been in most of the states and traveled on every continent. My daughter, Frances, whose face appears on the cover of my novel The Lost Child, graduated from college with a degree in French.  She then accompanied me to France for research on the novel.  I’m retired but continue to work part-time as a personal trainer; I work with interesting clients who give me inspiration, insight, motivation…and pay me for something that I enjoy doing. I have a lot of experience and some imagination, I think, with time now to write. I should have begun long ago, of course, but that’s no reason not to start now. I hope you want to read the complete novel…and the sequel that I’m working on…and a book on aging and fitness. What do you think of Survival of the Fittest or Second Wind as a title?

It rolled off a neural synapse into my\nthought field with the very first hint of the story's premise while I was\nnearing the wrap up of the first draft of La Maga A Story about Sorcerers and\nMagi. Sure, it deals with sex magick, polyamory, bisexuality, and 3-way sex,\nbut, sorry, it is not graphic and not erotica. It's not meant to be. Rather,\nthe themes noted are humanely presented as simple aspects of sexuality within\nrelationships that may be complex.Sexual\nenergy is a powerful tool in mysticism and magick whether the agenda is to\nsublimate or revel in it. A range of ideas inspired the novel. Whereas La Maga\nA Story about Sorcerers and Magi is influenced by my background in Eastern\nspirituality, The Sex Lives of Sorcerers was written while I was exploring\nmedieval philosophical alchemy. As for the heroine of the story, Bellaluna\nDrago, she is a veritable \"scarlet woman,\" to borrow a Thelemic term,\nfacilitating ecstatic spiritual experiences through the engagement of the\nsexual impulse. She developed out of my fascination with mermaids, sirens, and\nfairies as wisdom beings. That stimulus was coupled with a passage about the\nnature of elementals from Gareth Knight's bookA Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism, and, especially, an anecdote\nabout \"fallen\" dakinis related to me by a lama I once studied with.In more\nrarified Buddhist thought, a dakini is a process regarded as a catalyst in the\nenfoldment of spiritual illumination. In more simplistic thinking, it is a\nfeminine wisdom entity and may also refer to a human female adept--a yogini.\nSometimes the term is translated as \"fairy\" or \"muse.\" Sometimes it may be a\ngodform, a feminine ideal, an astral consort. While oddly eyeing me, the lama I had been\nstudying with told a group of us, during one of our discussions that preceded a\nmeditation session, that some women out there in the world were incarnations of\ncelestial beings fallen from grace--fallen dakinis who have forgotten who and\nwhat they really are and are struggling in human life to get back on track.\nWell, I thought this was wildly romantic and it stuck in my mind, inspiring me\nyears later, to develop the character as the center of The Sex Lives of\nSorcerers.", "related": ["B005TWRBK6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was first influenced by associationist psychology as it was expounded by Alexander Bain and Herbert Spencer, the latter often considered the most important individual in the transition from associationist psychology to Darwinian functionalism. In Allen's many articles on flowers and perception in insects, Darwinian arguments replaced the old Spencerian terms. On a personal level, a long friendship that started when Allen met Spencer on his return from Jamaica, also grew uneasy over the years.

In that year he went to California and married Mrs. Osbourne.

He was there to see the good, the bad, the ugly, and the insanely great. His first career was 10 years of raising purebred cattle. Running a large farm far from a safety net provided a great foundation for someone who would survive for so long in the high tech pressure cooker of Apple.  His farm was in Canada north of Fredericton, New Brunswick on the banks of the Tay River in what some would call wilderness.Those first 30 years of David's professional life on the farm and as a Silicon Valley computer soldier forged his character. Life on the farm taught him that who you are is far more important than what you do. How much money one makes is not the measureinlife which matters. How you treat others is far more important than any money one might make. Corporate life reinforced his belief that standing up for what is right is fundamental to any life of value.Beyond that David is greatly influenced by where he now lives and believes that how we treat the coastal marsh is a measure of how much we care for future generations.David spends his life after Apple immersed in the extraordinary natural beauty of North Carolina's Southern Outer Banks.

I live on Sydney's Northern Beaches with my husband and daughter, and despite my dog phobia, with a dog called Skip. I have written all my life especially as a child when I loved to write short stories and poetry. At University I studied Creative Writing as part of my Communication degree. After wards I was busy working in public relations I didn't write for pleasure for quite a few years although I wrote many media releases, brochures and newsletters. (And I still do in my day-job!) When I began to write again I noticed a trend - writing dark unhappy stories made me unhappy. So I made a decision to write a novel with a happy ending and I have been writing happy stories ever since. I began a year-long writing course at the NSW Writers Centre and (thank goodness) its’ members morphed into a writing group known as The Writers’ Dozen. We published a highly successful anthology, Better than Chocolate, in 2008. In 2008 I was also selected for the QWC/Hachette Livre Manuscript Development Course for my novel Mr. Right and Other Mongrels. In 2009 I received a Highly Commended in the Romance Writers of Australia's Valerie Parv Awards for my novel Hearts Afire. These are the first two books I will be e-publishing in 2012. along with a third novel, A Fair Exchange. I'm not really like the characters in my books at all although I do share something in common with each of them - Allegra (Mr. Right and Other Mongrels) has a dog phobia like me, Cassie (Hearts Afire) falls in love on a tropical island and I met my husband that way.

She is well informed, authentic, she likes her work and she is here to tell us, guide us all, on how to handle ourselves professionally. The naturalist, the barber and the photo journalist are important ambassadors of India. They symbolize the concept of professionalism as much as you and I do. Given the right inputs most organizations are either ignorant or ill-equipped they could be well-informed, well rounded, pleasant and in the process, personally way more successful. The book is written lucidly. It should be read by every young professional and I hope that it would be soon translated into regional languages soon so that the message spreads into the hinterland where India is emerging faster than we realize. Go pick up your copy of the book. Gift it to anyone who you think can benefit from it and help make the Indian professional world-class. --Mindtree India Ltd.A rave review of the book by Mr. Abhijit Bhaduri, Chief Learning Officer, Wipro India Shital Kakkar Mehra has brought out a very well written book called Business Etiquette for the Indian Professional. I loved the book. The chapterization is very well thought through. There is stuff on basic hygiene (eg Use a deo, groom yourself well kind of stuff). Then there is stuff on office etiquette how to behave with your colleagues in formal and informal situations. So eat something before you go for a business meal to let the food not distract the conversation. There are etiquette tips on how to behave in public places. When the flight lands, do not whip out your phone instantly and start doing a live broadcast of how you have just landed and that you are still inside the plane etc. I liked the book. It is well written. Shital Kakkar Mehra is one of the most experienced practitioners of corporate etiquette and international protocol in India today, having trained over three thousand executives, focusing on the specific requirements of the global Indian. She has been doing a column on etiquette for The Economic Times newspaper. So I would highly recommend that you read the book. I loved it. --Blog ReviewsAtul Kumar Thakur Journalist & Mentor at Entrepreneurial Development Initiative-CII I have been reading Shital Kakkar Mehra's columns on business etiquette in Economic Times/Corporate Dossier for years and one morning was cheered to found her on my blog's followers list :).Her book Business Etiquette deserves to be read by all aspiring/established folk in corporate world, who either lacks collective demeanour or know it little...and by also who wants to confirm their actual hold on behavioral action. --Blog ReviewsA rave review of the book by Mr. Abhijit Bhaduri, Chief Learning Officer, Wipro India Shital Kakkar Mehra has brought out a very well written book called Business Etiquette for the Indian Professional.

I've lived in multiple cities, many abodes. My current home marks the longest I've stayed put: 9 years, and I'm itching to move along. My most important occupation has been as mother of boy-girl twins (now grown into extraordinary individuals). But I’ve had numerous jobs and several careers. Babysitter, dog walker, duck caretaker. Switchboard operator, bank lackey, secretary, clerk, substitute teacher, bookkeeper, bureaucrat. Motion picture story analyst, low-budget TV producer. Research internship director. Earthquake consultant. Professor. Disaster scientist.   Even my school transcripts proceed in multiple directions. I've got majors in computer science, earth science, and film studies; minors in linguistics and Irish history.  From back when my age was one digit, I've had a single calling. Writing. I haven't always written but I've always known myself to be a writer. I dabbled with short stories and screenplays, but those weren't right for me. My first novel, Headliners, a character study about rock fans, earned a lot of love it, but... from publishers.  I look forward to self-publishing it soon and at last.  Bantam-Doubleday-Dell gave me an advance on my second novel, a psychological thriller, Was It A Rat I Saw, published in hardcover, 1992.  It felt fantastic to live on writing income and yet it was nearly two decades before I sat down to complete a third novel, Scar Jewelry, a work of literary fiction built on experience and understanding gained during my writing hiatus. My next novel will be the first in a fantasy detective series. I like to read and hike; to visit the ocean and new cities; and above all to get out to hear live music.  I have too many animals and expect I always will.", "related": [], "rank": 3546019, "title": "C.R.I.M.E.

For the past 11 years my wife and I have been living on our sailing yacht ‘Grey Glider’ in the Mediterranean travelling through Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey where the yacht is now based. At one point I owned a six seat twin engine plane and qualified as a multi-engine pilot and qualified to fly on instruments. I took up writing after being less than impressed and frankly disappointed with books bought in airports. I like to include some humour in my writing and prefer adventure thriller story lines. My work and my travels have provided wide and varied access to some remarkable and interesting places and situations. This has been one of the main sources for the ideas in my writing.

Alexander was one of those far right conservative Christians. A.F. Alexander was born and raised in Colorado.

She graduated from a church sponsored Bible Institute, worked as a part time church secretary in her spare time, was a Sunday School teacher for approximately eight years, and wrote for a monthly church publication. She left the movement, after a few decades of ardent involvement, over the position that women should stay with abusive husbands. Four years, and over sixty reference books later (we aren't even touching on the number of articles), she had systematically presented the Religious Right agenda. \"There are a couple of major themes and players that clearly stood out as I researched and pieced their agenda together.  One theme that I found very disturbing was the intentional move towards a government and culture solely established upon an extremist view of the Bible, essentially a theocracy, and a deliberate move away from any consent of the governed. I felt that deserved to be spotlighted and brought to every citizen's attention.\" She holds a BSBA degree, as well as a Bachelor of Arts in Sacred Theology.

I had so many ideas that I wanted to try out that I didn't want to settle in just one genre.  So in June 2012 I accepted the challenge to try to write 100 first drafts in 5 years, or a draft every 2 weeks.  Since then I've had some successful drafts and some not so successful ones. I've had to take a break while I went back to work full time for a few months, and also put new drafts on hold while I polished and published old drafts. But overall, I've had an amazingly fun time.  I know that I've broken one of the fundamental rules of building an audience; write in the same genre. However, as my drafts come to fruition, I can guarantee that each one will be a good read, even if it's different every time.  So why not explore the world of 100 First Drafts?", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Martin wrote her first novel at age 15 in 2005.  The first manuscript was motivated by a request of her grandmother, and Martin read the book to her grandmother, chapter by chapter, until it was complete.  Her grandmother put it best when she said, \"Keep on writing.  I might as well tell you to keep on breathing.\" (Anna Mae Wilson, 1936-2010). Since then, she has completed 9 novels.  At age 16, Martin earned the honor of participating in Kentucky's Governor's School for the Arts in Creative Writing.  That same year, a theatrical adaptation of her first novel manuscript was produced.  She also completed her second novel.  Her third novel was finished at age 17, and the fourth at age 18 during her first semester in undergraduate study.  In October 2009, Martin finished the first draft of Ember. After the enthusiastic reception of readers, Martin decided to introduce Ember to the world in 2011. After 3 years at the University of Kentucky, Martin graduated in May 2011 with a B.A. in Communication (Corporate Business) and English. She plans to promote her writing and produce more books, from sequels in the Ember Series and other novels such as the upcoming Gift of Saturn Series. Martin has works that branches into multiple genres, from literary to fantasy and beyond. Follow E.E.

Having retired after quite a few years, I can now dedicate my time to my love of reading and now hopefully also to creating stories. Stories that will take you, the reader, away on the wings of my imagination to wondrous places. EAGLE Kinght is the second book in the Eagle Series.  I enjoy writing historical fiction but I do tend to adapt history to work around my plots, that makes it more exciting I think. You never know what will happen next!  Set in medieval times, it tells the story of a young knight who sets out on a journey that will transform his life. The bygone days of Kings, Queens, Lords and Knights will come alive in this beautiful tale of adventure and romance.

Like the other Lestrade books (Brigade, etc.), this one is permeated with sharp historical detail, delightful humor and wordplay, plus a large gallery of characters. Among its players are, of course, Sherlock Holmes (\"The epitome of a man inches from neurosis\") and Dr. Watson (\"with the unmistakable stoop of a man who had been hit by a jezail\"), who provide no small amount of comic relief. Lestrade's patience and expertise are tested to the fullest when he inherits the men and caseload of a recently deceased inspector. Continuing those cases takes him to Rhadegund Hall, a public school where, by chance, young, pregnant Maggie Hollis is discovered drowned in a laundry tub. That night, back in London, the mutilated body of Mary Ann Nichols, the first of the Whitechapel murder victims, is found. Soon, Lestrade is investigating the Ripper murders as well as the rising body count at Rhadegund Hall, and in doing so the long-suffering inspector must contend with both the incompetence of his superiors (who destroy vital evidence) and the quirks of the school's masters. Despite the distractions of an attractive matron and interference from Holmes, Lestrade perseveres to the endAas will grateful readers.

For if you're not happy with the 'effects' or results of your existing marketing efforts or if you are dissatisfied with your current set of circumstances, then you need to examine the root cause. You need to examine your attitudes, beliefs, & intentions of you, your marketing & what it is that you really want to achieve and can 'offer' in helping others achieve their objectives so you can achieve yours. There are some core, fundamental principles that many do not know, recognise or apply with their marketing, and I share them to help the reader get a greater understanding of who they are, what they offer, and the problems they can solve for others.I hope it challenges your existing thinking and gets you planning and doing in a new direction.\"Fraser J.

I’ve lived in many places and enjoyed a wide range of experiences in my life.  I learned to shoot at 8 years old. I’ve hunted deer and when shot at by another hunter, decided on another hobby. I’ve  fished in fresh water and on the ocean. Fish don’t shoot back!  I’ve worked on a farm, herded cows on horseback, chopped cotton, stomped silage, bucked hay bales, plowed fields, and milked cows. I played football, basketball, and went out for track. I liked school despite being bored much of the time.  I finished college on my timeline, adding the electives of getting drunk, experiencing hangovers, and chasing young women. I was tested, ‘short armed’ in El Paso, Texas and rejected for flat feet. Eventually I became a school teacher. I completed a master’s degree, got married (45 years), bought and sold property, raised 3 kids, supported dogs, cats, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, a goat, pigs, horses and cows. I have felled big trees, cleared land, and built fences. I have built different kinds of farm structures.   I’ve traveled across twelve of the western states and lived in six of them. I’ve been an archer, a skier, sailed a boat, and paddled my own canoe. I’ve been a smoker and a drinker. I quit smoking but enjoy a glass of wine now and then. I’ve been in more churches than Carter has pills, studied religions, and been “saved” via sprinkle, splash, and dunk.  Well, I got wet anyway.

His first word was, “Uzbekistan.” Throughout his childhood, Jeremy had a hard time making friends. When other kids wanted to play baseball, he wanted to instruct them about Henry VIII’s six wives. After a failed career as a standup comic and broadcaster, in 2000 Jeremy fittingly became a Social Studies teacher.

One of our elders asked me, “Do you have something for me to read that might be helpful and that I can give to my sister who just lost her fourteen year old son?” I had a difficult time to come up with something I thought might be helpful other than the Bible. It was then I realized that not much has been written on the subject in recent years from a thoroughly biblical perspective. Therefore I set out to write a twenty page pamphlet but ended up with a book. One of my daughters, who has two masters degrees from Columbia University in psychology and who has had experience with taking care of a child who died from brain cancer, took a very active interest in the book. I consider her involvement indispensable as she brought a woman’s sensitive perspective on the subject. Some who have read the book have commented on how they appreciate the wisdom and sensitivity expressed throughout. As a pastor of forty years I have had to deal with the death of loved ones on a regular basis. Often I am asked, “What can I read on that would be helpful in dealing with such loss?” I believe this book meets the need of those with such a burning question. Lars Wilhelmsson writes with 40 years of pastoral experience and has worked with and counseled many singles and couples who have suffered the loss of a loved one. He has pastored churches in California, Minnesota and Connecticut and has authored seven books and numerous articles for Christian periodicals. He is part time professor at Alliance Theological Seminary, Nyack, N.Y. and he has taught as adjunct professor in various institutions of higher learning including Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, CA, where he received a master’s degree and doctorate in historical and practical theology.  He has been a regular lecturer and preacher in Lima, Peru, for the past 20 years and has been involved in humanitarian relief work in Cuba for several years. Lars and his wife Nancy have five children and four grandchildren.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Driven to Nicaragua twice in my life.  Also, I've driven all around the U.S.  Skateparks of the Northwest are incredible, it is a world of its own up there. Concrete Skatepark Design and Construction is a deep passion and something I've had to mainly walk away from. Thankfully, I can still skateboard to this day, although only when I can manage the heat and also the energy level/s needed. Very much I am a loner, Narcolepsy with Cataplexy has a real impact on life. Such is not an excuse, it is the lifestyle reality that I must live by, and with. For me, participation is hard.  Dreaming, caring and thinking, is not. Tacos are delicious and I eat them frequently! Cooking is something that I do daily, to some extent. With so many allergies, it is all that I can do to steer clear of pains and problems. Gluten Free, Dairy Free and eating as organic/local as possible; is how I do it, with a lot of herbs and Indian spices. 'Lifestyle Adjustments' are what has brought me 'the most of any' actual benefit, for my health. 'Skateboarding could not have better prepared me for, and/or helped me adjust to, living with Cataplexy.' Some of what I may work on for the future: - A memoirs book (or some series of some of the stories). - A book diving into how skateboarding has been one of the best things in life for me (specifically in relation Cataplexy); nothing, besides my Mother, has taught me more. - A 'Lifestyle Adjustments for Narcolepsy with Cataplexy' book.  Diving into specifically what has helped me; Diet, Sleep Hygiene, Exercise/s, Understanding, the fine-tuning, acceptance, attentiveness, juggling, observing, self-reflecting, etc... - A cookbook (or series of) of recipes that I use often, and the methods of how I cook such. - It's possible I'll at some point make some skateboarding related book/s too.  For instance on Skateparks, styles, terrain, the regions, D.I.Y., Design/Build process/benefits, design and construction techniques/tools/qualities/criteria, and possibly even going into industry related things.

He's a storyteller who places his readers in action-filled\nmoments. It's in these creative spaces that readers are allowed to get to know\nhis complex characters as if they're really alive.Most of Blake's titles\nare centered in the South, in urban settings, that are often overlooked by the\nmainstream. But through Blake's eyes, readers quickly learn that places like\nCharlotte, NC can be as gritty as they come. It's in these streets of this oft\noverlooked world where Blake portrays murderers and thieves alike as believable\ncharacters. Without judgment, he weaves humanizing back stories that serve up\ncompelling reasons for why a drug dealer might choose a life of crime. Readers of his work, speak\nof the roller coaster ride of emotions that ensues from feeling anger at\nempathetic characters who always seem to do the wrong thing at the right time, to\nkeep the story moving forward. In terms of setting, Blake's\nstories introduce his readers to spaces they may or may not be used to -\nstreetscapes with unkept, cracked sidewalks where poverty prevails, times are\ndepressed and people are broke and desperate. In Blake storytelling space,\nmorality is so curved that rooting for bad guys to get away with murder can\nsometimes seem like the right thing for the reader to do - even when it's not. Readers who connect with\nBlake find him to be relatable. Likening him to a bad-boy gone good, they see a\nstoryteller who writes as if he's lived in the world's he generously shares,\nreadily conveying his message that humanity is everywhere, especially in the\nunlikely, mean streets of cities like Charlotte.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 47, "rating_average": 4.8511, "rating_total": 228.0}

A mother of two, Michelle-Lyn told them bedtime stories mainly about her childhood adventures. The idea for publishing first came about when she created short stories for two friends that attended the early childhood care education program at the University of Trinidad and Tobago Open Campus.  Before deciding on becoming an author of children’s books, Michelle-Lyn like many of us had an employment history that was diverse.  She has pursued careers in graphic arts and even worked with one of the major Oil & Gas Company’s based in Trinidad. Agouti-mush is the first book to be published by this young and upcoming author, the by-product of her exciting childhood escapades.

As a highly developed seer, he based his work on direct knowledge and perception of spiritual dimensions. He initiated a modern and universal 'science of spirit', accessible to anyone willing to exercise clear and unprejudiced thinking.  From his spiritual investigations Steiner provided suggestions for the renewal of many activities, including education (both general and special), agriculture, medicine, economics, architecture, science, philosophy, religion and the arts. Today there are thousands of schools, clinics, farms and other organizations involved in practical work based on his principles. His many published works feature his research into the spiritual nature of the human being, the evolution of the world and humanity, and methods of personal development. Steiner wrote some 30 books and delivered over 6000 lectures across Europe. In 1924 he founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This is what Bill wrote in his letter to the first get- together of the VSO teachers at Pateley Bridge, North Yorkshire 1-3 August 2003, \"...Labrador called to you and we are calling you now. I hope you will do what you can during these few days to fill in the Labrador record with your recollections and reflections. This too will be an important contribution to Labrador history. But mainly I hope you enjoy your time together. Llewelyn Pritchard has done a remarkable job in bringing you together. He is as shrewd as Holmes and as persistent as Poirot. He could even be a great Canadian! We owe him more than we can say. It's his event and I know it will be successful. All good wishes. Bill Rompkey\" Interview with Llewelyn Pritchard: Where did you grow up, and how did this influence your writing? I grew up on the Black Mountain north of Swansea, South Wales. I haven't really got a clue how this influenced my writing except I suppose it instilled in me a great love of nature, adventure and the outdoors. I am the son of an elite collier and I would much rather take this opportunity to dedicate this great poem to his memory: \"My father was a miner, He worked deep underground; The rush of drams and clanking chains. They were his daily sounds. He worked so far below the ground. Where coal was hewed by pick,  The work so hard and wages small He didn’t dare go sick. He crawled upon his belly. In drifts so low and narrow, The wind it whistled down the shaft. It chilled him to the marrow. He ate his food from a Tommy box, Shaped like a slice of bread, While squatting down upon the ground, Where spit and crumbs were shed. His water, it was in a Jack, to wet down clouds of dust, That gathered daily in his throat and lungs. Where it formed a deadly crust. We would listen for his footsteps, He then came into sight: This man, our Dad, as black as black, just like the darkest night; Right down his back white rivers ran amongst the dirt and grime, But you cannot wash away blue scars. That you get down the mine. Years now have passed. My father gone, But I am proud to say, My Father was a miner, until his dying day.” by William Holden", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 2008, Tori returned to writing and finished her first novel. She wrote a third of that novel on her smartphone during lunches and breaks at work. It took awhile before Tori considered her writing to be anything more than a hobby, but by then she had finished a few books.  Writing taught her to appreciate the mischief her teenagers stir up, that the characters in her head fight back, and that she misses Seattle. Life is still teaching her that her children will grow out of it, and she can visit Seattle occasionally. She’s still looking for a solution on how to deal with her characters.

Harden was born in a small town in Michigan.

Fast forward more than fifteen years later, after graduating high school and moving to San Antonio, Texas; Timothy is currently attending college part time and working full time at a call center. He married a Texas girl by the name of Brenda back in 4/16/2011.

Timothy’s first novel is dedicated to his lovely wife and his hard working family in Michigan for all their inspiration and support over the years. Be on the lookout for future books from Timothy M.

{"asin": "B00J3YYRS0", "price": -1, "imUrl": "", "description": "We promise to be real men willing to be honest about our experience of manhood.We promise to tell the truth. If we’re sharing our opinions, we’ll give you truthful honest opinions. If we’re trying to communicate truth about God, we’ll make sure it lines up with the final authority: scripture. When we talk about culture, we’ll fearlessly expose the harmful trends without deliberately creating bogeymen just to have something to joust. We’ll call it like we see it, even when it isn’t going to make us any friends. We promise not to give positive reviews to crappy books, movies, cigars, music or beers.We promise to respect your mind. We will elevate the conversation beyond trivial clichés and disingenuous niceties. Children’s devotionals are great for kids; but we’re not going to waste your time by agreeing with the culture that tells you you’re a simplistic goof. You are more than flannel board, and our enemies aren’t smiling, one-dimensional cut outs. We will speak deeply about heavy, hard truths.We promise to deal authentically with the heart. Men absolutely do – AND MUST – process heart issues differently than women. It’s one of our major gripes with the man-ambivalent church; they assume that men and women process and relate to emotions similarly. So, we’re going to create a place for manly passions. We’re going to nurture the fire smoldering inside of you; the hot, holy heat of battle waiting for a cause. We’re also going to deal honestly with the reality than many of us are harboring some pretty raw spots, and none of us scar-less. This world is hard on the heart of a man. We’re acknowledge it, and we’re going to deal with it – like men.We promise to respect your innate desire for movement, for action. There’s a kinetic element to a man. Culture says, “calm down, sit still, be quiet.” We abhor those voices. We know you were made to work, train, move, fight, wrestle, build and explore. You were made to move. We will support that by pushing you to move when you feel lazy, by challenging you to move in purposeful ways, by pointing you to battlefields that could use reinforcements. And, when we can, we’ll hit the trail with you.We promise not to take ourselves too seriously. A commenter earlier this week said something that resonated strongly with me. He said, “I will never understand… the need to turn every mundane activity into a devotion.” I agree. Surely, we won’t assume God can’t or won’t speak to us through mundane happenings; we’re open to that and sincerely desire not to miss Him in those moments. But it’s exhausting. Concluding every moment with a devotional reflection, group discussion, prayer circle or parting challenge – it’s heavy handed and steals the life from those real moments AND those devotional moments. We’re going to have some fun. We’re going to kick back. We’re going to enjoy just being dudes.But…We promise to be excellent. We are raising the bar for ourselves. We will not tolerate anything less than our best efforts. We’re going to honor the perspective, experience, skill, and personality of every member of the team, but we’re going to demand they honor themselves and you by giving the best they’ve got. We’ve beefed up our editorial presence, standards and procedures. We’ve got a good team of great men. We’re going to work together to build each other up and develop our craft. Excellence is a must if we’re going to have any credibility.Finally, we promise to remain flexible and innovative. We’re going to regularly evaluate our efforts and your feedback to make sure we’re living up to the obligations of this platform. We’re going to dream new ways to work with you to win the war raging all around us. We’re going to roll out new ideas and opportunities as often as we can do them with excellence and honesty.Kindle blogs are fully downloaded onto your Kindle so you can read them even when you're not wirelessly connected.
