He describes nine dramatic moments from baseball's historical past, featuring the likes of Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Reggie Jackson, and Jim Abbott. These accounts depict the courageous aspects as well as the spectacular, including Dave Dravecky's comeback after cancer surgery, and the hobbled Kirk Gibson's game-winning home run in the 1988 World Series. Christopher tends to drift to his fictional roots as a number of the stories are laced with manufactured feelings, thoughts, and quotes. He also tends to generalize: \"As the crowd in Fenway Park watched Ted Williams run off the field for the last time, they told each other, 'There goes the greatest hitter that ever lived.' \" While his portrayals of these moments are basically accurate, the sidelights he adds without documentation have him walking a fine line between fact and fiction. While Christopher's legions of young fans will enjoy the book, a more straightforward account of memorable events in America's pastime can be found in Geoffrey Ward's 25 Great Moments in Baseball (Knopf, 1994), which is based on Ken Burns's public-television series, Baseball, the American Epic.?Tom S.

A body will be found later today. I want you to be the first to know. I think you may enjoy looking into this death.\"\"Are you telling me someone has died?\"\"I don't believe I said that.\"My heart did something crazy. \"Ma'am, is someone about to die?\"\"I don't think I said that either.\"\"You--you aren't doing anything to harm yourself, are you?\" I was trying to figure out how I could alert the police while keeping this woman on the line when I had only one telephone in my home.\"Let me repeat what I said, Mrs. Brooks: A body will be found later today. I'm not saying where it will be found or whose body it will be--whose body it is,\" she corrected herself.\"Who is this, please?\"\"Mrs. Brooks, you are wasting your time and mine. I have things to do. I simply wanted to give you a heads-up, and you're making it very difficult for me. Today is my twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. I remember how happy--and beautiful--I was as a bride. I remember how handsome and strong and loving my fiance was--my husband by the end of the day. Sadly, all things end.\"\"Please,\" I said, feeling panicky. \"Don't do anything you'll regret. Don't--\"\"I assure you I have no regrets. I just wanted to say thank you for listening to me and to tell you--\" She stopped.\"Yes?\" I said anxiously.\"And to tell you--Just a moment.\"I thought I heard another voice and then the sound was muffled. \"Hello?\" I said. \"Are you still there?\"There was a sound, loud and explosive. \"Hello?\" I said again.The phone on the other end clattered to the floor or onto a table, and a few seconds later, as I shouted frantically into my phone, a dial tone pierced the silence. A chill passed through my body. Reverting to my oldest instincts, I crossed myself. Then, without hanging up, I put the phone down on the kitchen counter, grabbed my bag and keys, and ran out to the car.\"Just try to stay calm, Mrs. Brooks,\" the police officer said.I had made for the Oakwood police station as fast as I dared. They knew me because Jack, my husband, is an NYPD detective lieutenant, and he has pals among the Oakwood police. I appreciated the uniformed officer trying to calm me, but it did no good. I was nearly in tears, less coherent than my usual fairly calm demeanor, and certain that I had witnessed a shooting over the phone.\"I'm fine. Please listen to me. Something terrible has just happened. Can you trace a call if the caller has hung up?\"\"Possibly, but it depends on the circumstances. Would you start from the beginning and tell me what happened?\"I told him about the phone call, the female voice, as much of the conversation as I could recall. \"And then there was another voice.\"\"On the phone?\"\"No,\" I said with irritation. \"There was another person on the woman's end of the call.\"\"Man or woman?\"\"I think a man. I didn't hear anything clearly. But she stopped talking to me and started talking to him.\"\"And then?\"\"And then,\" I said, swallowing, \"there was an explosion--a gunshot, I think. And the phone fell. And then a dial tone came on the line.\"\"Sounds like a prank to me.\"\"Officer, please. She said a body would be found. I wasn't talking to a child. This was an adult woman. Oh yes, she said today was her wedding anniversary. Her twenty-fifth, I think she said. That would make her forty-five, give or take. I don't think this was a prank.\"\"We'll look into it.\"I don't want to say he was lying to me, but I felt he was placating me, not addressing me as an equal. \"I left my phone off the hook,\" I said urgently. \"Is there something you can do right now to find out where the call came from?\"\"Oh, you did?\" He sounded almost joyous. \"Wait here a minute.\"I stood in front of the classic high counter and watched him disappear into an adjoining room. I looked at my watch. At least fifteen minutes had elapsed since I put the phone down in my kitchen, since the gunshot rang in my ears. If someone was lying wounded in a house here in town, we could save him if we got there soon enough. Three long minutes passed. I was alone in the outer office of the Oakwood police station.The phone rang, startling me. Someone inside must have picked it up as it stopped in the middle of the second ring. Come on, I thought. Do something.The officer returned, a man in civilian clothes behind him. \"This is Detective Palermo,\" the officer said. \"Mrs. Brooks. Her husband is Lieutenant Brooks of the NYPD.\"\"A pleasure to meet you. I've met your husband. Jack, isn't it?\"\"Yes. Will you try to trace the call?\" I was in no mood for chitchat.\"Let's go back to your house and see what we can do. I'll follow.\"I dashed out to my car, hoping he would move quickly. His car was parked closer to the building and he waited until I had turned into the street before he pulled out of his space. Less than five minutes later I was unlocking my front door.\"I just put it down without breaking the connection,\" I said, handing him the phone, which was making unpleasant noises.\"That was the right thing to do. You can dial a code to get the number of the last call made to this number. If you'd hung up and someone else had called while you were out, that's the number we'd get. This way we'll get the number of your strange caller.\"I was relieved I had done the right thing. He took the phone, broke the connection, then turned it on again and dialed a few digits. He had taken a pen and a small notebook out of his pocket, and he wrote down a phone number as I watched. Then he dialed it.He must have listened to twenty rings or more before he hung up. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"No one answers.\"\"Can you get an address?\" I knew I was sounding pushy but I was certain that someone was lying dead or was dying in that house, and it was his job to find them.\"Give me a minute. Why don't you sit down and relax, Mrs. Brooks. We'll get to the bottom of this.\"I was too keyed up to relax, whether sitting or standing. I walked away from him and stood at the entrance to our family room, looking away. He punched in a number, identified himself as a police detective, and asked for information on the number he had written down. It didn't take long.\"OK,\" he said, sounding more casual than I felt. \"I've got an address. I'll be on my way and I'll let you know what happens.\"\"I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to follow you in my car. The woman who called said she knew who I was, but I didn't recognize the voice. I'd really like to know what's going on.\"\"Sure,\" he said, and we went out to our respective cars.He knew where we were going; I didn't. I hadn't even asked if it was a great distance away. My son would be home from school in an hour and a half, and I had to be here or make a quick phone call to find someone to meet him. I kept the radio off in my car so I wouldn't be distracted and stayed close behind Detective Palermo. He signaled every turn so it was easy to keep him in sight.I had been surprised when the officer introduced this man as a detective. Oakwood isn't a very big town, and I wasn't aware we even had detectives in the police department. It occurred to me that we might share his services with a neighboring town. Oakwood isn't the kind of community that has a homicide more often than once every several years, although there are occasional break-ins and young people have been known to get in trouble. It was hardly enough to keep a full-time detective busy, but it was comforting to know that someone with that kind of training was available when we needed him.He stopped at the curb in front of a group of attractive garden apartments and got out of his car. I parked behind him and then joined him at a door.\"It's upstairs,\" he said. \"Two B.\"I followed him up and stood nearby while he rang the doorbell. When no one responded, he banged on the door.\"Looks like no one's home. Let's see if there's a neighbor.\"The woman in 2A answered quickly, and Detective Palermo asked her about the occupants of the apartment across the hall.She shrugged and looked unconcerned. She was an older woman, probably in her sixties, dressed in a cotton skirt and blouse, her hair half dark, half gray, and cut short. \"The Mitchells. I haven't seen them for a while.\"The name didn't ring a bell.\"You know where they are?\" Detective Palermo asked.\"I'm not friendly with them. They complained about things, and I thought it was better to let them go their way and I would go mine.\"\"How many people live in their apartment?\"\"I never see them come and go. More than one, I'm sure of that. A woman, maybe, I don't know, fifty. A man. Maybe two men. I guess they're a family.\"The detec...", "related": ["B009YAVVAU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bronwyn and ten-year-old Wesley rode in the front of an ancient Toyota truck— no air-conditioning—and it was broiling. Bronwyn's straight dark red hair blew dankly around her face, her skin stuck to her khaki slacks and the ripped vinyl upholstery, and Wesley was crying.He was crying about Ari of course. Because Ari was dead. The only father Wesley had ever known had been in prison for his involvement with a crime syndicate. He'd been murdered in prison.Sweltering, and certain the Vietnamese driver of the Toyota had emigrated too recently to have much English, Bronwyn spoke freely. \"Please don't waste another tear on him, Wesley,\" she told him, which wasn't something she would have said if her once-white blouse hadn't been pasted to her body with sweat, if they hadn't spent almost an hour crawling behind another ute on the winding road with no chance to overtake. Instead, she couldn't restrain the impulse to tell her only son not to mourn Aristotle. \"In fact,\" she added, \"it's his fault we're in this fix. It's his fault you have to move away from your friends and go to a new school.\" Once again, nothing she'd have said most days.She spared a look at the tearful boy and past him to the driver. Mr. Le at the Asian market in Sydney had found this man for her and imparted the information that his name was Nam and he would drive the three hours to the Hunter Valley, her destination. Wesley sat wedged in the middle of the front seat between Bronwyn and Nam, head down. His hair was lighter than Ari's and without even a hint of Bronwyn's auburn. Nor were his eyes like Ari's dark chocolate ones; they were hazel, not Bronwyn's green.Just those wild recessive genes, Ari.Yes.Wesley held his soccer ball in his lap. He wore his shin guards and cleats and a child-size Socceroos jersey. He had others, as well, other teams, other countries. His dream was to be a professional soccer player. Better than a footballer, in Bronwyn's opinion, even if Ari had owned a football team. Wesley had picked up the soccer thing from Ari, who had bought him a child-size Manchester United uniform. In any case, Bronwyn had never wanted to discourage her son's dreams and now regretted that he was going to have to experience practicality the hard way. Not as hard as the wayshe'dlearned as a child, though.\"And,\" she continued, forgetting that she'd meant to comfort him, \"your last name is Davies.\"\"It's not.\" He spoke under his breath, but Bronwyn heard.\"Look, Wesley,\" she burst out. \"I know this isn't fun, but we're going to a place full of people who are probably willing to die for their horses, and I'd rather not share the last name of a man who is known to have been involved with doping them.\"\"What does doping mean?\"\"Giving them drugs. So they'll lose or win or—I don't know. But Idoknow that the name Theodoros is not going to be a passport to anyone's friendship at Fairchild Acres.\"Wesley bounced his soccer ball on his knee, and Bronwyn put her hand on top of it. \"Don't do that. You'll cause an accident.\"\"Daddy doesn't have anything to do with the horses at the racetrack. He told me.\"\"Yes, well, I don't mean it was him personally, and that's only one aspect of his business. Ari was a criminal. He stole money, he cheated the government and he was involved in a lot of unpleasant things you don't need to know about.\" Bronwyn sincerely hoped Wesley would give up his hero worship of Ari without further examples of his perfidy. If it had been possible, she would have made a priority of protecting her son's image of the man he regarded as father.However, there had been too many explanations to make. How they had lost their home, cars, planes, bank accounts as law enforcement officials tried to untangle the web of criminal activity in which Ari had been involved. She didn't hate Ari. She didn't mourn him, either. Not now. She hadn't the leisure. Leisure was gone, replaced with indigence.And she'd sworn she would never be poor again.Well, the joke was on her, but she'd grown up learning to survive on nothing. If she was angry now it was at herself for ever depending on anyone but Bronwyn Davies.Now she was back to her maiden name but with complications she'd never had before she was married. Ari was dead, and Bronwyn Davies was glad for the simplification that offered in her own life. She was no longer married, need not obtain a divorce. Which was good. She barely had money to feed herself and her ten-year-old son. She did not have money for attorneys, for messy court battles. When Ari had first been arrested weeks earlier, she'd never considered divorce. In sickness, in health, in deceit and all that. But she'd grown tired of trying to offer Wesley meaningful explanations for things she would never understand:Why is my father a criminal? Why did he do bad things?Just the thought of these questions made her tired.I can't think about Ari. I can't think about some lag sticking him in prison. I can't think about his face. Too many lies, not all of them his.\"I'm sorry, Wesley. I know you hate this, but you've got to trust me. This is how we need to keep ourselves safe. I know you love Ari—\" the wordsyour fatherdefinitely stuck in her throat \"—and that's fine, but we have to be practical.\"\"We have to lie,\" Wesley clarified.Bronwyn wanted to swear. Nowshewas providing the duplicitous example. Also, it alarmed her how rapidly Wesley was becoming a cynic. It was one thing for her to be cynical; she had grown up sometimes literally homeless in Sydney because of poverty and had just discovered after ten-plus years of marriage that her husband's actual job description was \"gangster.\" It was different when the cynic was Wesley, who was such a brave kid, ultimately, who wasn't a whiner or a crybaby.\"This is going to be an adventure,\" she told him. \"You'll like it.\"Bronwyn could have said,What would your dad think if he saw you crying?That would have stopped those tears in their tracks. Because, of course, Aristotle Theodoros had not tolerated tears in his male child. The child he'd believed to be his flesh and blood.Well, Bronwyn had been repaid for her own deception now. Touché and all that. Which, after all, was the bigger marital betrayal? Maintaining a double life as a mobster or telling your husband that he was the father of a child who, even at birth, looked eerily like Patrick Stafford? A child whowasPatrick Stafford's son, not Aristotle Theodoros's.Then, Bronwyn spotted the first of the white fences and long green fields. Horse country, the Hunter Valley, home of Fairchild Acres, home of Louisa Fairchild and current residence of her great-nephew, Patrick Stafford.\"Wesley, look at the horses. Look how beautiful it is here. You'll see. You'll like living out here. Look at all that grass.\" She cast a meaningful glance at his soccer ball, though she had no idea if her son would be allowed to play on the grass.Beside her, Wesley said, for at least the tenth time that day, \"I don't like horses.\"Patrick Stafford gazed out the French doors of Louisa Fairchild's blue brick Colonial house. Most of the homes in the valley were lowset, but not Fairchild Acres. The sprawling, graceful homestead was very different from the penthouse apartment where he'd grown up in Sydney with his parents. They had been stockbrokers, and Patrick had vowed to do somethingmore meaningful with his life. Yet he'd ended up…a stockbroker. That was all right. He'd lost some romantic ideals along the way, become more pragmatic in general, and he was glad to be able to help people with their finances, as he was helping Louisa.\"Patrick, are you listening to me?\" his great-aunt said now.\"Yes, yes.\" Of course he was. When he'd first come to Fairchild Acres a month earlier, he'd been keen to confront Louisa, to demand answers; he'd wanted to know why she'd mistreated her sister, his grandmother. But gradually, he'd grown to love this elderly woman, as had his sister, Megan. When Louisa had been accused of murdering Sam Whittleson, he'd been outraged. An eighty-year-old woman kill a man she knew, a neighbor? He hadn't believed it. And Louisa had been proven innocent, though the stress of her arrest had sent her into cardiac arrest, something she was quicker to forgive than he was.His sister, Megan, now planned to spend her life with the arresting officer, Dylan Hastings. Yes, Patrick saw that both Dylan's own misconceptions about Louisa and the orders of his superiors had led to his persecution of the older woman. But still! And now Megan was living with Dylan and his daughter and was planning to open a gallery and artists' retreat.So his own struggle was to release the last of his anger over offenses against Louisa that she herself had already forgiven.In any case, this morning he had other preoccupations. While ordinarily he was the most attentive of listeners, today he kept thinking of the morning's news. Just a recap of the events of the past month. Aristotle Theodoros had been murdered in prison two weeks earlier, and speculation was rife that he'd been killed to prevent him testifying against the Syndicate.It had nothing to do with Patrick—not really. He'd met Ari briefly once, after Bronwyn had told Patrick of her engagement. It seemed a hundred years ago now. To Patrick, Ari had been the man Bronwyn chose over him. The man whose money she'd chosen over his lack thereof, no matter what else she'd claimed. Her rejection had put an end to his plans to do some graduate work in history, some writing, nebulous dreams.He realized now he'd never been a writer.He'd been born with his parents' fine-tuned instincts for the stock market. They'd died when he was eighteen, but they'd left him and Megan comfortable. His university goals had reflected that ease, he supposed. It had taken a shallow woman's ridiculing his dreams to make him see his own future clearly.Well,herscertainly hadn't worked out.

Lipton takes on a great, complex, and contentious topic, land reform, and does justice to this huge topic. He delves deeply and widely, producing a text that is remarkable in its scope, insights, and historical knowledge. He never fears to point out the true complexities of topics that are all too often over-simplified. Lipton's work is also extremely timely, as the world turns its attention once again to smallholder agriculture after decades or relative neglect. Scholars, students, and policy makers in all parts of the world will turn to this new study with enormous benefit and with gratitude to Lipton for his remarkable efforts'. - Jeffrey D. Sachs, Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University; Special Advisor to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon on the Millennium Development Goals. 'Land reform can make a huge contribution in removing poverty, but it has not been effectively tried in many areas of the world. The story has to be finished, and in this important book one of the foremost development economists tells us why and how'. - Amartya Sen, Lamont Professor of Economics and Philosophy, Harvard University; Nobel prizewinner in economics 'A compelling case is made about the need to refocus on agricultural growth as the engine to reduce rural poverty. Improving access to land will ensure that the benefits of agricultural technical change reach many millions of rural poor. Professor Michael Lipton is a world renowned authority on these issues. His decades of research experience, distilled in the book, offer compelling, insightful and timely solutions which are critical in addressing the global food crisis'. - Akin Adesina, Vice President, Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa 'Michael Lipton (pinching from Mark Twain) convincingly states that 'Reports of land reform's death are greatly exaggerated'. He takes the reader on a developing-world tour and shows tremendous dynamics in land reforms. Land reform is neither dead nor dying. As land (with access to water) becomes more scarce, land values increase as a consequence. Farms in many regions of the developing world actually become smaller -mostly for good economic reasons- and the need for efficient institutional change related to land remains strong. This book gives guidance for sound policy and offers unique opportunities for learning about land reform across time and locations. It is a must for development scholars!' - Joachim von Braun, Director, International Food Policy Research Institute 'Land reform has had a rollercoaster ride in the toolbox of development strategies: from a panacea that would cure all ills and help replicate the successes of Japan and Korea, to venom that destroys property rights and creates unviable production units that lead to agricultural decline and urban migration as it has purportedly done in Latin America. The story is really much more complex and nuanced. Michael Lipton - the doyen of the field - uses his half-century of thinking and experience as a development economist to set the record straight and to clarify the conditions under which land reform does and does not deliver the goods. It is a must read for those who are committed to finding the road to shared prosperity in the developing world'. - Ricardo Hausmann, Director, Center for International Development at Harvard University; Professor of the Practice of Economic Development, Harvard Kennedy School 'This is a passionate book - it is also brilliantly argued. Michael Lipton accepts that the poor of South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa need appropriate and often advanced scientific technologies - many new green revolutions - but they also need land reform. Without both of these there is little hope of the rural poor lifting themselves out of chronic poverty'. - Sir Gordon Conway, Chief Scientific Adviser, Department for International Development, UK; Professor of International Development, Imperial College, London 'Comprehensive, careful, thoughtful and surprising: Land reform is alive and well and delivering development around the world. Serious students of development, poverty and inequality will find here the micro theory and the macro picture - for years to come'. - Nancy Birdsall, President, Center for Global Development 'In the context of poverty, land is the major asset. The rights over land are social constructs and so are an emotive political battleground. But rights affect incentives: land reform needs economic analysis. Michael Lipton provides an accessible and comprehensive guide without which no reformer should go into battle'. Paul Collier, Professor of Economics and Director, Centre for the Study of African Economies, Oxford University 'Land and Land Reform are, in several developing countries including India, live issues - perhaps more critical today than they were decades ago. The unique analytical framework, remarkable empirical evidence and insight, and a modern perspective in this path-breaking new book of Prof. Lipton are invaluable to researchers and policymakers in their endeavour to address problems of poverty, inequality and sustainability'. - Pramod K Mishra, Chairman, Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (India), and former Secretary to Government of India, Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Agriculture and Cooperation 'Michael Lipton has, for the last few decades, been the world's authority on land reform and economic development. In a world of continuing poverty and inequality, slow agricultural growth, changing economic structures, rapid urbanisation, and facing profound challenges of climate change and deforestation, the institutions, policies and pressures concerning access to and use of land are as important as ever. Michael Lipton's book is a crucial contribution and an analytical landmark'. - Lord Nicholas Stern, I.G. Patel Professor of Economics and Government and Director of Asia Research Centre, London School of Economics; Chief Economist and Senior President of the World Bank 2000-2003; leader of the Africa Commission and the Stern Review on climate change. 'Land reform as a topic in development studies might seem to many to have a distinctly dated air, redolent of the 1960s. Michael Lipton, in this broad, solid, and impressive treatise on the subject, strongly demurs'. - John Bongaarst, Susan Greenhalgh and Geoffrey McNicoll, the Journal of Population and Development 'It is a book of importance not only for those interested in development issues from any perspective, but should be required reading for anyone who works for the World Bank, Food and Agricultural Organisation or any of the regional development banks... The debate about land reform remains alive and well and should you wish to know anything at all about it you need to read this book.' - Herb Thompson, Journal of Contemporary Asia, Vol. 41 No. 1 (2011)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Comprised of interviews between Roy Bhaskar and Mervyn Hartwig, carried out between August 2007 and March 2008, the book recounts the story of the philosophical formation of critical realism, as told by its ‘chief architect’. It takes critical realism philosophically through its main phases and levels of development, including original or basic critical realism, dialectical critical realism and the philosophy of metaReality.That such an overview of the development of critical realism is available in one volume is worth the price alone. But what makes this book particularly attractive is its promise of interweaving three unfolding and related narratives – the personal narrative of Bhaskar, a child of post-war Britain and Indian partition and independence, the intellectual narrative of the emergence and growth of critical realism, and a ‘world-historical story’ and discussion of the development of modernity.''...I found this book to be most inspiring in the sense that it revealed Bhaskar’s (albeit fallible) commitment to ‘walk the talk’, his search for wholeness and ‘unity of theory and practice’, as first mentioned in the opening chapter. There are many examples of this throughout the book, including his early political activism, exploratory practice with psychoanalysis, meditation and other spiritual practices. Though the book sets out to discuss the formation of the philosophyof critical realism, I think it achieves much more than this. We see how critical realism is (or has the potential to be) a lived practice.'-Nick Wilson, King's College, London, in the Journal of Critical Realism vol 11 iss 2 p.247-254", "related": [], "rank": 2252452, "title": "The Formation of Critical Realism: A Personal Perspective (Ontological Exporations)", "author": "Roy Bhaskar", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But this is hardly 1998's No Mercy redux. The stories are fresh, and the depictions are not as grisly as those of the earlier book. The crimes and their perpetrators are no less monstrous, however, in chronicles that are as compelling as they are disturbing. From the media-popular \"Railroad Killer\" to a remorseless member of the Symbionese Liberation Army with 25 years on the lam, to '70s iconoclast Ira Einhorn, who murdered his girlfriend and hid her body for 18 months in a steamer trunk, this title captures the television show's highlights. More importantly, in a genre where the reader is commonly a voyeur, Walsh goes to great lengths to avoid revictimizing survivors of violent crime and relatives of those whose lives have been lost. Over and over, Walsh renders sincere, indelible portraits of victims and their families, both before and in the aftermath of these crimes, exploring the labyrinth of disbelief, bottomless grief, rage and, sometimes, the strength they have mustered to endure the everyday. Their emotional turbulence is both stunning and provocative. At once gallant and crusading, this is Walsh's most tempered and clearly written work. Photos not seen by PW. (Aug. 14)Forecast: Tears of Rage did a stint on PW's bestseller list, and this book's first printing of 75,000 should fly out of stores, given the huge publicity it will receive: bookings on the Today show, Rivera Live, CNN, MSNBC and F ox just for starters, followed by a four-city tour and TV and radio satellite tours.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Following a demographic overview of women of color in the U.S., a number of essays show how patterns of oppression are built into the structure of our society, and how this social structure limits opportunities for women of color. Linda Grant, for example, examines how schools foster a nurturing role in black girls at the expense of intellectual development that could lead to high-status jobs. The book goes on to examine how women of color respond to various forms of oppression. Esther Ngan-Ling Chow looks at how the culture of Asian-American women affects the way they deal with authority on the job. Finally, the book shows how images of women of color are used not only to control them but also to rationalize their subordinate position in society. Meeting the editors' intention of broadening the white, middle-class perspective of earlier feminist scholars, this volume is an important addition to the literature of women's studies.

Born and raised in Seoul, Kim moved to the U.S. as a teenager. Along with his first car, a 35mm Asahi-Pentax, which Kim’s father had used for forensic photography, was passed down to the young Kim. The three soon became best friends and traveled across North America, and it shaped the later years of Kim’s life as a nomad artist. Until leaving the U.S. for graduate school education in Europe and round-the-world journeys, Kim enjoyed his career as a commercial videographer / photographer. Kim filmed and photographed many celebrities in Hollywood including the Dustin Hoffman family, Don Henley of the Eagles, and the Katzenberg family of Dream Works, and he also created promotional films and online contents for fortune 500 corporate clients like Samsung, Canon and NBC. Marco Polo said in his epilogue of life, \"I haven't told the half of what I'd seen.\" Kim wishes to do the same for himself, and share such spirit with fellow pilgrims of life like you.

His poems move me at the deepest level. I am struck by their sense of intimacy—and I love everything about this collection. How the poems articulate with seeming ease our existential dis-ease. How they address our desire for meaning, love, eternity, desire itself. How they hold the personal so close to the divine mystery, the impossible close to the possible, the temporal world close to eternity. He delves so near to the heart and dares to put on paper what it’s like to be human, with all its blessings, fears, curses, and wonders. This book reminds me that poetry can redeem us even as it reminds us of our suffering, our fragility, our irreparable and wounded humanity. In short, each poem here is profound and beautiful.” —Nin Andrews“Neil Carpathios’Beyond the Bonesis an essential meditation, a wholly alive exploration of mortality and love. His poems are affectionately witty, resilient, and determined. Neil Carpathios is a poet full of grace.” —Denise Duhamel“Any poet who can compare taking communion to swallowing a sea-monkey, or a stand of trees to a classroom full of children raising their hands, or pneumonia to taking a swim forever, immediately gets my attention. Carpathios connects the dots of the world with his poems, and makes a wholeness (which is hope) that is rare and original, which is whatBeyond the Bonesis: original and rare.” —Thomas Lux", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But a remarkable man named Robert Bradley bucks the establishment. A carpenter by trade but self-educated and sensitive, Robert escapes conventional marriage, but in so doing falls prey to violence. A chance encounter with Millie, the strange daughter of the castle, brings him into the orbit of the crumbling Thormans. Millie, dubbed \"The Moth\" by the locals because of her flitting escapades, ruins her elder sister Agnes's chances at a suitable marriage. When Agnes, shouldering the crumbling family fortunes alone, finds in Robert a source not only of commonsense but of love, the two of them defy convention.

Lovecraft emulator. This nostalgic collection, the second of two volumes (after 2007'sThe Taint and Other Novellas) of Lumley's best Cthulhu Mythos tales, demonstrates that his work improves the more he moves away from his model, as in the simple and unflinching title story. The more histrionic The Caller of the Black still takes a significant step away from its source, introducing the recurring character of the occultist-adventurer Titus Crow, who, like most Lumley characters, is much more of a man of action than the typical Lovecraft protagonist. Mixed among the contemporary horrors are sword-and-sorcery stories set in Lovecraft's surreal Dreamlands and the Primal Land, as florid as the rest but sometimes redeemed by irony. These straightforward tales of forbidden tomes, alien gods and hideous dooms should appeal to Lovecraft fans who care more about atmosphere than philosophy or prose.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The cop on the scene is Ted Branson, one of Lucinda’s old flames. More dead bodies emerge, all killed in the same face-smashing manner, turning Lucinda’s murder investigation into a serial-killer panic. Though she started out tentatively, Lucinda finds the work cathartic, helping her regain her confidence and womanhood. But will her emotional growth get her too personally involved in yet another case, so much so that she is put in peril?

She hid in the darkness, clinging to the shadows she'd\njust learned to call, because she had to get control. Yeah. Dakota was being\ndumped, alright. For another woman. She could smell the other woman, even above\nthe smoke, the alcohol, the food...and that lovely, male scent that was uniquely\nDrew's.Now\nit was for another woman to enjoy.Mine--Everything\ninside her screamed it. But she pushed it aside. Yeah, she had feelings for the\nguy. She'd had them for a while, but Drew was human.Dakota\nwas a vampire. Her heart might still very well be human, but she'd stopped\nbeing human forty years ago. Tears pricked her eyes. She blinked them away. Nothing\nlike leaking blood-tinged tears to really freak him out. She waited until she\nknew her eyes would be normal. Even though she knew they hadn't slid from their\nsheathes, she checked her fangs.He\ndidn't know. Oh, he knew she had secrets. She could see it in his eyes. She had\nno doubt that was part of the problem between them. But what could she\nsay? Honey,\nI'm a vampire. I'll be around as often as I can, but...He\nwas a mortal who wouldn't even believe in her world. She'd always known it\nwould have to end. Now it was time. As she slid from the booth, she released\nthe shadows. She saw the way he stiffened when he saw her, caught off guard. She\nallowed herself a small, pleased smile. She'd seen him looking for her, and he\nwas a cop--he'd have lookedwell.But\nnobody could hide like a vampire.She\ncame to a stop in front of him, smiled at him lazily, careful to keep her mouth\nclosed. Now that she was closer, she could smell the other woman even stronger\nand she wasn't going to risk losing that oh-so-precious control.\"Hey\nthere.\" He bent down to kiss her, not that he had to bend much with the\nfour-inch heels she wore.Dakota\nturned her head to the side so that his lips brushed against her cheek. Her heart\nshuddered in her chest and she eased backward, avoiding his gaze as she headed\ntoward the bar. \"I need a drink,\" she said over her shoulder. Not that she\nexpected it would do her much good, except maybe the familiarity of it. She'd\nhave to down a vat of it before she could really get tanked.She\nslid onto the stool and called out to the bartender. \"Hendrix and tonic with a\ncucumber slice! Make it a double.\"\"Sure\nthing, beautiful.\" His smile flashed white in his dark face. White...with rather\nsharp teeth. She rolled her eyes. Bo was a shifter. It was one of the reasons\nshe liked this pub. He was a decent sort.Iif she had to slip out sudden-like,\nhe'd help cover her retreat. As he brought the drink down to her, he focused on\nher face, his nostrils flaring a bit.\"You're\nunhappy, Hunter,\" he said, his voice too low for Drew to hear. That didn't keep\nhim from trying. He slid onto the stool next to her, gaze narrowed on Bo's face.\nBo ignored him, stroking a finger down Dakota's cheek. \"I don't like to see a pretty\nHunter unhappy.\"\"Can't\nbe helped,\" she said, smiling brightly. Then she reached out and patted his\nhand. In a voice just as low as his, she said, \"Now stop trying to piss him off.\nThis is going to be hard enough, 'kay?\"Bo\nstared at her. With a sigh, he walked off. She took a sip of her drink.\nNervous, she glanced around and saw a business card somebody had left on the\nbar. It had a phone number on it. For some reason, it made her even sadder to\nsee it. Somebody else had struck out tonight.Taking\nthe business card, she absently started to fold it up, turning it into a neat\nlittle triangle. She kept fiddling with it until Bo slid a Guinness in front of\nDrew.Dropping\nthe business card, she took a healthy drink from her glass and then turned,\ncrossing her legs as she studied Drew's face. His gaze dropped, quick as a\nwish, to her legs and then shot right back up to her face. Oh, yes. It was over.He\nreached for the business card , unfolding and it smoothing out the creases. \"You\ndid that the first time I gave you my number.\"\"Habit.\nYou know that by now.\" She shoved her hair back, staring at the familiar lines\nof his face, memorizing them.

It combines my love for all things fiction, especially fantasy. When I began, I had never written a novel length manuscript and I had a lot to learn. Over the course of two years (and the following three years), I honed my skill and developed techniques that I would later use to complete my second novel.What I found out part way through the writing process was that I was trying to write the book I wanted to read. Upon that reflection, of course I did.Eyes in Atlantisembodies everything that I enjoy in a good story, including Suspense, Adventure, and a strong attempt to keep the main characters grounded in the real world, despite their fantastic situations.My favorite part of writingEyes in Atlantis, aside from the actual writing/creative process, was the research that I did. I poured through the library at Western Michigan University, uncovering tales about Atlantis, Greek Mythology and History, and even Bio-luminescent Plankton. It felt great to study informally on concepts and ideas that I may never have otherwise encountered.Eyes in Atlantisis both a gift to myself and to the rest of the world. I hope that through its pages, readers are provided an escape from their worlds as they encounter the magic of the tale.Enjoy!", "related": [], "rank": 3147855, "title": "Eyes in Atlantis (The Diluvians Book 1) eBook", "author": "Gerald M.

It looks as if readers are enjoying the book.I'm struggling to account for one comment however. It's the first time I've heard from anyone that I seem negative about Marty.When his sister Mamie told me about their lives, it was clear that she wanted the account to be as near to the truth as her memory could make it. So the portrayal of Marty is intentionally warts and all.With my own research and my interviews with other people who knew Marty, I tried to stay faithful to that concept. It was a threadbare existence for both those kids, and even when Marty was a young adult he had to pays his dues, just as many country entertainers have done.Reportedly Marty was shy and his repertoire was pretty limited when he first started performing in Phoenix area clubs -- just as you might expect from a young performer learning his trade. At that stage, Mamie was not the only one who couldn't see Marty making much of his life.Well, as we know, he proved his doubters wrong. The proof, if it's needed, is in the love his fans still have for his music. In Arizona alone, there's a museum dedicated to his career in Willcox and twice a year tribute concerts are held, one in Willcox and one in Peoria, just outside Phoenix.", "related": [], "rank": 959047, "title": "Some Memories - Growing Up with Marty Robbins eBook", "author": "Andrew Means", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Can you tell us a bit about what that experience has been like... and what you have learned from it?David McAfee:I didn't start off self publishing. I don't think many writers try that route initially. (Some do, of course, but they are the minority.) But after several years of publisher rejections I just decided to go it alone. I felt I had a quality product that could do well if given the chance. It worked out much better than I could have imagined. I think I got into it at exactly the right time, what with the advent Amazon's Kindle and their e-publishing platform. I've often related self-publishing to being a castaway onGilligan's Island. What I mean by that is, when you are on the island, you have enough of everything you need to keep yourself alive-Giligan and his friends had plenty of food, water, shelter, etc.-but you still want to be rescued. In this case, being rescued would mean a huge contract from a NYC publisher. Since that hasn't happened, I'll just keep helping myself to the island's food for a while.One thing I have learned over the last year and a half is that you have to stay positive and be willing to accept criticism. No one likes to be criticized, but it happens. In this business, it happens a lot, and you have to learn to use that feedback to make your work better. I was (and still am) very proud of33 ADand its success, but that doesn't mean I consider it perfect. You take your lumps, especially as a self-published writer, and learn as you go. And someday, hopefully, you'll get a great email from someone like Lee Goldberg who wants to work with you.Question:Most of your writing can best be described as \"horror\"...what attracts you to that genre?David McAfee:I love horror. It's so visceral. Or it can be if it's done properly. One of the things that attracts me to the genre is the reaction of the readers. I'm not Nicholas Sparks, I'm not trying to make anyone cry or fall in love. I want people to read my books and shudder, but in a good way. I know I've done my job when a reader emails me to tell me they had a nightmare about the Lost Ones (which has happened more than once). I love that, because I know I got inside that person's head on a subconcious level. Because of that, I know the reader will remember me for a long time. There is nothing better than that feeling. Not to me, anyway.Question:The field is so glutted. Isn't it hard to find a fresh way to write about vampires and zombies?David McAfee:The vampire field is glutted, but mostly by teen angsty vampires like Edward Cullen and his ilk. I tend to refer to them as \"neutered\" vampires. Don't get me wrong, they have their fans and there is nothing wrong with that, but in my opinion they have no edge, no bite, no reason to fear them. In too many contemporary vampire novels, the vampires appear as moody human beings with a mild skin condition and selective diet. They have lost the part of them that makes them monsters. My take on vampires is nothing more than a return to the pre-Twilight vampires. The ones who were more interested in the blood in your neck than your feelings.The real freshness of my work comes in the setting. In33 AD, a vampire in Biblical Jerusalem is sent to assassinate Jesus of Nazareth. Ha! Have you ever read anything like that before? Probably not, and that's why I like it. Add to that the fact that the vampires in my books are blood-hungry, evil monsters who would just as soon tear out your throat as to look at you and you have quite a yarn.Question:What attracted you to The Dead Man series and how did you get involved in it?David McAfee:I'm going to answer the second part of that question first, because one leads into the other. Lee Goldberg, longtime television writer and author of theMonkseries of books (and many others), read33 A.D. and really liked it. He even left a fantastic review on Amazon in which he stated that (I'm paraphrasing here, but only a little.) \"David McAfee is the real deal.\" For a small time self publisher like myself, who could never gain acceptance from a publisher, that was huge! Lee has been in this business for a long time, and to have someone of such experience and talent praise my book represented a tremendous validation of my work. It made me think I really could do this, after all.So, a few weeks later when Lee emailed me and asked if I would be interested in working on a project he and his longtime writing partner William Rabkin had cooked up, I jumped at the chance. As I learned more about the project, I came to love it. Matt Cahill, dead but not dead, able to actually see the evil in people. He was presented as kind of a nomadic savior, of sorts. The traveling gunsligner in the white hat who goes from town to town saving people from evil, even their own evil. Like a modern dayKung Fuif the original had been written by Stephen King. Honestly, who could resist the chance to work on such a project? Not me.Question:What sets The Dead Man series apart from the other horror you have written?David McAfee:The books are a lot of fun. They are gory and fast and a kick in the pants to read. But there is more to it than just blood and gore. With Matt Cahill there is a sense of a higher purpose. In The Dead Man series, you know there are forces of good and forces of evil, and you also know they are warring with each other. Their weapons in this war? Why, people, of course. Ordinary people who might or might not even want to play a role, but are forced by their circumstances to participate.To me, that puts Matt's story on a whole different plane from anything else out there. This is a story people are going to want to read, and keep reading. From Book 1 (Face of Evil) all the way to the final installment, whenever that may be.Question:What was it like writing in a book in a series that you didn't create?David McAfee:I was nervous about it at first. I wanted to make sure I did the characters justice as well as the series, and I also wanted to turn in a good story. When Lee approached me about joining the team, he and William Rabkin had already hammered out some possible plots. All of them were great, but I had a story in my head about Matt meeting up with a woman who shared his ability to see evil in people. I knew I could probably write any of the ideas they had presented, but I also knew I could really sink my teeth into this idea, so I asked Lee what he thought of it. He and Bill were behind it 100%, and so I set off. I put Matt in the tiny fictional town of Crawford, Tennessee and let him run. It was a blast. I have to say that working with Lee and Bill was a real pleasure. Up until then I'd never had a real editor. I never would have believed how much easier a good editor can make things, but now I'm a believer.Question:What are you working on now?David McAfee:At this moment I am working with friend and fellow author Jeremy Robinson on a short novel featuring one of the characters from hisChess Teamthrillers. It's a new genre for me. I've never done a thriller before, but it's been fun. Once that is finished I will be splitting my time between working on the next Bachiyr novel, editing a horror story calledThe Gallows Tree, and finally setting up print versions of some of my other books, which are currently only available as ebooks.But I can definitely see another Matt Cahill book in my future.

What you read in the opening of the book, the lifting of the sidewalk, the accidental burning of the street, the ant colony extending feet deep ... to the closing of the street ... all true events.

My mother taught me to read when I was about four; I assume to try and distract me from drawing on the walls. She placed a bookcase outside my bedroom door and I was instructed to read when I awoke before dawn. By the time I was eight I’d enjoyed all the children’s classics from Janet and John to Robinson Crusoe. My mother had made the connection between food colouring and hyperactivity by then, but my voracious appetite for books would never be subdued. By twelve I’d graduated to Lewis, Tolkein and Orwell, amongst many others and my imagination swelled under master tutelage.  But my absolute beloved was Mr.Carrol’s ‘Alice in Wonderland’, chiefly because my mind was almost as hyperactive as I slept and my dreams were a consistent source of wonderment. My favourite lessons at school were English and Art, but I appeared to be relatively academic - I understood science - so my love of animals tipped me toward a career as a vet; it never actually occurred to me that I could write books or paint. Neither were proper jobs anyway. My brother died when I was fourteen, he eighteen.  Everything changed. My veterinary aspirations vanished. I pursued Neil’s dream to become an actor. I won a scholarship to drama school and studied at the Birmingham Old Rep, then moved to London, did the audition rounds and worked with some great people in TV, Film and West End Theatre.  But I soon discovered that an actress at nearly six feet tall is no role winner when most male actors stand barely over five, so I abandoned any ideas of super-stardom and moved laterally into corporate and commercial video production. I won some blue chip clients and got the bug for writing.  I first drafted The Toy Sorcerer back in 1996, but my career path once again took a sideways move and the book was shelved.  I spent ten years restoring and eco-updating a number of Heritage buildings. The last one very nearly killed me, so I went to college to study CAD and 3D modelling/animation in order to professionally draft construction schematics. This opened up a new avenue of 3D art and design and I’ve worked on some fabulous assignments.  Most recently I have begun making art and architectural glass. Maybe art and authorship are proper jobs after all.  Incidentally; I was married and divorced twice, but they really were only minor incidents. I chose not to have any children.

Lucien seems to be too clever by half, and his comeuppance, presumably to return to a life of dissolution (money allowing) is a sorry end. One can almost see the blackmail coming. The detail of the cravings of Pola is graphic and realistic. Robin Ryder is a credible character, although there were few who were as angry as he, perhaps because the surgeons provided more support than the story suggests (having said that he did abscond in his furious state so would not have benefited; this also explains why he continued to wear a mask, which by the later stages of war was something rarely made). His dependence is also well-crafted and the self-destruction has echoes in latter-day celebrities (Amy Winehouse springs to mind). -- Dr Andrew Bamji The story follows the paths of two men, one Dutch and one English, during and after the first World War as their lives are affected by cocaine. The author has researched the supply of the drug and the Consequences of its use so well that it is often easy to forget that this is a novel. The Dutchman is employed to sell cocaine legitimately for medical use to both the English and German armies. The tragedy of this obscure aspect of the first World War becomes clear as the stories unfold. The English soldier suffers severe facial injuries and is transferred from the trenches to England for treatment. There is a fascinating account of the pioneering reconstructive surgical techniques of Harrold Gillies (later Sir Harold in recognition of his work) and early attempts at maxillofacial prosthetic appliances. The limitations of these early procedures are vividly described through the hopes and disappointments of the patient. Eventually the paths of the two men collide as they live with deception because of their involvement with cocaine.There follows an insightful account of how family,friends and colleagues cope with the two principal characters during the chaotic post-war period and a painfully realistic interpretation of the affects of addiction on emotional relationships and an unfolding love story. This is a captivating easy read which maintains a sense of urgency throughout as the reader is drawn deeper into increasingly complex interactions between everyone affected by the two men at the heart of the narrative.When the men part at the end of the story an intriguing question remains - will the next phase of their lives allow them freedom from cocaine? -- Dr Phil Rood Picture a world of hellish exclusion, nightmarish noise and images, and horrid violence. Picture one person trying to live through the sleepless nights, the isolation among his peers, the permanent sense of dreadful threat. Picture him needing drugs. His best friend might even be called Charlie. But don't picture an inner city slum, 2012, but a man on the front in World War One. Robin Ryder is that person, about to enter his first real action since leaving his teaching job and fiancee behind in Great Yarmouth. Afterwards he will be so physically and mentally scarred he will be one of many hundreds of thousands given cocaine by his doctors. And where do they get that from? From a legal, virtual monopoly controlled from Holland. Hence the main character in this historical-book-you-wouldn't-suspect-from-the-title, Lucien Hirschland, who is a travelling salesman for one Dutch factory, whose bosses are providing both sides in the great war through Dutch neutrality. It's a relief that Conny Braam has uncovered this ... She succeeds in not just opening our eyes to an unexpected part of that war's history, and hence our medicinal heritage, but in providing literature with one of a select band, that of sympathetic drug dealers. Used to huge, sweeping deals that earn him a brand new Harley Davidson with little investment, his hubris is evident, but only one side of his well-formed character. And the book is certainly not just his story, as Ryder is similarly very strongly written. ... I think the most surprising thing about this book is that it was written by a female. This Conny is a Dutch Lady of Letters, and clearly shows more of her work could be brought to the English language market. In this translation at least it seems a particularly masculine novel, in style, content and detail. Yet it also allows a very general interest, in the way of historical sagas. ...the novelty of this circumstance, the characters and the strong form of the author make this a book to definitely consider. I wish it a large audience. -- The Bookbag", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Author BioII. Author Letter  I. Author Bio Carol R. Emberstarted at Antioch College as a chemistry major. She began taking social science courses because some were required, but she soon found herself intrigued. There were lots of questions without answers, and she became excited about the possibility of a research career in social science. She spent a year in graduate school at Cornell studying sociology before continuing on to Harvard, where she studied anthropology primarily with John and Beatrice Whiting. For her Ph.D. dissertation she worked among the Luo of Kenya. While there she noticed that many boys were assigned \"girls' work,\" such as babysitting and household chores, because their mothers (who did most of the agriculture) did not have enough girls to help out. She decided to study the possible effects of task assignment on the social behavior of boys. Using systematic behavior observations, she compared girls, boys who did a great deal of girls' work, and boys who did little such work. She found that boys assigned girls' work were intermediate in many social behaviors, compared with the other boys and girls. Later, she did cross-cultural research on variation in marriage, family, descent groups, and war and peace, mainly in collaboration with Melvin Ember, whom she married in 1970. All of these cross-cultural studies tested theories on data for worldwide samples of societies. From 1970 to 1996, she taught at Hunter College of the City University of New York. She has also served as president of the Society of Cross-Cultural Research and was one of the directors of the Summer Institutes in Comparative Anthropological Research, which were funded by the National Science Foundation. She is now executive director at the Human Relations Area Files, Inc., a nonprofit research agency at Yale University. After graduating from Columbia College,Melvin Emberwent to Yale University for his Ph.D. His mentor at Yale was George Peter Murdock, an anthropologist who was instrumental in promoting cross-cultural research and building a full-text database on the cultures of the world to facilitate cross-cultural hypothesis testing. This database came to be known as the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF) because it was originally sponsored by the Institute of Human Relations at Yale. Growing in annual installments and now distributed in electronic format, the HRAF database currently covers more than 370 cultures, past and present, all over the world. He did fieldwork for his dissertation in American Samoa, where he conducted a comparison of three villages to study the effects of commercialization on political life. In addition, he did research on descent groups and how they changed with the increase of buying and selling. His cross-cultural studies focused originally on variation in marital residence and descent groups. He also conducted cross-cultural research on the relationship between economic and political development, the origin and extension of the incest taboo, the causes of polygamy, and how archaeological correlates of social customs can help draw inferences about the past. After four years of research at the National Institute of Mental Health, he taught at Antioch College and then Hunter College of the City University of New York. Heserved as president of the Society for Cross-Cultural Research and was president (since 1987) of the Human Relations Area Files, Inc., a nonprofit research agency at Yale University, until his passing.   II. Author Letter Dear Colleague, I have always viewed textbook writing as a special challenge. Most of us specialize, in some way, in the advanced courses we teach or are asked to teach, in our regional or topical fields of interest, and with the usual colleagues we see at conferences. It is refreshing to move outside the box. Working on the textbook does just that, it encourages you to read books and articles in fields you don’t normally read and to look at connections across subfields. And most important of all, it makes you think about the gaps in our collective knowledge. But a textbook also presents other challenges, such as the style of writing, which is a particular challenge. How do you make something complex understandable but not sound patronizing or simple-minded? How do you make it interesting? How do you make it authoritative, but not authoritarian? And when describing other cultures, how do you convey respect for other people? Human Culture,2nd editionis an abridged version of the 13th edition ofCultural Anthropologythat is specifically designed for shorter terms and for courses with a lot of supplementary material. Shortening a book presents even more challenges. What chapters are most essential for a good grounding in anthropology? What examples are more important than others? In general, we have found that writing less is actually harder than writing more! We have always taken revisions seriously. It is a time to reflect on what needs to be added what needs to come out, and what needs to be rearranged. One of the most significant changes in the 13th edition ofCultural Anthropology, and in this abridged version, is a greater emphasis on how cultural anthropology has made important contributions to the lives of people. These contributions are highlighted in nine boxes new to this edition. Other new boxes deal with gender issues and roles. To emphasize the importance of culture change and globalization, we have moved that material toward the beginning in an integrated chapter on culture and culture change. In response to requests, we have added a chapter on the arts. Finally, to make way for more culture change material to be added earlier, we combined material formerly from the first two chapters into an integrated chapter called \"Explanation and Evidence.\" If you have comments, suggestions, or criticisms, I would welcome them. My email address is Carol.ember@yale.edu. Sincerely, Carol R.

Jennifer also co-authors a series called Once Upon A Zombie Apocalypse. She resides in the beautiful mountains of northern Idaho with her husband and five children where she practices preparing for the zombie apocalypse. Just kidding! But seriously, between the craziness of taking care of her children, Jennifer has little time left for herself. The time she does have left, usually leading far into the night, is spent working on her beloved fiction or chatting with her equally crazy friends. Jennifer also loves coffee, has a passionate affair with red bull, wishes the sushi were better where she lives and dances while she cleans.

Finally, T.L. Taylor provides an amazing perspective on eSports that will educate fans about a period of competitive play that's nearly been forgotten. Forget what history you may know, this book gives you the history you should know.(Marcus \"djWHEAT\" Graham, Host and Executive Producer,OneMoreGame.tv)T.L. Taylor has been among the best analysts of the media we have had over the past decade. Now she turns her exacting but always entertaining scrutiny to e-sports, with all the power we have come to expect of a participant observer of the highest order.(Toby Miller, author ofMakeover Nation)InRaising the Stakes, T. L. Taylor does exactly what the title promises by giving us the first serious academic take on the world of competitive e-sports. She touches on every aspect of the new cyberathleticism, always carefully balancing enthusiasm and skepticism.(Henry Lowood, Curator for History of Science & Technology Collections, Stanford University)This book is about much more than the e-sports scene. T.L. Taylor uses e-sports as a lens for looking at the confluence of social, cultural and technological practices that are reshaping human interaction as digital culture at both the local everyday level and at the broader level of global techno-politics.(Bart Simon, Director of the Centre for Technoculture, Art and Games, Concordia University, Montreal)… Taylor has given us a great account of an exciting part of gaming culture.(Faltin Karlsen 1900-01-00)WhileRaising the Stakesfits neatly within the gaming studies or media studies genres, it is also an exciting and novel contribution to the growing body of work in what might be termed global technology studies.(Jenna BurrellContemporary Sociology)Raising the Stakesis a must not only for game studies but also media and internet studies researchers as a wonderfully nuanced study of century-first digital play-based in DIY, grassroots ideology-in the face of burgeoning leisure commercialization. Play on.(Game Studies)Esports is a fascinating collision of new technology and culture with traditional sports structure, and is a phenomenon that could only happen in the present. There is a growing body of research around the growing esports phenomenon, and this book provides a great primer into the academic perspective on the emerging culture. In my opinion, this is the book to refer anyone to who is interested in understanding esports -- for both newcomers and veterans.(Timothy YoungDay9)", "related": [], "rank": 399444, "title": "Raising the Stakes: E-Sports and the Professionalization of Computer Gaming (The MIT Press)", "author": "T.

Too often though, as a trial consultant working side by side with attorneys in business litigation, I saw failure and unhappiness. As I explored the inner workings of businesses to better do my job, I observed a remarkably consistent equation: happy employees lead to increased productivity and profits. Unhappy employees lead to decreased productivity and profits--and sometimes, unfortunately, even to employee lawsuits.Contrary to the opinion of many bosses and managers, happiness for most employees is not goofing off or getting paid to do nothing. Happiness is being appreciated. Happiness is a business demonstrating through words and actions, that employees matter. That is the true meaning of appreciation: knowing that you count, you are important.It was thrilling to me, as I did the research for this book, to see how appreciating employees (and vendors and others) contributes enormously to business success: measurable success in terms of actual dollars, profitable innovations and growth. The book is filled with real-world examples of companies that have figured out the secret value of appreciation and benefited mightily from it.I confess, I am a true believer in the worth of appreciation, in business and everywhere else in life, for the simple reason that--it works, has no downsides, and doesn't require three pages of fine-print-nasty-side-effects.May \"Make More Money by Making Your Employees Happy\" bring you much success!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cross is a novelist, and he has given his own life-story the shapeliness and ironic depth of fiction' SUNDAY TIMES 15/5 'Neil Cross is a great writer and his story grimly fascinating. Yes, he was unhappy, shuttling back and forth during the 1970's between his father in Bristol and mother in Edinburgh. But he was also transfixed by his stepfather, Derek, an enigmatic man who became a Mormon bishop and was also a serial abandoner. This relationship is the absorbing focus of this flinty portrait of a family pulled in so many directions it eventually collapses' METRO 18/5 'As an English boy in a tough Scots playground, Neil Cross was never going to have it easy, but his stepfather Derek hardly helped - a white supremacist South African, he then became a Mormon bishop. But, against the odds, Derek also provided Neil with an unlikely refuge' YOU, MAIL ON SUNDAY 29/5 'Neil's story is utterly compelling and his writing beautiful. He brilliantly conveys a child's view of the world' WESTERN DAILY PRESS 21/5 'Neil's salvation and this wonderful account are a stunning testimony to the redemptive power of the love of books, his lasting legacy from Derek Cross' DAILY MAIL 3/6 'At the book's heart is Neil's ambivalent relationship with his stepfather Derek Cross, this massively influential figure rendered vividly and compassionately' THE LIST 26/5 4 Star review 'This is a beautiful, disturbing book, strongly recommended' DAILY EXPRESS 10/06 'A distressingly fine piece of writing' SCOTLAND ON SUNDAY 'Wonderful memoir of a different kind of childhood: fractured, unhappy and at the whimsical mercy of a stepfather who is half-hero, half-monster. A great example of how to wrest real life into a work of art' Jonathan Coe, Hot Reads, GUARDIAN Summer Books 18/6 'Growing up lonely and confused in Scotland, bullied for his Englishness and in the care of a wayward stepfather, Neil Cross somehow pulled through and emerged as a fine writer. This memoir of a fractured childhood is even better than his novels' Jonathan Coe, THE LIST. 'HEARTLAND has many qualities, not least the poetry of its language and the gentle evocation of a late 1970s childhood. But it is the relentless persecution of Derek that truly ignites this book. The way Cross puts the authorial boot in, tears shining in his eyes, is grimly riveting' INDEPENDENT OF SUNDAY 26/06 '[Cross's] childhood seems by turns drab and dangerous, but there are reasons for recalling it, even if they are private ones. As one of his characters says in ALWAYS THE SUN, 'Don't forget what it's like, being a boy'. 'Written with a novelist's skill for structure and atmosphere, the book's a real page-turner. But of course it's his portrayal of Derek Cross that one will remember. A domestic tyrant, a monster of egotism and perhaps not as rare as one might wish' THE SUNDAY TRIBUNE 19 June 2005 'Novelist Neil Cross's memoir shows a desperate childhood, scarred by sundry acts of violence and multiple betrayals...It sounds like a no-fun read, but its author has a brilliant memory for sights and smells and his alchemy keeps the reader involved pretty well from beginning to end' Sunday Telegraph 18/12 'The striking feature of the book is not Neil's terrible childhood but the clarity with which he shows how unbearable the world can seem to little boys everywhere' Observer 1/1 'This moving, wonderful memoir of the complexity of love and cruelty is brilliant piece of writing -- and a tribute to Cross's endurance and survival' Express 6/1 'This is the most honest autobiography I have ever read read - warts and all...A must-read for parents about to introduce a new partner to their children\"' Woman Magazine, bookclub choice Jan issue 'Neil Cross's resolute rejection of pity makes this memoir an unnerving read, and all the more special in a world where you can hardly move for bestselling memoirists racking their brains for yet more horrific recollections of child abuse...Cross's observations are savagely lucid and he punches out judgement with every anecdote, but what is most striking is the strength of resolve that develops in Neil's interior \"heartland\".'

When her perfectionist classmate Claire Plummer taunts her with pictures from Beautiful Living of perfect celebrations, Katie starts to think that a grand dinner would help cement her family together, but she is embarrassed about her brother's rude table manners. Then she accidentally invites her teacher to Thanksgiving dinner, and she and her father scramble to come up with a meal. Readers are apt to sympathize with Katie's concerns about the cohesiveness of her family, while deft touches of humor add comic relief. Barbara Cohen's Molly's Pilgrim (Bantam, 1990) would make a good counterpart in a class discussion. Richly drawn characterizations, a brisk pace, and a theme subtly woven into the plot add up to an enjoyable read.James K.

Snelson's teenage concern for human survival motivated him to study social history, philosophy, theology, economics, and scientific epistemology in search of an answer to history's most critical and pressing social problem, namely, \"How can the scope and scale of organized violence - whether religious or political - be limited to a level of destruction that no longer threatens to destroy civilization and the human species?\" Lecturing on these issues for more than four decades, Snelson has shown that through observational analysis and verification, a greater understanding of social causality reveals a practical solution to the endless crises unleashed by war, poverty, and servitude. His focus on finding workable strategies for resolving crucial social problems led to his development and presentation of proprietary seminars on a Science of Social Causation that identifies and verifies which social causes lead to which social effects. Causality identification and verification confirms the practicality and efficacy of win-win structures of social organization that maximize the causes of peace, prosperity, and freedom and minimize the causes of war, poverty, and servitude.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In love with writing since her elementary school days, De Leon was a student in the Performing Arts Class at P.S. 85 where she penned her first short story and first full length play. It would be many years before her art took a professional turn. In 2000, De Leon self-published her first novel, Once Upon a Family Tree. In 2002, bestselling author Zane offered her a contract with her newly founded company, Strebor Books International. In 2003, Missed Conceptions was the first release. In 2004, Love to the Third and Once Upon a Family Tree were published. Strebor Books International eventually became an imprint under the Simon & Schuster umbrella and they still have the rights to these works today. In 2009, De Leon released Broken Bands of Gold: Restoring the Covenant on her own. It is her first non-fiction book and is an Inspirational guide and a personal testimonial about standing with Jesus for marriage restoration. It is available via CreateSpace.com and Amazon.com. She also wrote Inspirational novel We Never Danced to a Love Psalm and Young Adult novel Evangie's Fortune. An avid reader from the beginning, De Leon became interested in writing as a way of expressing her ideas and sharing her imagination. After four novels, a collection of novellas and one non-fiction piece, she has turned her attention and talents towards playwriting. She has written Like a Psalm Out of Tune which is based on the novel We Never Danced of a Love Psalm. She is also working on 3 Bethel's Way; an Inspirational sequel to the super sensual novella Love to the Third. A Christian who believes her God given talent should be used to advance the Kingdom, she is developing a ministry play based on the Word she received while composing Broken Bands of Gold. Never one to get bogged down and/or pigeon holed into one genre, Michelle De Leon hopes one day to excel as a screenwriter. Or whatever else her heart desires.", "related": ["B00AMRGYL0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has abroad spectrum of best selling books that include such divergent areas as self-help for depression, global politics, and paranormal Victorian thrillers. Fiction includes Paranormal Victorian Thrillers, Science Fiction, Psychological Thrillers and Spiritual Fantasy. In addition to his writing he is has a wonderful, esoteric adventure in photojournalism that you can view at his www.StephenPaulWest.com website. \"Kwenda, Women Slaves of War\" tells the true story of motherhood caught in the cruelty of modern warfare. This story paints a story that will touch you to the core, and you will both weep and cheer. \"Depression Symptoms Decoded\" is a deep analysis of depression symptoms with a Jungian view of each symptom demonstrated: weeping, sex issues, rage, eating disorders, isolation, fatigue, confusion addiction, recurrent dreams and dark thoughts. The pioneering self-help book on depression delves deeply into the meaning of each symptom of depression as a pattern for emotional need. By decoding your type of depression symptoms you can identify a means of overcoming depression. \"Rise of the Maiden - Blood and Venom\" is a new twist on the paranormal. Emily Black is a compelling and strong female character who exemplifies a Byronic role. She is every bit as intelligent, smart and dangerous as role reserved for traditionally male leading characters. The darkness of this thriller include haunting of a mother's ghost, and the insanity of a kidnapper who practices vampire occultism. This is combined with the unusual aspect of drug addiction as found in Victorian London.

But with numerous fantasy, horror, science fiction, magic realism and literary fiction stories under his belt, in late 2012 he'd had his fill of generic rejection letters from agents and editors, and took the plunge into the murky waters of self-publishing via the current hot medium of the e-book. \"The Girl in the Stationery Cupboard\" was released upon an unsuspecting world, and a print edition followed to broaden its audience.Rob lives in Bristol, England, with his wife and energetic toddler. They have inspired in him a love for romance and all that soppy stuff - but his passion for fantasy, magic and all things beyond the mundane remains as keen as ever, and continues to fuel his writing.", "related": ["B00AEGD70A"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Though I never went to Vietnam. my assignment, at Fort Riley, KS had it's own issues. I had a brief break in service to attend college, but returned to the Army with goal of completing my degree. I retired from the Army in 1992 with 21 years and a BA Degree from University of Maryland and 13 years experience as a graphic artist. I am still a graphic artist with the Federal government. In my youth, I  thought I had to choose between art and writing. Now in my mature years, I know I don't.

As you probably have guessed, \"The Dino Detective\" is what we writers call a \"pen name\". I chose \"The Dino Detective\" rather than my own name for several reasons. The main reason is because I love to research and write about dinosaurs and it makes me feel like a detective as I hunt for information and clues for my next dinosaur book. When not working on dinosaur books for kids, I am a school teacher, living in a small town in Canada, with over 30 years teaching experience. Most of my teaching years were spent teaching elementary school children which probably explains why I enjoy writing and publishing dinosaur books for kids, rather than for adults. As a child, and even into my adult years, the topic of dinosaurs has always fascinated me. I loved movies like \"Jurassic Park\" and any other movies that featured dinosaurs! My hope is that I can pass along some of that \"dino\" wonder and fascination through my interactive dinosaur books for kids, that can be read using digital readers such as the Kindle device and in print form as well. I sincerely want to thank you if you do decide to purchase any of my dinosaur books for kids, and hope you have as much fun reading it yourself or along with your children, if you are a parent reading this, as I did creating these books. May the \"Dinosaur Force\" be with you!

The abnormally taciturn recluse, who mined the history of his Sicilian aristocratic family in its ruinous decline for his classic novel The Leopard , had a \"vexatious, disappointing and often pathetic life.\" His arrogant, sharp-tongued father, fueled by a ridiculous sense of pride, spent much of his life quarreling with relatives over money. Lampedusa's domineering mother nearly wrecked her son's marriage to psychoanalyst Beatrice Mastrogiovanni, a largely epistolary relationship for years at a stretch. In this elegant, sprightly biography, Gilmour ( Lebanon: The Fractured Country ) draws an incisive portrait of a curious modernist outsider deeply skeptical of all human motives. Lampedusa's fictional counterpart, Don Fabrizio, The Leopard 's protagonist, likewise seems a contemporary figure swinging from hedonistic pursuits to the contemplation of eternity without a personal God.

As a young woman raised in the English countryside and trained in classical ballet, Eve longed for excitement and adventure.  Barely 20, she disguised herself as a boy and took glider lessons, enlisted in the WRENS (Women’s Royal Navy Service) to help the war effort, and danced in racy West End Theatre productions. At 24, she donned a red ‘Star Girl’ uniform and embarked on a series of harrowing adventures as an air hostess on the ill-fated British South American Airways.  But within a few months, two of the airline’s fleet—bombers and military transport planes retired from recent combat—disappeared in the Caribbean. That was too close a call for her suitor, the handsome Cavalry officer Ted Branson, whose proposal lured Eve from the skies to safety and a marriage that would last 62 years.As a young wife, Eve devoted most of her energy to raising three children but still found time to start several businesses, serve as a probation officer and JP, and volunteer her time to charity organizations.  Over the years, she and Ted travelled the world to follow their son Richard’s highly publicized attempts to break world records in ballooning, sailing, and the like.

It always has.  Or maybe she's just a trouble magnet.   Like the time she taught all the kids in her kindergarten class how to lock the bathroom stalls and slide out underneath. Or when she became the first kindergartner in the school's history to get suspended, after starting a glue war to the tune of one carpet, ten emergency haircuts, fifteen shirts, three pants, and two pairs of sneakers.  Or was it three pairs of sneakers? Anyway, ten years later she came up with the bright idea to use her father's street motorcycle like a dirtbike and crashed it while attempting a spectacular jump over two logs, a lawn chair, her brother, and the family St. Bernard.  Brutus survived.  Her brother still has nightmares. The motorcycle was DOA.  Day, only slightly bent, spindled, and mutilated, spent most of that year grounded. Then there were all the times she wrecked the family car.  Her parents were not amused. The insurance adjuster was. Eventually, he started answering the phone, \"So, what's she done now?\" Nowadays, Day loves fostering dogs for the SPCA and playing The Sims 3 obsessively. Day also writes with equal obsession, and loves to play god with the fabulous characters and settings she creates, all within the confines of her computer world, of course.  Or so she claims! USA Today bestselling author, Day Leclaire is the author of more than 60 novels and is a three-time winner of both The Colorado Award of Excellence and The Golden Quill Award.  She's won Romantic Times magazine's Career Achievement, and Love and Laughter awards, the Holt Medallion, the Booksellers Best Award, and has received an impressive eleven nominations for the romance industry's most prestigious award, Romance Writers of America RITA Award.  Day writes romances which touch the heart and make you care about her characters as much as she does.  In Day's own words, \"I adore writing romances, and can't think of a better way to spend each day.\"", "related": ["B007W5CP9K"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 38, "rating_average": 3.8158, "rating_total": 145.0}

Starving and lonely, an orphaned timber wolf is befriended by a boy named Red Wolf. But under the Indian Act, Red Wolf is forced to attend a residential school far from the life he knows, and the wolf is alone once more. Courage, love and fate reunite the pair, and they embark on a perilous journey home. But with winter closing in, will Red Wolf and Crooked Ear survive? And if they do, what will they find?Jennifer Dance'sRed Wolfis a heartrending, relentlessly compelling novel about the impact of the Indian Act of 1876 and the residential schools system upon indigenous cultures.Dance's first novel addresses a horrific historical period and detailsRed Wolf's harsh awakening in painful, hard-hitting scenes . . . readers will finish with a strong sense of the abuses suffered by natives at the hands of settlers.Children and young adults alike will want to read Jennifer Dance's novel on the intertwined stories of a wolf and a First Nation boy. It is exactly the sort of story I loved when I was a boy.WithRed Wolf, Jennifer Dance has come howling out of the wilderness . . . and I'm deeply impressed.The Dickensian world of any 19th century boarding school, particularly a Canadian Indian residential school with the agonizing clash of Indigenous and British cultures, is excellent fodder for Dance's powers or portrayal and she gives a memorable picture of those who worked in these institutions.AlthoughRed Wolfis marketed as juvenile fiction, it is a book that will appeal to all ages. Poignantly written from the perspective of both boy and wolf, it brilliantly encapsulates the fear, alienation and hopelessness felt by a child who is powerless against a system which seeks to annihilate his heritage, spiritual beliefs and family ties.", "related": [], "rank": 1944176, "title": "Red Wolf", "author": "Jennifer Dance", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Through personal trials, she came to understand that only through significant changes in these four aspects could she experience peace. Steph was raised in an Italian neighborhood in the Boston suburbs that provided a rich source of experiences.  She earned a B.A. in Management and a certificate in Communications from Regis College, Weston, MA.  Her ethnicity brought with it as much pain as joy in her life. There was a tremendous emphasis on food that contributed to her being overweight. Steph is challenged with a physical disability that added to her feelings of rejection and loneliness, a misunderstanding of God and her faith, and not acknowledging and nourishing her intellect and talents. Today, Steph has journeyed uphill to make strides in maintaining balance and peace in her life with a specific emphasis on physical health.  She is a proponent of healthy relationships and working toward continual personal growth spiritually and intellectually.  In addition to providing life coaching on the four aspects of the human person, Steph offers keynote speaking, half day workshops and radio and TV guest spots.  Steph co-hosts a web talk show with comedian Charlene Mae.

Noun.The word Anunnaki is composed of\nthree words or more, depending on the choice of linguists: 1-\n     Anu, which is the name of the Anunnaki's supreme god. And the\n     epistemological meaning of Anu is: Lord; leader; king.2-\n     Na, is either a verb or an adverb, meaning to send. In many Akkadian, Sumerian, Assyrian and\n     Old Babylonian texts and inscriptions, \"Na\" was written as \"Ina\", and\n     meant in, from within, so on.3-\n     Ki, generally means Earth in Akkadian and Sumerian. But Ki also means all\n     of the following, in Akkadian and Sumerian: The underworld, the\n     netherworld, the world of death. THUS, THE\nCORRECT MEANING/DEFINITION OF the word ANUNNAKI is: Gods (Anuna) of the Underworld (Ki), also\nGods (Anuna) of Earth (Ki; Ki means both Earth and Underworld). The\nAkkadian/Sumerian Anunnaki word is used in a plural form to represent the gods\nof the heaven and Earth, called Anunna in Sumerian and Akkadian.Later on in\nhistory, and in order to differentiate between the Anunnaki and the Igigi, The\nscribes called the Anunnaki, the gods of Earth, also gods of the netherworld,\nand gods of the Empire of Death, and the\nIgigi, gods of the Heaven.This\ndifferentiation is very clear in all the Mesopotamian clay tablets,\nparticularly in the Ishtar Descent to the Underworld (Ki), the poem/myth of\nGilgamesh, the Enuma Elish, etc...Theyare represented as Sha Shame or Da-meh u\nerSetim(Pronunciation: As Sha Shameh ersetiim) meaning the Anunnaki of\nheaven and earth. Sha Shame means heaven in Akkadian and Sumerian.\nShem and shama in Phoenician, and Sama in Arabic. erSetim means earth.\nThus, theAnunnaki and Igigi are\ngrouped together under Anunna (A group of Gods in Sumerian, Akkadian and Old\nBabylonian). Consequently \"Those who from heaven to earth came\" is an absolute\nNONSENSE!  Other names of the Anunnaki: The Anunnaki were known to\nmany neighboring countries in the Near East, Middle East, and Anatolia. And because of the languages'\ndifferences, the Anunnaki were called differently.  For instance: 1-The Habiru (Early\n     Hebrews/Israelites) called them Nephilim, meaning to fall down to earth,\n     as well as Anakim.2-Some passages in the Old\n     Testament refer to them asElohim.3-In Ashuric\n     (Assyrian-Chaldean), and Syriac-Aramaic, they are calledJabaariyn,meaning the mighty\n     ones.4-In Aramaic, Chaldean and\n     Hebrew, the Anunnaki asGibborimmean the mighty or majestic ones.5-In literary Arabic, it is\n     Jababira. The early Arabs called them Al Jababira; sometimes Amalika.6-The Egyptians called themNeteru.7-The\n     early Phoenicians called them An.Na Kim, meaning the god or heaven who\n     sent them to us.8-The\n     early inhabitants of Arwad called then Anu.ki, meaning the subjects or\n     followers of Anu. Sometimes, they were called Anu. Ki.ram. (Ram means\n     people, persons, community, tribes,\n     group)9-The\n     early Hyksos (Ancestors of the Armenians) who invaded and ruled Egypt\n     for 100 years, called them the Anuramkir and Anuramkim, meaning the people\n     of Anu on earth. It is composed of three words: Anu + ram (People) + Ki\n     (Earth). The primitive form of Ki was kir or kiim.10-The Greeks called themtheAnnodoti.11-the Book of Enoch, they are called The Nephilim, \"The\n     Sons of God,\" or the \"Watchers\".12-The\n     Ulema call them Annakh or Al Annaki, meaning the people from above.13-In other parts of Anatolia, and especially in the lands of the\n     Hittites,theAnunnakiwere also calledAnunnaku,\n     andAnanaki.", "related": [], "rank": 2147992, "title": "PREMIERE ISSUE: ANUNNAKI MAGAZINE", "author": "Maximillien de Lafayette", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the realm of family relationships made more complicated by human failing and life's happenstances, forgiveness may not be a realistic or attainable goal. How does all of this impact the lives of the people involved?  I grew up in the Bronx and Forest Hills, New York in the forties and fifties. I am the mother of seven grown children and a total of thirteen grandchildren and have been married three times, the last one is a keeper. I have been an artist for over fifty years, have owned schools and art galleries in the Hamptons, a gold coast area at the tip of Long Island; I have been president of the Southampton Artists' Association, Vice President of the Jimmy Ernst Alliance before it became the Artists' Alliance of East Hampton, was editor of both the SAA and AAEH newsletters. I have studied law, been a paralegal, an advocate, an activist. I have exhibited and sold my artwork internationally and have spent the last little while completing my autobiography.  Presently I live with my husband and three rescue dogs in the middle of North West Woods, East Hampton, New York, where I enjoy my garden and working on new art projects in my studio. For as long as I can recall I have been an artist. I received all manner of instruction since I was a child, from the MOMA to The Art Student’s League to Pratt Institute, and plenty of private lessons in between. But my avocation always was writing, maybe because my parents both wrote and my mother was an English teacher in the New York City School system.   The years have been filled with a mad variety of events; it has been a long eventful journey.    Here’s the thing. In the midst of my lifetime full of the creation of art and homes and gardens, there were other things, traumatic and joyful, mostly monumental, that occurred. Originally, I kept journals as a record of events. Ultimately these journals morphed into a memoir and then an autobiography. It became so long and complex that I was forced to divide it into three then four separate books.

The story centers around Molly Stewart, who has traveled with her twin brother Cameron from Atlanta to Wyoming to solicit financial help for the struggling family business from their Aunt Alma, whom they believe to be the owner of the Rocking J cattle ranch. In fact, Alma is the local madam, a secret she hopes to keep from her niece and nephew by enlisting Ned Lawson, foreman of the Rocking J, in an elaborate charade. Meanwhile Cameron maneuvers to marry off Molly to Page, the evil cattle boss who has hired a band of Texas gunslingers to clear the area of homesteading. Events follow a predictable course: Ned and Molly bashfully fall in love; Molly is rescued from Page's clutches in the nick of time; Aunt Alma assumes ownership of the Rocking J. The romance has its happy ending, but the showdown between the good guys and the gunslingers belies any notion of justice, closing the novel on a pessimistic note.Copyright 1992 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If you are searching for a fresh, original and engrossing murder mystery I highly recommend The Thornhill Covenant.From an avid reader...It is a gorgeously written and involving book. Mr. Firmes wove an intricate plot, with the feelings of men and women in their tangled relationships. Each character struggling to find a fulfilling life, as the story unfolds in such unexpected ways. Both the past and present come alive and the characters are uniquely drawn and complexly human.

Dennis has one daughter, Jessica Bailey Ischy, and two sons, Robert and Ryan Lively. Dennis' writing career has spanned 15 years and over 600 titles now with the great majority of his works being digital. He's just come to Amazon for physical books to be published and to take advantage of the Kindle platform for digital publishing. Dennis enjoys writing \"how-to\" books so much that nearly all of his 600+ books are in the \"how-to\" classification. He's just discovered children's books and has published a children's series entitled \"The Amazing Adventures Of The Fabulous Bushytail Brothers\" More children's titles are scheduled to be published soon. (That's probably due to Daniel, Dennis' only grandchild being born just 6 months ago!) Lately, Dennis has returned to the roots of his youth and started writing science fiction...and in his typical \"energizer bunny\" style of working has 18 titles just about ready to release to the public. Dennis has been a musician most of his life and has been lucky enough to be the musical director for revival groups like The Drifters, The Platters, The Coasters, Tommy James, Dennis Yost and others. Dennis also hosts Self Publishers Talk Radio each Thursday evening at 6:30PM eastern time. The show features conversations with self published authors who give their best tips to the listeners.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 20.0}

After reading dozens of books on diving, I could not find one that portrayed the depth of what's like to live as a regular person. Stories about the daring and bravado of adventurous souls defying the laws of physiology and physics as they venture into forbidding depths and venues are abundant and well-written and they satisfy one aspect of my life.But I also wanted to read how we too, are regular people. How we fall in love, struggle with the nuances of life, and share our love as we try to leave our mark in the world. I wanted something that showed that under the glamorous gear, lies a spouse, parent, or child, a sensible being doubting his worth as a human and confronting the tests of life.Here's my gift to you. I try to capture and do justice to the magic that is diving but I also capture the magic of being a regular human who finds escape and meaning in the addicting world of diving. A world that forges strong friendships with those who share our passion, a world where our diving buddies become icons in our lives.Salute!Holden Gerrig", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A native of Astoria, N.Y, he grew up there and then in Greece & took his psychological training at the Institute of Anthropos in Athens. His mentors there were George and Vasso Vassiliou, respectively a psychiatrist and a psychologist both trained at the University of Chicago. The Vassilious' approach concentrated on people's strengths, examining how they best function in the workplace. By the late 1990's this approach had become generally known as \"positive psychology,\" emphasizing optimism, strengths and values.  After leading change at child welfare agencies in N.Y., Dr. Tavantzis and his family moved to King of Prussia, Pa. where he opened a private practice for a national psychology group. Many of his clients there were laid off managers and engineers from the aerospace industry.  Helping them back to a place where they could use their strengths and talents productively re-awakened and stimulated Tom's interest in career counseling.  \"They felt powerless to control their own lives because they had relied on the company to give a path to advancement,\" Dr. Tavantzis says. \"They didn't realize what they were really good at and were afraid to take the next step. This, of course, impacted all aspects of their lives. In 1990, Dr. Tavantzis became affiliated with the Highlands Company, which emphasizes working with the Whole person.  In 1986 he founded Innovative Management Development (IMD), which works with both corporations and their employees.   \"Not surprisingly, managers who know their own strengths are far better at recognizing the strengths in others,\" he says.  \"Our last 15 years of experiences with different industries suggest that our methodology is sound & helpful & that we can customize our programs\" \"We recently developed a program called 'Invest In Yourself' which assists employees at all levels in developing their career visions.\"  IMD clients have included both national and global companies.  Dr. Tavantzis also has served as Director of both the Evening BA Organizational Psychology Program as well as the Graduate Organizational Psychology concentration. Currently he is an Adj. Prof., OD and Leadership Grad. Program at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia. He and his wife, Martha Taylor Tavantzis, live in Media, Pa. and have three grown children.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As early as kindergarten, Piper began her adventure as a storyteller. It wasn't long before others caught on that her talented storytelling was actually a disguise for her tendency to be a pathological liar. Luckily, by the time high school rolled around she got her act together and began to channel her bad girl tendencies into something constructive. By the age of 16 she had written her novel, Silent Witness; a John Grisham- like tale about the treachery and brutality of the Colombian cartel. Before ever hitting the book shelves, Silent Witness was adapted into a screenplay that was picked up by a major Hollywood studio. It was at this time that Piper learned the harsh lessons of Hollywood and the literary world. NEVER pay an agent one measly dollar until you have a contract in your hands and listen to your parents when they advise you against blindly sending $500 to have your dreams come true overnight. Sometimes parents actually know what they are talking about. For the next several years (okay, about 20 years) Piper held onto her dream of becoming a published novelist, but decided to take up procrastination instead. It didn't pay well, but it sure felt great to get nothing accomplished and pursue other random dreams. Finally, in 2012, after an eight year period as a social worker and a seven year stint as a business owner Piper decided it was time to get back into the habit of storytelling . . . err, writing. She began freelancing and ghost writing for several popular websites, while continuing to postpone writing her original work. Piper's mother had told her during her teenage years that writers write what they know. Of course, she didn't take her mother's advice back then and continued to write about drug cartels (because didn't you know that every 16 year old living in rural Missouri knows about drug cartels? Meth - maybe. Colombia drug runners - no). However, in true Piper fashion, after 20 years she finally took that parental advice. In October of 2013, Piper debuted her first novel, The Waiting Room, a story about the complexities of family, the invisible bonds that connect people, and the pain that can reverberate through the choices we make. Piper Punches lives 45 minutes from downtown St. Louis with her husband and two daughters. She continues procrastinate and write on a daily basis and is excited to share her stories with readers each and every day!", "related": [], "rank": 1497191, "title": "Missing Girl", "author": "Piper Punches", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 4.6667, "rating_total": 42.0}

I've never seen techniques and talent presented in such a way as to be concurrently hugely aspirational yet completely approachable. I look forward to learning all the skills that I, as an artist in rolled fondant, have only the most rudimentary grasp of. Not since Cakewalk by Margaret Braun have I been this excited about a cake book. Bravo!\" Chef Duff Goldman, Ace of Cakes \"If you love buttercream you'll adore this book. Lots of fascinating techniques to try and lovely ideas to develop. Thank you Valeri and Christina for generously sharing your buttercream secrets.\" Lindy Smith, author of The Contemporary Cake Decorating Bible \"There are numerous new and fresh techniques in the book ... but the main take-away for me was that buttercream designs are limited only by one's imagination. The authors' examples are inspirational and a demonstration of what is possible if you 'put your whole heart into it.' Overall, Valeriano and Ong have created a book full of inspiration and encouragement that re-energizes the use of buttercream in modern cake design.\" Sonya Hong, American Cake Decorating magazine", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
