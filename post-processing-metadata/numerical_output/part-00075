Applying \"early adopter\" buzzwords to Lincoln, Wheeler's inquiry into his use of the telegraph has the spirit of a management consultant appraising a client's leadership style. The author relates that Lincoln personally sent out 1,000 telegrams during the Civil War, learning along the way what was or wasn't effective. Initially an intermittent user, Lincoln at times was so reliant on rapid communication that he spent nights at the War Department's telegraph office. Every Lincoln reader is familiar with this image, and Wheeler taps into this common memory by quoting Lincoln's telegraphic words on these occasions. They group most numerously around specific battles (e.g., 1862's Second Battle of Bull Run) and Lincoln's reprieves of condemned soldiers. Expanding on this footnote to history, Wheeler shows a Lincoln groping for a best-use of new technology and learning the limitations of the \"killer app.\"Gilbert TaylorCopyright © American Library Association.

Various species of Juniperus have been increasing in density and are expanding into associated grasslands, reducing the size of the grasslands. The reason for the Juniperus expansion is highly debated, but seems to be related to high levels of herbivory, changing fire frequency and probably global change phenomena. Western North American Juniperus Communities addresses various aspects of the biology, ecology, and management of Juniperus woodlands and savannas, by synthesizing past, current, and proposed future research. The book includes information on community distribution, composition, and structure; the effects of alterations in ecosystem processes such as modifications in water budgets; and the impacts of humans, herbivory, and fire on the communities. The book will provide professionals with a solid background in Juniperus ecosystems, enabling them to better understand the communities and manage the communities for maximum sustained productivity and diversity.

In the company of St. Augustine he ponders what it means to live a mature Christian life. The charm is found not only in Meilaender’s wisdom (winnowed by experience) but also in his inventive selection of passages from Augustine (often unnoticed by others) and in the leisurely pace of his prose. Nothing is hurried as Meilaender patiently teases out the issues without rushing to conclusions. This is a book that invites reflection.\"William Werpehowski— Villanova University \"A splendid account of the shape of Christian identity and the Christian moral life. With characteristic wisdom and insight, Gilbert Meilaender develops the continuities and tensions present in our loves for God and neighbor, as they are made manifest in political life, sexual bonds, and the experience of grief. One of our finest Christian ethicists has written his finest book to date.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jim McTaggart takes a look CARLOS I, who was crowned King of Spain at the age of 17, became the most powerful figure in Europe as an aggressive warlord and Holy Roman Emperor. She starts this tale as Carlos settles into a remote monastery after his abdication in 1557, at the age of 56. She flits back to episodes of his life through conversations involving him and his long-suffering servants. By this time the former monarch is most unlike an emperor: stooped and worn, his body is \"witness to years of over-indulgence in food and drink\". He had lost most of his teeth and the sight of him eating was offensive to the eye and stomach. Food was sloshed and squashed about in his mouth before being sluiced down his throat with a good swilling of wine or beer. \"As you can imagine,\" murmurs the narrator, \"he prefers to dine alone, and his companions are more than happy when he does.\" Carlos suffered from gout and other ailments, so he had to be carried around in a chair and continually washed and pampered with vinegar bandages. Ointment had to be applied in a way that doesn't bear thinking about. But surely he was once a great leader? Er, no. He ruled with an iron fist, but Spanish blood and treasure were squandered on his hopeless ventures. Spain ended up bankrupt, in debt to the tune of seven million gold ducados. Well, perhaps he was especially kind to his mother? No, again. He treated Queen Juana with the utmost cruelty, keeping her locked away for many years. Some historians have taken a more sympathetic view of him and his deeds during a tempestuous era in which Europe was divided by continuous feuds, with Spain heavily involved, but Carlino's Carlos is a brutal and greedy tyrant. What motivated Carlos? Was it pride in his country, empire, the Catholic faith, himself or the Hapsburg dynasty to which he belonged? Carlino's narrator leaves it to the reader to decide. --J. McTaggartI have just finished Linda Carlino s latest book A Matter of Pride. From the title to the last full stop it is an enthralling read! Although I m here on my own I give her three cheers - and loud ones at that! Well done! I am very impressed with her use of an all-knowing narrator. From the very start he brings you right into the story with a warm personal welcome, offering a few revealing and intimate details so almost immediately I felt I was one of the characters in the novel. It is a story that at times is sad, at others very funny. I didn t want it to end. It is an accomplished performance and a wonderful follow up to her first historical novel That Other Juana. --Alain TomasThis is a wonderful book; a story successfully combining historical accuracy with masses of fiction. The generally accepted imposing figure of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor: king, general, lawmaker, and the defender of Christendom is shown here to be a man of faults and failings, of generosity and tenderness, of passions and regrets, all in equal measure and always to excess. This Charles is revealed through his everyday dealings with those around him and, more interestingly, by the author s use of a unique and amusing narrator who gossips regularly with us highlighting the emperor s reactions, usually intolerant and immoderate, both towards his family and to events in the empire. Even at the story s moving close this all-seeing, all-knowing, all-telling narrator leaves us still pondering, who really was this greatest emperor since Charlemagne ? --J.

Every twelve seconds a woman is beaten, raped or maimed by a man in this country today.Five Keys For Understanding Men exposes the deepest drives and most pervasive needs that lay at the core of the male psyche. Dr. Gary Malone and Susan Mary Malone collaborate to reveal the five needs driving the lives of all men, and that by knowing what these are, women can understand their men, who they are, how to predict their responses and actions in any given circumstance.Complete with case studies, checklists, as well as questions and answers, Five Keys For Understanding Men will enable women readers to separate the healthy traits of their men from the unhealthy, borderline, and dangerous ones.

(Walter Enloe, professor of education and human studies, Hameline University)Wurdinger and Carlson clearly understand that experiential education is a broad concept that is not narrowly defined to a specific methodology or programmatic manifestation. This is a commendable effort to develop language that experiential educators from very different perspectives can use to talk with one another and to the broader world of educational policy making in general. (Jasper Hunt, coordinator, Experiential Education Graduate Program, Minnesota State University-Mankato)The book provides conceptual understanding and is nonprescriptive in the delivery of theory and knowledge about this growing field that is crossing different academic content borders.... Written in a user-friendly style, this book is quite easy to read and is useful for different audiences.... Recommended. (CHOICE)After reading the book I find the approaches unassailable. The author's of this book have discovered five major themes of importance if the education system in America wants to get it right: 1. Motivation and interest is always the key to learning 2. Learning is much more complex than regurgitating facts 3. Applying, doing and producing enhances long-term memory and productivity 4. Schools and teachers that use the experiential methods discussed in this book produce a different and superior set of skills than do schools that are using traditional delivery methods 5. This superior set of skills is not measured by NCLB and AYP measurements. Research and experience as discussed in this book prove that experiential forms of learning are superior in many ways. And the author's also point out that schools as presently structured can move in this direction. Or, if not, there are ways to create schools that restructure to accommodate experiential learning.

At sixteen, she made love with the boy of her dreams, Alex Kane, only to spend the rest of her summers waiting for him to return to her.   At nineteen, her parents died in a plane crash, leaving her destitute.  And now, years later, after she's clawed her way to a top management position, she's just been fired.  Left with little money and no prospects, Abigail learns that her great aunt has died, leaving Abigail the house she'd spent all her summers in.  Abigail jumps at the chance for a change of scenery, and heads off to North Carolina to claim her inheritance.  What she finds isn't exactly what she was hoping for.  Not only has she inherited a house with serious structural problems and no money to fix it, but her aunt Leila has also made another bequest: Abigail is to care for Leila's best friend, Belle.  Belle is cranky and cantankerous, and she's the grandmother of Abigail's long lost love, Alex.  When Alex shows up on the scene, Abigail can hardly wait to lay into him for leaving his grandmother destitute, dependent on the charity of others.   But it seems that Belle has been busy manipulating both Abby and Alex.  It's Belle's fondest dream to see the two married, and with her help, and a bit of supernatural influence, she just might get her way.  Although the romance doesn't start up until at least a quarter of the way into the story, once Alex and Abby get together, this story takes off.Mariah Stewart certainly has a charming way with characters! Carolina Mist is quite an entertaining read! As with Mariah Stewart's other books, atmosphere abounds in Carolina Mist!Annette Carney  --Copyright © 1994-97 Literary Times, Inc.

Tell me why I should buy your comic fiction?It's funny -- at least I thought so -- thought-provoking,  explores big issues and my wife wants you to know that none of the female characters are based on her.What's the big idea?Using comic fiction to sneak up on people and ask profound questions about who we are, what the universe is like,  what we do with our sense of lostness, and what risks we take to love and be loved.All the best comedy, or all the comedy that I like the best, is a bit of a ridge-walk: a carefree hike but with scary drops on either side.Where do you get your ideas?Can't remember. I've always liked the idea of exploring 'the world behind our world'.  We work hard to choose our clothes and fix our teeth, because that's the parts of us people see. But what do our souls look like? What influences them? How can all that be pictured? Our souls are so big and real, so much the essence of who we are, and yet so abstract. By setting my book with one foot on earth and one in the afterlife, I'm able to have fun making visible what's normally hidden.I've borrowed the afterlife scenery from John Milton'sParadise Lost. I've carefully stripped it of all epic and noble content, and made my fictional Pandemonium a place of bureaucracy, vanity, power struggles, sales conferences and disruptive grace.  It's absolutely the most fun I've ever had on a computer keyboard.How long have you been writing?All my life. My first non-fiction book was published when I was 24. My second, published when I was 26, went on to sell around 50,000 copies. I peaked early.What authors have inspired you?English comic writers like P G Wodehouse, Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett. Also C. S Lewis, who was a genius at retelling the Christian story using fiction, something no-one's done as well since. (He's still best-selling in that genre, and he died in 1963.) Then the science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke. When I came across Clarke, a physicist and engineer, writing mind-stretching fiction and elegant and coherent non-fiction I knew what I wanted to do with my life.(Interestingly, Clarke and Lewis, who held diametrically opposite views on things like faith and technology, once had a happy evening of dialogue in an English pub. Lewis brought along his friend J R R Tolkien. One of those conversations you'd have liked to sit in on...)Who's your favourite character in the book?That would have to be Caroline, the ex-girlfriend of main protagonist, Jamie. She was supposed only to have a walk-on part, but I noticed that every time she appeared, Jamie lit up, and their relationship was irresistible to write about, limping along in its misunderstandings and asynchronous love. She's so gorgeous and Jamie loves her so much, but he's missed his chance. As I re-wrote drafts, Caroline kept insisting on having more scenes, and I saw how she could be a vehicle for Jamie's gropings towards honesty about who he really was. How could I resist?There's a lot of food mentioned in the book: Afghan (murtabak), Indian (for example, roti prata), Singaporean Chinese (Hainanese Chicken Rice) and Malay (Mee Goreng, Laksa, Nasi Lemak). Have you eaten all these foods?Yes, and I keep working at it.

It took me about 12 hours to read through the Kindle version, and I could scarcely put it down. Reading it brings out how much suffering is caused by the unfair division of wealth, but even more how love in the family helps everyone to overcome.  I recommend it strongly.  L.

He briefly studied engineering, then law, and contributed to university magazines while a student. Despite life-long poor health, he was an enthusiastic traveller, writing about European travels in the late 1870s and marrying in America in 1879. He contributed to various periodicals, writing first essays and later fiction. His first novel was Treasure Island in 1883, intended for his stepson, who collaborated with Stevenson on two later novels. Some of Stevenson's subsequent novels are insubstantial popular romances, but others possess a deepening psychological intensity. He also wrote a handful of plays in collaboration with W.E. Henley. In 1888, he left England for his health, and never returned, eventually settling in Samoa after travelling in the Pacific islands. His time here was one of relatively good health and considerable writing, as well as of deepening concern for the Polynesian islanders under European exploitation, expressed in fictional and factual writing from his final years, some of which was so contrary to contemporary culture that a full text remained unavailable until well after Stevenson's death. R. L. Stevenson died of a brain haemorrhage in 1894.", "related": ["B004UJN0AE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Blenkush2011246 pagesIn John J. Blenkush's latest novel,Stacy's Story, the lives of a young married couple are irreparably damaged and changed by one man attempting to cover up a crime. What begins as a two week hiking and camping vacation in Taylor Lake, California quickly turns into a nightmare. Love, survival, and retribution are the main themes of this tale of good vs. evil. In this book, Blenkush exploits the full range of the human experience, from abject fear to unrelenting courage.A gun shot changes the course of Stacy's life during the five terrifying days that Brock holds Stacy captive. The physical and psychological terror he inflicts upon the young nurse forces her to relinquish her dependent nature and take on the hard, callous perspective of a cold blooded criminal in order to save her life. As the days pass, Stacy develops a toughness that morphs into super human courage and a burning desire for revenge.This story is powerful and emotionally overwhelming. Blenkush stresses his protagonist in every possible way, down to the heartbreaking battle she wages against her maternal instinct in the days before she learns who her son's father is. And yet, she survives it all.The greatest take away from this book for me is that, even though the main character is a woman, Blenkush allows her to adapt and grow throughout her horrible experience using every resource she comes with as an individual. He does not portray her gender as a hindrance. Stacy is simply a human being doing everything within her power to survive.Stacy's Storyis an incredible story. I highly recommend it. Melissa Brown LevineforIndependent Professional Book Reviewersbookreviewers.orgmelissabrownlevine.com", "related": ["B006SMNP4W"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

How would you know what sort of world this is? What resources might you find? Is there some way to get off the world? This is the basic premise ofTo Rule the Universeand a rumor of another spaceship sends Meredon traveling across the face of an increasingly intriguing world. Meredon discovers that this world is crucial to a plot to disrupt the economy of the civilized worlds and here we have a coincidence, the criminal involved was also the mastermind behind events inthe Faces of Immortality.However,  the meeting of a top investigator with civilization-s top criminal is no more a coincidence than Sherlock Homes- meeting with his old adversary, Moriarty.

Inside, readers will find immortal baby boomers (forever with us and always playing '60s music), a new form of onanism that creates an unplanned self-pregnancy crisis, and even intelligent zombies who scheme and plan. The short sketches are reminiscent of futures that Kurt Vonnegut, or his character Kilgore Trout, might have explored in depth. In some of Kutner's vignettes, our desires and wants, deeply pursued by science, create fatuous or insufferable prospects. In others, we're given a glimpse into a random person's life, such as a journal entry from the man who cleans up trash left by time travelers. A testament to a deeply creative mind,The Future According to Medefies categorization and will find a place among those who love pondering questions that begin: “What if …?” --Paul Diamond", "related": [], "rank": 461496, "title": "The Future According To Me (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Rob Kutner", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.8333, "rating_total": 23.0}

His father, Arthur, supported the family working for Ballantine Beer as a salesman, then manager.  Ballantine Beer was one of the New York Yankees principal sponsors so if you see Al wearing that cap, you’ll understand. His mother, Victoria, an editor and author, insisted on literacy for her children. The Webster’s dictionary was always at hand.  Al attended Webster Academy for few years, a New England prep school. He likes to describe his experiences there as a cross between “Animal House,” and “Dead Poets Society.” For awhile Al lived in Manhattan’s ‘rocking’ lower East side, aka the ‘East Village.’ It was the late sixties then. While there he worked for the famed rock concert hall, ‘the Fillmore East,’ and later the company that filmed and produced the documentary film about ‘Woodstock.’  At age twenty-one Al recounts the surprising and unusual loss of his hair. A condition defined as Alopecia that affects a relatively small segment of the population in various forms. Al laughingly says he never did anything half-way citing the proof that he has the most severe form of the condition. For the last nearly 30 years Albert has been a professional in the investment community. He is an avid fan of cars, motorcycles, various genres of music, baseball, stout, good Scotch or Irish whisky, and of course- his two kids. Al say’s-‘One Rode In’ started with the development of one character on a snowy evening. A shoot of very green grass rooted and grew, and grew. Thanks Mom, thanks Webster, thanks Alopecia, thanks life!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After enlisting in the U.S. Navy in 1960 and completing the Nuclear Power School program, Gary Penley embarks on a series of adventures-often at risk of his life-while serving on a submarine as a power plant operator. During his seven years with the navy, Penley and his shipmates encounter several frightening situations. While on submerged patrol in the Mediterranean Sea, his submarine, the USS Hamilton, strikes a heavy object, which tears a large hole in the ballast tank and threatens to sink the submarine. Later, they ride out a ferocious storm in the Arctic Circle that nearly submerges the vessel. Another harrowing experience occurs when the sailors, while on a top-secret mission in the Mediterranean during the Six-Day War, are attacked by unknown enemy ships and barely escape unscathed. Throughout his expeditions, Penley stops in such countries as Spain, Scotland, Italy, and Japan. In this captivating memoir, he recounts the coping skills necessary to live in a confined space for extended patrols while facing constant danger-often resulting in hilarious scenarios that only wild submarine sailors could conjure. He also provides a detailed description of the submarine and explains how the machines operate. Written in first person, Deep Venture carries the reader along for the epic ride.", "related": ["B0052YQLWA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The layers of complexity made me want to write about the subject matter.   I wanted diversity in my characters...some white, some black, some mixed.  I wanted  to demonstrate the outcome of those who faced the \"person in the mirror\" and the outcome of those who didn't.  I've been told that this book reads like a movie...starting you off right in the middle of the action --and yes, that was definitely my intent.  I hope you enjoy it....and thanks for sharing your reading time with me....J.

I would say that Los Angeles has been the love of my life. I had been a writer for the L.A. Free Press and Entertainment Weekly. At Warner Bros./Tamara Music I'd written over 300 songs and have had three plays produced. Most of my life, 37 years, has been spent waiting behind the wheel of a car and writing on a portable tablet or synthesizer in the driver's seat while waiting for important passengers in driveways. Sometimes for 72 hours at a stretch. I did some racing but I was primarily a chauffeur for the Department of State, Justice, Commerce, Senate, Saudi Royal Family, Brunai Royal Family and many celebrities and front pagers. There was plenty of seat time to write music and text. I'll add that I had well over one million miles with no tickets or accidents. My father was a leading architect who had lived in Taliesin East and Taliesin West with his teacher Frank Lloyd Wright and had traveled with him to Japan to study earthquake damage there. He also went to Mexico in 1957 for DMJM to investigate their damage. He was instrumental in changing the L. A. building code to allow structures over thirteen stories IF they built to code. It became apparent that so many, through cost cutting, were below standard and are clearly dangerous. My father's longtime friend was a teacher at the Sherman Indian School in Riverside. I spent many days playing with Mojave, Serrano, Navajo and Apache kids there. My fifth grade classmate, Socorro, was Tongva/Gabrielino and had challenged our teacher about their 'extinction.' She taught me a lot. My ex-wife, and still BFF, is Irish/Oglala Sioux, so my interest in the trials and survival of the Tongva Nation comes from within. The books underway include two on Los Angeles tectonic plates, earthquake peril, nuclear plants, and a novel with very graphic automobile chases on identifiable L.A. streets and canyons. \"The Birth of Los Angeles - And the Genocide of the Tongva\" The cover price for the 484 page paperback is: $19.95. The Kindle and E-books  price is: $8.00", "related": ["B00307S9XK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In River Run, Freya and her sister have spent years locked in the basement of the Man Upstairs. When Kat disappears, Freya escapes into the winter-bound city to search for her. After nearly freezing to death, she is rescued by young drifter Finn, who is on his way to \"Norlins\" where he hopes to find his family. They head south in his canoe, trying to avoid slaver bands, who are always looking for fresh victims. In Plague Riders, Shep, 14, delivers Doctor St. John's homemade medicine to the river communities in what used to be Wisconsin. When he learns that his parents may be alive in a settlement that is scheduled to be burned out as a plague spot, he and his fellow Rider Cara head for Dusty Hollow despite St. John's refusal to give permission, and they are pursued by the doctor's sadistic enforcer, Vargas. Beyond the apocalyptic setting, there are no evident connections between these two titles. Hints about the Fall and its causes are scattered throughout the texts, but there is much that remains unrevealed. The post-Fall world is a rough place, and the books contain considerable physical violence, both on- and offstage. There is some obliquely implied sexual violence as well, such as St. John's \"interest\" in Cara and other young girls and the two sisters' undefined relationship with the Man Upstairs. Not all of the plot threads are resolved, implying possible sequels to come. The short text (approximately fourth-grade reading level) and intriguing design of these books will appeal to challenged and reluctant readers in middle and high school.-Elaine Knight, Lincoln Elementary Schools, ILα(c) Copyright 2011.

The first presents information on roughly 250 individuals named in the Bible whom Eisenberg considers most important to understanding the text. Though useful, this tool is highly selective. The entry for Hilkiah, for example, does not indicate that many other individuals mentioned in the Bible have the same name. And it is important to note that Bible here refers to the sacred texts of Judaism, known to Christianity as the Old Testament without the books of the Apocrypha.   The Talmud is the masterwork of rabbinic Judaism, comprised of the Mishnah—a written compilation of rabbinic oral commentaries and discussions on the first five books of the Hebrew Bible—and the Gemarra, a rabbinic commentary on the Mishnah. Eisenberg’s handy volume brings together information on more than 250 of the more than 2,000 rabbis and scholars mentioned in the Talmud. Entries usually include passages from the Talmud that nicely introduce the wisdom of these Jewish sages in their own words.   These A-Z volumes are concise and informative and are recommended for theological and research libraries as well as academic and large public libraries with extensive Judaica collections. --Christopher McConnell", "related": [], "rank": 3505762, "title": "Essential Figures in the Bible", "author": "Ronald L.

As the oldest child of three children, Dave learned at an early age the importance of fiscal responsibility and living within his means. Some of his earliest memories are of his parents teaching him, and his siblings, how to conserve and stretch their family’s resources in order to survive on her limited income. In fact, Dave now proudly shares that his parents never earned more than $51,700 in a year; yet helped put all three children through college.   The lessons from his early life have remained with Dave ever since childhood and he readily shares them with his audience and clients. Today, although financially a little better off than while growing up, Dave and his family still incorporate many money-saving practices into their daily lives and happily live within their means. Many of the very same tips, tricks and ideas on cost-cutting and resourcefulness that are in this book come from the very same things the Ramson family does on a daily basis.", "related": [], "rank": 1852884, "title": "Money Saving Emergency Plan - Proven, No B.S.

He worked as farmhand in Texas, Apothecary, dishwasher, translator for the German Western Post in St. Louis, and as Journalist in San Francisco. In the year 1898 he found himself as part of the US Army reporting on the battle of Signal Hill in Cuba.This stage of his life was documented in his novel Der deutsche Lausbub in Amerika which translates as \"The German prankster in America\".

She started writing for fun when she was a child and loved escaping into imaginary worlds. Alcamia has had a varied career life both in the arts, media and alternative healing and medicine but always had the dream of being a writer, something she’s been able to put into practice over the last few years. She started by writing pure romance but says her writing really came alive when she studied Anais Nin and began to put some hot passion and erotica into her stories. An avid science fiction and fantasy buff she also loves exploring all aspects of the paranormal and sciences and hopes that her work will always be fresh and thought provoking and give the reader something to think about. As she says, ‘there’s nothing I won’t tackle and if I come up with a simple idea for a story whether it’s mainstream, gay, lesbian or fantasy - I’ll have a crack at it. I like to be continually writing and active.’ If asked if she has a first love with story telling - it always has to be a story with a strong and passionate romance as its basis. She also likes her characters to be strong and a bit different and able to accept their faults and use them. She loves giving talks about books and magic, is an ardent lover of nature and cats and enjoys ballet, Victorian costume, collecting books and travelling.

By that yardstick, authorTony Bianco hits it out of the park withProstate Problems, a book about hisbattle with BPH, or benign prostate hyperplasia.Told in short chapters, the book reveals with frank language how Bianco beganto have trouble urinating in his late 40s, was finally diagnosed with BPH and thenstruggled to find a regimen of medications to keep the condition in check beforefinally having a transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP, to solve theproblem.Upon learning that the drug he's about to try is an \"alpha blocker,\" he notes: \"I don't like the sound ofthis. How are blockers going to unblock me?\"The account of his operation and a brief flash of anger at his doctor for notdisclosing more information up front, as well as humor at his own expense abouta painful and humiliating condition, give readers a rooting interest in Bianco'srecovery.What most stands out, though, is the realization that a conditionthought of as minor (by anyone who doesn't have it, anyway) can be so all-consuming.Prostate Problemswill provide vital aid and comfort (and hard-earned laughs) toanyone dealing with BPH, but it will also help friends and family betterunderstand and sympathize with a largely undiscussed condition. Bianco puthimself out there - way out there - and the risk pays off nicely in this highlyreadable account.Also available as an ebook.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Michael Dear deploys a rigorous social science mixed with the fresh eye of an explorer to guide us through the 'third nation' that has sprung up between Mexico and the US.\"-Sergio Aguayo, El Colegio de México\"In this lucid, concise, engaging, graceful, and constructive volume, Michael Dear draws on insights from across the social sciences and humanities to map the emergence and significance of a 'third nation,' formed from the juxtaposition, interconnection, and exchange between Mexico and the United States on both sides of their increasingly blurred political border. Dear argues convincingly and eloquently that the physical barrier being constructed along the US-Mexico frontier is an unprecedented and damaging historical aberration that will eventually be overwhelmed by the strong, positive human connections between the United States and Mexico.\"-Abraham F. Lowenthal, Professor Emeritus, University of Southern California\"A comprehensive history of the multiple tensions and processes related to the creation and strengthening of the demarcation at the U.S.-Mexican border, based on a transnational and transdisciplinary perspective that recovers the multiplicity of visions and challenges on both sides of the border. The most novel aspect of Dear's approach is the complex and optimistic emphasis placed on the social and cultural practices of border people, which show connectivity, continuity, and the possibility of thinking about a region without walls. This is a challenge not only to the notion of border and nation, but also a powerful counterargument to the discourses of fear that permeate perceptions of one of the world's most sensitive geopolitical edges.\"-Norma V. Iglesias-Prieto, Professor and Chair, Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies, San Diego State University\"This is an important, elegantly written volume that reflects the very hybridity it seeks to portray: it flips between Mexican origins and U.S. politics, between cultural studies and hard social science, between the personal and the analytical with a playful skill and ease that captures the very spirit of the borderlands. Dear reveals the creation of a new border culture in which blended identities and daily transnational and transcultural interactions are emerging even as the walls between our two countries continue to rise.\"-Manuel Pastor, Professor of Sociology and American Studies and Ethnicity, University of Southern California", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The police think that Breckenridge killed his wife so he could marry his mistress. Harry engages skiptracer Caedmon Rivers to help with the search, and she convinces Harry that Afton is still alive, hoping to cash in her investments. Harry continues his search and finds evidence that a wealthy friend of Afton’s may be involved in her disappearance. Then someone kidnaps Caedmon, rapes her, injects her with heroin, and leaves her for dead. There is plenty of action here, along with quirky characters, including Harry’s neighbor Tucker, a senior citizen who talks to his animals. Readers will also sympathize with Harry’s fear of intimacy, which keeps him from getting close to the attractive women who enter his life. An entertaining PI novel that will appeal to both hard-boiled and cozy fans. --Barbara Bibel", "related": [], "rank": 2246587, "title": "Birds of Winter (A Harry Brock Mystery)", "author": "Kinley Roby", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Those short stories often captured her life growing up on a 39-acre farm in Williamsburg, OH, a small town east of Cincinnati. There were horses, cows, pigs, dogs, and cats—basically, a zoo—which included three older brothers.

I grew up reading Agatha Christie and Erle Stanley Gardner, and I was very drawn to their plot-is-king-and-the-details-matter approach. I knew I wanted my book to have that no-nonsense, no-frills take, so I paid careful attention to crafting the plot and the denouement, and giving the reader a sporting chance of solving the murder before the end of the novel.Setting the book at an university appealed to me for a variety of reasons. As an academic, I'm very familiar with the environment of an university, life on campus, and the general atmosphere. Further, an university provides the necessary complex society for a entire series of novels - nearly every ethnicity, group and culture are represented in the population of a large university, and chance meetings and interactions can happen at any time without raising too many eyebrows. As an alum of Ohio State, I had intimate knowledge of the campus and the city of Columbus, and they fit all my needs. I briefly considered using a fictitious university but in the end I decided that the advantages of anchoring the surroundings to a real place outweighed the benefits of constructing my own. The Natural Victimstays true both to the surroundings and to the classic mystery genre. If you are a fan of writers like Agatha Christie or Margery Allingham, you will find this book a very enjoyable read.", "related": ["B00CJK8LIW"], "rank": 2717097, "title": "The Natural Victim (The Dieter Fox Mysteries Book 1)", "author": "Peter Reynard", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

(Brian Balogh, author ofA Government Out of Sight: The Mystery of National Authority in Nineteenth-Century America)Epsteinuses the history of American and British torpedo development to provide a thick description of the way boundaries between government and private industry eroded in the area of weapons development. Skillfully integrating military, legal, business, and technological history, she argues that the military-industrial complex began with torpedoes in the late-nineteenth century, not with atomic weapons in the mid-twentieth century.  This highly original, deeply researched book is an important contribution to scholarship on war and the state. (Mary L. Dudziak, author ofWar Time: An Idea, Its History, Its Consequences)This rich and powerful book reveals a hidden revolution in naval warfare, one at the heart of the creation of the modern military-industrial complex. It is a fresh and sure-footed account of the emergence of the torpedo. By making the weapon's significance and complexity clear for the first time,Torpedorewrites British and U.S. naval history. (David Edgerton, author ofEngland and the Aeroplane: Militarism, Modernity and Machines)You cannot understand the naval side of World War I without understanding the profound impact of torpedoes on the navies who fought--an impact that went well beyond the navies themselves. This book is an excellent guide to that story and to the technological revolution that brought it about. (Norman Friedman, author ofNetwork-Centric Warfare: How Navies Learned to Fight Smarter through Three World Wars)Torpedois the first detailed account of the development of naval torpedoes in the decades before World War I. But it is much more than that. It reveals the origin of the military-industrial complex, the fraught relations between governments and private firms, and the tangled legal history of intellectual property in weapons development. In doing so, it uncovers the complicated interconnections between technology, the military, and the law that historians of the period have previously ignored. (Daniel R. Headrick, author ofTechnology: A World History)This deeply researched book traces torpedoes' impact on the British and American navies before World War I. During this period of rapid technological change and intense geopolitical competition, torpedoes--cutting-edge weapons at the time--disrupted traditional naval tactics and strategies, forcing navies to make operational and procurement decisions in the face of pervasive uncertainty.Epsteindisplays a keen understanding of the challenges confronting naval officers and policy-makers, and the parallels with today's national-security affairs are striking. Highly recommended.

He has been living in London, UK, for the past ten years. At the age of eight, Dos Santos had to cope with the loss of his mother, Mariluci, who passed away suddenly, the victim of a brain aneurism when she was at the tender age of thirty. Since a very young age, he started to look for answers which could give him the comfort for such a dramatic loss in his life. He found in the Spiritism doctrine all the comfort he needed to continue his life, knowing that the death of the human body doesn’t mean the end but only the passage of our spirit from the material world to the spiritual world. He felt - and even saw - many times the presence of his deceased mother throughout his life. The most memorable and special experience was when, after recovering from a coma, he saw the spirits of his mother and his grandfather Benedito (who had passed away before Valter had been born). Both spirits had been around him and looking after his soul while his corporeal body had spent three days in a coma. His first romance, The Truth Never Dies, released in Europe and the USA in August 2012, was written with the intention to share with the readers all the comfort and peace he learnt from Spiritism. The romance quickly reached the number one spot in the Amazon US and UK lists. Having lived in the UK for over ten years, Valter Dos Santos is very thankful to the country that welcomed him with so much warmth and gave him so many opportunities. He remembers that at the beginning things were difficult, needing a lot of hard work and determination. “I worked very hard. It wasn’t easy but I never thought of giving up on my dreams,” he says. Nowadays Valter Dos Santos works for a multinational company. He remembers his past with great emotion and is very grateful for every opportunity received in his life. The author sends a message to his readers: Never give up your dreams. Throughout my life I heard a lot people telling me things like “You will never make it.” Many others even told me that I would never be able to write a book or get my manuscript published. I never paid attention to those people. I preferred to listen to my heart and to those who offered me words of support and motivation.Most importantly, I always kept my faith in God.I strongly believe that those who live with God within will never fail.

Jennifer Johnston is a\n girl struggling with her identity, surrounded by a terrifying family\nwho causes nightmares in all those who encounter them. She is a mystic, a\n vampyra with the talents of a shape-shifting witch. When her family\ntries to force her to marry her brother to keep their bloodline pure,\nshe refuses, but this only sets off a sequence of events that causes\neven greater fears. Meanwhile, two dylias, (commonly referred to as\nwerewolves,) named Jackson and Taylor, who are pack mates and lovers,\nmove forward in life as they live in fear of the mystics. Eventually,\nthe two werewolves reunite with Jennifer, joining forces, aiming to\nbring balance to their world.This is an interesting story because it\nbrings up new dynamics that have previously been unexplored in the realm\n of paranormal fantasy and romance. It was especially refreshing to see\ntwo male werewolves in a relationship with one another. The tension in\nthe story builds up from the start, as the reader is introduced to\nJennifer and the dysfunctional family that she is a part of. The\nbeginning of the narrative contains a lot of information and at times is\n confusing, but Johnson builds upon her story and explains all that is\nunforeseen by the end of the tale. If you are a fan of vampires and\nwerewolves, then this would be a great read for you, as it brings a\nstrong new voice to the already overflowing market of paranormal\nfiction. -Red City Review", "related": ["B00KFKXV10"], "rank": 10978, "title": "Dark Indiscretions (Dark Indiscretions Series Book 1) eBook", "author": "Shakuita Johnson", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 33, "rating_average": 4.0909, "rating_total": 135.0}

The heat emanating I recognize as coming from the fire of the Holy Spirit. He is also a man of faith reckless faith that is. This book is a vivid illustration of the same. Duncan's teachings and testimonies are very refreshing and edifying. We are friends and colleagues and I love him and his family dearly in the Lord. --Reinhard Bonnke, EvangelistIt is such an honor to write an endorsement for a new book written by one of your spiritual sons. I am very proud of Duncan, his fiery, bubbly, happy personality and his amazing insights into Scripture. He has been part of our leadership team in Toronto for many years and we have travelled to the nations of the world together with many a challenge and many a victory. We preachers often have the ability to speak on a vast number of topics, but generally we have only a few that we might call life messages. I have mine, and Duncan has his. One of his main life messages is about the oneness that we have in Christ as believers in Jesus. This is is a fantastic and glorious revelation, not new, but freshly presented. It has helped and strengthened our leadership team in Toronto. It has helped me personally to continue to move out of my spiritual orphan tendencies and into my place as a son of my Heavenly Father, where I belong.

With his mother and brother, he moved to England in 1919 and attended Rossall School in Lancashire before moving on to Cambridge University to study law. His studies there came to a halt when a publisher accepted his first novel. His third book, entitledMeet the Tiger!, was written when he was twenty years old and published in September 1928. It introduced the world to Simon Templar, aka the Saint.He continued to write about the Saint until 1983 when the last book,Salvage for the Saint, was published. The books, which have been translated into over thirty languages, number nearly a hundred and have sold over 40 million copies around the world. They’ve inspired, to date, fifteen feature films, three TV series, ten radio series, and a comic strip that was written by Charteris and syndicated around the world for over a decade. He enjoyed travelling but settled for long periods in Hollywood, Florida, and finally in Surrey, England. He was awarded the Cartier Diamond Dagger by the Crime Writers’ Association in 1992, in recognition of a lifetime of achievement. He died the following year.To find out more about Leslie Charteris and his work, visit www.lesliecharteris.com.", "related": [], "rank": 308169, "title": "Count on the Saint (The Saint Series)", "author": "Leslie Charteris", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Mostly because when he was grounded for his outlandish behavior as a hyperactive school child, the only place he was allowed to go was the public library. His literary tastes were forged by the works of Helen Hoke, Alvin Schwartz and Stephen Gammell, Ray Bradbury, Richard Matheson, Stephen King, Clive Barker, Edgar Allan Poe, and H. P. Lovecraft. He is the author of Spooky Creepy Long Island, and a contributing author to Forrest J. Ackerman’s Anthology of the Living Dead, Fracas: A Collection of Short Friction, The Call of Lovecraft, and Cashiers du Cinemart. He is currently working on ten novel-length book projects which will be released in 2014. He also publishes themed collections of interviews from his interview blog You Are Entitled To My Opinion. His reviews have been published by a variety of in print and online media including Scars Magazine, Icons of Fright, Fatally Yours and Screams of Terror, and he has appeared in Fangoria, Rue Morgue and HorrorHound Magazine. He is the Assistant Program Director for The Arkham Film Society and produces electronic music under the names Master Control and LOVECRAFTWORK. He is currently working on a novel-length expansion of a short-story titled, \"The End Of The World Is Nigh\", a crowd-funded, crowd-sourced, post-apocalyptic, zombie epidemic project.
