This book is his soapbox, and his message is eloquent, urgent, funny, irreverent, unapologetic and life-affirming. Older sailors are better sailors, he insists, and supports the claim with a dozen inspiring portraits of modern-day ancient mariners interspersed throughout the book.Reese Palley is an orator, haranguer, and cheerleader bent on enriching your life, but he is also a first-class coach. With the hard-won wisdom and practical knowledge of one who has been there (and stillisthere), he addresses your concerns about the physical demands of sailing, safety issues, sailing long distances with a medical condition, preparing for emergencies, and much more.Call of the Ancient Marinerdelivers the encouragement and know-how you need to keep your sea legs under you and enjoy smooth sailing for years to come.A manifesto for all fellow ancient mariners\"People die these days as much from boredom and irrelevance as from disease. Antiquarian depression is pandemic in America. To help others avoid so depressing a fate, this handbook shares with the reader the experiences of this Ancient Mariner. There are obvious adjustments to be made as physical and mental facilities alter and falter. Herein are tips and tricks to keep you sailing decades after you might have thought you were through with the sea. For a sailor, being through with the sea is like being through with life itself.

She argues that the impulse toward maintaining a cleanly outward appearance, which plays a central role in sexual attraction, is opposed by a psychological or religious desire for inner purity linked to Christian asceticism, which disdained physical adornment. Thanks to the development of an ethos of sanitary need in the Victorian era, which linked cleanliness to purity, personal hygiene has now reached the stage of general consensus, with newly emerging middle classes around the world eager to buy hygienic and cosmetic products to meet Western standards of appearance. Smith's chronicle is sprinkled with interesting details and draws on a broad cultural canvas, but the tone is academic; general readers will prefer to await a more popular history. 25 illus.(July)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Despite how well-made and well-cut the suit was, it felt wrong. He'd spent half his life in workout clothes, covered in sweat—he wasn't a suit kind of guy and probably never would be. But he'd come courting, and he was smart enough to know that he needed to look the part if he was going to convince Ray Marshall to leave his current trainer and join Fitzgerald Fighters' Gym.Before hitting the doorbell and announcing his arrival, Cooper squinted at the sleek, modern house Ray had just bought. Situated on the beachfront of the increasingly exclusive Sydney suburb of Bronte, he figured the place was worth well over 1.5 million. But he already knew that Ray wasn't hard up for cash. If Cooper was going to woo him to his stable, it was going to be about more than money. It was going to be about offering him the one thing that all fighters wanted: immortality. Just like every fighter who'd ever donned leather and sweated his rounds in the ring, Ray wanted to be remembered. Ali, Sugar Ray, Tyson—no one would ever forget their names, even if Tyson was as infamous these days as he was famous. And Cooper knew he could make Ray unforgettable. He had all the raw ingredients to become a legend of the sport rather than some guy who'd gotten lucky with a few heavy purses. Together, they could fly high.It was getting to the \"together\" bit that was going to take some fancy footwork, since Ray had been with his current trainer since he started.Aware that he was stalling, Cooper hit the bell. He was nervous. Like the suit, this was the part of setting up his own establishment that made him feel the least comfortable. He was a fighter, not some slick sales guy with a line of patter. Hell, he was only thirty-four. Not young by boxing standards, but if his body hadn't given out on him, he'd still be in the ring, giving up-and-comers like Ray a pounding. When he'd bought the gym last year, it had been with the long-term in mind. No way had he planned to be training at this age. That was supposed to come later.Muchlater.He glanced at his hands. A scar ran across his left knuckles. He rubbed it absently. He missed fighting. Stupid to pretend otherwise. But there was no point spending the rest of his life thinking about what might have been. The doctors had given him a clear choice after he'd detached the retina in his left eye in his last fight—keep fighting and go blind, or retire.Some choice.\"Hey, man, good to see you,\" Ray said as he opened the door. He gave Cooper a one-armed hug around the shoulders, the muscles of his big arms hard against Cooper's back.A heavyweight, Ray was an inch taller than Cooper, with a broad-nosed, heavy-browed face and olive skin. He wore his dark hair shaved close to his scalp, a style that made it easier for training and disguised the fact that it was rapidly receding.\"Good to see you, too,\" Cooper said. Before he'd retired three months ago, he and Ray had trained together for a while. There was plenty of mutual respect between them, a good foundation for a future partnership.\"Come on in and check out my new pad,\" Ray said with a big grin.Cooper followed him along a white carpeted hallway, the plush pile so deep and thick underfoot that he was almost in danger of breaking an ankle in the stuff. The hall opened into a huge living room with a high ceiling, slick black-leather-and-chrome furniture and lots of windows. The glare from the morning sun pouring through all the glass was almost unbearable and he squinted his eyes in self-defense.\"Yeah, I know, I gotta do something about that. Get some curtains or something,\" Ray said. \"Let's check out the pool.\"They passed through a state-of-the-art kitchen to a terrace that was dominated by a lap pool and a separate structure that housed a shiny gym bristling with high-end equipment, all of it visible through a wall of windows. Ray waved Cooper into one of the chairs arranged in a conversational grouping near the house.\"You want coffee?\" Ray asked.\"Sure. Why not?\" Cooper said.Ray stepped toward the house and opened the sliding door a crack.\"Yo, Jimmy—coffee would be great, thanks, if the offer's still good,\" he called.Cooper sat back, resting his right ankle on the knee of the opposite leg. Man, but his collar felt tight. Resisting the urge to run a finger under it like a kid at church on Sunday, he surveyed the rear of Ray's house.\"Great place, bro,\" he said.\"I like it,\" Ray said, laughing at his own understatement. He shook his head. \"If you could have seen where I grew up…\"Cooper understood. The best fighters were the ones who needed it as well as wanted it. They all had their hardluck stories, some harder than others.\"So, have you thought any more about my proposal?\" Cooper asked, cutting to the chase. They both knew this wasn't a social call.Behind Ray, he caught sight of a figure moving around the kitchen making coffee. Because Ray had used the nameJimmy,Cooper was surprised to see it was a woman. A really hot woman, he noted as she bent to retrieve something from a lower drawer. She was wearing a uniform, a plain back dress with a zip up the front and a white apron around her waist. When she leaned over he copped an eyeful of strong, athletic legs and a tight, round butt.Some guys preferred their women skinny like greyhounds but he'd never had a thing for bones. He liked women with breasts and butts, and strong, athletic women particularly got him going. Perhaps it was the combination of textures, hard and soft, silk and steel…He realized Ray was talking. He'd been so preoccupied with checking out the hired help that he'd missed half of it.\"…but I've got some reservations, I'd be lying if I said any different,\" Ray said. \"And I've got a favor to ask, if we can cut a deal.\"Damn. Had Ray just said yes to him, and he'd been busy staring at some bimbo's butt?Focus, Fitzgerald.\"I want us to be straight up if we're going to do this thing, Ray, so let me know what your concerns are and we'll deal with them,\" he said, keeping his gaze firmly on Ray now, even though he could still see the woman out of the corner of his eye.\"Well, you know, it's the experience thing. You've got no track record. Sorry, man, but it's true. You were one hell of a fighter, and I'd kill to have half your form, but you're freshly minted as a trainer,\" Ray said.Cooper nodded. \"You're right. I'm new, I'm untested— which means I'm also hungry. I like to win, Ray. You know that about me. I built a career being a winner. And I've trained with some of the best guys in the business—guys you don't have a chance of getting near because they're in the U.S. now, or they've retired. I've got a lot of knowledge and experience to pass on—and I'm hand-picking my boys because I only want to work with fighters who I know have what it takes to go all the way. You're at the top of my list, that's why I'm here,\" Cooper said.\"Yeah, sure, I bet you say that to everyone you're talking to,\" Ray said, and Cooper could tell he was only half joking.\"I'm not talking to anyone else just yet,\" Cooper said. \"Like I said, you're at the top of my list.\" Maybe it was a mistake to give away so much, but he hadn't come here to shadowbox. He held Ray's eye, and the other man slowly nodded.\"Okay. Okay. I'm interested,\" Ray said.Cooper grinned, and Ray grinned right back at him.\"So what's this favor you mentioned?\" Cooper said, jerking his tie loose and unbuttoning the collar on his shirt. They were on the downhill run now, he could feel it.\"I've got a friend, an up-and-comer. No fight record, just starting out. Loads of natural talent, strong, fast, great power. I said I'd put in a word with you,\" Ray said. His gaze slid over Cooper's shoulder as he spoke, and Cooper frowned.Was it just him, or did Ray look a little…uncomfortable?\"Fair enough. Get him to come down to the gym tomorrow. I'll take a look at him, put him through his paces. If I like what I see, I'll certainly consider him,\" Cooper said. That was as good as it was going to get. He had a reputation to build, and untried fighters would not do it for him.\"Uh, yeah. Thing is, it's ashe,not ahe,\" Ray said, rubbing the back of his neck.\"Sorry, Ray, but I don't follow women's boxing,\" Cooper said coolly, hoping Ray would get the hint and drop the subject.It wasn't that he thought women's boxing was wrong or freakish the way some of the old-timers did. He simply didn't think there were enough women out there truly committed to the sport. It was different for men. Often boxing was the only way out for them, and that gave them a hunger, a commitment that couldn't be faked.\"If you saw her fight, you'd know what I mean. She's good—really good. I think she could go all the way,\" Ray said.\"Not with me,\" Cooper said, shaking his head. \"I'm not interested in training women. I want real fighters, not a bunch of Barbie dolls playing around with boxercise.\"The door to the house slid open as the maid appeared with a tray of coffee. His gaze honed in on her instinctively, taking in her straight brunette hair, pulled high in a ponytail, the fine bones of her face, her full lips and the supple grace with which she moved. Her eyes were an unusual light gray, almost silver, and were slightly tilted. Her body was everything he'd imagined— strong and curvy, her legs long, her shoulders square and proud.\"Women's boxing is huge now,\" Ray said. \"Purses are bigger, and the Women's International Boxing Association has really stepped things up. With women like Laila Ali out there, it's only going to get better.\"\"Listen, I appreciate what you're trying to do for your friend, but I'm not interested in taking on someone who's going to bail when the going gets tough. Boxing is a man's sport.\"The thump of the tray dropping abruptly onto the table drew his attention back to the maid.

In their first-rate book, Novak, star of TV'sConfessions of a Matchmaker, and novelist Zigman (Animal Husbandry) prove to be a match made in heaven.

The book exhorts the reader to Get Over It when it comes to thinking all men are jerks or being paralyzed by past relationship trauma. Like a dating GPS, the book identifies dating obstacles and puts readers on the right road to romantic fulfillment. No shrinking violet, Novak is part drill sergeant (especially when it comes to self-exploration worksheets), part love therapist (though she refers on deep issues to the appropriate professionals). Writing in a frank—and funny—manner, Novak uses tough love in offering a compelling and rewarding read for the lovelorn.(Jan.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I was often reminded of Harry Chapin's haunting melody as I followed the cabby/narrator around Houston's shadowy, grimy environs and encountered the creatures of the night he picks up and delivers as he seeks to fly and, ultimately, to understand. BClay Reynolds, author ofFranklin's CrossingCab Talesevokes a sense of place as vibrant asThe Odyssey; and indeed these stories do represent an odyssey of sorts. Through the eyes of the cab driver narrator, we meet the denizens of Houston's underworld: strippers, cowboys, desperate men, strong and sexy and weeping women. Throughout it all, Muirhead paints his characters and the urban landscape of Houston with a keen sense of a poet's eye. Lyric, edgy and powerfully moving, these are stories for and of our time. Sheryl St. Germain, author ofHow Heavy the Breath of God Westheimer, River Oaks, Montrose, the ship channel appear, butCab Talesis not about places but people who need a ride to and from the many locales that make the crazy quilt of Houston.

Dolores who can find no one to talk to, a tough kid whose only solace is the song of the mockingbird, the Homecoming Queen from some lost Eden, the pregnant dancer trying to find her way back to BrazilBthese are the people you will remember when the cab goes off duty. Robert Flynn, author ofLiving with the Hyenas", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Having performed a dramatic rescue inNightmare(2002), they have returned to the forest planet of Bellerophon to start a family. But politics and personal problems intervene. The end of the Dream--the ability of various sentients to enter a telepathic plane that made faster-than-light communication possible--brought down governments, destroyed economies, and roused interspecies enmities, and elements of all three catastrophes remain in process on Bellerophon. Moreover, Ben has discovered that his genetic parents were humanity's greatest hero and its greatest villain, both dead for a thousand years. Then a madman starts killing, intent on replicating Daniel Vik's villainy inNightmare. Harper's characters and society are as fascinating, and his plot is as intricate, as ever. It helps, though, to have readNightmarebefore tackling this one.Frieda MurrayCopyright © American Library Association.

Most of her days are spent assisting Viola at school and doing chores on the farm where they are boarding. Her only release is found in her journal entries or in spinning her fantasies into stories that she includes in letters to a friend back home. Wanting to have someone with whom to share her feelings and desires, Mable turns to a town outcast, an eccentric woman who leads a secret group of suffragettes. As she learns more about the injustices carried out in this small rural town, she ignores her sister's warnings and puts herself in the midst of a strike at the local cheese factory.

Approaching his tkday, the word he made up to denote one's 10,000th day on Earth, he realized he really wanted to do something important. What better way to do that than to invent a new word or two? For the rest of human history, people would be saying things that he created. Of course, getting a new word into the lexicon isn't as easy as making one up and sending it to a dictionary editor—for example, you have to demonstrate that your made-up word is actually being used, that it has an accepted meaning. The book follows Horne's efforts to get his new words into general circulation, a challenge that involves slipping his lexographic creations into public forums (for instance, using one on a popular TV show) and generally making a cheerful nuisance of himself. A very enjoyable book that should spark the interest of word lovers and do-it-yourselfers, not to mention fans of offbeat memoirs by A. J. Jacobs, Danny Wallace, and Dave Gorman. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For historical accuracy, I consulted former New York City Opera prima ballerina Rochelle Zide Booth, and Ivor Guest, premier ballet historian and author of \"Ballet in Second Empire France,\" as well as the dance faculty and design staff of the Boston Ballet Company.

The preaching of some Baptists drew him to a sense of religion and in 1755 he was baptised by immersion. In 1760 Booth became superintendent of the Kirby Woodhouse congregation. Up to this time he had been a convinced Arminian. But now he changed his views for the doctrines held by Particular Baptists. He composed his work The Reign of Grace (here in abridged form) in 1768. Soon after its appearance, the Particular Baptist Church in Little Prescot Street, London, invited Booth to be their pastor. He was ordained there in 1769. He died in January 1806, having been a pastor for some 35 years. During his pastorate, an academy was founded, which is now in Oxford, known as the Regents Park College for ministerial training.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The thesis of this book is that Israel and the church are distinct theological institutions that have arisen in the historical progress of divine revelation. But they are also related as successive phases of a redemptive program that is historically progressive and eschatologically converging. The approach to these issues here is neither polemical nor apologetic; rather, it anticipates a convergence among evangelical scholars in the recognition of both continuity and discontinuity in the Israel-church relationship. This book has three purposes: - To offer a contemporary dispensational treatment of that relationship through an exegetical examination of key texts with a focus on theological concerns - To foster genuine dialogue with nondispensational thinkers regarding major biblical themes tied to the plan of God - To identify the changes in dispensational thought that have developed since the publication of Charles Ryrie's book Dispensationalism Today in 1965", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Su interés por la lectura la llevó a cursar estudios graduados, obteniendo una Maestría en Literatura.  Más tarde, una vez que completó su Tesis, ésta fue escogida para publicación por la universidad a la que asistió.  También tomó cursos graduados para especializarse en otra rama de la literatura, ampliando sus conocimientos y fortaleciendo sus intereses.  Además, siempre le interesó la Psicología, creyendo que ésta era su vocación en un principio, hasta que supo que necesitaba expresarse, decidiéndose por las letras, que abarca más ampliamente el estudio y los conocimientos de numerosas materias, satisfaciendo así su motivación en el campo intelectual.       Aparece en la lista de \"Stanford Quién es quién Presidencial\",  una asociación de profesionales registrada en el Congreso, por sus logros como mujer profesional a nivel nacional.   Hoy está felizmente casada y tiene una hija.  Ha viajado mucho junto a su familia, complementando así su interés por el conocimiento de otras culturas.

The hard SF shell of McDevitt's work often contains a romantic core, where a skeptical faith sustains and motivates his protagonists to struggle on (Indomitable, Never Despair). Never predictable in outcome, conflicts are resolved by a well-formed argument that enables the well-aimed blaster (Kaminsky at War). McDevitt's fondness for ideas such as idealism's triumph over pragmatism is a little too apparent in this single-volume setting, but his strong, clear voice easily sustains each individual story.(Feb.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Character\ndevelopment is pitch-perfect. The narrative tension is growing steadily. The\npace and rhythm is lyrical, and the local color/environment is vivid.

I was hooked from the first page by the writing\nand by the character of Charles. The author pays attention to detail and local\ncolor, creating an environment of dimensional characters and conflicts. The\nprose is muscular and the mood and tone are spot-on. Moreover, I was intrigued\nby secondary characters, for example the obese Benjamin, who fears the\npotential violence of his father. There is nuanced foreshadowing here.

Unfortunately, circumstances didn't allow me to pursue this promising career. In 1995, I came to the United Kingdom to improve my English. Struggling to make a living while in the UK, my life turned around when I believed and was baptized into Christ Jesus, confessing Him as my Lord and Saviour.

Private eye Joe Hannibal travels downstate from Rockford, Ill., to nab armed-robbery suspect and bail-jumper Junior Odum after Odum's mother's funeral. In one of two major plot flaws, narrator Hannibal is convinced to leave Odum at liberty for 48 hours while Hannibal investigates the \"accidental\" death by fire of Mrs. Odum. She'd been resisting selling her home to the county's biggest employer, a toy factory, and the factory owner had threatened to relocate his business outside the county. Hannibal contends with some local hostility (two nasty drunks) and a little hospitality (the factory owner's beautiful sister), and seems to be getting nowhere until the murder of a local \"loose woman\" starts to break the case. There's a second glaring unlikely event at the end, but Edgar nominee Dundee creates vivid characters and a sense of place, mixes them nicely and delivers a solid performance. Joe Hannibal himself is quite engaging.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00C8W23P8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ira, a Jewish writer, has already published his first novel to much acclaim and is struggling with the second (at Yaddo, no less) when he falls for M, a fetching Midwestern pianist, despite having Edith, his domineering mentor and lover, waiting back in New York City. Ira's search for artistic inspiration soon requires a change of scenery, so he and his latest muse, a fervent Communist, travel to L.A., but things get off to a rocky start: Ira's one contact is no longer in town and work is hard to come by, but to turn to Edith or M for help would compromise Ira's effort to stand on his own. The novel comes close to achieving its aspirations of being a sweeping portrait of 1930s America and the story of a writer struggling with art, love, and finding his own voice, but despite a strong start, the narrative loses resonance as it meanders toward an abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Treadway examines and exposes emotions that few would readily admit to, such as a mother's impulse to suffocate her wailing son, or a woman's delight in exaggerating a childhood illness in order to gain admiration for her courage. Often set in winter, these eight tales reveal moments of empathy and revulsion alike, illuminating how love, complicated by both guilt and denial, can fray without unraveling entirely; Treadway doesn't gloss over her characters' shortcomings, nor the failure they feel for not accomplishing what they had hoped. Although the final story concludes with a disappointingly familiar realization--that we may search far and wide for signs of comfort only to find it in our midst--Treadway's writing is otherwise charged with perception.

It's a very small town with very little to do! My folks were Christians and I spent most of my time going to church and to school. Before I was old enough to go to school I helped my mom and dad in the cotton fields. I really thought I was a big shot! I was just five-years-old, but I thought I was really working hard as I filled my little cardboard box with cotton and dumped it in my mama's sack. I never helped out for very for long; nevertheless, I thought I had really contributed. Once I had pulled a couple boxes of cotton, I was free to go play. I had so much fun jumping off that cotton trailer into that mound of white fluffy cotton. I was involved in sports but singing was \"My Thing\"! I sang everywhere I could. Church became a lot more fun when I got a little older and could travel with the church choir. Those were the days all right! My parents were from Arkansas and my brother Billy and my three sisters: Betty, Patty and Mary were all born in the razorback state. I'm the only Okie out of the bunch. Guess that's why talkin' hillbilly comes so natural for me. Its just part of my DNA.

This memoir traces his role in such cold war milestones as the 1954 Geneva conference on Indochina, the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, and Vietnam. Fine material for historians, but will such an obscure figure interest the recreational history buff? Happily, yes, for Cooper's ironic sensibility endows his account--at least of his formative years--with readably breezy self-deprecation. This tone never vanishes from the narrative of his advancing career, and indeed inures him from undue awe toward the powerful figures he worked for (Robert McNamara contributes a foreword). He turns serious, however, when he discusses Vietnam and details how he assisted Averell Harriman during futile peace overtures to the Communist North. Cooper's memorable memoir is replete with pungent observations of CIA chiefs, cabinet secretaries, and British prime ministers.Gilbert TaylorCopyright © American Library Association.

She enjoyed the adventures of the different people, relished in the entertainment of traveling to other places, and gained knowledge about other lifestyles and other people. Consequently, she spent a lot of her free time at the library. It was like a second home to her. Writing became her next love after reading. Her interest was piqued enough for her to begin writing poetry at an early age. She honed her skills as a writer when she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English at Morgan State University. In 2010, the prestigious English department celebrated its seventy-fifth anniversary. She later started an ambitious career as an English teacher at a Baltimore City High School for young men. While participating as a member of Baltimore city's Grand Jury, she coauthored a thesis which investigated the current status of the city's \"war on drugs.\" One of the highlights of her fact gathering was an interview the committee conducted with former Baltimore city mayor and Rhode scholar Kurt Schmoke. Later, she became a member of the Black Writers' Guild of Maryland and volunteered at the Arena Playhouse and the Enoch Pratt Free Library. As a member of the Black Writers' Guild, she was involved in pursuing information about the self-publication and marketing of books. At the Arena Playhouse, which in 2003 celebrated fifty years entertaining the citizens of Baltimore, she worked behind the scenes with several directors in various duties as dialogue coach, stage hand, dramaturge, script consultant, and pre-production assistant..  She worked on one of the first black productions of Cat on the Hot Tin Roof, as well as other productions such as Opal's Husband, Arsenic and Old Lace, Having Our Say, Jar the Floor, and Interstices. She volunteered at the Enoch Pratt Free Library assisting the librarian with imaginative reading groups for school-age children.

I\nheard of the concept in church and read of it in the Bible but it was still\nunclear. So one day in July of 2011, I asked was He the Holy Ghost and He\nreplied\"Yes I am\nand now that you recognize my voice, I expect great things from you\". One of the greatest things that I like about God is nothing\nis a secret to those that are righteous. Jesus Christ came to make the\nMysteries of the Kingdom known, i.e. the true power of God. Meaning all you\nhave to do is ask and God will tell or show you. Ask and you shall\nreceive. Supporting Word: \"Now if\nany of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to everyone generously\nwithout a rebuke, and it will be given to him. But he must ask in faith,\nwithout any doubts, for the one who has doubts is like a wave of the sea that\nis driven and tossed by the wind. Such a person should not expect to receive\nanything from the Lord.\"(James 1:5-7) So yes you can have a complete conversation between you and\nthe Holy Ghost. I can literally talk to Him in my mind and He will answer, in\nfact, we talk all the time. The Holy Ghost comes straight forward and is easy\nto understand. He does not talk in an elevated Bible language, such as\n\"thou shall speak\", etc. One day I asked why does He sound like me and His\nresponse was\"Because\nI am apart of you\". As mentioned, if you become close to God, He\nwill become close to you, and you will be one with Him. The Holy Ghost has guided me on many things in my walk, from\nbig to small. To telling me what to do, how to do it, and when to do it, to\nspeak, to be quiet, to comfort (by telling me\"all is well\"), to chastise, to\nquestion, to guide, the list goes on.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And it turns out that everyone with an office job is disgruntled at least some of the time. In a way, Dilbert predicted the current wave of reality entertainment. I'd love to say my writing is what makes Dilbert work, but it probably has more to do with the recognizable workplace situations and the fact that people see themselves in the strip. Dilbert works best when the characters give voice to what employees in the real world are thinking.Amazon.com:The Kindle edition of Dilbert 2.0 is split into four volumes organized by business era. Are there signature characters or themes that mark the essence of each era?Scott Adams:In the early ears, volume one, Dilbert wasn't strictly about the workplace. Dilbert had a job, but the comic was more often based around his home. The next volume involves strips written during the downsizing of the early nineties, at about the same time Dilbert became a workplace strip. Next came the hardest era for any cartoonist -- the dotcom years. During the go-go days of the Internet, when employees felt well-paid and hopeful, it was hard to find humor. Humor prefers dysfunction. We now know that the dotcom era was hugely dysfunctional, but it wasn't obvious to most people who were in it. Then came the modern era, when hope and compensation took a hit, and once again it became easy to do my job.Amazon.com:How did you narrow down your selections from more than 7,000 potential strips to the nearly 2,000 included in Dilbert 2.0?Scott Adams:It wasn't easy! I tried to find the strips that were the funniest while also having some meaning, or a funny story attached. But it felt like I was a mother with triplets and someone told me I could only keep one of them.Amazon.com:What were the greatest challenges and opportunities associated with translating Dilbert 2.0 for the Kindle Fire?Scott Adams:It's a fascinating process. When you change the physical delivery system for a comic, you can also change the pacing. There's a tradeoff between what looks best and what reads most fluidly. I think we found the right balance.Amazon.com:What are you most excited about for the Dilbert of the future?Scott Adams:I'm hoping a Dilbert movie comes together soon. We're working on it, but movies are never a sure thing. A lot of elements have to fall in place. And we'll be doing a lot with Dilbert.com and with mobile phone distribution. It's an exciting time to be a cartoonist.", "related": [], "rank": 166263, "title": "Dilbert 2.0: The Modern Era, 2001 to 2008: 20 Years of Dilbert", "author": "Scott Adams", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Stories that will take you, the reader, away on the wings of my imagination to wondrous places. EAGLE LADY is my first book but its sequel EAGLE KNIGHT has already been published. I enjoy writing historical fiction but I do tend to adapt history to work around my plots, that makes it more exciting I think. You never know what will happen next! EAGLE KNIGHT is my second book, and even though it is a sequel, it can still stand on its own. Set in medieval times, it tells the story of a young knight who sets out on a journey that will transform his life. The bygone days of Kings, Queens, Lords and Knights will come alive in this beautiful tale of adventure and romance. This is a story of love,friendship and loyalty, spiced with a slice of mystery, and with just that little bit of magic that will enthral and captivate you from begin to end.

(The idea for a sci-fi show about life aboard a space station came to me in my sophomore lit class.) After a brief stint in the Army, part of which I served overseas in Germany for a year, I came back home to Twin Falls, Idaho, and enrolled in the College of Southern Idaho. I knew I wanted to major in English, and, after receiving my Associate of Arts Degree, I went on to Boise State University. I graduated with a BA in English, Writing Emphasis, in 2005.     During those years in college I continued to work on The Exxar Chronicles outside the classroom while honing my writing skills in class. After leaving BSU I returned to Twin Falls to write full time, and in fall of 2008 I finally completed the final draft of The Erayan. After two years of rejection from numerous literary agents, I decided to self publish via the Amazon Kindle Store. You'll find those links on The Books page.     Since I am still struggling to make a living from my writing, I fill my days by teaching full time at an elementary school. I'm a computer assistant, which means I teach basic computer skills to the students for their 5th block specials. I enjoy having my summers off, though I don't make quite as much as a fully certified teacher. (I'm just an hourly employee.)     In my spare time, I enjoy watching TV, going to the movies, reading, and generally feasting on all things pop culture.", "related": ["B00LDCER4E"], "rank": 1847891, "title": "Emissary (The Exxar Chronicles Book 2) eBook", "author": "Neal Jones", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I've always got a project in the works; I love working with color, photography, scrapbooking, building altars, and so much more. Life in its most simple and pure form is what works best for me. The oceans, lakes, mountains, fresh air, and basic human and animal connections nurture me in a way that nothing else can. I am a Hospice volunteer in grief support, and actively involved in our community. I currently serve on the board of the Carousel Fund, a non-profit organization that helps families of children with life-threatening illnesses. As an altar maker, I have easily gravitated toward our town's annual El Dia de Los Muertos celebration, coordinating the numerous altar placements in our downtown area each fall. My personal philosophy is this: Choose love, take the high road, have a sense of humor, and meet others where they're at.

Most of his adult life has been spent in the entertainment field with a brief stint in the US Army during the Viet Nam period. As an entertainer, the Author had the opportunity to travel extensively nationally and internationally.  Managing a traveling business along with ongoing involvements in a variety of other businesses ranging from real estate development to portfolio investments, truly added to his perspective.  Most enlightening was the ultimate brush with the IRS and the dishonest money system of which it is a part.

Fluent in French, she spent time exploring Europe and its history in her late teens. Elyse has eclectic interests in studying the human mind, philosophy, and humanity and its varied cultures. Combining that with a lifelong admiration of nature, from astronomy to geology, she has experience with a broad spectrum of knowledge. Elyse has a poignant writing style that is both melodious and uncluttered, coming from an enduring love of poetry. The unique cadence, when coupled with dark fiction, provides an intriguing and memorable read. Her inspiration and understanding of the darker side of literature, and life, is drawn from the intimate experiences she has had in coping with hospice work, and terminally ill patients. That knowledge brings humanism to her plots, and unexpected emotions to her character development. Elyse still lives in Colorado, with her husband, daughter, one cat, one cockatoo, and two amazing K-9 companions. A blessed work environment that will continue to add love to her writing projects, and all other parts of her life.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 3.5714, "rating_total": 25.0}

As it turns out, however, cheese trivia isn't enough to hold a book together, making this more an encyclopedic, uninvolving work than a cogent history. A fascinating selection of photos is included, but captions are anemic (a photo of well-dressed African-American students making cheese is simply labeled \"Agriculture students gather around a cheese press, Hampton, Virginia, 1900\"). 40 color plates, 20 b&w.;Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She currently works full time as an insurance agent, but her favor-ite jobs are mother, wife, and author. On her eighth birthday, her mother bought her a journal and said \"write whatever you want, just write.\"  And so, a love affair with words was born. She wrote poetry and short stories in high school and college, until 1993 when her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. After her moth-er's death in 1998, Monique fell into a deep depression and found herself unable to write. Nine years passed, and only on rare occasion did she attempt to write with no luck.  Finally, in 2007, under the urging of friends, she sat down and pecked out her first novel. It was raw and unpolished, but the process had been unquestionably cathartic. The next three years were spent filling her hard drive with seven complete manuscripts. At the beginning of 2011, Monique decided it was time to edit the work and share it with the world. She hopes you enjoy the ramblings of a deeply southern girl raised in a state rich with heritage and love.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, \"as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife,\" Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. \"The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden.\"As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful \"When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy.\" But despite its many languorous pleasures,The Picture of Dorian Grayis an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least \"no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.\" Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: \"All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He worked in the fields of investment banking, trading, asset management, and stock broking prior to founding the ICMA Center as a specialist university finance school. His career in the City of London started as a trainee with the merchant bank, Hill Samuel. He then became a fixed income analyst with Kidder Peabody Securities Ltd. Along with three others he was a founder of Ross and Partners Securities Ltd - a privately owned international bond trading house. After negotiating the sale of Ross & Partners to Drexel Burnham Inc. he became finance director of Drexel Burnham Lambert Securities Ltd responsible for funding and risk management.

In 1995 the International Capital Market Association voted to allocate £3 million from their capital account to constructing a purpose-designed building to house the new ICMA center. ICMA has since donated a further £5 million to the university which enabled the construction of a second facility that includes someone hundred Thompson Reuters terminals with associated trading, valuation and asset management software. He was director of the Center from the time he founded it until 2006 when he took up the newly created post of Chairman. Today, the ICMA Center is one of the largest university finance schools in Europe and is part of the triple-accredited (AMBA, EQUIS and AACSB) Henley Business School, the UK's oldest business school which is home to some 7,000 students from over 140 countries from Africa to Asia, South America to Europe.His main areas of consulting, executive education and research are: strategy in the financial services industry, banking, wealth and asset management and trading systems. He has been a consultant to, amongst others, Westpac Bank, NM Rothschild, Canada Life Insurance, Australian Mutual Provident (AMP), Investec Bank, the London Stock Exchange and SWX Europe (the Swiss exchange). He was a member of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) industry working group on Secondary Bond Market Transparency. He has been a consultant to the US Treasury and to a central bank and in 1978/9 was a monetary policy advisor to Mrs. Thatcher's first Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), Lord Howe of Aberavon (Sir Geoffrey Howe).

Spilled milk could create a very dramatic crisis for the women in the family. Her husband, Ira, has learned after 25 years together to deal with her. He says he deals with her drama one of two ways. No time for that or just go ahead and do your thing and whine and get it over with. Ira see's the \"Drama Queen Personality\" as being very entertaining and creative. It seems to be good for both of them. They have a very successful marriage and another successful business venture together. Peggy Ann is currently living in Sarasota, Florida. She and her husband work together to keep Peggy Ann's Chic Boutique successful and operating smoothly. They make a great team. She is the hyper member of the team, while Ira is the calm member of the team. In all the years Peggy Ann and Ira have been together, they have been rich and they have been poor. Peggy Ann never hesitates when asked which is better. Her reply is always loud and clear. \"Don't expect me to give you that crap, you can be happy, no matter how much or how little money you have.

Although we think our lives are hard, they are nothing compared to what our early ancestors experienced. Imagine no electricity, plumbing, heating, running water, toilets - in the dead of winter even! Just to name a few. Imagine having one set of clothing, one pair of shoes, socks maybe, and maybe socks with no holes. In addition, no medication, hospitals, or any real trained physicians. Honestly, today we have it easy. I believe I accomplished my goal, but writing this story was certainly a challenge. Probably one of the hardest I've ever undertaken. Brining a medieval army into the modern world and coming up with a way to make our modern weaponry ineffective is not an easy task, but magic is magic, and you can make magic do all kinds of things. Making it believable is the challenge, and I think I did. Many authors have inspired me through the years, Feist, Jordan, Salvatore, Martin, Eddings, just to name a few. George R.R. Martin inspired me with how often he kills off favorite characters. You'll certainly experience a little of this in my story. Bad-guys aren't the only ones who die in life. Lastly,and most important, the 13y/o daughter of a very good friend of mine suffered devastating side effects from the HPV vaccine shot. Most of the proceeds I get from each purchase I give to Rachel to help her through daily life. I do keep some funds to cover taxes, but the rest goes to Rachel. She has a long road ahead of her to recovery, and may never regain full use of her legs, but she is a fighter and there is hope. Thanks again. I hope you enjoy the story.Sincerely,VA Pesce", "related": ["B00K31USUS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The breaking of his magical duar is the occasion for encounters with pirates, cannibals, talkative porpoises, a flying horse who's scared of heights and the lovely, level-headed otter Weegee, who becomes the love of Jon-Tom's irascible companion Mudge.

Disillusioned with the world in which she  was brought up, she acted out – she was expelled from St Paul's Girls'  School in London for throwing her school uniform over Hammersmith  Bridge. Dickens then decided to go into service, despite coming from the  privileged class; her experiences as a cook and general servant would  form the nucleus of her first book,One Pair Of Hands, published in 1939.Dickens  married an American Navy officer, Roy O. Stratton, and spent much of  her adult life in Massachusetts and Washington D.C., but she continued  to set the majority of her writing in Britain. No More Meadows, which  she published in 1953, reflected her work with the NSPCC  – she later  helped to found the American Samaritans in Massachusetts. Between 1970  and 1971 she wrote a series of children's books known as The Worlds End  Series which dealt with rescuing animals and, to some extent, children.  After the death of her husband in 1985, Dickens returned to England  where she continued to write until her death aged 77.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From target practice to candle making, she enjoys an eclectic list of hobbies that feed her outgoing and creative personality. Feeling unfulfilled with her life in corporate America, Erin decided to pursue her true passion, and her first novella was published in May 2010 under the pseudonym Joyee Flynn. To date, she has published over 70 books in the erotic romance genre, and her dedicated readers eagerly await each installment to her numerous bestselling series. Wanting to give her characters a bit more action, mystery, and adventure, Erin decided to branch out from romance and her Joyee pen name to create successful, strong, independent women with a paranormal twist. Living near the Rocky Mountains, Erin spends her days curled up on the overstuffed chair with a Mountain Dew and her 8 year old Weimaraner, Marius, at her feet, telling the stories her characters whisper in her ear.  Her love of the written word hasn’t changed much over the years. The only difference is that she no longer has to hide in her closet to read after bedtime. www.ErinRFlynn.com", "related": ["B00KIVZMSQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.4667, "rating_total": 67.0}

After a rash of robberies leaves the residents on edge, suspicion falls on Nick, the outsider. When town elder Paddy Canty is murdered during an apparent robbery, a small council of men decide to take matters into their own hands. Led by the manipulative and almost hypnotic Muiris, a centuries-old practice called €œthe Triangle€ is put into force, which leaves one man dead and several others marked for life. Filled with elegiac prose, this shocking tale of moral decay that spreads from one black heart to claim everything in its path will keep readers turning the pages.

Flores was born on February 16, 1986 and raised in West Philadelphia. Since the early years of his childhood he was creative and loved writing; from poetry, raps, short stories and song writing. He was always great with words. C. Flores went to high school and that’s when an intern from Penn University who he remembers as Ms. Andrea introduced him to creative writing. She saw the potential in him from his classwork in his English class. She asked him to just write a story of whatever he wanted. He went home with the okay to free write, his mind ran and he ended up writing a 10 page short story that blew her away with his creativity and imagination at the age of 15. The short story was an erotic story about a kid and a teacher who were intimate. This kid was a player and a ladies man. He was descriptive with sex scenes and used explicit language. Ms. Andrea fueled the fire and C. Flores began creating short stories on his own. Going to school and under the influence of the streets he began to sell drugs. He still wrote but it was raps instead of stories, his rap group G.H.I is where he continued his writing ability. At 19 years of age he was arrested by the FEDS and sentenced to 5 years for trafficking cocaine. It was his first time ever seeing a cell he was cut off from the world. He says that the abandonment and separation inspired him and also gave him time to get back to his gift and start writing. “When you doing years people forget about you, you know what they say out of sight, out of mind.” C. Flores was released in 2010 with a G.E.D, some college courses and 9 books fully completed and ready to publish. He started off by attending classes at the Community College of Philadelphia while working at various jobs. After having two sons 11 months apart and three years after his release from prison reality started to set in. He realized that he was letting his talent go to waste. He searched the internet for how to start the process of getting his books published. C. Flores then started converting his handwritten books to the computer; this process alone took weeks and many sleepless nights. He juggled taking care of his youngest  son during the day, who is 1, and trying to complete his project. His exact words were, “When you have a little cry baby trying to be held and needing to be changed and fed it slows you up. But I was focused on getting my work finished and out to the people.”", "related": ["B00JZ6G37O"], "rank": 2290358, "title": "Beyond Gangsta", "author": "C.

In the process, he provides an important, essential and convincing challenge to modern sustainablity movements and their approach to questions of race and class. It is to his further credit that he presents this challenge in a manner likely to move efforts inside those movements toward a synthesis that encompasses the intent of the movements while expanding the breadth of their base.\" - Ron Jacobs,Counterpunch\"In this beautifully written book, Julian Agyeman builds on his groundbreaking concept of just sustainabilities to include an exploration of how food, space, place, and culture shape our capacities to imagine and pursue a world of possibilities. From Bogota to Boston, he always asks the right questions and makes sure to consider the real world applications and implications of just sustainability. Agyeman also offers a bold and refreshing critique of reformist approaches to sustainability and social change. He presents a clear agenda for policy, planning, and practical pathways to co-produce societies in which we all are recognized and respected.\" - David Naguib Pellow, Don A. Martindale Professor of Sociology, University of Minnesota, and author of Resisting Global Toxics\"Agyeman's engaging analysis brings the concept of 'just sustainabilities' to the centre of the stage, right where it deserves to be. In this essential book, he brings together the literature on sustainability, particularly environmental sustainability, with that of environmental justice, illuminating the discussion throughout with cases where communities are striving to achieve just sustainability on the ground. Agyeman makes very clear the importance of cultural diversity and paying attention to the needs of situated identities.\" - Yvonne Rydin, Chair of Planning, Environment and Public Policy, and Director of the Environment Institute, University College London\"Julian Agyeman has done more than any other scholar to emphasise the potential in the relationship between environmental justice and ecological sustainability. In this book, he explores the evolution and recent development of the crucial concept of just sustainability, in particular how it manifests itself in various aspects of our everyday lives. In doing so, Ageyman makes both the idea and practice of just sustainability more inclusive and salient to a new generation of students, activists, policy-makers, and environmental practitioners.\" - David Schlosberg, Professor of Environmental Politics, The University of Sydney\"Julian Agyeman has produced a powerful new statement of the need to integrate justice and sustainability. Building on his own ground-breaking work, he analyses the key themes of food, space, place, and culture, showing how equity, justice and inclusion are fundamental to any enduring practical expression of sustainability.\" - Andrew Dobson, Professor of Politics, Keele University, and author of Citizenship and the Environment\"With this excellent book, Agyeman both consolidates and advances his ground-breaking work on just sustainabilities. Readers looking for a clear and concise review of the concept and underpinning ideas, as well as those wanting compelling examples of its practical application will be more than satisfied.\" - Professor Gordon Walker, Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University\"With Just Sustainabilities, Julian Agyeman again demonstrates why he is considered one of the world's foremost modern thinkers on the relationship between humanity and nature. By eloquently making the case that the loss of human potential is as detrimental to our future as the loss of environmental potential, Agyeman shows that we need to transform the way we treat each other as well as the planet.\" - Professor Mark Roseland, Director, Centre for Sustainable Community Development, Simon Fraser University, and author of Toward Sustainable Communities: Solutions for Citizens and Their Governments\"There's lots to think about if we want to build cities that are culturally-inclusive and sustainable in the most comprehensive sense of that term.

With Celeste's Bestrecipes it is absolutely possible for anyone to live just as fully without allergens in their diet as they once did with them.   When\n we found out our family had celiac disease and other food intolerances,\n we weren't about to settle for eating anything less than the foods we\nhad previously enjoyed.   We're a family who enjoys cooking and\neating so being diagnosed with celiac disease and having other food\nintolerances and sensitivities really hit us hard in the beginning.  But\n I have to also admit that I'm a person who likes a challenge.  And\nfinding a way to make gluten-free and allergen-free foods taste\nincredibly delicious became a challenge I set out to overcome. My main cookbookCeleste's Best Gluten-Free, Allergen-Free Recipes allows\n those who have eliminated wheat, gluten, dairy, casein, soy, corn, nuts\n and yeast from their diet to once again be able to enjoy all their\nfavorite foods.  Light, fluffy pancakes, crispy waffles, soft tortillas,\n chewy chocolate chip cookies, moist and airy cakes and cupcakes,\ndelicious fudge brownies, tender, flaky pie crusts and anything else you\n may desire. And I also developed all of the recipes in the cookbook so\ntheycan be prepared completely free of xanthan or guar gum, replacing it with a natural binder - konjac powder (ground vegetable fiber from the konjac root). Theyeast-free breadrecipes included in the cookbook will allow readers to once again enjoy\n bread that is light and airy.  Bread that requires no kneading and\nbakes in the oven in 45 minutes.  Bread that can be eaten toasted or\nuntoasted (a common complaint of most gluten free bread).  Bread that\nmany of the cookbook testers commented actually tastes and feels just\nlike \"real\" bread.I know that many who start following a diet\nfree of gluten and most common allergens may have never cooked before so\n I made the recipes straightforward and very easy to follow. I've also\nincluded notes and tips to help make the reader's gluten and\nallergen-free cooking experience be the best it can be. (Click on the\n\"Look Inside\" feature to see a few sample pages.) And almost all\ningredients in the recipes can be purchased in your local grocery store.\n No funky, processed substitutions you'll have to buy, just real food,\nmade from real ingredients so you can live a healthier allergen-free\nlife.I developed the recipes and created my cookbooks for my\ndaughter and my nephews and everyone else who avoids gluten and other\nallergens in their diet so that life can be full of more possibilities\nand smiles, and less about things in life you can't have.", "related": ["B007LTQ0O8"], "rank": 489099, "title": "Celeste's Best Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free and Yeast-Free Bread and Pizza", "author": "Celeste Clevenger", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story was a very quick read, great for readers who don't have a lot of time to dedicate to a full length novel. My favorite thing about Splash was the story line. Baine was able to develop a pretty complete well defined story complete with a little suspense, a long lost love, a suitable ending, and a meet and greet with several characters we are sure to see later in this series.Readers can definitely read Splash without feeling obligated to read the next in series read, but will probably want to with the intrigue Baine was able to establish. I will be picking up Garrick's story next.Now back to Splash. Nathaniel was pretty great. He's a vampire scientist who has been pursing medical and science degrees for decades in order to find a way to help his one true love Sariah; control her urges to feed. But Sariah has been locked away in a special facility being forced because of this problem without any contact with Nathaniel for so long that she feels unwanted by the first man she loved.When these two are forced into each other's presence to test Nathaniel's latest invention \"Splash\" their relationship tested. Not only by each other, but also by the other vampires who clearly have something against Sariah and Nate. I'm sure as we dig deeper into the Sable world in the next book, we will come to understand more of the dynamics and the motivations of those against the group of vampires that Saraih and Nate belong.", "related": [], "rank": 3330197, "title": "Splash: A Sable World Novella (The Sable World)", "author": "Baine Kelly", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In The Laws of Attraction, God is giving me a second chance to discover what my gifts and talents really have to offer. So I'm writing this manual for everyone that has felt like their dreams have just passed them by. God told me to tell you that your purpose isn't lost but only hidden from your sight because you have refused to yield to him.

What if the U.S. funded the execution of\nterrorist groups - and what if CIA involvements resulted in 'hit teams' that\nmistakenly threaten the general public?   If all this sounds\ncomplicated, that's becauseThe Killing Gamesis anything but light\nleisure reading - and is anything but predictable. Readers had better be\nprepared for a high-octane series of encounters spiced with protagonists who\nare all involved in terrorist activities at some level; and who each have\nsomething to lose.   Now, if one recalls\nrightly, there was a lot of concern over the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. So\nthe setting, events and characters here assume a certain gritty reality based\non the very real sentiments and social and political flavor of the times.   It's this 'spice' that\nkeepsThe Killing Gamesa highly charged, believable story despite all\nits convolutions and changes. By basing action on realistic concerns, readers\nreceive an emotionally-charged saga that neatly ties into modern-day concerns\nnot just about Olympic settings and politics, but about world terrorist actions\nas a whole.   Characters are\nwell-rounded with all their involvements and motivations presented in action\nthat is unrelenting, while fast-paced intrigue offers satisfying twists of plot\nthat include a kidnapping and even a dash of romance.   Any who want a thriller\nbased on real-life terrorist threats will findThe Killing Gamesmore\nthan makes an impact, and presents page-turning, high drama to the end.D.

Signing up for a six-day vacation to London and Brussels in the dead of winter, Elaine found time to meet and fall in love with a local Belgian man and extended her trip to last 12 years. While living abroad Elaine became a board member of a charitable organization and taught Mexican cooking classes to the expatriate community.

Their menacing presence made even more so by the weapons they carried. These were no mere peasants like the ones who had happened upon him and Rourke. Nay, these men, their clothes bespoke of fine quality and the sun glinted off the mail they wore under their tunics. Poachers they were not. Darc clucked his tongue and his mastiffs sat their large bodies down flanking him, their low growls and woofs of warning puffed out of their throats.  One of the men across the river, a tall fellow, big in chest as he was round all over nodded and a lopsided smile spread across his mouth. Darc's blood boiled.The look the man had given him was a challenging one and Darc would know who had sent the fool before he cut off his head.The small group disappeared and fell back into the trees as if they had not been there at all. The river was too deep for him to cross. Within seconds Renald knights poured out from the wood beside him.Darc gave them the nod to go after the men. His men would have to go a ways down the riverbank to where it was low enough for the horses to cross safely. By then the strangers would be long gone, but he hoped they had left a trail. His dogs would pick up their scent. He turned and followed, his anger growing with each step.  There was no sight of them. No trail.Gan approached and pointed in the direction of a thick part of the wood. Darc gave the order to enter. It led nowhere as well.The dogs followed the men's scent so far then stopped and howled, barking. The trail ended at the curve in the road. They found nothing but a small encampment these men had dared set up near low lying bushes that as Darc approached, gave a partial good view of the inner bailey of his castle. He swept his eyes around the encampment. Rage filled him anew at how dangerously close these men had been to his home, to Caroline, Kelbie and he looked back at the castle.He now knew who had sent them. It was another sign. William had been right.Raven was near.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 23, "rating_average": 4.3043, "rating_total": 99.0}

Even when she's already successful by most people's standards, she still does not slow down and look at the more important things in life. Now in eight hours, all of that will be taken away by God who had given it all to her. Will Carter learn to appreciate and be grateful for what she has in the final eight hours of her life? Rhonda Kennedy tells the story of Carter, her regrets, aspirations, and how she will make it all all right in her novel The Final Eight.Rhonda Kennedy wrote a moving and heartfelt story in The Final Eight. What happened to Carter happens to most of us; in our attempts to seek more material things and riches we sometimes forget the people who have supported and loved us along the way. The message she sent through her novel is a powerful and inspiring one. Luke was an outstanding man for sticking with Carter, even if she rejects his love and support continually. I didn't like how Carter was with her family, especially Luke and her daughter, Payton, but as the story develops so does Carter. Not everybody will be given the chance that Carter was given, so reading this story will really teach readers a life lesson. It was kind of sad but I love how everything played out and how it ended was epic.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As I've grown older I have continued to be a slave to fiction, and at 25 years old I realize that I do am not cut-out real world.    I began writing \"Elite\" almost two years ago as a side project while I did what was necessary to provide myself with a relatively comfortable life after college. In that time I have worked two different jobs, moved across the State of Michigan, and loved and lost more times than I care to admit.    I graduated from Central Michigan University where I majored in Broadcasting and minored Advertising. I pursued the field of my degree and worked in radio in Detroit for a couple years, but got burnt out on it rather quickly and decided on a change of scenery. I accepted a new job at a non-profit organization in Grand Rapids, MI. The move brought with it a noticeable improvement in my quality of life, but it did not take long for me to once again become bored with myself and realize that the only thing I want to be in life is a writer.    I am generally happiest when immersed in the world of fiction - whether that world involves superheroes, aliens, or magic - and to be able to spend my life making up such stories would be a dream come true.    As one of my all-time favorite story-tellers once said, \"Fiction over fact always has my vote.\"", "related": ["B00KET4TR2"], "rank": 689805, "title": "Elite eBook", "author": "Joseph C.

But no staff greet her upon her arrival, her luggage is still in San Francisco, a blizzard has cut off power and any thought of escape, and, worst of all, her suite is already inhabited--by a tall, enigmatic, and furious stranger. Gradually Cooper and Breanne forge an alliance of sorts, fueled mostly by their immediate appreciation of each others' physical attributes, but attraction swiftly grows into friendship mixed with exasperation as they find themselves curious about each other's secrets and those the motley collection of staff are trying so desperately--and unsuccessfully--to hide. Shalvis skillfully mixes the bizarre with the poignant and the hilarious in this deliciously creepy romp, while three totally mismatched couples eventually find true love as well as an adventure worthy of sharing with their grandchildren.Lynne WelchCopyright © American Library Association.

It was cavernous, with ceilings so tall they were lost in darkness. Ribbons of red silk dangled from great heights with acrobats swinging and dancing upon them. Great bonfires in sporadic rows burned brightly, like a medieval version of an airport runway. Between the bonfires were heaps of writhing bodies, moaning and licking and stroking each other. Men and women and some who were both and some who were neither were locked in a great orgy like one living being. A chorus of sighs and cries of pleasure reverberated in the room. The fires led deeper into the chamber, stopping at a raised, stepped platform--like an altar--atop which sat a beautiful woman on a golden throne.Her Majesty Queen Tera of the Succubi had chestnut brown hair spilling over her shoulders in luxurious waves. Her blue eyes were playful and curious, watching everything in her hall at once, delighting in everything they saw. She had full red lips, caught in a perpetual smile like a cat licking from a bowl of cream. Tera wore an armored corset, a crimson, nearly transparent skirt slit up to her hips, and armored boots that rose up her thighs. Her breasts looked like she was poured into her top, and some spilled over.I didn't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't this. She looked human. Except for the tiniest red horns poking through her hair and a thin devil's tail curled about her leg. I'd been expecting--I don't know--something monstrous and cruel, like the blue succubus that nearly stole my mind. But Tera--Tera looked nice.The energy in the room couldn't have been more sexual. Esme had been right, the orgy was a wind blowing gently on my skin. It fed me, nourished me, ever so slightly. I walked down the path defined by the fires--no one was on the path but me and my escorts--and off to my right a man's voice cried out in crescendo, setting off a chain reaction of climaxes in the succubuses around him. The gentle wind became a tornado as the sexual power exploded from the revelers. It lifted me off my feet and shook me like a chew toy, spinning me around and around until I forced myself to open up and accept the pleasure.", "related": ["B00EENE9G0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
