Though she's comfortably settled in her hometown of Revere, Mass., and relishing the affections of Matt Gennaro, a local homicide detective with \"Al Pacino eyes,\" Gloria can't seem to keep her nose out of sleuthing. When John Galigani, the son of her beloved landlords, is accused of murdering a former girlfriend, Yolanda Fiore, Gloria's on the case to prove John's innocence faster than you can say \"periodic table.\" Although Matt has to recuse himself because of his friendship with the Galigani family, he helps sift through clues and Lamerino's hypotheses. Was Yolanda killed because her newsletter Raid-iation exposed falsified data in Japan? Did her death stem from conflict over a questionable library expansion plan? Or did Yolanda uncover clues about a 55-year-old murder? Descriptions of boron as a neutron poison, radioactive wastes, Italian food and characters' fashion choices serve more often to slow than advance the plot. In addition, readers may find themselves lost amid generations of Italian names in this highly populated novel. Reading Yolanda's e-mails, Lamerino decides, must be like wading through something by Mario Puzo. But there's no denying the flair in Minichino's portrait of Italian Americans, or the charm of her energetic, quick-thinking heroine, who seeks both love and justice.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Whether writing about the power of the theatre or the power of the people, Davis was gifted with an ability for remarkable, courageous speech: Calling for a new Constitution in 1968, he said, \"Let us sit down and negotiate a peace treaty among ourselves.\" Davis did not shy away from controversy, be it in defense of the rights of known Communists, or in re-examining the history of African-Americans; writing in 1965, Davis states that \"most of the stereotypes we know about Negroes were invented by Negroes for the purposes of survival and social correction.\" The writer's humor, humility and tremendous inspirational power shine, but suffer from a lack on context. Davis' wife of more than 50 years, the equally renowned actress and activist Ruby Dee, provides commentary at the beginning of most selections, but her notes are often too vague to illuminate Davis' writings properly. Not much elucidation is needed for Davis' eulogy for Malcolm X, perhaps, but subsequent eulogies for less-known figures like actors Godfrey Cambridge and John Randolph could use a biographical sketch. Quibbles aside, this is a great read by a luminous, much-missed American treasure.Copyright Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His successor and critic is Idel, also a professor at Hebrew University and author of this densely written treatise. In contrast to recent efforts to make Kabbalah more accessible, Idel presents a highly specialized narrative in language that can be grasped by only a few learned scholars. Idel demonstrates his intellectual mastery of Kabbalah by citing both Jewish and Christian commentators from medieval to modern times. Many of his sources are obscure and abstruse. Seemingly in recognition of this limitation, Idel offers six appendices in which he tries to further explain the work of Abraham Abulafia, Isaac of Acre, Nahman of Braslav, Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola, among others. All of these thinkers, along with Idel, focus on the mystical aspect of the Bible as the major topic for analysis. Idel's writing is sprinkled with foreign words and phrases that are not translated, as well as English terms that require an academician's expertise: anagrammatic, renomadization, crisical, superarcanization, hypersemantic, theosophical-theurgical, historiosophical, floruit, astromagical, extradivine, imaginaire, intercorporal, ergetic, clinamenic, and so on. Kabbalah enthusiasts who emphasize its experiential rather than its intellectual aspects will be bewildered by this text, though some academic specialists may appreciate its dizzying breadth.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her mind felt weirdly disconnected, taking in only snatches of what was said. She couldn't make sense of what she heard. It was as if she was locked inside a fog that almost cleared sometimes but then swallowed her up into a blank nothingness. Was this a nightmare that kept coming and receding? She needed to wake up, get a grip on what was real, but her eyelids were so heavy.'Miss Rossiniâ¦'There it was again. Where was Bella? Why did the voices use her friend's name as though it belonged to her? It was wrong. Her head ached with trying to figure it out. The fog swirled. So much easier to slide back into oblivion where there was no painful confusion. Yet she wanted answers, wanted the torment of this nightmare to end. Which meant focusing all the energy she could summon on opening her eyes.'Oh, dear God! She woke up! She's awake!'The screech hurt her ears. The sudden glare of light made her want to close her eyes, but she fought the impulse, frightened of losing the strength to open them again. Her blurred vision picked up a flurry of movement.'I'll get the doctor!'Doctorâ¦ white bedâ¦ white screensâ¦ tubes stuck in her arm. This had to be a hospital. Some kind of sling was on her other arm. She couldn't see her legs. The blanket on the bed was covering them. She tried to move them but couldn't manage it. Dead weight. Her mind filled with a galloping fear. Was she paralysed?A nurse appeared at the foot of her bed, a pretty blond woman with anxious blue eyes. 'Hi! My name is Alison. I've paged Dr Farrell. He'll be here in a minute, Miss Rossini.'Jenny tried to say that wasn't her name but her mouth wouldn't co-operate. Her lips, her throat were so dry they felt cracked.'I'll get you a cup of ice,' Alison said, darting away.When she returned she was accompanied by a man who introduced himself as Dr Farrell. Alison fed her a piece of ice which she rolled around her tongue, working moisture from it, grateful for the lubrication trickling down her throat.'Glad to have you with us at last, Miss Rossini,' the doctor was saying, looking cheerful about it. He was a short stocky man, probably mid-thirties, dark hair given a buzz cut that seemed to defy the receding hairline, certainly no vanity about hiding it. His bright brown eyes twinkled approval of her wakeful state. 'You've been in a coma for the past two weeks.'Why? What's wrong with me?Panic churned through her as she tried to telegraph the questions with her eyes.'You were in a car accident,' he said, understanding her need to know. 'For some reason you were not wearing a seat belt and you were thrown clear of the wreck. However, you suffered a severe concussion, and the bruising of the brain undoubtedly contributed to the coma. You also had three broken ribs, a broken arm, deep lacerations on one leg and you have a cast on the other, fixing up a broken ankle. However, you are mending nicely and it's only a matter of time before you'll be on your feet again.'Relief whooshed through her. She wasn't paralysed. However, her bruised brain wasn't working so well. It couldn't recollect any memory of a car accident. Besides, it didn't make sense that she hadn't been wearing a seat belt. She always did. It was an automatic action whenever she got into a car.'I see you frowning, Miss Rossini. Are you up to speaking yet?' the doctor asked kindly.I'm not Bella. Why didn't they know that?She licked her lips and managed to croak,'My nameâ¦''Good! You know your name.'No!She tried again. 'My friendâ¦'The doctor sighed, grimaced. His eyes softened with sympathy. 'I'm sorry to tell you that your friend passed away in the accident. Nothing could be done for her. The car burst into flames before help arrived. If you had not been thrown clearâ¦'Bellaâ¦ dead? Burnt? The horror of it brought a gush of tears. The doctor took her hand and patted it, mouthing words of comfort, but Jenny didn't really hear anything but the tone. All she could think of was that being burned was a terrible way to die and Bella had been so kind to her, taking her in, giving her a place to live, even letting her borrow her name so she could work at the Venetian Forum since everyone employed there had to be Italian. Or of Italian heritage.Was that how their identities had got mixed up?The tears kept coming. The doctor left, appointing the nurse to sit at her bedside and talk to her. Jenny couldn't speak. She was too overwhelmed by the shock of her situation and the dreadful loss of her friend. Her only friend. And Bella had had no one, either. No family. Both of them orphansâa bond that had given them immediate empathy with each other.Who would bury her? What would happen to her apartment and all her thingsâ¦the home she'd made, waiting for her to come backâ¦ except she never would return to it.Eventually the exhaustion of grief drew her into sleep.Another nurse had replaced Alison when she woke up.'Hello. My name is Jill,' she said encouragingly. 'Can I get you anything, Miss Rossini?'Not Rossini. Kent. Jenny Kent. But there was no one to care about who or what she was now that Bella was gone.Fear speared through the dark turmoil in her mind.Where would she go when they finally released her from this hospital? Social Services would probably find some place for her, as they had throughout her childhood and early teenage yearsâplaces she'd hatedâ and if she was forced back into the welfare system because of her injuries, that sleazy abusive creep might hear of it.Revulsion cramped her stomach. The officials hadn't believed her when she had reported their highly experienced social worker forhelpingdown-and-out girls in return for sexual favours. He was too entrenched in the system not to be trusted, and the other girls had been too frightened of his vengeful power to back up her report. She'd been painted as a vindictive liar for not getting what she wanted from him, and no doubt he would revel in victimising her again if he became aware of her present circumstances.Yet what other choice was viable? Simply to survive she would have to be dependent on welfare until she could stand on her own two feet again and make her way, selling her sketches on the street as she had before meeting Bella. Impossible to stay on at the Venetian Forum without the Rossini name.The wild thought flashed into her mindâdid she have to give it up?Everyone thought Jenny Kent was dead.There was no one to care if she was, no one to come forward to claim her. If officialdom believed she was Isabella Rossiniâ¦ if she found out why they didâ¦ would it be too terrible of her to take over her friend's identity for a whileâ¦ stay in the apartmentâ¦ go on working at the Venetian Forumâ¦build up some savingsâ¦give herself time to think, to plan out what to do when she felt up to coping on her own?Wouldn't her friend have wanted that for her instead of all of it justâ¦ending?Rome, ItalySix Months LaterDante Rossini unwound himself from Anya's voluptuous charms and reached for his cell-phone.'Don't!' she snapped. 'You can pick up the message later.''It's my grandfather,' he said, ignoring the protest.'Oh, fine! He calls and you jump!'Her burst of petulance annoyed him. He sliced her a quelling look as he flipped open the cell-phone, knowing it could only be his grandfather because no one else had been given this private numberâan immediate link between them. He'd bought the phone for this specific use when Nonno had been diagnosed with inoperable cancer, and yes, he was ready to jump whenever it rang. Three months at most, the doctors had forecast, and already a month had gone by. Time was running out for Marco Rossini.'Dante here,' he said quickly, aware of a tight knot of urgency in his chest. 'What can I do for you, Nonno?'Frustrated that her jeering words had had no effect on him, Anya flounced off the bed and strutted angrily towards the bathroom. Time was running out on Anya Michaelson, too, he decided. She always expected to be indulged, which he hadn't minded in the past, given her fantastic body and her talent for erotic games, but her self-centred core was beginning to irritate him.He heard his grandfather wheezing, gathering breath enough to speak. 'It's a family matter, Dante.'Family? Usually it was a business issue he wanted resolved. 'What's the problem?' he asked.'I'll explain when you get here.''You want me to come now?''Yes. No time to waste.''I'll be there before lunch,' he promised.'Good boy!'Boyâ¦Dante smiled ironically as he flicked the cellphone shut. He was thirty years old, already designated to take over the management of a global business, having met every challenge his grandfather had set for him from his teenage years onward. Only Marco Rossini had the balls to still call him a boy, and Dante excused it as a term of familial affection. He'd just turned six years old when his parents were killed in a speed-boat accident and he'd been his grandfather'sboyever since.'What about me?' Anya demanded as he rose from the bed.She'd propped herself provocatively against the bathroom doorjamb, every lush naked curve jutting out at him, her long blond hair arranged in tousled disarray over her shoulders, her full-lipped mouth pouting. The desire she'd stirred earlier was gone. The only feeling she raised now was impatience.'I'm sorry. I have to leave.''You promised to take me shopping today.''Shopping is unimportant.'She was blocking the way into the bathroom. He took hold of her waist to move her aside. She flung her arms around his neck, pressing herself against him, her green eyes sparking anger. 'It is not unimportant to me, Dante. You promisedâ¦''Another time, Anya. I'm needed on Capri. Now, let go.'His voice was cold. His eyes were cold. She let go, infuriated by his command but ...", "related": ["B001E28M2Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Not the big existential ones, just the facts.  Iâd asked my mother a question about our early years and her answer would ignite another spark of curiosity rather than provide closure. In no time at all we were off and running like a couple of dog-track greyhounds. The more I wanted to know the more she wanted to tell-- like it was some sort of absolution ritual.Mom didnât need to apologize for anything--nor did I--weâd already done that countless times throughout the years. When I started interviewing doctors, institutional historians, family members, and friends I noticed there was a real pattern to this process of rediscovery. Everybody wanted to contribute. My inquiries reminded them that we were all a part of an amazing period in American history.My early childhood was fascinating in the fifties; my teens were quasi-suicidal in the sixties; young adulthood was sexy in the seventies, and the edginess of the eighties lasted into the mid-nineties. Then that edgy life caught up with me. I only turned away from it when it finally threatened to take away my worldâs most precious gift--music.This isnât literally a book about music--maybe writing about music reallyislike dancing about architecture, as the old saying goes.  But if music takes the jumble of life--the love and loss, the excitement and pain--and neatly arranges it into notes and chords and verses and choruses that somehow capture it all, then what Iâve done is a little reverse engineering by recovering all the stuff that got packed into those records, a story that trails around the world and back to a newborn leaving his teenaged motherâs arms on Welfare Island in 1952.

When he notices something familiar about Tammy Aiken, a girl playing shortstop on a rival team, he studies her and even takes photos of her on the field. Finally, Danny's mother reveals that he has a twin sister who was adopted by another family, and that they have just moved back into a nearby town. Christopher does his typically good job of describing the baseball play-by-play. However, he peppers this far-fetched plot with clues that are about as subtle as a ton of bricks. Readers will find it implausible that Tammy would not only move back in town, but also end up playing shortstop, the same position as Danny on a rival baseball team. Also unbelievable is the fact that he would notice other similarities between himself and the girl?batting with the same left-handed stance and having the same grin. When Danny finally blurts out the truth to his twin, she is shocked. Readers will be just as incredulous at the idea that Tammy's adoptive parents never believed the children would meet when they moved back into the area. Die-hard fans of Christopher may want to read this one, but it's not one of his most memorable books.?Blair Christolon, Prince William Library, Manassas, VACopyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

First, choose criminals who can plan and carry off a narrative--that of their intended crime--with at least as much savvy as the writer himself.

In telling the true story of this audacious Swedish bank heist of September 23, 2009, Ratliff metes out the known details with the subtly suspenseful mastery of a seasoned mystery/thriller writer. Featuring a motley cast on both sides of the law, the result is a gripping, seat's-edge thriller. --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 803383, "title": "Lifted (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Evan Ratliff", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Brickman is an indefatigable researcher who understands the keys to unlocking the secrets of the tort system. What is truly striking about Lawyer Barons is not just the massive amount of evidence presented but the tenacity with which he tracks down just about every scrap of available evidence on a particular problem and melds it into a compelling narrative that reads as a coherent whole.Anyone who reads this book will quickly conclude that tort reform belongs back on the national agenda.\"- Richard EpsteinLawrence A. Tisch Professor of Law, N.Y.U. Law SchoolPeter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution\"Accident rates decline, but tort costs increase. In Japan, legal fees consume just 2% of compensation payments, but American lawyers take more than half the money. If you suspected that our legal system is rigged to fund lawyers at consumers' expense, this book well documents that. Our system is disgusting. In great detail, Lester Brickman explains how American lawyers collaborate with judges to use their special coercive powers to overwhelm defendants and create 'a huge money making' machine for themselves.\"- John StosselFox Business Anchor\"In Lawyer Barons, Lester Brickman exposes the new legal power elite as little more than a sleazy, self-interested racket. Brickman surgically dismantles each rationale for their approach to justice, revealing a sewer of hypocrisy and greed. Brickman lets the facts do the work of the powerful indictment, leaving the Bar with this unavoidable choice - does it stand for justice, or money?\"- Philip HowardFounder, Common GoodAuthor, The Death of Common Sense\"Tort litigation in America is riven with abusive and corrupt practices that Dickens would find familiar. Dickens is not around to chronicle them, but fortunately, Lester Brickman is. Himself an able story-teller, Brickman combines compelling narrative with lucid summary of pertinent theories and research.  He builds a powerful case that current fee practices undermine the tort system and betray the professed values of the legal profession.\"- William H. SimonArthur Levitt Professor of LawColumbia Law School\"Lester Brickman has long strikingly exposed in scholarly and other writings the gross unfairness of much personal injury law, especially the often scandalously excessive 'contingent fees' charged by many claimants' lawyers. In this thorough but readable book Brickman both collects and expands on his seminal scholarship to the benefit of all - except those same claimants' lawyers.\"- Jeffrey O'ConnellSamuel H. McCoy II Professor of LawUniversity of Virginia School of Law\"There is about [LAWYER BARONS] the sort of fascination one has in being let in on the workings of a particularly long con. ... Mr. Brickman has made the case for a re-thinking of contingency fee arrangements.

About life. About the world. But when you write about things that eat away at you, questions aren't enough.So when I got to 'Green'--after three other novels on male-female relationships-I shocked myself by actually finding some answers: about lovers and friends (why they're not the same even though it would beÂ soooÂ convenient) and the real basis for that Mars-Venus sexual-politics gulf.A dearÂ friend invited me to Ireland for the first time eight years ago. It wasn't a place I was particularly interested in but she lived there and assured me I'd get a book out of the visit. I carriedÂ a notebook and took notes in character. I was thrilled recently to find out that John LeCarre, one of my idols, travels the same way--storyline at least vaguely in mind, writing notes as a character, people and incidents turned to stories in the notes, so that, from the first, fiction informs the journey and vice versa. I flew to Ireland that way and immediately fell in love with the place and the people.So I had a start. But something was missing. I was going through a particularly unsatisfying time in my love life and saw a profile on a dating site from a woman who said she had an open marriage and was looking for a lover. I'd never done anything quite like that before but it fit my cynical mood and, if nothing else, would have allowed for sex without complications, which at the moment seemed all I could handle.I wrote her back and we agreed to meet at a Barnes & Noble in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Oh yeah, she had no picture on her profile--but she'd sounded confident and funny so I took a chance. She turned out to be a complete knock-out, definitely the prettiest woman I've ever met online.It didn't take long for our meeting to go south. After a few minutes back-and-forth, she mentioned casually that she was the only one taking advantage of the 'open marriage.' Her husband didn't want a lover and didn't want her to take one but, she said dismissively, 'I can't be expected to confine myself to one man.'That pretty much instantly ended any interest I had in an affair. Which means, in mid-conversation, I put on my other hat--she becameÂ material. It's a rather nasty part of being a writer; anything disagreeable or unsatisfying (and much of the good stuff too) ends up viewed through the prism of story. It gets in the way of life sometimes but every job has its hazards.As she talked, I couldn't miss that every story she told--about her own life, her friend's lives--seemed to turn on how beautiful they were, the trials of being beautiful. My first reaction--I suspect it would be most people's--was 'most people would be more than willing to suffer that problem, dear.'But then it occurred to me that it really was an interesting subject--beautiful women are imprisoned in a shell they didn't create, that affects everything they do, the way they're treated by everyone they meet, that offers them a power and influence others strive mightily for and that they know will be gone in all too short a time. It's the Faustian bargain, the call to corruption in a very messy form.So by the time we said goodbye outside B&N;, I had Emily. It took seven drafts to get Jillian--she had to go from spokesperson to person and several women contributed mightily (though not always knowingly) to her. And those two characters opened the door to answers I needed.Now hopefully I can develop someÂ newproblems with women instead of the same old ones. It's a goal anyway...", "related": ["B004TZ0BE2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After his parents held him back in Kindergarten, Seth vowed he would get even by graduating high school early, which he did. Seth began attending college at fourteen years old.  After three years of college, he decided to pursue a career in the service industry rather than finish a degree, much to his parents' chagrin.  In retrospect, this path was the best to take as it not only gave him a great appreciation for the hard work of others, but also led him to his wife, Crystal, a co-worker. Throughout his life, Seth has been fascinated with music.  He sang professional opera when he was a child and was in a show choir in his formative years.  Despite having a talent for singing, he never learned to play an instrument with any aptitude nor can he read music; a misfortune he hopes to help others avoid.

After Dragon Lord was completed, I realized I had to settle the problem I had established with Jason, because I couldn't keep him in a coma for too many years. I still had no idea who the man was.One day, while revisiting the television seriesHercules, the Legendary Journeys, King Jason from Thessaly retired and married Herc's mother. I grabbed my laptop and started doing my research.Jason of Iolcus had quite a history with the Ancient Greek Gods. I watched every movie I could find, read countless accounts of his life and death on the Internet, and speculated until my brain hurt. Jason of the Community had at last been born.I went in a different direction with Jason than I did with my first three lovers. Joshua was a loner, Colton hated himself, and Ronan had severe trust issues, and was very dark and mysterious. I patterned Jason after my own beloved, who is fun-loving and an eternal cock-eyed optimist. He's also always right. (Sometimes I hate being married to a Libra.) Mike has kept my life lit for thirty years. I wondered what he'd have been like as a vampire. Well, now I know. Yee-haw!Haven's King was a joy to write from many different standpoints. My lifelong fascination with myths and legends of all sorts, combined with my own Christian beliefs, made an interesting playground in which to explore my clash in cultures. Parts of it were more difficult to write than others, especially when I wrote of Devon.In Twilight Destiny, Haven's Realm 1, I mention Devon in only two places and only briefly. Anyone who has read this book knows that Devon was killed by a vampire hunter with a particularly lethal arrow. Writing the man in book four hurt, because I put all I had into making him the most lovable of my Community family, knowing I would have to kill him in the end. My goal was to make you, dear reader, love the man as much as I imagined he'd have been loved. I needed the pain of his death to be felt.And, of course, there's Mirissa Wellston, two-year rookie police officer on the verge of becoming a Special Victims Unit investigator. Early childhood trauma robbed her body of its innocence, but not her spirit. I decided to give her a guardian angel, set her apart from the other mortals in town, just to see how Jason would react.I didn't know until the last minute that Cupid had already planned to be on hand for the first of many interferences in Jason's involvement with Mirissa. While some of the Ancient Gods were in favor of Jason's interest in Mirissa, others acted against the couple and their territory. Their struggle took a lot out of me, but I'm certain you'll love every minute of it.", "related": ["B00CL0EVT8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Grade 9 UpâIn this riveting debut novel, 16-year-old Nick and his older brother, Alan, are accustomed to life on the run. Since their father was murdered, the boys have been forced to slay demons set on them by magicians seeking the powerful charm stolen by the boys' mother. Nick is furious when Alan receives a first-tier demon mark while saving a neighborhood boy. While seeking to remove it, Nick begins to suspect that his brother is lying to him about the reason for the magicians' attempts to kill them and about why their mother screams whenever Nick touches her. Fans of theSupernaturaltelevision series will be hooked from the novel's opening lines (The pipe under the sink was leaking again. It wouldn't have been so bad, except that Nick kept his favorite sword under the sink.). Even teens who don't consider themselves genre buffs will appreciate the solid writing, fast-paced plot, and sense of authenticity that Brennan gives to the shadowy world between ordinary, modern-day London and the otherworld of demons and magicians. Though Nick and Alan's story is mostly resolved with Nick discovering the truth behind his father's death and his mother's fear of him, readers will no doubt clamor for the next book in this planned urban fantasy trilogy.âLeah J.

Inspired by years of putting my thoughts on paper, I am now ready to share the most inner part of myself with the world, as a way to inspire and help with healing and moving forward in life. On September 10, 1996 an unexpected event happened which has changed my life forever. My older brother, Marcus A. Jones had been scheduled for a routine kidney transplant at age 26, due to an unexpected illness while serving in the United States Navy while in Oakland, California. After being medically discharged from the US Navy and returning to Warren, Ohio as his disease got progressively worse, which then required dialysis three times a week. As many kidney transplant recipients hope and pray at some point they will be added to the Kidney transplant registry, well my brother received that wish, as hopes to live a normal life that he had expressed to me the day he received that call informing him that a match was located and that he would need to report to the local hospital for pre-op testing. While stationed in El Paso, Texas serving my last 2 years in the US Army, on September 1, 1996. I received a phone call from my sister at 1030am that day, having the day off, after answering the phone my sister asked if I had spoken to Marcus, because he had something very important that he wanted to tell me, stating the he had been trying to contact me in which he was unable to get thru statng that the recording said all circuits were busy. Briefly speaking with him, he seemed anxious and had a lot of concerns regarding the surgery and pre-op instructions that he would be getting once he arrived at the hospital. During the course of our short conversation my attempt to reassure him, and that kidney transplants had come a long way", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Being a part of the culture for this period has enabled him to get to know the people and their mind-set and customs.  It also has allowed him to observe the good and the bad of a dictatorship government.  This has provided the inspiration and the foundation for this story, Doublestar Conspiracy, in which havoc that takes place in the United States is created by actions that take place in the Middle East.  With the turmoil now taking place in the whole Middle Eastern region, and the ousters of Mubarack and Khadafy capturing the headlines, this story of the attempted removal of another cruel dictator is pertinent for today. His children's book, Maadi's Adventures in Egypt, is founded on the eleven years spent in that country, three of which were with his dog, Maadi. . He has also traveled extensively throughout Europe. Tides Inn came about due to the time spent in the atmospheric British Pubs and imbibing in the great British Ales.  A love of British Mysteries also helped. He grew up in New Orleans, attended Louisiana State University, and is now retired with his wife Sally, in the Lake Tahoe, Nevada area.

At first, the eager young bee enthusiastically follows her sisters' lead, but she soon grows tired of the tedious regiment and is curious about the wider world. When the bee-master's daughter takes a bicycle trip to the Chateau of Villandry, Bea follows the girl and is enthralled by the incredible beauty of the vast gardens. The weather changes abruptly, however, and the pleasant sojourn becomes a life-threatening experience. Fortunately, the bee-master comes to the rescue and carries Bea back to the hive. The young honey maker realizes how lucky she is to have survived and that rules are for her own good. While didactic in nature, the somewhat contrived plot does reinforce to children the need for rules to define acceptable behavior and to insure safety. The oversized, double-spread watercolors depict the French countryside and the busy work of the bees. Unfortunately, the pedestrian artwork does little to lighten the message. The endpapers add interesting trivia about France, pollination, and other related topics, but they are hardly enough to make this a priority purchase.?Debra Gold, Cuyahoga County Public Library, Parma Heights, OHCopyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a result, they've stopped reading it. It's gone out of vogue, and lost it's prominence in the literary world. I believe that's because today's readers demand relevancy. If poetry made sense to people, if it came alive and jumped off the page with a moving message, why wouldn't the public read it? I promise you this collection of poems won't be dry, boring or incomprehensible. I believe there is still a niche for poetry which is inspirational, motivational, even exquisite in nature. We all need to be reminded that there is something greater inside of us than the confining, challenging circumstances we face, and this trilogy of e-books proclaims it IS possible for you to overcome the hurdles in your life.

In a sensational case Myra Hindley and Ian Brady were tried and sentenced to life in prison. The horrific nature of their crimes made them two of the most reviled characters in Britain. Four children were murdered by Hindley and Brady and buried on Saddleworth Moor; the body of one of their victims, Keith Bennett, is yet to be found.   With unprecedented access to Myra Hindleyâs papers combined with the cooperation of the families of the victims, the police and expert witnesses, Duncan Staff has written a definitive account of these terrible events. He casts new light on the motivation for the murders, the nature of Hindleyâs relationship with Brady and her life in prison. In bringing together this evidence, Staff calls for a renewed effort to find the body of Keith Bennett.   The Lost Boy is a classic work of investigative journalism and the gripping story of the most notorious crimes in Britain of the last one hundred years.", "related": [], "rank": 2101344, "title": "The Lost Boy eBook", "author": "Duncan Staff", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bill and Mark documented those findings in Shades of Play so those who start playing guitar will keep playing guitar.

Mark has played college football, hiked to the bottom of the Grand Canyon (twice), climbed Colorado Fourteeners, backpacked throughout Europe and South America, written three books, closed multimillion dollar software deals, gotten arrested in Mexico (several times), ran marathons and triathlons . . . and raised two children. Ever since Bill convinced him he could play guitar he hasn't spent a boring moment in his life.

The accused, Brennan Rose, is the boyfriend of Joleneâs mechanic, Cory. Jolene and Cory discover another tragedy in Brennanâs past, along with several folks who hold deep grudges. Then Dannyâs criminal father surfaces at the boyâs first football game, and Ray arrests him. The mystery is skillfully presented here, but itâs the personalities who really shine, moving the story beyond most similar crime series featuring an amateur sleuth married to a cop. Several surprises in the charactersâ personal lives will keep readers turning pages right to the end. Fans of G. A.

Recommendations for preventing cyber bullying in the first place and intervening in instancesÂ that occur are provided in a clear, programmatic way. The cyber bullying stories give an inside look into cyber bullying in a way that simply describing research cannot. The book will appeal to those conducting research in the area of cyber bullying, but will also be beneficial to school administrators and counselors as well as parents. Each chapter ends with reflective questions that will provide both parents and teachers with important talking points related to cyber bullying.â(Robin Kowalski, Professor of Psychology 2009-06-25)âAs a researcher of bullying, I really got some great ideas about how to handle this new concept of cyberbullying.

GREAT resource!â(Rhonda Williams, Assistant Professor 2009-06-25)\"Trolley and her associates approach issues of cyber bullying fromÂ the very practical, very hands-on level of the cyber kidsâaround the world and down the block. The overall theme is restoring balance: balance among kids, families, educational professionals, and the technologies themselves. This book provides insights and practical tools to help cyber kids navigate safely and securely through this new technological world. It is a very useful addition to a growing set of resources for both professionals and parents.â(Mike Donlin, Senior Program Consultant 2009-06-25)âWhether we like it or not, teens are tightly tied to technology. While most adolescents are responsible in their use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices, some are not. InCyber Kids, Cyber Bullying, Cyber Balance, the authors help bring adults up to speed by pulling together information from a variety of sources to illustrate the varied ways in which adolescents use and misuse technology. The book provides parents, teachers, and other youth-serving adults with sensible strategies to help bring balance back to the technology utilization of the children they supervise. The 'cyber story' features interspersed throughout the text help paint a clear picture of the role of technology in the lives of youth using real-life stories. Readers are sure to learn something about the positive and not-so-positive ways adolescents utilize technology.â(Justin Patchin, Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice, University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire 2009-06-25)\"Trolley and her colleagues draw upon a vast array of resources to get a sense of how children and youth use technology. Packaged with real-life stories, practical examples, and applications, this book is very informative for parents and educators of all types.\"(Qing Li, Education Professor 2009-06-25)âThis book is a useful manual filled with concise information, valuable tools, and a proactive model. School districts can develop practices and policies that support cyber balance in our studentsâ lives.

After Katie Lynn Cooke's father informs her they can't afford a trip to Florida to visit Grandma, Katie Lynn and her best friend, Tina, bake a batch of cookies using Grandma's recipe, plus her \"secret ingredient\"Amayonnaise. Tina gives samples to a local restaurant owner who hires the girls to supply the dessert. After baking incessantly all summer, the two pals raise enough money to visit Katie Lynn's grandmother together. Yet when Katie Lynn and her friend tell Mrs. Cooke that they have earned enough for \"us\" to make the trip, the clueless woman assumes that \"us\" means Katie Lynn and her rather than Tina. With another leap of credibility, the young heroine solves the problem in a snap: \"I used the money to fly Grandma here to see us!\" Grandma suddenly appears on the doorstep and announces she's staying on permanently to help the girls bake and sell cookies. Katie Lynn gushes, \"Oh, Grandma! That would be so incredible!\" Readers may be inclined to agree.

His well-written critiques reveal hard truths about the Mountain State. --Stephen Skinner -- West Virginia House of DelegatesIn just a short amount of time, Sean O'Leary has become one the leading intellectual critics of state policy. His collection of essays not only provides a window into understanding the most challenging and pressing problems facing the Mountain State, but it also provides a realistic path toward building a shared prosperity that has remained so elusive to policymakers over the years. Everyone who believes that it s time to start putting West Virginia working families first instead of last should read this book. --Ted Boettner -- Executive Director, West Virginia Center on Budget & PolicyThe keen political insights contained here are desperately needed. For a long time I have wondered why West Virginians regularly support policies that hurt them economically. O'Leary's finely reasoned arguments help us understand this disturbing contradiction. In one of O'Leary's most compelling pieces, he argues a new paradigm is required for measuring success, one built on human values and not economic ones. This is the kind of brave, bold vision that can lift West Virginia from the cellar of national statistics. With such guidance as O'Leary's, West Virginia could enter the vanguard of progressive states where reliance upon excellence in education trumps reliance upon the ever-diminishing payback from extractive industries. Among the forty-three commentaries are others less politically focused including a magnificent reflection upon the legacy of Senator Robert Byrd.

After three years of postgraduate work he entered practice in Carrollton Georgia a small town in the western part of the state as a general practitioner. This was to be a temporary assignment to obtain financial stability necessitated by the economics of pursuing a career in medicine in the 1950s. Those were the days where physicians in training were paid as little as $10 per month. It wasn't long however before he found himself deeply involved in the lives of the patients he served there and his original plans of becoming an academic physician faded away. Now after 54 years of practicing primary care he continues to find service to his patients to be rewarding and a never-ending challenge and thus he is still at it. Dr. Birge has always been an advocate of healthcaring providing patients dedication interest and compassion which he feels are essential elements in being a good physician. He has also been community oriented having served on the Carrollton city Council and served as chairman of the Carroll County Board of Health. He has also been a strong advocate of quality healthcare having been Medical Director of Quality for the Tanner Health Systems, a three hospitals system. Dr. Birge previously wrote a book titled \"Murder Without Death\" a true story about events taking place in Carrollton Georgia in the 1970s. In addition he has had long-standing interest in public education regarding healthcare and co authored a book on patient symptoms titled \"Your Body's Red Light Warning Signals\" published by Random House Publishing Company which has sold over 100,000 copies. That book is now being published in China, Vietnam, South Korea, Croatia, and Poland.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As\nsuch, you might have become more aware of your own cholesterol levels, and how\nit affects your health. Cholesterol levels have long been an indicator of heart\nhealth because of their association with coronary heart disease and stroke, but\ncholesterol is not the enemy of heart health. The good and bad cholesterols the\nnews cover are actually fatty molecules that attach to cholesterol and these\nmolecules are what your blood test reports. Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and\nhigh-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are molecules that either carry cholesterol to\nyour heart or to your liver. The LDL-cholesterol that reaches your arteries and\nheart inflames your arteries. This inflammation can lead to coronary heart\ndisease.Unfortunately, there are\nmultiple factors that affect your heart health. Your LDL, HDL, and cholesterol\nlevels have to be taken into account. A blood test usually gives you the amount\nof all of these plus triglycerides, the amount of fat in your bloodstream. In\ngeneral, higher levels of LDLs, cholesterol, and triglycerides can signify a\nhigher risk of heart disease and stroke. HDLs, the molecule that takes\ncholesterol to your liver to be broken down for recycling, are the opposite,\nand the higher your levels, the lower your chances of heart disease. Luckily,\nthere are ways you can control your cholesterol levels.While high\nLDL-cholesterol levels may increase your risk of coronary heart disease and\nstroke, you are not doomed to those ailments. High cholesterol is a reversible\ncondition that can be dealt with through nutrition and knowledge. The\nnutritional labels on food are designed to help you, and they list the levels\nof saturated and trans fats in food. These are the fats that raise your\nLDL-cholesterol levels. To lower these levels, avoid foods high in saturated\nand trans fats. The labels also list the nutrients that can help lower your\nLDL-cholesterol and raise your HDL-cholesterol. Focus on eating foods high in\nsoluble fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants.A good, general guideline\nfor heart healthy eating is to avoid foods with solid fats, the saturated fats.\nThese are usually used in cooking processes as well as certain foods. Instead,\ncook with water or on low-heat settings with olive oil or canola oil, and\nbypass the butter, cream and palm oils. Instead of salt, use spices rich in\nantioxidants, such as turmeric, to help control your blood pressure. Limit\nintake of fatty cuts of meat and try eating more fish or vegetarian sources of\nprotein. This will replace saturated fats with omega-3 fatty acids. If the\nchanges to your diet are too drastic, try taking these nutrients as supplements\nand work your way up.Exercise is a good\naddition to any lifestyle. Simply moving more throughout the day can improve\ntriglyceride levels, reduce blood pressure, and lower your risk of developing\nheart disease. For those overweight who are attempting to lose the pounds,\nexercise in combination with healthier eating is a good starting point.\nAdditionally, stress reduction is a good way to keep your heart healthy.\nNatural therapies will lower your stress, and natural health practitioners can\nprovide you with a list of nutrients to include in your diet. They will advise\nagainst some habits that are known to raise the risk of heart attack, like\nsmoking.Ultimately, reducing your\ncholesterol is achievable through a wide variety of options. Whether you\ncompletely adopt a new, saturated fat free diet, or include natural therapies\nand supplements is up to you and your doctor. Do what fits your lifestyle best,\nand watch your cholesterol levels shrink.Once you switch to a\nheart healthy lifestyle, there are a multitude of resources. A few books have\nbeen published that pinpoint a new culprit. The inflammation in the arteries\nmight play a larger role in coronary heart disease than previously thought, and\nthese books claim that the current cholesterol-lowering medications are\nunnecessary.Regardless, across the\nboard the solution to high cholesterol levels is a change in lifestyle.\nHealthier eating and moderate exercise can lower cholesterol and your risk of\nheart disease.", "related": ["B00CNVZFRW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Since then, Kenneth Copeland Ministries has grown to include not only its headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, but offices in Canada, England, South Africa and Australia as well.  Best known for his exuberant proclamation that \"Jesus is Lord!\", Kenneth Copeland has introduced people the world over to the saving message of faith. However, the vision of KCM includes more than simply introducing people to Jesus Christ. Theirs is a vision of taking believers on to maturity in the principles of faith, love, healing, prosperity, redemption and righteousness.

I especially love writing inspirational books, religious fiction and poetry.  As a person of faith, I truly believe that God gives us all the gift of inner and outer insight into the world at large. That way, we can learn from those experiences and become a walking testimony and ministry for others we can positively affect.  It never ceases to amaze me that with faith and understanding, we can all make a world of difference to those we come into contact with. That is why writing spiritual and inspirational stories are my personal favorites. The primary goal in my stories is to enlighten and inspire the reader. My mantra is \"Live for the glory of what God has blessed you with and he will lead you to a beautiful tomorrow.\" When I am not reading and writing, I enjoy cooking, shopping, spending time with my partner & friends and taking walks in the park with my daughter.", "related": ["B00KG252XM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The fifteen stories contained within\nthis book have a wide range of different narratives, from 'The Old\nLady' to 'A Knock on the Door' to the final story 'Church of\nthe Modern Apostles.' The stories stand alone, and each can be\nenjoyed one at a time, but the themes and narrative styles present\ncompliment each other nicely.Mostly all of the stories are told in the first\nperson, placing the reader right within the imagined tale that is\ntaking place. As Needham describes in the book's introduction,\nthese stories were written with a purpose, to broaden the reader's\nimagination and cause them to delve into each of these short stories\nfully. He requests each story to be looked upon individually, fully\nimmersing yourself into each of the tales he has spun. The characters\nrange from all sorts of different people, but each one is fully\ndeveloped and makes the story he or she is entwined within matter,\naffecting the reader in an intrinsic way. Needham excels at the short\nnarrative, although from the vast amount of content imagined within\neach tale, it is likely that he would succeed at writing a\nfull-length novel as well. If you are looking to get lost for a while\nin stories that twist reality and offer up notions to ponder, then\nthis is the book for you.", "related": [], "rank": 3736663, "title": "Short Pathways In A Room Of Imagination eBook", "author": "John Needham", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I live outside of Tampa, Florida with my fabulous wife Anita, and one remaining son at home, Montana. I have three older boys, Mark, Gary, and Anthony, all of whom have married and presented us with terrific grandchildren.  My early reading interests were arguably all sci-fi related, from Doctor Doolittle, Captain Marvel, to Superman. I then transitioned to \"real\" science fiction on black and white TV, such as Captain Video and Flash Gordon. I read hundreds of books by the science fiction greats growing up, and thousands of fair to not so greats in dual novel paperbacks and magazines. My education gravitated to science, starting out as a physics major and my depression era folks told me I'd never make a living as a theoretical physicist (probably right, and Cosmology wasn't a career field then), so I moved to Electronics Engineering. I did most of that in the aerospace field for MacDonnell Douglas Corp, in St. Louis, Mo. I worked on the F4 Phantom project, and briefly on Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL), before the fickle fates of government finance forced contract cancelations. I devoted (read: I was drafted into) two years' service for the US Army from 1965 to 1967. A great two years, and the Army, caring not a whit for my electronics background, offered this draftee a job as an Air Traffic Controller. Cool! After discharge I spent a short time back at MacDonnell Douglas before the contract reductions laid me off, and was hired by Emerson Electric (1968), working on the design of a neat heads-up fire control system for the Army's new Cheyenne Helicopter (to be a 270-knot hybrid fixed wing/rotor craft). Never heard of it? The fickle fates of Army finance is why this time, plus Lockheed didn't keep the airframe part from crashing and burning at a crucial point in development. I taught Electronics for about eighteen months (near starvation wages after the high pay), and finally decided to try my hand at actually supporting my family again. I hired on with the Federal Aviation Administration as an Air Traffic Controller in 1970. Thanks Army! I spent exactly forty years in federal service, deciding in 1979 to use my technical background to work on writing features for the software of the FAA's Terminal Automation Systems (for 28 of those 40 years). Retired, I finally decided to try my hand at writing what I love to read, Science Fiction. My Koban series is doing well, with 4 books out so far.", "related": ["B00LDCER4E"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 48.0}

An intricate reimagining of earth history and the influence of extra-terrestrial civilization, her descriptive ability creates a compelling and immersive world which is thoroughly enthralling. Delivering a tantalizingly plausible vision of unexplained aspects of evolving civilization it has all the elements of great Science Fiction, but it's Joseph's attention to detail that really sets her books apart. Combining meticulous research with the mechanics of great storytelling, it makes for pure escapism and an unquestionable belief in the legitimacy of her characters. Their technology, politics, beliefs and the influence they have exerted in creating the foundations of our modern world, The Alterran Legacy Series is truly epic Science Fiction that would transition well to multiple mediums", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
