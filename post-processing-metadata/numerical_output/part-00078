She was, as the title states, his last love, and the author (no relation), director of the Kafka Project at San Diego State University, has assiduously tracked the traces of her subjects through personal recollections, private papers and newly opened archives in the former Soviet bloc. Dora (1898- 1952) and Kafka first met at a Baltic resort, and she was instantly captivated by his intelligence and deep sensitivity. Kafka in turn was swept away by the vivacious 25-year-old Polish-born Jew, who had fled her Orthodox family for the broader intellectual currents of Weimar Germany. But Yiddish was her first language and she knew Jewish traditions, and Kafka found her a beacon for the religion his own family had rejected. The author describes at great length the one year the lovers lived together in Berlin, but more interesting is the account of Dora and her larger family history after Kafka's painful death in 1924. Here was a woman intent on keeping Kafka's flame alive, who was forced by war and political upheaval to flee from one country after another. Many relatives died in the Holocaust. Her treasured possessions, Kafka's last diaries, were seized by the Gestapo and have never been found. For 15 years her husband, having served time in Nazi prisons and the Soviet gulag, lived in East Berlin, unaware that Dora and their daughter had survived the war. The remarkable story continues in Moscow, London, San Francisco and Tel Aviv, the far-flung points of dispersal of a family caught in the maelstroms of fascism, communism and the Holocaust. 16 pages of b&w; photos.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But a mere century ago, scientists didn't know how to culture cells in a medium and believed that cells couldn't live outside their parent organism. As Landecker reminds us, today we can hardly live without cell cultures, which are used for everything from routine medical tests to genetic engineering. Landecker, a professor in the anthropology department at Rice University, focuses on five aspects of how cells have literally taken on a life of their own. Around 1900, scientists learned to observe cellular activity in the lab and then pursued the immortality of cell lines, a project that resulted in more than one notorious fiasco. Mass reproduction of cells was the obvious next step at mid-century and led to the polio vaccine. A widely distributed cell line (HeLa) derived from a Baltimore woman with cervical cancer made it possible for scientists to standardize their research, but also demonstrated how lines could grow out of control. Most recently, scientists learned in the late 20th century how to hybridize cells, mixing ingredients from various species. Landecker at times interprets to distraction—even minor aspects of her story are weighed for their significance—but she is a keen observer of scientific practice.(Feb.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Through highly readable portraits, the authors take readers into these teachers' classrooms, illustrating richly what it is they do differently that yields such great results from English learners. Because most teachers profiled work within a three-tiered Response-to-Intervention framework, the book shows how to implement RTI effectively with ELLs—from providing general reading instruction for the entire classroom to targeted interventions with struggling students. Written by noted ELL educators Diane Haager, Janette K. Klingner, and Terese Aceves, How to Teach English Language Learners is filled with inspiring success stories, teaching tips, activities, discussion questions, and reflections from these outstanding teachers.Praise forHow to Teach English Language Learners\"Drawing from the complex and challenging milieu of educating diverse student populations, the authors provide a dynamic teaching and learning resource for ensuring literacy success.

In fact, I used several of these stories in my own college education classes. Teachers currently in classrooms, especially the young ones, will read this book and say, \"Yes!\"  I arranged the stories chronologically so readers see the young, inexperienced teacher grow into the more mature, experienced professional. People who look back on their high school experiences and wonder \"what were those teachers thinking\" will now know. Finally, anyone who likes a good short story will find this book refreshing because the chapters are about human beings experiencing an American rite of passage:  surviving high school.Q:  What surprised you most about writing The Education of a Teacher?A:  I thought my stories would be about the subject I taught for thirty-four years: high school English and speech.  Instead, they centered on memorable students and interactions with them.  I can still hear their voices and see their high school faces.  They taught me a how to be a teacher. I located many of these students who were eager to help with this book, and it was most gratifying to hear where their lives have gone.Q:  Since you taught English, didn't you find it easy to write your own stories?A:  It took me six years, on and off, to finish this book.  I taught expository writing in high school, but chose to use creative nonfiction in my book.  That meant I had to walk an ethical line between using the facts as I remembered them (or could corroborate them), and creating dialogue or using nonlinear plots. These stories read like fiction but they are based on fact. People often ask how I can remember conversations.  Some conversations I remember quite clearly, and others I created to approximate what might have been said to move the story in a factual direction.   Q: What aspects of a public school teaching career do you believe are central to your book?A:  The early stories touch on my fears.  Every first-year teacher has some of those fears despite the face he or she puts on.  Those early years a teacher deals with fear, sleeplessness, and concerns about discipline and ethics.  Exhaustion becomes a way of life.  Many of the stories reveal how teachers figure out a way to be genuine in their reactions and interactions with students, but also remain professional and ethical.  Differences in socio-economic backgrounds and home lives play a huge part in many of these stories.  And aloneness is a real issue in teaching.  Every day teachers go into their classrooms, shut their doors, and have to deal with all kinds of issues and decisions alone.  It can be a very lonely and frustrating profession.  Problem-solving and making ethical decisions are important skills for any professional teacher.  These true stories reveal how all of these aspects of public school teaching are a part of teachers' lives on a daily basis.Q:  What issues do your stories address?A:  The book has fifteen chapters and each addresses a topic teachers often face.  Some of those subjects are:  drug use, socio-economic differences, racial issues, intellectual freedom, the death of a student, teenage pregnancy and sexual abuse, teacher aging, and book censorship.  The longest story is about a book challenge to Kurt Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions. Some of the stories are humorous, focusing on the lighter side of the job.Q:  What are you working on now?A:  I'm moving to fiction and working on a novel of the cozy mystery genre.  Set in a small town, it will involve a main character who just retired from teaching and finds herself in the middle of a murder.  I'm having great fun planning and writing in a new genre.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It didn't matter what Lizzie did or how good she tried to be; her mother would always find something wrong with her. A part-time job with Dearden's shop helped get Lizzie out of the house. Then a few years later, when Sam Thoxby proposes, Lizzie grasps the chance to get away permanently. But once they're wed, Lizzie discovers she has escaped from one unhappy household into another as Sam turns into a stranger, forbidding her to talk to family and friends, not allowing her to work, and eventually becoming abusive whenever she angers or defies him. As England becomes involved in World War I and Sam goes off to fight, Lizzie finally escapes, but when Sam returns, Lizzie finds her new happy life, and second chance at love, threatened. A stubbornly courageous young woman endures an abusive marriage and then manages to create a more hopeful future in Jacobs' captivating, wonderfully old-fashioned historical novel.John CharlesCopyright © American Library Association.

The Reggie & Ryssa series developed when Bo discovered a passion in her children and others, for fantasy fiction suitable for kids, but didn't \"talk down\" to them. Reading has always been one of her great passions in life, and she wanted to encourage that in the next generation by giving them a tale that was uniquely theirs. There are 6 books currently planned for the Reggie & Ryssa series, and 5 books for the Broken Wings series, plus a spin off series that delves further into the realm of the Grigori. Bo writes under several pseudonyms, to keep the genres of her books separate and distinct in the hearts and minds of her readers. Her books for young adults are written under Bo Savino. Her spiritual books are written under Dr. Kim Savino. Her contemporary books (primarily fantasy) are written under A.J. Rand (after her 3 sons...Aaron, Joshua, & Random). Finally, her supernatural romance books are written under Catherine Chase (after her 2 grandchildren).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When Evan tells her he loves her, Judith is reminded of another man--  a man who forced himself upon her and left her in disgrace.  Can Judith trust Evan to be different?  She tries to keep control of her emotions, but when Judith is in Evan's arms it is her heart that is in control.  As Evan is getting to know Judith, peculiar things are happening at Meremont.

The irony here is that \"Knots\" went through ten editions in its first eleven years, and to this day many consider it to be J.C. Ryle's magnum opus!Because “Knots” is a systematic defense of confessional Christianity, as opposed to the chaos which marks the modern church, perhaps it could be argued that its fall in popularity is simply a reflection of contemporary Christians’ antagonism to orthodoxy. However this may be, one thing is certain: “Knots Untied” is a remarkable witness for the evangelical faith—a witness that if heeded could only benefit the Church.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It puts into sharp relief how welfare policy today reinforces the cultural biases against the poor while actually working to make the poorest of the poor even poorer. Steeped in deep understanding of the history of welfare policy,Cheating Welfarepoignantly relies on first-hand accounts from clients to specify the ways that the current system works to undermine their attempts to achieve self- sufficiency. The contemporary integration of welfare policy and criminal law is put under a brilliant light for all to see. This is a most timely and critical book that should be read widely.”-Sanford Schram,author ofWelfare Discipline: Discourse, Governance and Globalization\"Cheating Welfareis simultaneously compassionate and scholarly. Gustafson provides a rare insider perspective on how citizens understand and use welfare. The stories that she relates are a testament to the resilience and strength of people caring for others as best they can in the face of great adversity. Her discussion of necessary, sometimes inadvertent, non-compliance as a form of resistance brings a more complex understanding to theories of rule abidance. This compelling book is a must-read for students, policymakers, and scholars who wish to have informed opinions based on how policies actually shape the behavior of and outcomes for low-income citizens in the context of their complex lived reality.”-Corey Shdaimah,author ofNegotiating JusticeThe 1990s ushered in an era of neoliberal changes in the US in public policies aimed at the poor.  Key to these modifications  was a shift in ideological thought that mandated personal responsibility for all.  Poverty researchers have always paid attention to the hegemonic discourses that shaped public policy, ranging from regulating the behaviors of the poor, to determining which poor are worthy of assistance, to punishing the poor (e.g., Loïc Waquant,Punishing the Poor, 2009;  Michael Katz,The Undeserving Poor, 1989).  Gustafson (law, Connecticut) continues this tradition  by focusing on how US welfare policy has increasingly become criminalized  despite the polyvocality of welfare recipients.  She examines the similarities and differences of 34 female and male respondents concerning their knowledge, perspectives, and experiences  of the rules and sanctions governing welfare.  The author begins by offering a comprehensive overview of US poverty embedded within a criminalization of poverty,and draws upon rational choice theory to conceptually frame her arguments.  She adeptly demonstrates the need for a new paradigm that embodies the words of the Founding Fathers to \"promote the general Welfare\" of all US citizens.  Students and researchers alike will benefit from her multidisciplinary  approach.  Summing Up:Recommended.  Most levels/libraries.-Choice,The book is a readable account of welfare mothers (and a few fathers), emphasizing how these people understand and often violate the rules they are supposed to follow. It would be useful in a course on welfare or perhaps as supplementary reading in a course on poverty.-C.

These are stories to be told and retold, until we work together both locally and internationally to assure that human trafficking is no longer tolerated.'' --Rody Thompson, Southeast PeaceJam Director, Florida State University''In 'This Is Our Story,' Wendi Adelson has captured the reality of young trafficked women in the United States. The main protagonists are multi-dimensional, evoking sympathy and admiration as well as frustration and pity. She brings to life the utter disregard for human dignity that characterizes traffickers around the world. She movingly and persuasively demonstrates how the victims are brutalized into believing in their own lack of self-worth, lack of recourse, and lack of a future. The book ends with a bitter-sweet, frustrating, but all too real resolution that brings into stark relief the magnitude and gravity of human trafficking.'' --Marisa Cianciarulo, Associate Professor of Law, Chapman University", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Like Geppetto, Pino has the gift of making wood come to life, and this skill causes many people to want favors from him. The two go on a magical quest of danger and intrigue, meeting interesting characters and visiting unusual settings. They hear a voice in a cave, and the People of the Tall Trees tell them to visit Queen Elendrew. She has healing skills, and they strike a deal with her, but they soon learn that she doesn't respond with gratitude and they're off again, running from danger. The concept of taking this classic story and showing what could happen after it ends is sure to grab readers' attention. This fun read is a fast-paced adventure filled with thoughtful life lessons that will encourage readers to accept themselves as they are and to appreciate how they are different. It is certain to prompt contemplation and discussion.-Helen Foster James, University of California at San Diegoα(c) Copyright 2011.

On top of that, a ruthless conqueror has risen from beyond the edge of the world, with his ever-growing army in their fleet of flying ships, to lay siege to the people of Europe and steal their cheese.

And not just for the wealthy, insists Astra Taylor, who split her formative years between \"unschooling\" at home and traditional public schools. At home, curiosity ruled. She and her siblings enjoyed free reign of the mind, encouraged by their parents to pursue whatever they chose, whenever they chose. No 50-minute sessions, no mandated math, no social minefields... In public school, she endured what she describes as \"the management of boredom, the administration of mental fatigue.\" These contrasting experiences might lead a lesser writer to lambaste the nation's schools as little more than factories for the manufacturing of passive patriots, but Taylor is, frankly, better educated than that, andUnschoolingrepresents a much more meaningful undertaking. She ultimately seeks a compassionate compromise, based on a respect for our shared destiny and fueled by--here it is again--ceaseless curiosity. Ideas abound in this breezily heady read for parents, educators, administrators, and anyone (of any class) who recognizes the fundamental importance of education in a literate world. --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B005LYTHZO"], "rank": 929960, "title": "Unschooling (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Astra Taylor", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

By holding out his brainwave, Michael K. prevents the 3.14 million and one brainwave globe from powering the ultimate destruction device; the red hot ray. The chief, in a plot to get Michael K's coveted brain wave, sends diversions all over the globe, leaving Michael and friends to finish fifth grade alone. When the new principal starts assigning television, texting, and videogames as homework, Michael gets suspicious. The quirky plot, zippy dialogue, zany art, and abundant action will keep easily distracted readers moving at full pace. Individual pages with complimentary science are interspersed through the book for interesting, but not overwhelming, interludes. The extensive catalog of characters and winding storyline make this a tough read without prior Spaceheadz knowledge, but will make an excellent addition where the previous installments are popular. The related website is a fun supplement to the story.—Devin Burritt, Wells Public Library, ME", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We know nothing about him, except that he knows no one in the town. Looking for a late dinner, he enters a bistro. Jose, the owner, tells Gabriel that he is not cooking that night; his wife has been hospitalized. The next day Gabriel takes groceries to Jose’s bistro and cooks for him. He does a similar thing for Madeleine, who works at his hotel. Taken with Gabriel, Madeleine offers herself to him, but he politely declines. Garnier presents Gabriel as a human anodyne, a Samaritan as gentle as the titular stuffed panda he buys for Jose’s children, and he bears his ennui by cooking for his new friends. But we also learn that something in his past haunts him, and it generates a denouement that Albert Camus would have understood. The Panda Theory is Gallic to its core. Some American readers may dismiss it, but Francophiles will embrace it. --Thomas Gaughan", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I like that it includes ethics but goes beyond that – the four elements of excellence on the Web go to the unique characteristics of the medium and therefore give students something new to think about and discuss, whether from the viewpoint of journalists or as media consumers. ... The book, by looking specifically at opportunities and challenges of ethical journalism ONLINE, will contribute to understanding both journalism ethics (because there are new challenges online) and the general practice of online journalism.\"(Kathy Olson 2010-06-21)“Reading about the practices and insights of working professionals is the book’s greatest appeal. Chapters are richly detailed and address significant issues in online journalism. The writing is brisk and highly readable, and the examples are well chosen.”(Steven D. Koski 2010-09-13)“The greatest benefit is Craig’s focus on the interrelated nature of the multiple forms of information presentation and the need for practitioners to move beyond the traditional journalism model.” (Michael Williams 2010-09-13)\"Excellence in Online Journalismprovides a great deal of concrete information for students. Its grounding in the tradition of journalism ethics makes it particularly valuable since the ethics become so well integrated into the practice. Students should easily learn that becoming an ethical reporter will make them a better reporter. Those teaching online journalism will do their students a good service by considering this book.\" (Paul A Soukup, SJCommunication Research Trends2012-04-02)\"Craig uses the philosophical approach of the Notre Dame scholar Alasdair MacIntyre as applied by the media ethicists Sandra Borden and, to a lesser extent, Edmund Lambeth. This philosophical approach allows for the consideration of developing standards in the digital era, challenging some old rules while incorporating most of them into a rede?nition.”(Mark Neuzil, Ph.D.Journal of Mass Media Ethics2012-09-15)“Institutions, such as media companies, come in for criticism when the balance of quality and pro?t get out of whack. Craig does a good job providing examples of how the professionals he interviewed attempt to keep quality in the product.”(Mark Neuzil, Ph.D.Journal of Mass Media Ethics)“Craig’s book is appropriate in a journalism ethics course, although I would be tempted to assign it in an advanced multimedia reporting class to flesh out the ethical dimensions of a journalist’s decision making while showcasing the new best practices.”(Mark Neuzil, Ph.D.Journal of Mass Media Ethics)'This handbook will be welcome on any practical journalism course, especially at colleges that embrace the potential for theory-practice synergies. Its thoughtful approach via four elements of excellence, and the idea of external and internal goods, admirably situates thinking about journalism at the heart of doing it.

Created in a sterilized 1980s laboratory with gleaming white walls, he was marked for greatness, bound to be a beacon in the sea of humanity, leading the masses to an everlasting epoch of unequaled love and prosperity. Under the flickering glow of a long fluorescent tube, he was taken pain-staking care of by a classified team of anonymous doctors, who watched, if not lovingly, at very least proudly, as he grew from idea, to germ, to bouncing baby boy. Nourished on the best things money can’t buy and taught at the feet of the greatest philosophers yet to be born, David Morgan grew into a man. And became a writer. And the doctors were all canned.  Or David Morgan was born in California, but only lived there for a short time before being whisked away to spend his formative years in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He played a lot of soccer, but only when he wasn’t parading around the neighborhood with his brother. He excelled in school right up to the point when he realized that the world would, in fact, not end if he didn’t complete his homework, and then he did okay. Above all he was nice. Or so he would have you believe. But what he won’t tell you, is that he once sent a friend hurtling down a dirt path on a bike, instructing him that on this part of the trail you have to go as fast as you can, and then David watched in delight as said friend jumped the edge of a small cliff and ended up hanging inches above a dirty creek, only separated from the stinking water by a dense patch of foliage. He won’t tell you about that. David lives with his wife and daughters in a house. He is severely outnumbered at home in the gender department, but he thinks that’s pretty cool. David writes from the warm tropical beaches of his mind, but looks forward to a day when he can write from the warm tropical beaches of Hawaii’s reality.

Although clearly a well-intentioned man, Hammond seems smug, introverted, alienated, even aloof to everyone except his wife, Julie. Hammond's smoldering unhappiness heightens when he alone hears what is apparently God's voice saying \"Know that the truth is . . . .\" Shaken and mystified by this inexplicable, fragmentary message, Hammond hears the voice again eight days later when it delivers a similarly cryptic warning. Then, Jakey Miles, the child of a couple in Hammond's congregation, is permanently blinded in a freak accident on church property. When Jakey's distraught father irrationally blames Hammond, the pastor punches him out of sheer frustration. Overwhelmingly moved by Jakey's plight, Hammond stands at his bedside frantically beseeching God for a miracle cure. Hammond's most searing crises still await him, however. Payne writes with lyricism and deep understanding. The novel concludes in a fittingly heartwarming, uplifting way when Hammond finally makes peace with his past and opens up to those around him.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Investigating the disappearance of 350 desert tortoises from a research center, the junk-food-munching Rachel lands in the midst of disputes involving environmentalists, developers and ranchers. But she suspects something more is going on after someone kills an elderly woman rancher and helicopters are reported flying over the desert at night. Rachel's personal life also gets a workout; she's torn between a handsome mine manager and her long-distance boyfriend, a New Orleans police detective. Speart's need to situate Rachel as a loner leads to some credibility gaps: Her office?a federal facility?is bombed, but there's no FBI investigation; a police investigator agrees to Rachel's request to delay reporting a discovery that could have major public health implications. But still the author portrays the stark atmosphere of Nevada as vividly as she did the lusher one of New Orleans and once again there are plenty of appealingly eccentric characters not the least of which is Rachel herself.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There, he befriended many of the leading French artists and writers of the day. As a naturalistic writer, he was amongst the first English-language authors to absorb the lessons of the French realists, and was particularly influenced by the works of Émile Zola. His writings influenced James Joyce, according to the literary critic and biographer Richard Ellmann, and, although Moore's work is sometimes seen as outside the mainstream of both Irish and British literature, he is as often regarded as the first great modern Irish novelist.", "related": ["B0093M15D2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Each chapter is chocked full of essentials to prepare a school site leader to effectively support school staff to not only conform to legal mandates but also engage in best educational practices in collaborative planning, teaching and home-school communication. The websites provided throughout the chapters and included in a reproducible appendix offer invaluable resources beyond the essentials provided within the pages of this valuable handbook. Likewise, the glossary helps the reader keep up with the latest terminology and jargon that is used in the special education realm. Thank you, Margaret McLaughlin and Kristin Ruedel, for synthesizing for our very busy educational leaders what otherwise could seem like a maze of special education rules, regulations, and legal requirements. This third edition is an up-to-the-minute gift to administrators!I teach the Foundations of Law, Ethics, and Procedures in Special Education course for our special education credential program, so am most interested in this book and its content. I am always looking for something I can use or assign to my students that has real meaning. I see this book as being an essential part of any administrative leadership credential program. --Jacqueline Thousand, Professor, School of Education, College of Education, Health, and Human Services, California State University San MarcosThe School Leader s Guide to Special Education is an essential read for principals seeking to support and organize their special education programs. The authors outline the legislative requirements and foundational steps with processes and practices that are grounded in research and realities. --Toby J. Karten, Inclusion Coach and Author, Marlboro, New JerseyMcLaughlin and Ruedel provide a straightforward, yet comprehensive explanation of special education that will help administrators navigate this sometimes complicated system. Rhetoric is eliminated, allowing the reader to understand each section without the confusing jargon and regulatory language often used to describe the processes surrounding special education. Consider this a must-read for every school leader in search of a well-articulated sketch of special education and its intricacies. --Karen A.

His career was, ironically in producing books for others, and once works with one or two successful authors - including Ken Follett. Hopefully something of this may appear in the worlds.

Long before he ever stepped into a cockpit, McCartney seemed destined to fly. As a boy, the kitchen table was his airplane, and he watched World War II bombers train near the family farm in Arkansas. So it was fitting that he became a professional pilot who crisscrossed the country for almost 50 years. Co-written with his sister Angela, this hefty memoir actually tells two tales. One covers the ups and downs of McCartney’s career, from Air Force-maintenance crew chief to check airman with American West Airlines and beyond. The other recounts McCartney’s battle with pancreatic cancer. The book sometimes gets overcrowded with details, and the authors’ distinct voices don’t always harmonize, but what it lacks in literary finesse it makes up in storytelling. McCartney spins yarns of nearly being arrested for smuggling in Mexico while flying for Pan American Sulphur and having an unfortunate encounter with Lady Bird Johnson. With professional precision, he describes the dangerous aspects of flight—engine failures, bomb threats and crashes that claimed the lives of colleagues. While very much a dying man’s reminiscence, the book also deserves credit for revealing how an airline is far more complicated than merely flying passengers from here to there. McCartney helped improve safety and secure better working conditions for pilots through his work as a union negotiator. McCartney Miro contributes the heartrending final section as doctors give her brother just months to live. She dutifully records his cancer treatments and her own quest to understand the disease, capturing the family’s anxiety as they confronted the loss of a loved one. McCartney eventually came to terms with his own mortality: “I look forward to the next great adventure when I see what God has planned for me.” A ride alongside a master flier with a cool head and sly sense of humor who, even facing death, refused to be grounded by circumstance.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I have to say, for me this trilogy ranks right up there with Gone With the Wind. History, war, romance, drama, a strong and gutsy female protagonist, paddleboats on the Mississippi and even a brothel ... I'm in heaven! Finally. Rose From the Ashes. What an appropriate title! Again, I learned so much about the war and what the women and men had to deal with when they came home. Now Rose has come full circle, she is back home where she started, only this time to bury her husband and move back in with her family. She is a newlywed and a new widow, just back from the war, with all of the horrible sights, sounds, smells and experiences fresh on her mind. She is also newly pregnant with her dead husband's child. Rose has been away from home since she was a young girl, chasing new horizons and seeing the world. Unused to the confines of her small town, Rose soon feels smothered by well-meaning family and friends - including Earl, a man she is slowly developing feelings for. She turns to drinking, a habit started in the war, as a means to cope. Haunted by the loud noise of explosions and memories, her drinking problem soon gets worse. One day an old war buddy, Alfee, looks her up and she uses him to escape to the bigger city of Madison where she hopes to find a nursing job to support herself and her baby when it arrives. She feels she is fortunate to find a room to rent over a bar, living with the widowed owner and her special needs son. Alfee, a traveling salesman, is soon smitten. I am a firm believer that people and experiences are put in our path during life for a reason, and felt the author wove and built on that extraordinarily through Rose's life. Now we see, when she finally hits bottom, how she pulls strength from those who passed to pull herself back up: Rose is drinking in a club one night and ... to tell more would be to spoil it. I think this may be my favorite of the three Rose books. I loved the way it was written and I absolutely, positively loved the ending. I enjoyed escaping into Rose's world. She is a character who will stay with me for a long time. Now get yourself a copy of this tremendous trilogy by this tremendous indie author so you can meet Rose too!(less) --GoodreadsWhen I first started reading this book on my iPad, I had no idea really what I was reading at all. Having been given a copy to review, I didn't even know the genre the book was written in or that it was book three of a series. Had I known that, the opening chapters might have made a little more sense. As it was, I found the opening chapters a little disjointed because I couldn't quite understand why she was burying her husband but was thinking about being with Earl. It didn't feel right to me. Since then, I've realised that Rose had a long, established history with Earl and a complicated relationship with her dead husband so her thought processes in the opening chapters now make sense. Perhaps a few more 'flashbacks' to previous books might have helped anyone, like me, who had not read the books in sequential order. Having said that, it is obvious right from the start that Christine Keleny has done her research. I would not normally have been interested in this type of book but I immediately felt transported back to the 1940s. Deciding to raise a baby by oneself today has become commonplace but during the 40s, it would have created quite a scandal, as Keleny wonderfully depicts. I also loved that she was not afraid to tackle hot topics. Post traumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, racism, domestic abuse, sexism... She handled all with aplomb. Rose is a strong character who knows what she wants and isn't afraid to fight for it. I don't always think she is the most likable character but I think that just makes her more real. She isn't some cardboard cutout of perfection but a real, flawed human b --AmazonWhen I first started reading this book on my iPad, I had no idea really what I was reading at all. Having been given a copy to review, I didn't even know the genre the book was written in or that it was book three of a series. Had I known that, the opening chapters might have made a little more sense. As it was, I found the opening chapters a little disjointed because I couldn't quite understand why she was burying her husband but was thinking about being with Earl. It didn't feel right to me. Since then, I've realised that Rose had a long, established history with Earl and a complicated relationship with her dead husband so her thought processes in the opening chapters now make sense. Perhaps a few more 'flashbacks' to previous books might have helped anyone, like me, who had not read the books in sequential order. Having said that, it is obvious right from the start that Christine Keleny has done her research. I would not normally have been interested in this type of book but I immediately felt transported back to the 1940s. Deciding to raise a baby by oneself today has become commonplace but during the 40s, it would have created quite a scandal, as Keleny wonderfully depicts. I also loved that she was not afraid to tackle hot topics. Post traumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, racism, domestic abuse, sexism... She handled all with aplomb. Rose is a strong character who knows what she wants and isn't afraid to fight for it. I don't always think she is the most likable character but I think that just makes her more real. She isn't some cardboard cutout of perfection but a real, flawed human being. I do have a few criticisms. First, I wasn't always sure whose viewpoint I was experiencing as it can switch between Rose, Earl and other characters very quickly - sometimes flipping from one sentence to another. This can create confusion with the reader, particularly if they are not familiar with the characters. As already mentioned, I would have liked to have more of the backstory explained, just to make it easier for people, like me, who had not read the previous Rose stories. Overall, a very good book for people interested in historical fiction/women's fiction. I give it a 7/10 --Amazon", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Grade 8 Up—Laura Brown's diary of 2015 charts the first year of carbon rationing in Great Britain. The global climate has declined so precipitously that the country has made the unilateral decision to cut its carbon emissions by 60 percent. Everyone is issued a card that tracks their allowable use of carbon for the year. This limits utility usage, travel, and purchase of anything that has been transported over a distance, including food. Laura has to cope with limits to hygiene, cell phone use, and practice time with her band and listen to lectures on reducing energy consumption. Her father's job as Head of Travel and Tourism at a local college is eliminated. Freezing weather is followed by hot drought and flooding to finish off the year. Her family initially reacts badly to the strains—her parents fight, her dad starts drinking but then tries his hand at home agriculture, her mom joins the Women Moving Forward club, and her sister, Kim, disappears for days at a time and almost dies when a cholera epidemic hits the city. The book refers to itself as an eco-thriller but it doesn't present the usual over-the-top characters and hardly believable events of so many books in that genre. It works so well because of all the normal craziness of life that has nothing to do with the environmental disaster. The family crisis, the colorful supportive neighbors, the crush on the cute boy next door, and the triumphs of Laura's band lend the story verisimilitude that will give it appeal far beyond the usual thriller for doom-and-gloom junkies.—Eric Norton, McMillan Memorial Library, Wisconsin Rapids, WICopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

On a normal day, she would be found in her herb garden collecting spices for her kitchen or ingredients for her potions; in her huge eclectic Provencal kitchen with the big modern oven cooking pots and pans of food for her family of one husband and three kids (an ardent daughter and two boisterous sons) that'll probably last for weeks; in her library with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and an e-reader in her hands as she reads the latest short story erotic hit; or scribbling pages upon pages of different erotic lifestyles, searching for the one that feels like it was inspired by just the right mix of passion, storyline, and sex. She loves going crazy on weekend nights with the hubby. Aside from these activities, the rest of the time she'd be found in front of her laptop typing the latest Sandra Ross concoction for her readers.", "related": ["B00K92ZHJS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 3.75, "rating_total": 60.0}

Prospective readers without current access to SAS will be pleased to know that a reasonable level of access to SAS is now available at no cost to students and teachers on the web … If the reader prefers to work with GLMMs in the free, powerful, and state-of-the-art R environment, then he/she should supplement this text with some others that are built around R. I myself had good luck using Stroup’s text along with Julian Faraway’s two booksLinear Models with RandExpanding the Linear Model with R, both published by CRC Press.\"—Homer White,MAA Reviews, June 2013\"… for SAS users concerned with the analysis of trials, it is a very good resource. There are excellent discussions on many important concepts such as likelihood ratio testing and model selection criteria.

His exceptionally lucid exploration of commonalities, disparities, and unresolved questions between the literatures on psychoanalysis and attachment is a 'must read.'

In this cogent, original account, he unravels the intricate relationship between these influential theories and brings their history and complexity to life in a most accessible way. Eagle integrates recent advances in developmental study and neuroscience and breaks important new ground in examining the relationships among attachment, sexuality, and aggression.

Paul Tharp, was first introduced to family acquaintance, and world renowned author, Alex Haley when he was a small boy in rural East Tennessee; changing his world view on literature forever. Being too young to appreciate the gravity, and long-reaching scope, of the acclaimed author's fame, he wasn't too young to appreciate the reverence and respect Mr. Haley seemed to inherit, even in the old South. This fueled Tharp's early, fervent interest in the written word, and sparked, what would become, a lifetime love affair with art and music.    Reading many of the accepted classics, Tharp found a whole new world of imagination, and vivid imagery, in them. Longfellow, Yeats, Byron and Twain captured him on such an intimate level, and at such a young age, that their words would follow him all of his young days, only to haunt him on intellectual level later. Butting heads with the academic status quo at every turn, he later abandoned the ideas, ideals and influences of the classic literature camps, and what he viewed as their regurgitated standards, for the genius of the cult followed, fringe writers and their obscure works. Here he found an easy freedom in their prose, and a partiality for the free writing style. To Tharp, these largely ignored writers embodied a more idyllic standard of writing- one without the constraints, or narcissistic need for validation. These works stood unapologetically alone.    Traveling, painting and music took priority most of his adult life, until a motorcycle accident forced Tharp to slow down long enough to write his first expanded work. This unplanned time alone with the blank page reignited his amour for writing and literature, and the fringe Ideas he had once found, with so much emancipation and levity, were still there waiting.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This is where I'm at now, but it started long ago... I was born in Yugoslavia, a peculiar country in the Balkans - a little bit to the right, then down, from the center of Europe. For the first 11 years of my life, I lived in a communist country, and then I suddenly changed states without changing my street address. In 1991, there was a war (Yugoslav wars for everybody looking from a distance) that lasted for four years, so I lived in war-torn country. It was a strange time for Europe; the Berlin Wall fell, Yugoslavia dissolved, USSR had a similar notion (minus the war), and not all that strange time for me - if you don't count running to the shelters when bombings begun I had a pretty normal childhood. My old/new state is now called Croatia, and people around here say we have the most beautiful sea in the world. They are wrong, but they are not too far off - Croatia really is a nice place to look at, no matter where you go. If only our politicians hadn't sold Croatia into modern slavery or driven us to the verge of bankruptcy, but hey, you can't have everything! On the one hand magnificent nature and beautiful women; on the other verge of bankruptcy, rampant corruption, and public debt so high we had to invent a new numbering system just to describe it. After high school I went to college, studied economics but found it boring, so I turned to my first love - computers. So, here we are again - for the last 15 years I have worked (and am still working) for some of the best-selling Croatian IT magazines and biggest Internet portals where I have been a journalist, executive editor, head of outsourcing, you name it! There is no big philosophy behind my life - I do something that makes me happy and, sooner or later, somebody starts paying me to do it. Not sure if good karma or just more luck than brains. The next thing is learning 3D, bass guitar, maybe blues harp... And books, yes, books are nice too. I'm drawn to architecture, have an interest in science (especially physics), became a video gamer in 1986 and haven't looked back, been known to rant about traffic a lot, and am rarely seen without a book.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has been studying and inducing out-of-body experiences and psychic experiences since he graduated from high school in 1979. He graduated from the University of Minnesota Institute of Technology, with a B.S. degree in computer science in 1984. While attending the University, he became more proficient at out-of-body exploration, while keeping detailed journals of his experiences. At the same time, he did volunteer work for a student-based organization called the Minnesota Society for Parapsychological Research (MSPR), which gave him experience as a “Ghost Buster” before the movie made the subject popular. Since college, he has had a very successful career in systems level computer programming. He lived in Phoenix, Arizona in 1985 and 1986, where he started editing and occasionally contributing articles for a local spiritually themed newsletter called The Spontaneous Self. In 1987, he moved to Rochester, Minnesota and worked as a contract programmer at the IBM plant until 1996. During that time, he compiled his experiences and journals into his first book, Out of Body Experiences: How to have them and what to expect (Hampton Roads Publishing, 1997).

It's locked and loaded with everything you could ask for in a mystery, starting with the most unusual PI to hit the pike in quite some time, Frank Boff. If you're looking for a complex mystery, with multiple murders, twists, surprises, and a peek into the hidden world of sex-for-hire at premium prices, The Killer Sex Game will deliver all that and more. I look forward to the fourth novel in this highly-acclaimed series.\" (Kevin Kernan,NY Post) \"This is another dark and unforgettable tale that will make your jaw drop and skin itch, as Nathan Gottlieb takes Frank Boff through a top-shelf escort service and the most notorious crime family in New York in search of a murderer -- and this time, it's personal for sidekick Danny Cullen. Almost overnight, Gottlieb has become one of the most prolific and engaging storytellers in the crime fiction genre.\" (Dave D'Alessandro,Newark Star-Ledger) \"Frank Boff returns, taking on another righteous case with boxer Danny Cullen, Frank's sidekick and friend. A Cuban boxing legend who defected is murdered after his pro debut. The case gets Boff involved with high class call girls and a powerful mobster. The personal danger to Cullen and Boff is even higher than in the first novels, prompting Boff to come up with a pretty devious scheme that will show you why the private investigator is as much anti-hero as he is a hero. Written in Gottlieb's usual, easy to read with witty prose, this is another great thrill-ride with some very funny but also very devious characters.\" (Jochem Vandersteen, author of the Noah Milano mystery series and the website, Sons of Spade)", "related": ["B00FTIZJKE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It wasn’t until a friend lent me a copy of Terry Jones’ Nicobobinus that words became a powerful ally of images and I started creating stories (which often got me into trouble). I attended Yale University and studied graphic design for job security and then creative writing at Edinburgh University.

Wetness greeted his fingertips.\nHis nostrils flared and his jaw clenched. He pressed his finger\nlower. \"Bring it.\"She\nclosed her thighs and held him there for a second, doing her best not\nto let out a moan. \"Yes.\"He\npulled back, hand and all, but brought his fingers up to his lips.\nHis gaze darkened as he flicked his tongue over his index finger.\n\"Deal.\"He'd\ntasted her in a restaurant, in front of their client. She really,\nreally had to get him liquored up more often. Her breath became\nuneven and her brain muddled with all the possible wagers. \"And\nwhat do I get when I win?\"He\ndidn't hesitate. \"I get an answer to whatever question I have.\"Surprised,\nshe blinked. Not that Nicole thought he'd win, but what would he ask?\n\"Any question?\"What\nwould she asked him? Her heart quickened.Could\nyou ever love me?Needing\nto even ask made the answer no. If he did, Sebastian would have said\nit by now. If he did, she'd know on some level, right? What could she\nask that wouldn't leave her so vulnerable?Well,\nshe had a few days to come up with one. She let out her unsteady\nbreath. \"Prepare to lose.\"He\ncocked a brow. \"I'll say the same, but tonight, I'll make you pay.\"This\nwas their game, their foreplay, and her bra abraded over her nipples.\n\"All talk.\"She\nglanced at Jeremiah and Delilah. They continued to coo and nuzzle\nlike lovebirds. Nicole shook her head. \"We have to stop betting\nagainst each other. It's not healthy for a relationship.\"\"Relationship?\"\nBoth of his brows rose. \"You're acknowledging one exists between\nus?\"She\nhuffed. \"Of course we have one.\"Sebastian\npaused, sucked his entire finger into his mouth and closed his eyes.\n\"If I continue down this line of conversation I'll have to hand\nover my balls to the manhive.\"She\nmentally moaned, long and hard, but kept up the conversation. \"And\nthey're vicious.\"He\nlooked at the couple and then murmured to her, \"Say it again and\nthen give me that mouth.\"Heat\nrushed to her face. \"What?\"\"Relationship,\"\nhe whispered with a bit of growl in his voice. \"The word suddenly\nturns me on and that's just disturbing within itself.\"Nicole\nglanced down.

His passion for coaching comes from his personal experience of losing 45 pounds in 12 weeks and a decade of personal development coaching for lululemon athletica. He is internally driven to share as much knowledge as he can in hopes it will motivate and inspire you to take action. Action is what creates our results and improves our quality of life. Along with his weight loss coaching he researches and authors books in the self-help niche. There is a direct connection between how we feel and what we weigh. In essence our outside world is a direct reflection of our inside world. Losing weight is as much a physical act as a psychological act and Darrin understands that. Your success in anything you do in life also relies on your ability to set clear powerful goals. His goal is to change as many people's lives as possible through his weight loss knowledge and self-help books. You can have the life of your dreams if you can develop the right mindset.

After the early death of their parents, Dorothy and William grew up almost entirely apart. But after reuniting on the cusp of adulthood, they lived together for their entire lives, with Dorothy joining William's household until the end. Best known today for her lyrical journals recording travels with her brother, Dorothy was central to William's creative process, to the extent that William called her one of the two Beings to whom my intellect is most indebted. Newlyn argues for seeing much of Wordsworth's poetry as a kind of gift-exchange with his sister, asserting the therapeutic value of their creative community in overcoming early bereavement and poverty. Dorothy's prose and William's poetry were reparative, Newlyn claims, as the two cultivated shared memories, community, and an enduring bond with their environment. Along with close readings of their respective works, Newlyn provides useful contextual detours into theories of gift economy, 18th-century medicine and nostalgia, as well as themes in critical theory and eco-criticism. Though the book's level of detail is best suited to specialists, Newlyn offers a valuable corrective to existing Wordsworth criticism and a moving testimonial to the power of creativity and community. 8-page b&w plate section.

When I'm finished with a book, I want to move on to a new set of characters and create a new world.\" Well, I've finally taken the plunge with my Promise series and guess what? I liked green eggs and ham. I do. I like them Sam-I-Am.My oldest daughter brainstormed the idea for the series. She said it should be sort of a Sex and the City or Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants group of old friends who are getting back together after a number of years apart for the wedding of one of them. Along the way, each would have her own romance. I said \"Sure. I can do that.\" My daughter helped with the plotting of Graci's story, the troubles she might encounter during her mission to lose her virginity--which she ultimately realizes is merely part of a desire to change herself.During Graci's story, the romance for her friend Tara became clear to me so I immediately launched into the next story. And then the next. I'm now almost finished with the fourth book and feel like I've really come to know these women. I've also learned how a series must be carefully fitted like a jigsaw puzzle so all the pieces come together seamlessly.So, for my daughter's sake and to prove that I made the right decision in starting a series--BUY The Virginity Vow, or at least download a sample and see if it hooks you in. I want this series to be my biggest success yet and you can help.
