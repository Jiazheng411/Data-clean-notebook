With candor and passion, he speaks to issues every man must face. He illustrates them with true, modern-life stories.

Despite previous long-term aid from the international community to improve the country's infrastructure and economy, sustainable development was hampered by corruption and governmental inefficiency. This book tells the story of Western-trained entrepreneur Iqbal Quadir, the driving force behind the creation of GrameenPhone, the largest Bangladeshi GSM (Global System for Mobile) cell-phone operation. Quadir had the innovative idea of using local Western-trained entrepreneurs to help villagers attain micro-loans funded by foreign investors (and generated by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yanus) and then showing villagers how to operate cell-phone leasing businesses. Sullivan refers to this successful business model as the \"external combustion engine\" because of its impressive multiplier effects on economic growth. Applications of this model in other poverty-stricken areas worldwide have repeatedly yielded similar results. This book offers valuable insights about the use of cell phones and technology-based investments to generate wealth and demonstrates that entrepreneurship may be more fruitful than aid. This valuable work can be effectively integrated into public administration, global business, and human resource academic courses.—Caroline Geck, Kean Univ.

The authors examine the core technologies and commercial products in use today, providing a nuts-and-bolts understanding of how you can deploy customer and product data in ways that meet the unique requirements of the online marketplace-particularly if you are part of a brick-and-mortar company with specific online aspirations. In so doing, they build a powerful case for investment in and aggressive development of these approaches, which are likely to separate winners from losers as e-commerce grows and matures.FeaturesIncludes the latest from successful data warehousing consultants whose work has encouraged the field's new focus on e-commerce.Presents information that is written for both consultants and practitioners in companies of all sizes.Emphasizes the special needs and opportunities of traditional brick-and-mortar businesses that are going online or participating in B2B supply chains or e-marketplaces.Explains how long-standing assumptions about data warehousing have to be rethought in light of emerging business models that depend on customer intimacy.Provides advice on maintaining data quality and integrity in environments marked by extensive customer self-input.Advocates careful planning that will help both old economy and new economy companies develop long-lived and successful e-commerce strategies.Focuses on data warehousing for emerging e-commerce areas such as e-government and B2E environments.", "related": [], "rank": 4108095, "title": "Data Warehousing And Business Intelligence For e-Commerce (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems) eBook", "author": "Alan R.

Algoplex is ready to sign a potentially lucrative agreement with Plush Biologics, a company whose gene-regulating treatments could revolutionize the skincare industry. At the filming, Algoplex's owner, Rod Glaser, is agitated when his girlfriend, Alissa, doesn't show up as planned. Bill goes with Rod to Alissa's empty apartment, where Rod confesses that Alissa is a hired escort with whom he's fallen in love. Bill agrees to help Rod find Alissa, and then, when Rod is found dead, he launches his own investigation into the murder. Bill's motivation for entering and staying on the case is weak, and the biotechnology detail is not woven as seamlessly into the story as it was in Calder's debut,Knockout Mouse[BKL Jl 02]. Still, Bill is a likable character, there are some intriguing plot twists here, and the idea of a filmmaking amateur sleuth has appeal.

Bancroft Prize-winning historian Patterson (Grand Expectations) reviews the report's perspectives on the woes of lower-class, inner-city black families—at the center of which are nonmarital births—rooted variously in the historic past (slavery, migration to urban centers), contemporaneous economic forces (joblessness), or black culture. Patterson's wide scouring through the scholarly literature and the popular media, from the mid-1960s to the Obama era, results in a generous survey of the sociological and historical treatment of lower-class black family life and a reappraisal of whether the report scuttled LBJ's civil rights agenda. Alas, Patterson's thorough account is dulled by a plethora of repetitive statistics concerning out-of-wedlock births and a surfeit of reports concerning media handling; while it remains useful documentation, it is a tiresome read.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Mrs. Bradley received her B.A. in 1964 from Hardin Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, then did graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1965-67. She was a science fiction/fantasy fan from her middle teens, and made her first sale as an adjunct to an amateur fiction contest in Fantastic/Amazing Stories in 1949. She had written as long as she could remember, but wrote only for school magazines and fanzines until 1952, when she sold her first professional short story to Vortex Science Fiction. She wrote everything from science fiction to Gothics, but is probably best known for her Darkover novels. In addition to her novels, Mrs. Bradley edited many magazines, amateur and professional, including Marion Zimmer Bradley's Fantasy Magazine, which she started in 1988. She also edited an annual anthology called Sword and Sorceress for DAW Books. Over the years she turned more to fantasy; The House Between the Worlds, although a selection of the Science Fiction Book Club, was \"fantasy undiluted\". She wrote a novel of the women in the Arthurian legends - Morgan Le Fay, the Lady of the Lake, and others - entitled Mists of Avalon, which made the NY Times best seller list both in hardcover and trade paperback, and she also wrote The Firebrand, a novel about the women of the Trojan War. Her historical fantasy novels, The Forest House, Lady of Avalon, Mists of Avalon are prequels to Priestess of Avalon She died in Berkeley, California on September 25, 1999, four days after suffering a major heart attack. She was survived by her brother, Leslie Zimmer; her sons, David Bradley and Patrick Breen; her daughter, Moira Stern; and her grandchildren.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 4.4444, "rating_total": 40.0}

The very name of the sandwich reveals how to make it, and the classic combination of bread, bacon, lettuce and tomato needs no alteration or addition to satisfy. However, to Jordan, a California chef, radio host and columnist, the classic sandwich is just the beginning of BLT possibilities. She offers 60 variations in soup, pasta, and even strudel form, such as Bacon, Leek, and Tomato Strudel and Pasta Salad with Bacon, Tomatoes, and Bocconcini (little balls of mozzarella that lend a delicious chewiness to the proceedings). Risking charges of heresy, Jordan even gives the recipe for a vegetarian VLT, which calls for crisp-fried leeks instead of bacon. It's surprisingly tempting. And while this cookbook doesn't contain much else to entice a vegetarian, it does offer much to please anyone who enjoys bacon, tomatoes and lettuce-in every possible incarnation. Also included are recipes for mayonnaise, aoli and other appropriate condiments.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When I was first learning to read, an aunt gave me a book of heroines that inspired me with dreams of the pirates Mary Read and Anne Bonny. I began writing fiction when still at university. After a year as a researcher, I felt the need for adventure, and spent four years working my way around the world. I spent the last year aboard an old wooden ketch, the Nordvag, learning navigation by dead reckoning, and making my way slowly back home. In the Caribbean I re-discovered the story of the Englishwoman, Mary Read, who lived as a man and ended a pirate; and her young American friend, Anne Bonny, who lived openly as a woman rover. In Sydney, I found the women pirates mentioned in Captain Charles Johnson's \"A General History of the Most Notorious Pirates\", published in 1724. Yet all the original documents were in London, Holland, and the Bahamas. I found the Court Records at the Public Records Office in Kew, \"The Trials of Captain Jack Rackam and Other Pirates\", by Robert Baldwin, 1721, as well as all the Colonial records on the pirate settlement of Nassau, and the records of the Dreadnought. I completed my research in London, searching dusty libraries for journals written by sailors and soldiers in the eighteenth century. In Breda, I found the old town almost untouched, and drank the same beer that Mary Read had served in her tavern. The librarian in Nassau could not have been more helpful, and sent reams of information on the islands of the Bahamas and their fascinating history. Re-creating the life of Mary Read has been a labour of love, as well as the work of half a lifetime.  Learning about the real pirates of the Caribbean made it worth it.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 2003 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism; \"Hashimoto's thyroiditis\" being the cause. This autoimmune form of thyroid disease that causes destruction of the thyroid gland resulted in my also developing \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\", due to a compromised immune system with severe co-morbid \"Adrenal Fatigue\". I also suffered severe anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks early into the onset of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Hashitoxicosis - temporary hyperthyroidism). A common heart murmur I was diagnosed with in my teens called \"Mitral Valve Prolapse\", also worsened in severity of symptoms, with the development of these other health disorders.  My eventual receiving of diagnoses was a difficult process with proper diagnostic testing not being ordered by the first doctors I sought treatment from. These types of issues were inspiration for me to become proactive in my own health care and to self-educate myself on these health disorders, which I have done extensively since 2003.

Making matters worse, only about one-third of Canadians currently belong to a formal, or registered, pension plan; and even a large number of that \"lucky third\" will not retire with a guaranteed pension income.If you no longer have the time to wait and hope for your traditional investments to pay off, the answer is to \"pensionize your nest egg\" using the new technique of product allocation set out in this book.Pensionize Your Nest Eggexplains how toRecognize if you really have a pension or just a tax-sheltered savings plan.Become informed about the new risks you and your nest egg face in retirement and why asset allocation, despite its value in the accumulation stage of life, is not sufficient to protect you and your money.Measure your retirement sustainability quotient (RSQ) and your Financial Legacy Value (FLV)—then choose a retirement income plan on the Retirement Income Frontier.Understand how product allocation differs from asset allocation, how to allocate your nest egg across three product silos, and learn about the new financial products that are available to protect against the new risks you face.Follow a seven-step process to close your Pension Income Gap and convert your retirement savings into a secure stream of lifetime income.Whether you do it yourself or work with a financial advisor,Pensionize Your NestEgggives you a simple plan to create a guaranteed retirement income-for life.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Through my books, articles, workshops, websites, and public speaking appearances, I've tried to demystify project management (PM) and make it accessible to everyone. My step-by-step PM texts have been adopted by many universities, businesses and public sector organizations. For many years, I managed teams of contractors working with new product developers to create training and performance improvement systems for major corporations such as Xerox, Epson America, and Apple Computer. The projects I planned and coordinated were as simple as a single resource working for 3 weeks and as complicated as 60 people working for more than a year and a half. Deliverables ranged from simple documentation to transcontinental satellite broadcasts incorporating pre-produced video sequences, live executive speakers, and real-time competition among problem-solving teams located all over North America. In recent years I've focused on providing workshops & consulting support to help organizations improve their PM processes, as well creating print & media materials to support PM. See my website for free articles, links to YouTube videos, and info about my customized PM workshops & webinars. If you have comments or suggestions about this book, I'd love to hear from you!

My only complaint with the story is that Lily's father, Lord Devlin, doesn't get what he deserves; namely a good old-fashioned horse whipping. And she leaves you wishing that Rose, Richard's mistress, would finally find someone to care for her, as she deserves. Oleta Blaylock-JERRAuthor Jordan Summers weaves an erotic tale that is sure to please readers of vampire stories.Gothic Passionsis filled with seduction, temptation, lies and deceit as befitting the ton of London. All in all a very well created romantica. To say that Lily and Richard's love scenes are hot is an understatement, but I didn't like the idea of him still visiting his mistress after he realized Lily was the one.

Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s.

Based on those experiences, which included sitting through a number of customer services trainings, she knew what was missing. The typical program stressed empathy with the customer but didn’t equip the customer service reps to deal with the unique stressors of their jobs. After all, it doesn’t matter so much if the customer is right if the customer service rep is irate, angry and unable or unwilling to solve the customer’s problem. Also a trained life coach, Karyn began adding some components to her customer service training that showed representatives how to handle stress and manage their time and environment. After seeing how well her additions were received, Karyn knew she was onto something and The Colors of Customer Service was born. An engaging and entertaining public speaker, Karyn is passionate about great customer service and loves talking about it wherever she goes. She also enjoys writing about it.

Our forebears lived on the land above the ocean surface in great cities of stone, breathing fresh air and feeling the heat of Shu on their skin.Then the Emperor of the world and his magi discovered a `new science' and unlocked the power within a mineral known as Lexan Stone. At first it was a great discovery and many wonders were worked. The greatest of all these feats was `shimmer travel'. The resonating stone created a shimmering field through which objects were thrown, and then appeared miles from the original location. The technique was perfected and people travelled through them over vast distances.With this untold power at his disposal the Emperor declared himself a God. He outlawed the worship of the ancient deities, with the premise that if they truly existed they would make themselves known to him. He used the shimmer portals to take his armies to all parts of Gebshu where all tribes were forced to acknowledge him as the only true God. He destroyed or enslaved any that stood before him. The age of light had ended.\"", "related": [], "rank": 4346292, "title": "Dying Star", "author": "Samsun Lobe", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her desire to ensure the continued success of all she's worked for induces her to try to get to know her nieces and nephews and decide which one is deserving of her estate. Maeve is estranged from her two brothers who believe that she bought them out of their inheritance. The story centers on Maeve's nephew, Mitch, a studious young man, eager to go to college, and not rugged enough for Des, his gregarious and cruel father; Mitch's 12-year-old sister, Lily, an illegitimate child of Des'; and Maeve's other brother's daughter, Kate, who suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome. The cousins have never met before, and as they are come to love Maeve, they are also given the gift of each other in a new, nurturing family configuration. Fast-moving and populated with compelling characters, Jacobs offers a wonderful tale about letting go of past hurts and grudges and embracing what's really important: family.Maria HattonCopyright © American Library Association.

She uses her own experiences and those of friends and clients to illustrate the universality of grief.

It is also a primer for helping to understand people from distant countries who may be living next door. Many ancient traditions can seem bizarre and humorous to outsiders; the author presents numerous instances of personal traits of Americans that are thought to be strange abroad. This is not just a matter of knowing that how we wave hello in the United States may be taken as an insulting gesture in Greece. The person standing so close to you in the checkout line may be unaware that you consider that rude since it is natural to him. An understanding of what is \"normal,\" then, is culturally based. The unique customs and rituals described here are a wonderful introduction to seeing beyond ourselves to the beauty in the variety of human experience.

Kendall tries to maintain a semblance of a normal life; she and her best friend are both interested in boys. Kendall likes Brandon, and Ellie likes his best friend. Trying to figure out if Brandon likes her back, what to wear, and how she should style her hair take up a good deal of Kendall's time that's not occupied by school or helping ghosts. Other drama comes from her father's possible relationship with a neighbor and the fact that Brandon's mother, who is also a ghost, has been randomly showing up as well. Kendall is able to help Danielle, but there are a lot of issues left unresolved, signaling that there is sure to be a sequel.-Jesten Ray, Seattle Public Library, WAα(c) Copyright 2011.

Jake Morrison is a bright, young and ambitious attorney\nhell-bent on achieving his vision of success. But his vision is about to become\na nightmare. Zara Jane is a real-live Angel, sent from Heaven above to guide\nJake through these pivotal changes in Jake's life. She ends up working at\nJake's firm and dating him, so that she can watch over him. They fall in love.\nBut Jake rejects the message and her love and his life spirals out of control.\nAs an Angel Zara Jane imparts wisdom and insight for his life and world, and\nexpresses her insight on the road that lies ahead, not only for Jake, but also\nfor humankind as a whole. After Zara Jane has been given\npermission by the Angel Oversight Committee that she would be allowed to live\nwith Jake and experience human emotions, like love, first hand. They end up\nliving together in her mansion in Beverly\n Hills, formingParadise\nParanormal Investigations, Inc.together, solving capers together. This book is designed to help\nstimulate your strategic thinking when it comes to luck, and love, to help you\nrealize that everything in our lives really can have mystical significance! Enjoy the journey!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I enjoyed developing the main characters (Les Moore, Cyndra Baker and Phil Brinkman) over the years to the degree that three sequels became obvious and are in the works.The first is actually a prequel that tells the story of Les Moore's relatively normal life and family - and how it all came crashing down when Riverbend decided to enter their lives. At the same time, a young Cindy Baker is making her way through the FBI Academy and getting her first assignments in the field. We see how Les and Cindy - without knowing it - are cut from a very similar and particular cloth, mentally and emotionally - as their paths inexorably converge at Riverbend.The next sequel follows Cindy's attempts to avenge her favorite partner and continue their traditions. The \"final\" sequel (at least for now) has Cindy fighting for her life in Riverbend.More than anything I've written (and I've written a lot in 35 years), I think Riverbend has informed my taste, style and rhythms more than any other novel or screenplay. Each subsequent thriller has its own life. (Versions of the Truth is not as dark or funny, and is set solely in South Florida, but still has the flavor of Riverbend as it is played out in a completely different environment; thereby creating its own style and rhythms. Rubric, coming out soon, is at times even darker than Riverbend, with much less humor; but it still has echoes of the original feeling that infuses Riverbend.)So Riverbend becomes the gateway novel to my world of crime fiction. Several of my fans have read it more than once; some have read it several times - and plan to read it again! I of course have read it hundreds of times over the years as I have worked on it, editing it (mainly in the last five years), and I still laugh at the funny scenes and lines and still go breathless during the tense ones. What came together in 1999 as a 1,000 page manuscript has condensed into 400 or so pages of intense, action-packed, humor-laced, at times grisly entertainment. The book is still fun for me to read!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Thanks to the GI Bill, I attended college and afterwards had the good fortune to serve a tour of duty as Cultural Affairs Officer in the U. S. Embassy in Brazil. I became fluent in the language, fell in love with the culture, and to this day am involved with Brazilian friends. Little bits of that experience work their way smoothly into both of my novels. In The Patron Saint of Desperate Situations, the heroine Sonia is a single mom immigrant from Brazil, who, for reasons I don't understand, is liked better by female reviewers of the novel than by male reviewers. In Jeeptown, one of the most intriguing minor characters is Charlie's teacher, a nun who hails from Cape Verde and speaks English with a Portuguese accent.  After three years in Rio, I returned to grad school and then became a professor of Political Science at a small liberal arts college. Currently at work on a third novel,  I live happily with my wife Sandy in Falcon Heights, MN.

Part one eloquently expresses the grief Isabel Cuerrier endures when her 16 year-old daughter is killed in a car accident only days before playing the role of Anybodies in her high school's production of West Side Story. Part two shows us the resilience of the human spirit as Isabel recounts her struggles to heal from one of life's greatest tragedies, the death of one's child. While wading through the depths of pain and loneliness, more tragedies strike, making her healing journey even more difficult. In the space of less than three years, other deaths of family members follow, including the murder of the last of her surviving sisters and the torching of her last sibling.At one point during her battle to survive, when she can no longer go on, she loses her waning grasp on life and tumbles into an abysmal pit. It is only through the hands of Providence that she surfaces again. Later, a car accident of her own, nearly three years following her daughter=s death, gives her precious gifts. Throughout most of her journey, Isabel finds strength and solace in her beliefs and various coping strategies. She also is gifted with many spiritual experiences, including miracles and visitations from her daughter, who has become her angel. For anyone seeking encouragement or inspiration, this is a must-read book.", "related": ["B009HVYFZ4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When she's not writing she loves to work in her flower garden or take long walks up her country lane. She is a contemporary romance writer with 2 areas of books. A bit more adult oriented  20 yrs of age and up and she has decided to write romance for the New Adult reader - 17 to 22 yrs old. She's been told there are no readers. Victoria believes there are just no books for them to read. In this genre there will be the passion and heartbreak of young lovers struggling through relationships. The stories will match the generation and won't hide things under the table. Victoria says - I've never believed in shielding teens and I won't start now. There will be sex, violence and swearing, but only when it is necessary for the plot. In her first book of the Circles series Dancing in Circles - Robert is a gang member and she is not about to have him speak proper English and spend his time studying in the library! In the second book of the series - Circles Divided - there is violence as seen in many modern day cities. Her next book - A Guy and A Girl - matches a hockey player with a dance major who is being haunted by a stalker. The third - Points of a Triangle (working title) - matches a senior high school student with a mob leader's son posing as a high school student while he hides from his father. All of Victoria's books are going to be printed in Canadian English. It won't be hard to deal with this. Colour - color -- cancelled - canceled. The differences between standard US English and Canadian English are not that great. If you read this bio - you can read her books. Victoria would love to hear from her fans.

Eli, Thea, and Clyne have tumbled through the Fifth Dimension from 2019 to 1804 and 1805 and become entwined in the Lewis and Clark expedition and the struggle to help slaves escape to freedom. Thea is originally from ancient Alexandria and Clyne is a dinosaurlike creature. They mistakenly arrive in this time period as they are on their way back to 2019 from their last adventure with Merlin. The members of the Corps of Discovery come to life and the story is rich with historical details. Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings are integral to the tale, and Williams combines fact with fiction to make them well-developed characters. The hardships and problems faced by the members of the Corps and the injustice of slavery are embedded in the story, which is told in alternating chapters by the three main characters. It is not necessary to have read earlier selections in the series. Gradually, readers become familiar with the idiosyncrasies of the tale's underpinnings as they learn the secret powers of a baseball cap and how myriad languages are understood. This cleverly plotted, engrossing read will appeal to maturing fans of Jon Scieszka's \"The Time Warp Trio\" series (Viking).-Renee Steinberg, formerly at Fieldstone Middle School, Montvale, NJCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Jim Greenwald, a retired Vietnam vet, is\nrunning a bar with his partner when the IRS seizes it in lieu of\nnon-payment of taxes. Jim fights back in the only way he knows how. The\ngovernment trained him how to fight and so he goes on a spree of false\nbomb threats before setting off a real one, carefully designed not to\nhurt anyone. Then he goes on the run. What follows next is a race across\n America and into Canada, with the Austin Police and the FBI on his\ntail. But, someone else has joined the chase, someone who knows more\nabout Jim's background than anyone else does, someone he has faced up to\n before. Jim also finds himself as a political pawn in the race for the\nWhitehouse but who comes out on top? Find out by reading Tax Break for\nyourself.Tax Breakby Jay Williams is brilliantly clever, funny, sad, and\nheart-warming all at the same time. It has to be one of the most\noriginal stories I have read in a long time. I found it to be written in\n a manner that was easy to read, the plot was easy to follow but you\ndidn't see the twists coming until they were right on top of you.\nExcellent book, well worthy of the time it took to read and I really\nhope there is more where that came from.", "related": ["B00IMKPS8Y"], "rank": 3968597, "title": "Tax Break", "author": "Jay Williams", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has grown to love her current home in California however, and is devastated to learn that her dad is being posted overseas so her and her mum are going to live with her grandparents in the small town of Myrtle Creek in Oregon.Eliana knows that she is only going to be living there for a year, so she doesn't want to get too close to anyone and she most certainly doesn't plan to get herself a boyfriend. However things don't always go as planned and Eliana finds herself making new friends, a possible boyfriend and discovering that Myrtle Creek maybe can become her home.Solo is a beautiful read, a truly lovely story about discovering the true value of friendship, young love, and the meaning of home. This book perfectly captures what it is like to be a 16 year old girl struggling with friends, high school drama, and falling in love for the first time.I really liked the character of Eliana, she is strong, refusing to be beaten down by her new high schools popular girl and also refusing to retaliate. I loved the relationship she has with her mother, one open and full of trust and also the fact she spends lots of time with her gramps.

This story of love, loss, pain, hope, and courage reads quickly because of Pelzman's unfettered, visual style, which vividly and masterfully present her mother's experiences, memories and emotions against the historical events of the WWII period and Hitler's genocidal regime. --Jack OngOn the back cover is a 1944 photo of Ms. Pelzman s mother, Sonja Rosenstein, 22, happily married for the past eighteen months to the love of her life, Herman Rosenstein. In the eerily beautiful and yet haunting photo, Sonja has a yellow Jewish star sewn into her sweater to identify her as a Jew, as was the law. She is uncommonly pretty, intelligent and innocent with a whole, wonderful life ahead of her in her native Holland. What seems to separate this book from other Holocaust literature is how Sonja s experiences did not end with her liberation and return to Holland as an orphan with almost no surviving family. Almost like DNA, Sonja's living nightmare was unavoidably passed on to the next generation. But, balancing the unimaginable is the life affirming story of a daughter who was unable to hear her mother's war time experiences, but who, 40 years later, took nearly a decade of her life to interview her elderly mother. In so doing Ms. Pelzman tells Sonja s story in moving fashion, and is able to repair their strained relationship. She literally gets her mother back in her life. So, in addition to being a historical account of that dark period in history, Liliane Pelzman s remarkable book is one of hope that will likely inspire the reader. It certainly did in my case. --j.n.As a retired teacher, this a must read for every 5th through 12th grader. Adults also should take note of this true story. Students and adults will feel a surge of gratitude. Sonja, the main character teaches the reader that ultimately it's friends, love and family that motivate and guide us through our most challenging moments. These words come to mind: inspiring, brave and forgiving, not unlike the story of Anne Frank, who grew up a few blocks from Sonja. Well done. --Elizabeth Franzheim", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

On his journey to the light, he meets a greedy bishop, a philosopher-theologian janitor, a courageous young woman and a wild ex-nun.

Where is God? Why celibacy? When do you follow your conscience and not the church? These are the questions of Beyond the Vows.         Griffin was a Roman Catholic priest in Cleveland, Ohio between 1962 and 1967. He became active in the civil rights movement and marched in Selma with Dr. Martin Luther King.

In the following years many other novels have appeared, including the sci-fi thrillers, DEATH'S HEAD and EQUINOX, which have become cult classics. DEATH'S HEAD was nominated for the mainstream \"Science Fiction Hall of Fame,\" and the historical THE DECEIVERS won a Stonewall award. For almost a decade the Keegan novels were published by GMP (the Gay Men's Press, London), but after their merger with Prowler and later, Millivres, GMP became more or less 'dormant,' selling only old titles, and apparently publishing only those novels which had been in pre-press at the time of the merger. Eventually, Millivres discontinued its paperback division, and Mel turned to a local South Australian studio, DreamCraft, to manage his intellectual properties. A self-confessed science fiction and fantasy devotee, Keegan is known for novels across a wide range of subjects, from the historical to the future action-adventure. Mel lives in South Australia with an eccentric family and a variety of pets, and is closely associated with DreamCraft, where he's been known to work as a part-time, standby editor.", "related": [], "rank": 1737274, "title": "More Than Human", "author": "Mel Keegan", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I have a degree in Early Childhood Education from Kennesaw State University.  I teach Pre School part time and write the other part along with taking care of my family and the house, so not a lot of spare time. I have been married to a wonderful man for ten years.  We have two amazing children ages eight and five.  Most of the time my life is a mix of chaos and complete nonsense that is both invigorating and exhausting.  In short I absolutely love it! I was born in Dalton, Ga.  I still live in Georgia in the little town I grew up in.  Although I always said I wouldn’t stay, I just couldn’t leave it. I write because I enjoy it.  It allows me to escape from the normality of life and weave romantic stories the way I choose.  I love strong men with a soft center, just like a tootsie pop.  I admit that some of my heroines are sappy, but I also like strong quippy women as well.   I like to vary my characters in attitude and personality, so you never know what you might get when you open one of my books. I admit that when I started writing I thought it was crazy how authors said that their characters ‘speak to them,’ but now I understand.  The story unfolds in the mind and the characters build themselves and the events in the story.  So… I really don’t know exactly what will happen in the story until it is finished.  Of course I have an idea of what I want, but it may or may not turn out that way in the end.   I enjoy hearing from you.  I do read emails and I try my best to reply if necessary.  I would love to hear your ideas and all about the types of books you enjoy most.  Who knows, you may give me a great new book idea?   amandaanderson2@tds.net", "related": ["B00E3LZF9I"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As usual, Chivers has produced an excellent audio presentation of a literary masterpiece. Alas, in this day and age fewer and fewer readers not enrolled in literature classes actually read the works of what are frequently referred to as \"dead white males\" even if, as in this case, they were actually written by a woman.

Through Thady's memories of these landowners (and the tenants who all too often had to pay for the landownders' indulgences) we gain a picture of fedual life in Ireland before the Irish Revolution. Thady is an unreliable narrator who, it appears, cannot - or does not - tell the whole story. Which leaves a question. Is Thady a naive and loyal servant or is he a clever and self-serving man who knows how to get his point across and his plans accomplished without seeming to know what he is saying or doing? Adding to the underlying irony of the narrative is the contrast between Thady and the anonymous, condescending British voice of the mock glossary of terms. Humorous and biting,Castle Rackrentis a largely unrecognized jewel of social satire.-- For great reviews of books for girls, check outLet's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14. --From500 Great Books by Women; review by Erica Bauermeister", "related": ["B00G1RJO3U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Love Bug is an incredibly sweet story that perfectly describes the trauma that many children face as they navigate life in the foster care and adoption systems. In fact, as I read the story to my 11-year-old, he said, \"Hey, she used my life to tell that story! That is what I do.\" He recognized himself in Love Bug's behaviors. What I really loved about this story is that it carefully shows that there is a reason behind thebehaviors. If we don't understand what it is that is behind them, we will never be able to successfully address those behaviors. My children and I enjoyed the story, and I imagine thatall other children and parents will, too. As we read about Love Bug and his forever mom, we smiled big huge smiles, looked deep into each other's eyes, and then shared warm and snuggly hugs. The story is special, and reading it with my children allowed us to experience some profoundly intimate moments. It allowed us a chance to talk about some very diffi cult issues in an easy and non-threatening manner. Seeing cute little puppies facing the challengesof foster care made it easier for my children to discuss those challenges in their own lives.Thank you, Mary, for this treasure.

The tension spikes suddenly at appropriate, organic moments that never feel forced or tacked on out of necessity…Even as you read the text, there is no obvious solution to the mystery. This is not a predictable, expository story nor is it a simple mystery to unravel. The questions continue to build as the story goes on in conjunction with the growth, or deconstruction, of the characters and comes to what is simply a disturbingly satisfying conclusion. Like all good horror, Gethsemane Hall plays tricks on the mind as you read before it decides to let you walk away.”“Compelling, a little frightening and amazingly inventive, a new and powerful take on the old haunted house story…Annandale has created a house that lives and breathes and constantly shows new and terrifying facets of itself as the tension builds.”(Star Phoenix)“With Gethsemane Hall, Winnipeg writer David Annadale has created that rarest of books: a genuinely chilling horror novel. And a fresh take on the hoary old haunted house novel, no less...Gethsemane Hall is a slowly tightening noose of a novel, the carefully measured tension beginning with the pedestrian stuff of bad dreams and mysterious sounds in the dark, and building steadily until finally exploding in an imaginative Grand Guignol release.” (Quill & Quire)\"As ghost hunters and debunkers explore the hall, braving cold spots, unearthly screams, and a shared nightmare, it is a hidden staircase that lures readers and characters both into the belly of the beast that is Gethsemane Hall. As they spiral down together, Annandale ascribes reptilian, malevolent presence to mere steps, leading ultimatley to the terror that is the real dark power beneath Gethsemane Hall\".(Prairie Books Now)“A  creepy thriller with a devastating conclusion. Highly recommended.”(Rue Morgue horror magazine)“Annandale has taken the cliche and turned it into a high concept, and lived up to his ambition by nailing the execution. His characters are fully formed and carefully assembled into a complex puzzle of disparate convictions. Everyone in the Hall knows how the world works, even as the Hall itself works to unravel their ironclad truths. The story is deliberately paced, an inexorable crawl from ignorance to terrible enlightenment. Under Annandale's pen, nightfall is once again a time to be feared, while the safety of daylight is slowly bled away, until the familiar comfort of the sun is nothing but a cruel joke.”(McNallyRobinson.com)“Fans of literary horror have been waiting for a haunted-house story this smart for a long time.” (Winnipeg Free Press)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hide!\" is the third book in Scott Ferrell's series of e-reader\nbooks for children. This time we follow Mr. Marceau's favorite friends,\nSpringer Spaniel Gaston and Gregorie the parrot in an interesting game\nof hide and seek. Only Gregorie takes this game on a unique twist\nthroughout the neighborhood, getting everyone involved. I love the sweet\n friendship between Gaston and Gregorie. Seeing a dog walking around\nwith a little bird on his back just gives you that warm, fuzzy, homey\nfeeling. I really like the way the author includes all of the neighbors\ninto the actions and fun of these precious animals, giving the feeling\nof a wonderful, nice, safe neighborhood.\"Hide! Hide!\" is a sweet little story written and illustrated especially\n for e-readers. The illustrations are simple, so the book will not take a\n lot of space on your readers, but yet these colorful and adorable\npictures are detailed enough to capture the attention of your young\nchild. My 3 and a half year old niece loves all three of Scott Ferrell's\n books, and continually asks me to read about Gaston and Gregorie. And\nreally, she loves looking at the pictures and making up her own story to\n read to me. I really think \"Hide! Hide!\" is at the top of her list\nbecause she thinks it is so much fun! Abilene and I highly recommend\nthat you start your child out early with your e-reader and download\n\"Hide! Hide!\" immediately. And while you are at it, go ahead and grab\n\"Peaches! Peaches!\" and  \"Sing! Sing!\" I know you will not be\ndisappointed with these precious little books.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The Five Face fire did not become a series until the book was done and a publisher said it would be more catchy if I made it into a series, so I went to work and took out my old stories, poems and quotes that I picked up and created a series that I call \"The Five Face Series\".", "related": ["B00A8CEA9C"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There are so many individuals that step into the ring or have a part in what the fan sees, that have no business there. I've checked all of the colleges, universities, and online schooling facilities, and even pre-kindergarden, and have yet to find any program to learn this wonderful love affair with the lady I call the ring. You see, there are too many pimps in this world that will use anything to make a buck. I would give you the list, but I won't live long enough to complete it.You don't have to have a diploma, doctorate, and in my day, you had to have tights and boots, but those are gone, too. I bet you wonder where I'm going with this. Here's where.Gordon Solie. My God. There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said about this man. The accolades should go on forever. Simply a class act. You see, he was able to do what Vince McMahon has done without all the tv time, glitz and glamour, and the unending money flow that Vince uses to create. Solie could do it with one word, or without a word, just a look. You always listened to him. You turned on the television, and sure, you wanted to see Dusty, the Briscos, the Grahams, and the rest, but the first thing you yearned for was to hear Gordon's voice. This man was not an announcer, color guy. He was the show. Without Gordon, there wasn't a show. This man, regardless of the situation, gave credibility and believability to whatever was being put on the platter. You see, Vince, Mr. Solie was the first to make chicken soup out of chicken sh . There is NO way anyone will come up with the recipe any better, or even close to what he gave to us weekly.I myself watched him for many years, and then going to Florida early in my career, when I had no right even to be near the ring. In fact, I was a part-time referee and job guy. But I was hungry. All he ever gave to anyone was respect, support, and a friendly smile. My problem was, at the time, I did not feel worthy of even a glance. I think what I'm trying to tell you guys, is, if you didn't know the man, or have any idea what he was about, or contributed, then you are very fortunate, because there are books, and if there was any book to talk about wrestling, this is the one you should read. Why? Because its not a hyped , pushed down your throat, and million-dollar marketed extravaganza of BS ... just this man's thoughts. If I were to tell you of my many regrets and mistakes in my life, one of the biggest would have to be not taking advantage of this great man's friendship, love and knowledge. Next week, I will tell you a story about this man, and no, it's not the giggles and smiles I used to give him during a production meeting at Georgia Championship wrestling, when I'd given Ole Anderson (my boss) with no power, a fake tv show on Friday, just so he would go nuts all night and be frothing at the mouth when he came to the meeting on Saturday morning at TBS. Gordon knew the game I was playing with Ole without me ever saying a word to him. Ole would rant, spit, and rave and Gordon would play it off like a child had spilt his milk in the high chair. You see, the class of the man was to enjoy the presentation and the game without spoiling it. Always to enhance whatever had been given. He was cool before cool ever happened. If you look up cool in the dictionary, there is Gordon Solie's picture looking back at you. Simply put, the best that ever was, or will be. More so than Gorilla and Heenan, 'cause he never stole the show. THE man.Next week, we will give you my funniest, and I regret to say, most painful memory I've ever done to anyone. And unfortunately, it was Gordon.

Doug's\nbook is a joy to follow, well thought through and well written. The camera\ncompany should be employing Doug to write their cameras manuals!-Robert D.A Pro Right There with You- If you want to get the camera\nup and running with the feeling of a pro right there with you then I would\nstrongly recommend it. He walks you through setting the camera up and gives you\nhis reasoning for the settings. He leaves the door open to change them based on\nyour level of experience. After the basic settings tour Doug then gets down to\nthe heart of this great camera: the custom settings and focus system. His\nexplanation is first class and he explains how various custom settings are\nrelated to each other. The focus system on this camera is top drawer and Doug\ndoes a fine job explaining what can be a very intimidating area of this camera.\nAll in all a great read.  Camera in one hand and reader in the other and\ndig in.-Tim S.A Must-Have Accessory- What a great addition to my bag.\nThis is a well written, full body of work that explains, in plain English, how\nto get the most out my new camera. Doug provides the knowledge and experience\nto bring you to the next level. I look forward to learning more every time I\nopen the book.-StevenIt's the first guide I've read which has taken me through all the settings in\nan understandable way. I now feel that I have control over the camera.-Peter S.Really Focuses on the \"Why\"- I found the (camera's)\nmanual good for understanding how to set things up but not much on the why -\nthis book really focuses on the \"why.\"-Benoit A.This manual is a clearly written,concise and useful\nexplanation of the rationale for the seemingly infinite and often confusing\nsettings options.-W.L.S.It's clear, concise and gets to the heartof the camera's multiple and often confusing options.

In 2003 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism; \"Hashimoto's thyroiditis\" being the cause. This autoimmune form of thyroid disease that causes destruction of the thyroid gland resulted in my also developing \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\", due to a compromised immune system with severe co-morbid \"Adrenal Fatigue\". I also suffered severe anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks early into the onset of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Hashitoxicosis - temporary hyperthyroidism). A common heart murmur I was diagnosed with in my teens called \"Mitral Valve Prolapse\", also worsened in severity of symptoms, with the development of these other health disorders.  My eventual receiving of diagnoses was a difficult process with proper diagnostic testing not being ordered by the first doctors I sought treatment from. These types of issues were inspiration for me to become proactive in my own health care and to self-educate myself on these health disorders, which I have done extensively since 2003. I now enjoy sharing this information with other patients experiencing my same health disorders.", "related": ["B007XTMNLA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Always looming in the background was my desire to write a novel. This goal has now become a reality, and I am happily pursuing my career as an author. Originally from California, I became a transplant to New Jersey when I met the love of my life through the internet. We now reside in NE Pennsylvania in a rather rural area with our little girl, Sophie, a vibrant little Cockapoo with a heart of gold. In my first novel I wanted to portray real people who are like anyone else, with the exception being that they are gay. It is the first in a series I am planning to write in which I will present characters with what can be assumed as an obvious difference from other individuals, with this distinction always being something that is beyond their control. Their stories will portray them as ordinary people, driven by the same needs, dreams, and desires as everyone else. I hope you will enjoy my first novel and that you will continue to join me as I endeavor to create more characters with whom you may identify, and situations that will intrigue you and tug at your heart.

He began to write fiction in 1965 but switched to poetry and is now a popular cowboy poet. He has written over 500 poems, many of them short stories about the west. In the late 1930’s and 40’s, he fell in love with the west that Zane Grey, Max Brand, Louis L’Amour, and so many others wrote about, and John Wayne, Gary Cooper, and later, Clint Eastwood brought to life in the movies. He has spent most of a fourteen hour day in the saddle, been thrown from a running horse, and had to walk home after being knocked from the saddle.  He still loves horses. Three of his poems appeared in the anthology COWBOY POETRY MATTERS by Story Line Press, edited by Robert McDowell. His first exclusive collection of cowboy poems came in the 2011 publication of WHO GETS TO RIDE,  and was followed the next year by THE FARTHER I RIDE, both published by Brave New Genre, Inc. Clad in cowboy garb, Bob has read at numerous cowboy poetry festivals and rodeos in Central California, as well as on KVPR--Valley Public Radio and KVPT Television.  Bob and his wife Margaret have travelled from Alaska to Florida in their motor home, and have visited the states in which his characters have their adventures. During the Korean War, they lived in Tucson, Arizona where he learned to love the desert.", "related": ["B00J1IN4B4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tristan is not a typical dominant, but he truly enjoys bringing new and different experiences into his physical relationship with Raina.A word about the names. Yes, I chose Raina for my heroine because it means queen. Obviously that fits nicely with our hero, Mr. King. Why not?

What followed was years of writing workshops as well as correspondence courses in writing for children through the Institute of Children’s Literature in Connecticut.  She credits the award winning author, Troon Harrison, as the instructor who helped her find her literary voice.  Marta’s first work of juvenile fiction, BEING SAM, NO MATTER WHAT was published in 2005, followed by EVERY WHICH WAY BUT KUKU! in 2006.  With her more recent endeavors, Marta has shifted her writing focus to “women’s suspense”, a genre she fondly describes as having “strong female protagonists with closets full of nasty skeletons and the odd murder or two to complicate their already complicated lives”.

Normally, I choose my books feeling like they will be ok, but not that they will necessarily change my students' lives. I really feel like this book offers so much useful, understandable information, that students will feel like they are getting in on the \"secret\" of how to succeed in college. It will take some work, but because the activities are engaging and personal, I believe students will enjoy the process.\"\"I am thrilled that a college reading textbook finally has paired how to learn with the process of reading. It incorporates teaching the student about the brain and how it functions and then applies that to the process of reading. This is something I have tried to do for over twenty years. It's gratifying to find a text that does it so well.\"\"This text bothers to explain the reasoning (the science) behind how students can become more effective readers while continually assuring students that they have the power to improve their reading based on that reasoning. Most other texts focus on WHY students should become more effective readers and basically issue prescriptions for improved reading without rational.\"\"In my classes I discuss building dendrites, but this book actually practices this theory in every chapter. I really like the section at the beginning of each chapter where it asks students to draw their dendrites and then at the end of the chapter to now draw their dendrites. This book truly practices and reinforces brain theory. So many students do not have a clear understanding as to how they learn and how important it is to their reading and comprehension. This is truly innovative and relevant to present day college students.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has always wanted to be a writer so she also took several classes in creative writing. Hadena’s primary literary genre is action/thriller.  She currently writes two series, both use action/thriller.  “The Brenna Strachan Series” uses fantasy and the “Dreams & Reality Series” uses murder mystery as its secondary genre.  She continues to explore and expand her writing and hopes to soon produce a comedic action/thriller.  When she isn’t busy writing or running her business, Hadena enjoys playing in a steel-tip dart league.  She also loves to travel throughout North America and Europe. Her favorite cities are Chicago, Illinois and Berlin, Germany.  She is an avid reader,  reading everything from the classics like Jane Austen to modern writers like Terry Pratchett.  One of her all-time favorite books is “Good Omens” by Neil Gaimen and Terry Pratchett.  She writes all of her books while listening to music and the bands tend to get “honorable mentions” within the pages. http://www.facebook.com/hadenajames hadenajames.wordpress.com", "related": [], "rank": 861019, "title": "The Dysfunctional Valentine (The Dysfunctional Chronicles Book 2)", "author": "Hadena James", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Years later she would launch a community forum for this very purpose via social media that attracted some 300 members.   It is there she penned the first essays for this book.  Jessie’s essay, Sheer Delight, was selected for publication in the Lambda Award nominated anthology, Letters to My Bully.  Her writing caught the attention of Eleda Literary Agency in Los Angeles who secured a publishing contract with Glover Lane Press for Jessie to pen this book.  Jessie can be found in sunny northern California, working on her next books, relaxing with her wife of many years and smiling happily at their miniature Dachshund family.

Like my heroine, I am a middle aged, youthful, African American BBW who works at a credit union. My story is not autobiographical, but a lot of my life and experiences have provided material for me to work with. Claire Stinson and I are both women nearing sixty, but feeling, looking and living a lot younger! We are baby boomers still looking for our happily ever after. I am tired of reading about twenty or thirtysomethings working for gazillionaires. Men who all of a sudden fall head over heels for the fat little temp or back office secretary. My story is indeed a fairy tale, but one that really could happen! I’ve written a story that the mature woman working in an office or at a Wal-Mart can close her eyes and imagine herself in Claire’s size EEE shoes. Seeing that how a simple act of compassion could open up an incredible new world to them. How a flawed but fantastic warrior could learn about and come to love them for themselves.  The demographic of the population of the U.S. is now so diverse that interracial relationships are no longer the exception, but the norm, as is the BBW or Full-Figured Woman.  The aging of America lends itself to providing realistic representations of mature love relationships, not just little old ladies sharing tea with little old men.", "related": ["B00JQS5FIO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 48.0}

He studied English at the University of Texas at Austin (B.A., 1973; M.A., 1975), where he fell in love with medieval tales told in their original languages. Before pursuing his doctorate in English at the University of Delaware (English, 1980), he spent two years away from formal study to fish and to plunder libraries and used bookstores for books on fishing and a wide variety of other subjects. His scholarly publications have treated metrics, the legendary history of Britain, Geoffrey Chaucer, and lexicography. He is currently working on a series of medieval tales retold for the sophisticated contemporary reader.", "related": [], "rank": 2221083, "title": "The Humiliation of Sir Lancelot", "author": "Arthur Wayne Glowka", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His approach is to read Luke's gospel in the company of previous interpreters, ancient and modern. The end result is a beautiful exposition of Luke, blending in patristic comments and snatches of poetry along with medieval and modern interpretations of individual passages in the gospel.\"--Donald Senior, CP,The Bible Today\"[Lukeis] a fine work. . . .[David Lyle] Jeffrey excels in capturing the overall picture of each scene and helps us read the text with the church through the ages. . . . [A] great resource.\"--Ray Van Neste,Preaching\"[1 Samuelis] a thoughtful, stimulating commentary. . . . In her discussion of the text, [Francesca Aran] Murphy draws on a variety of sources throughout church history, ranging from the Church fathers to modern commentators. Her familiarity with this entire range brings together a rich variety of perspectives that would be especially helpful to someone preaching through this book. . . . This is a worthwhile commentary on 1 Samuel. Anyone preaching on Samuel or studying Israel's united kingdom will find it a helpful resource.\"--Michael A. Harbin,Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society\"Many commentaries exhibit a strange doubleness. On technical points they are sharp and decisive; on large questions they are evasive. Not Francesca Aran Murphy's1 Samuel. . . . Murphy is almost belligerently forthright in laying out her interpretations, making her book a delightful read even when one disagrees. And whereas typical commentary is written with all the verve of an instruction manual, Murphy's prose is fresh, witty, at times exuberant--not to draw attention to itself, but in mimetic homage to the richness of the text.\"--John Wilson,Christianity Today", "related": [], "rank": 412908, "title": "Esther & Daniel (Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible)", "author": "Samuel Wells", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hawthorne was born on December 25, 1981 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After moving to California and back with her mother, Hawthorne settled in Wisconsin, finishing her primary education at the Milwaukee High School of the Arts studying theater and vocal production. She went on to study at Virginia College, graduating with a major in business and as 2009 president of PHI BETA Lambda (national leadership  society).  Finding refuge in the pen, Hawthorne began to write at a very young age, expressing her creativity through poetry, plays, and short stories. In 2008  she was inducted into the National Library of Poetry for the poem The Spirit of the African American Dream. Proving to be a very productive year, Hawthorne published her first book entitled PIMPTRESS under the pen name Keylo. The next year she co-write and acted in Secrets, the stage play. Later, her vocal dynamics would lead her to becoming one of Jackson Mississippi's 15 finalist in the Fox 40 American Idol Auditions in 2010.  Taking time to embrace her other love; empowering youth, Hawthorne is an educator, motivator, and volunteer for the community. She taught art at the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, teaches general studies at an elementary school, and developed standardized reading passages for  elementary, middle, and high school students. Hawthorne is also a certified reading specialist and director of the Poindexter Park After school Club.   In the hectic world of composing great works and feeding knowledge to the youth, Hawthorne looks to her family for peace and support. She is a  loving nurturer. Mother of three; Josiah (1), Kalynn (6), and Kaliah (11), Hawthorne is the epitome of a strong matriarch.  Returning to writing, K E Hawthorne's new novel series is about to take the world by storm. The Guardian: The Panther with Many Faces is the  introduction to a new age hero.

A non-traditionalist, she juxtaposes the unexpected in a pleasing manner, both visually and journalistically. One of her many skills is effectively uniting an idea with an image. An amateur photographer, Lynne’s passion for visual aesthetics—beauty, texture, light and natural elements—developed at a young age. She obtained a degree in advertising from the Journalism College at the University of Florida and subsequently taught a communications and design course there. She studied graphic design at the Ringling School of Art and Design, and this experience helped shape her lifelong vision. She started her career at an ad agency, collaborated with designers at a boutique studio in Sarasota, worked as a typesetter and assisted the Art Department at Sarasota Magazine. Lynne has built a flourishing business as a designer and artistic consultant. Her creativity fuses with her business acumen to produce compelling results for her clients’ products and services. From designing logos to collateral materials such as stationery, stickers and banners as well as catalogues, books, CD covers, brochures and even cigar bands, Lynne reaches many audiences. Her unique combination of talents has landed her a varied roster of clients. Her personal interests reflect her zest for embracing the unfamiliar, from learning to sail to taking voice and painting lessons and web design classes. When she travels, she borrows cultural nuances and incorporates them in how she sees and represents a variety of concepts. She’s taken photos of signage in Montreal, observed how Italians hang their laundry, photographed food being transported down a canal in Venice. But it’s not just the exotic that moves her. She is stirred by her everyday surroundings, studying nature, light sources and shadows. She draws inspiration from her studio—a mélange of aboriginal art, books on art history, photography, her acrylic paints, artifacts from her travels, and a wire clothesline draped with design projects. Her studio overlooks her garden, which is just as eclectic. Dotted among flowerbeds are teacups glued to copper poles. A pergola and a fire pit invite cozy gatherings. Old, Bohemian bits comfortably share space with new life and the fresh presentation of ideas.", "related": [], "rank": 2938702, "title": "A Month of Sundays", "author": "Lynne Grainger", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The three titles are  excellently read by Joe Morton, Lindsay Crouse, and Tim Curry,  but it's unclear what the producer was trying to accomplish by  arranging the set out of chronological order. The action in  Lasher logically follows that of The Witching Hour, which ends  describing the relationship of Rowan Mayfair with the spirit  Lasher. Taltos seems to be a vehicle to redefine Lasher, killed  off in the earlier work, as a demon who assumed the identity of  Mr. Ash/St. Ashlar, a nonhuman, nonvampire being whose kind live  for millennia. There's a lot of pseudomyth touched up with  Catholic or voodoo imagery and laced liberally with incestuous  or otherwise taboo sex: a Mayfair dynasty no doubt but with no  discernible witchcraft and quite a fixation on the female  breast. Horrifying, no, though quite horrible. Merrick, on the other hand, provides the listener with an  excellent abridgment, read with great feeling and effectiveness  by Sir Derek Jacobi. Though Merrick is a Mayfair and a witch,  one will not have had to read a majority of other works Rice has  written about the Mayfairs to understand what is happening in  this story. Also, along with the myth and voodoo allusions, one  actually gets some of what the listener would think of as  witchcraft. It's decidedly spooky stuff that also explores  Rice's visions of possible afterlives, the mortality of witches,  and the virtual immortality of vampires. Acquire Mayfair Witches  in this abridged set only if circulation patterns indicate you  should. Merrick is highly recommended for adult fiction and  horror collections.

Even as a teenager I used to make up children's stories as I put them to bed while baby sitting. They were always begging me for more, perhaps just to stay up late, perhaps because I used to include them in the stories.Illustrating children's books was an ambition that grew from the early seventies. My tutor who was also trying to get a children's book published said I'd get there before him. He was a great tutor.Now , having spent time working in children's homes and with disenfranchised and special needs children I love telling the stories which will inspire children to read. First with and adult's encouragement and eventually by themselves. I think children love dialogue, playful and expressive characters and vibrant colours. They also have an acute eye for details and when I worked in schools were the first to spot if I lost an earing despite my long hair. I have tried to incorporate all these factors in my books plus a positive caring attitude towards other people which most children share automatically but a few need reminding of now and then.Children are my worst critics but also my most devoted ones and I will continue to write books for their enjoyment, since their delight is the greatest motivation any writer can have.Yours Viv.", "related": ["B00BEI64MK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That's all covered. But there are also interesting snippets of information on all sorts of people and subjects, including William Hershel; the astrological meanings and history of various planets; homeopathic remedies for short-term relief of emotional problems; and even a section on flower remedies for the different star signs. There is lots of self help advice, with practical guidance and websites - and even suggestions on how to check your finances and keep a reign on your budget.

It sits on a nice big section where one day my tomatoes will ripen and my Annabel Langbein / Hugh Fearnely-wotsit organic lifestyle fantasy will become reality. In the meantime though there is heaps of room for our two boys Joshua aged 9 and Daniel who is 7 to run around along with the cat Blue and the hens who are not feeling the love and refuse to lay. When the boys are at school and I am not lamenting life with my walking buddies or if it is that time of the month, hibernating while I snaffle the aforementioned cheese scones I write. This is something I came to later in life when Joshua was a baby and having those lovely long day sleeps. I happily penned PC opinion style pieces for various NZ parenting magazines but when Daniel was born I decided to set myself the challenge of writing a book. The joy of writing a novel was the freedom to be oh so un-PC hence the title of my book The Brazilian Job.

The border area between Scotland and England has been a\nplace of dissension for eons, probably starting long before the ice\nbridge between England and the Continent thawed. Why did Hadrian build\nthat wall of his? Because it slows down the inhabitants from either side\n of the wall as they carry stolen cattle, property and, yes, women, back\n to their own side of the border. Of course, if we hadn't had the border\n folk we'd be poorer some great words, like blackmail, or games, like\nrugby. Lucien's lodge, the pele tower, is an actual style of home for\nthe area. The way the hills fold behind his home is referred to as a\n\"beef-tub\", which is essentially a hidden place where the denizens who\ndid manage to carry cattle over Hadrian's wall stashed their stolen\nbeef. And, the abbey Devanney's house party goes off to visit is based\non the lyrical ruins of Melrose Abbey.So, for what it's worth I hope you've enjoyed my stab at a Regency Era romance. Thanks for trying it!ROSES AT MIDNIGHTby Diane A.S. StuckartI'm very pleased to be\nbringing back in eBook format another of my \"vintage\" historical romances first\npublished by Pinnacle Books and which were written as Alexa Smart.

Writing has always been an outlet for my imagination and freedom of expression, I began writing poetry and short stories at the age of 5. While other kids played outside, I found leisure writing in my personal diary or writing fun stories for my family to read. I was also obsessed with reading. I memorized every Dr. Seuss book there was. My reading selections of course matured with age, I was totally intrigued when I learned there were books about African American people. It wasn't that I didn't love all the other books I read, it was the simple fact that this was something I could really relate to. \"The Coldest Winter Ever\" by Sister Souljah was the first novel of this Genre I got my hands on. Although to this day that book is still my favorite, I grew to also love books by Zane, Omar Tyree, and Teri Woods just to name a few. My passion for these stories and my love for writing, in which I truly have been blessed with talent, has convinced me that it has always been meant for me to pursue a career as an author.", "related": ["B00GM4N3MU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 42.0}

I let a good friend view the manuscript. They enjoyed what I wrote. I had no plan to publish it, but they convinced me to give it a try. It has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.

They are in constant danger as Raveyn, the Aragnarian King who sits on an earthly throne, becomes less tolerant with each passing day of those who follow The One. When Raveyn finally makes a move on their village to eradicate the followers of The One, they are forced to flee. Maria gets some unexpected help as her mother, brother, and Daniel, along with the other believers from their village, are caught and taken captive. But their victory over Raveyn is bittersweet for Maria as she suffers loss and heartache. A revelation from The One True King to Maria fills her with uncertainty as she faces a future fraught with something more monstrous than the one they have just defeated.Wings of Honor was an enchanting read for me. I was pulled into this story immediately. Elizabeth Hornberger showed pure talent as she painted her characters and the world they lived in with a vivid brush. Excellent dialogue and actions brought her characters to life right from the start. This story isn't just about the age-old theme of good versus evil; it's a refreshing and engrossing depiction of destiny, faith, and courage in the lives of her characters. Carried out by a seemingly unlikely heroine, it reinforced the fact that The One can use even the least of us to do wondrous feats. I highly recommend this book, and I look forward to reading the next one in this trilogy. I can't wait to see if a certain spark turns into a flame!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dennis Gwin has suffered a few heart problems in his life and has had stents fitted on more than one occasion. Unfortunately, his problem becomes too serious for stents and he requires a quadruple heart bypass. This is his account of what happened - the lead up to the surgery and how he coped afterwards. Dennis takes us through everything - his feelings before and after the surgery, the nurses and the doctors who looked after him, and his family, who provided the much needed support for his recovery. This is a very frank account of one man's fight against heart disease and how he overcame his own personal Mount Everest.Although the subject matter is serious, Hit the Knee and Other Sage Advice is a wonderfully funny look at how you should (or, in some cases, should not) deal with heart surgery. Dennis Gwin has been very frank about his surgery, his feelings, about everything really. In many ways, his story is a lesson to all of us on how to deal with what life throws at us, on how to deal with pain and, perhaps more importantly, on how to listen to what your body is telling you and not ignore the signs of what could be something very serious. I take my hat off to Mr Gwin for sharing his story with us and would love to read more from him - although I certainly wouldn't wish him any ill to provide the material for another book!-Anne-Marie Reynolds for Readers' Favorite", "related": ["B00K2GC12M"], "rank": 1868479, "title": "Hit the Knee: A Cheeky Account of my Heart Bypass Surgery", "author": "Dennis J Gwin", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
