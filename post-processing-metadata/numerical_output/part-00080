Naturally, there are those who yearn for pregnancy the old-fashioned, \"Abnormal\" way. Neiderman's fast-moving tale weaves together several such characters, but focuses on Natalie Ross, a romance novelist who was born an Abnormal. Despite her best efforts at using black-market birth control, Natalie finds herself pregnant-which could ruin her lawyer husband. Even more intriguing is a story line involving a group of young girls who are infatuated with the idea of pregnancy; at meetings of their clandestine PYPC (Pretend You're Pregnant Club), they stuff pillows under their shirts and commune on prenatal vitamins. One Machiavellian girl, hyper-sexualized and fascinated by the violence of animals, resorts to murder when threatened with exposure. The ideas that comprise the bulk of this book aren't novel-laboratory births and fascist family planning having been a sci-fi staple for decades-but Neiderman's light touch and breezy style make this well-worn idea seem new again.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The players' voices emit every nuance required to let listeners experience the swashbuckling deeds of the famous heroic threesome and the boy called D'Artagnan who wants to join their ranks. When the young man arrives in Paris with the wish to enlist with the King's Musketeers, he finds himself challenged to three duels in his first afternoon in the city by men who turn out to be Porthos, Aramis, and Athos-the Three Musketeers. Instead of fighting against them, the twists of fate have D'Artagnan battling for them against the evil Cardinal Richelieu's guards. After demonstrating his worth with a sword, D'Artagnan proves more of his mettle by journeying to England to foil a plot to embarrass France's Queen Anne, the former Anne of Austria. D'Artagnan saves his queen but loses the woman he loves, so he seeks vengeance and, in turn, instills himself firmly in the ranks of the Musketeers. The flavor of the original is evident even though this abridged version includes only highlights in its retelling.Joanne K.

In a chatty voice, she reflects on all things bee, from how their senses work to what the tendency to swarm is all about (to establish a new hive in response to overpopulation in the first hive) and how each bee serves the hive through various stages of life. She reveals how honey is made (spit is involved) and how the hive, itself an organism of sorts, functions. At times Wallace touches briefly, and sometimes all too glibly, on global environmental issues. Her narrative leaves traces of her personal involvement with bees, though the reader only really gains insight into her personality late in the book: In a section full of potential, she reveals that without the social link her ex-husband provided, she \"could happily have holed up in the bottomland woods and gone slowly, ecstatically mad\" and describes her tension with the hive of human society as a single woman in midlife. Still, Wallace leaves much unsaid, and this is as close as we get to understanding how the hive is linked to her own life.(July 11)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Walter Selby, a decorated WW II veteran, becomes a speech writer and strategist for a prominent Tennessee politician; marries Nicole, a decade younger; and lives with all the trappings of the Southern upper-middle class, including two small children, Frank and Gail.  A political debacle causes the fiercely moral Walter to resign, and he returns home early, only to find Nicole has been unfaithful.  The second half of the novel follows Frank--who recalls little of his parents after his adoption--as a known, but declining, actor approached by a famous actress, Lenore, to star in her swan song.Lewis displays considerable writing talent, such as when Frank explains to Lenore that he never talks about his real father, and \"[s]he sounded surprised by the notion, and slightly incredulous, as if he'd told her that he'd never tasted orange juice, or that he'd once gone a year without sleeping.\" The novel is constructed to showcase Lewis's astute musings on love, sex, and death, but gives short shrift to the relationship between Frank and his ancestry. Instead, Frank's time is spent recalling his first love, Kimmie, and their sexual experiences (in vivid detail). While engaging characters abound, the plot ofThe King Is Deadbecomes suppressed and merely strings them along.--Michael Ferch", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Being a real time sub for a little over three years now I was able to see what a wonderful help this would ve been when I was first thinking of entering into a serious BDSM relationship. The exercises are straightforward and provide a lot of insight for a sub into what it takes to make a Dominant happy, as well as what he/she is willing to and needs to do from their end to make a lasting relationship a reality. The interesting thing I found while reading the book was that the exercises also served to help me understand more about what it is to be truly submissive. While many of the exercises in the book have been done in one way or another by myself and my Mistress during our relationship, they have been done in our heads as the need arose and are not kept anywhere to be reviewed. This book makes it easy to keep a log of your relationship needs, priorities, etc. It will also serve as a lasting and easy way to help enter into the next relationship, if the need arises, as any perspective Dominant can see what type of submissive you are prior to moving forward. This will serve to eliminate many problems often found early in a BDSM relationship. All in all, I found the book to be an excellent way for any submissive to get themselves organized and make sure they have concise, well thought out goals that they would like to achieve before going into a BDSM relationship as well as a reference guide to be used throughout your relationship. --Bob, Orlando FL", "related": ["B00JYQ9ZNY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was one of those inky Mobile nights when warm April air met earth still cool from winter, brewing up a fog as thick as gumbo. A night when the Union blockade crouched like a sullen watchdog far out in the bay and Confederate soldiers camped under abandoned cotton shelters at Camp Beulah just outside town. A night when any civilian with a grain of sense was tucked up asleep under the breeze of an open window.She paused with one leg out the window and took a deep breath. With practiced ease she grabbed the knotty old wisteria vine that twined around the lattice and began the climb down.It was amazing she hadn't been caught and sent to the prison on Ship Island. In the early days her forays had been executed with haste and blind luck. Lately, however, every move and communication were plotted with exquisite care, orchestrated by an anonymous sponsor. Camilla longed to meet him, one day when the war was over, the Yankees went home, and the Southern conscience woke up to the truth that slavery was wrong.As she scooted into an alley behind the Battle House Hotel, a baby's cry from an open upstairs window stopped her in her tracks. She prayed there wouldn't be a baby tonight. Babies made her task twice as difficult and dangerous.Shuddering, she continued down empty residential streets, slipping from behind one tree to the next— huge old oaks dripping with Spanish moss that tickled her face, magnolias just beginning to bud, and scratchy, richly scented cedars. She sneezed, then looked around, stricken with fear, breathing in and out. The fog was so dense she could barely see her hand in front of her face. When all remained quiet, she continued, knees trembling.At the waterfront, noise and light from inside the buildings spilled out into the fog. She paused outside the Soldiers' Library to watch the approach of two gray-uniformed soldiers. They seemed more intent on observing the ribaldry inside the gambling saloons and oyster bars than enforcing the 9:00 p.m. slave curfew.Slouching into a bowlegged, droop-shouldered posture, she lurched out into the road. An inebriated vagrant wandering the downtown streets in the wee hours of the morning was a common enough sight. As long as he was white.She hesitated at the corner of Water and Theater streets, peering blindly into the mist, and nearly jumped out of her skin when cold fingers tapped her cheek. She stifled a shriek with one hand.\"Now, now, Missy, I thought you wasn't comin'.\" The whining whisper was so close to her ear that she could smell the speaker's fishy breath.\"Shh! Virgil, you nearly scared the life out of me. Come here before somebody sees us.\" She grabbed a skinny arm and towed him deeper into the shadows.Any passerby who chanced to see them would have found little to tell them apart. Much the same height, they wore the same disreputable costume—dark stocking cap, patched pea jacket, canvas pants of an indeterminate color and hobnailed boots.\"Where's the bag?\" Camilla turned Virgil around and yanked off the burlap sack slung across his back, then placed her hands firmly on either side of his vacant face. \"You forget you saw me tonight, you hear?\"Virgil nodded with childish pleasure. \"I ain't seen you, Missy.\"\"Good.\" Camilla reached into her pocket for a coin and a slightly fuzzy toffee. \"Get yourself something to eat, and I'll sell your papers for you.\"\"Yes'm, Missy.\" He popped the toffee into his mouth. \"You'll bring my bag back when you're through?\"\"Haven't I always?\"\"Yes'm, shore have.\" Virgil grinned, then shuffled away into the fog without a backward glance.Camilla watched him go with a mixture of pity and gratitude. Since no one considered him capable of putting two thoughts together on his own, Crazy Virgil the Birdman could come and go as he pleased. When she assumed his identity, she was virtually invisible.Disguise complete, she stepped into the street and continued northward to where the Mobile and Tensaw rivers dumped into Mobile Bay.Camilla could remember when the quay of Mobile was lined with stately hulls and a forest of masts. After General Bragg forbade cotton to be shipped to the port lest the Yankees succumb to the temptation to attack, the steamers made increasingly rare appearances downriver. The docks looked embarrassingly naked these days.But there should be at least one riverboat tied in. Camilla strained to see through the fog. There she was. TheMagnolia Princess,flambeaux peering through the mist, bumped gently against the pier like a cat nudging her mistress's skirts.As Camilla approached, a burst of laughter reached her ears, faded, swelled again. TheMagnolia Princess,one of the few pleasure boats remaining in these grim days, carried a troupe of actors and singers and dancers, as well as floating card games run by professional gamblers.Ready to hawk her newspapers should she be noticed, Camilla stole across the boat's gangway, darted across the lower deck and found the ladder down into the hold.Wooden beams creaked all around her as she descended, and the smell of oil and burning pine from the stoke hole was suffocating. Sticky turpentine oozed from the frame of the boat and clung to her clothes and hands as she felt her way down the rickety ladder. She was nearly at the bottom when she felt strong hands clasp her around the waist and lift her down.\"Horace,\" she breathed in relief.\"Me and the boy both here, Miss Milla, but we got to hurry. The train, she leaving in less than two hours.\"Camilla took a deep breath. \"There'll be four this time.\"She dropped the bulky bag full of newspapers, then with the two men began to examine the barrels crowded into the narrow space. At length Horace kicked one in disgust. \"Porter say he mark ours with aX,but it's so dark down here I can't see a thing.\"Camilla wiped her sweaty face on her coat sleeve. It would be deadly to send the wrong barrels north on the train. She hesitated, then whispered, \"I know you're not supposed to make a sound, but we're running out of time, so I want you to make some little noise so we'll know where you are.\"There was a moment of thick quiet. All she heard was the creaking of the boat and the slosh of water against her pontoons. Then, barely audible, came a scratching sound from the barrel upon which Camilla sat. Grinning at Willie, she hopped down. When they'd found the three others, she assisted the men in hoisting them one at a time up the ladder.Porter, their accomplice on the boat, had done his job—keeping the crew away from this end of the deck. The thick fog aided them, as well. They spoke not a word as they worked, and Camilla flinched every time one of the barrels bumped against the ladder going up. But no sound came from within any of the barrels— until they were loading the last one onto the wagon. Losing her grip, Camilla gave a dismayed little squeak.Just in time to keep it from bursting open on the ground, Willie grabbed her end of the barrel.As a muffled wail came from inside the barrel, Camilla flung her arms around it. \"Shh, it's all right,\" she whispered through the knothole near the top. \"I know you're scared, but hold on. We're almost away.\"Horace patted her shoulder and jerked his head toward the rail station a quarter mile or so up the quay.Taking a shuddering breath, Camilla nodded. \"All right. Let's go.\"The wagon lurched into motion.As they rattled along the waterfront, Camilla strained to see through the twining fog. The military watch was spread thin. Maybe they'd escaped.\"Hey, you there!\" A hoarse voice penetrated the darkness. \"Stop where you are!\"Camilla clutched the side of the wagon as Horace drew the horses to a halt. Boots crunched on damp shells as a gray-clad watchman appeared out of the fog. She and Horace and Willie waited, letting the picket make the first move. Camilla kept her head down and pulled her cap over her face.The soldier leaned against the wagon. \"What you darkies doing out here?\" He reached out and whacked Camilla on the head with a gloved hand. \"What's in them barrels, boy?\"She cowered. \"Nothing, sir.\"Horace drew the sentry's attention. \"We's just coming back from market, sir. Mistress need supplies for baking.\"\"In the middle of the night? I don't think so.\" The man laughed and walked around the wagon to plant the barrel of his musket in Horace's ear. \"You all holding a voodoo ritual?\"Close to vomiting from terror, Camilla felt for her newspaper bag. \"Please, sir, we been delivering—\" The bag was gone. She must have left it on the boat.Think, think, think.She struggled to her feet, and her toe struck one of the barrels already in the wagon before they loaded the otherfour. \"Oh, please, sir, don'tlook in them barrels!\"\"What you got there?\" the man demanded. \"Moonshine?\"Horace again drew fire away from Camilla. \"That against the law, sir.\"The soldier turned. \"It sure is, you black rascal! But I might forget I saw you out after curfew if you let me have it.\"\"Sir, Colonel Abernathy get upset if we let this load go. But we might could find you some more in a couple of days.\"\"Colonel Abernathy, huh? Why didn't you say so?\" The man shouldered his gun and stepped back. \"I'm on duty ever' blasted night this week. You best deliver my load within two days, or I'll have to remember I found two darkies and an idiot running around in the middle of the night. You hear me?\"\"Yes, sir,\" chorused Horace and Willie. Camilla was too relieved to speak. The wagon started up, pitching her on her rear, where she sat hugging the closest barrel and shaking like a blancmange.Virgil was going to be in serious trouble if she didn't find his bag.In the quiet darkness Gabriel Laniere—trained physician, thespian and horse wrangler who presently found himself masquerading as a minister—leaned on the rail of the aft main deck of theMagnolia Princess.It was the only pleasure boat docked among the shrimpers, oyster boats and merchant vessels in the quay of Mobile Bay.

Been nice. Sorry.Lizzie Gilbred sat on her family-room sofa, clicking the cell phone to reread the message from her boyfriend—scratch that, her ex-boyfriend—Jerry, her thumb hovering over the delete button. It had been seven days. Surely the words were burned forever into her brain by now. She saved the message instead, then sighed and tossed the cell to the leather cushion next to her, where she knew she'd just pick it up again in two minutes.She took a hefty sip from her wineglass, leaned her elbow against the sofa back and stared out the window at the snow swirling in the yellow security light over her driveway. The weatherman was calling for three inches of the white stuff to fall again tonight, casting a festive glow on the two-week countdown to Christmas.Blizzard Bill the weatherman's words, not hers. As far as Lizzie was concerned, they could cancel Christmas this year and she wouldn't even notice.She took another sip of her wine, feeling a blink away from jumping out of her skin. She'd returned late from the law offices of Jovavich, Williams, and Brent-wood, Attorneys-at-Law, as was usual for a Wednesday, and fought to stick to routine even though she'd felt anything but normal since receiving Jerry's cold text message goodbye. She'd kicked off her shoes at the door, removed her suit jacket, cranked up the heat, poured herself a glass of her favorite Shiraz, started a fire in the family-room grate, then sat on the rich leather sofa she and Jerry had picked out together. Usually at this point she went through her mail or reviewed the briefs or depositions she'd brought home from the office. Tonight it was a brief she'd had one of the junior attorneys write up for her. But damn if she could make it through a single sentence, much less comprehend the entire ten-page document.She thought about making herself dinner. She hadn't had anything since the bagel with jelly she'd half eaten at the office meeting this morning. But she couldn't seem to drum up the energy to reach for the television remote, much less that required to actually rise from the sofa and go into the kitchen to either heat a frozen dinner or open a can of soup.So she sat staring out at the snow instead, wondering what her ex-boyfriend, Jerry, and his once-estranged wife, Jenny, were doing right then.She groaned and rubbed her forehead.She hadn't thought of Jenny as Jerry's wife in a long time. More specifically, for the past six months—ever since Jerry had left Jenny and appealed for a legal separation. One that had ended with his surprise text message and virtual disappearance from her life a week ago when she'd come home from work after retrieving the missive to find he'd taken everything he'd had at her house, including the waffle maker he'd bought her for her birthday last month.What did he want with a freakin' waffle maker? Had he taken it to Jenny and said the equivalent of,Something for you, honey, to show how serious I am about sharing Sunday-morning waffles for the rest of our lives?Or,See, I even took back every gift I ever bought her.Well, that wasn't entirely true. Because to take back every gift, he'd have had to go back six years, when he and Lizzie were the established couple on the verge of an engagement and Jenny had been the other woman.God, she couldn't believe she'd let him do this to her again. Six years ago, it hadn't been a text message; rather, he'd left a quickly scribbled note on her car windshield, secured by the wiper: \"It's over. Sorry.\" With it had been the announcement of Jenny and his engagement from that day's newspaper.The cell phone chirped. Lizzie scrambled to pick it up, punching a button and answering.\"Hello?\"\"Lizzie?\"She sank against the cushions and pulled the chenille throw up to her neck. Not Jerry.\"Hi, Mom. How are you?\"\"Okay, considering.\"Lizzie made a face. Ever since her parents had announced their impending divorce, the War of the Roses Revisited had begun at the Gilbred house. Both of them, it seemed, were all for the separation. But neither was willing to give up the house. So her father had taken up residence in a downstairs guest room, and her mother went about life as if he wasn't there, up to and including a candlelit dinner with some guy she'd picked up at the country club last month.Her father had had a fit and nearly clunked the guy in the head with one of his golf clubs, which her mother had tossed into the driveway after he'd taken advantage of an unseasonably warm day and gone out for a few rounds, missing an appointment with their divorce attorneys.The clubs had gone completely missing the following day and Lizzie had gotten a call from her father asking her to help him find them since he'd had the set specially made. They'd finally hit pay dirt at a Toledo pawnshop, where they found them with an abominably low price tag…until the new owner figured out that they must be worth more and jacked up the price while her father fumed.But maybe her mother was beginning to come to her senses. Usually she began conversations with whatever outlandish thing her father had done that day. That she was actually quiet and appeared pensive was a positive sign. Wasn't it?\"How about you? How are you doing?\" her mother asked.\"I'mjust sitting in front of the fire with a glass of wine.\"\"That's nice, dear. And Jerry? Is he there with you?\"She had yet to tell her mother that she and Jerry were no longer a couple. In all honesty, she had never told her parents that he was still married, even though he was legally separated at the time.What a tangled web we weave, she thought. \"Yes. Yes, he is,\" she lied.\"Hmm? Oh. Yes. Well, tell him hello for me.\"\"I will.\"Lizzie squinted through the window, making out a shadowy, familiar figure in the falling snow.Gauge.She instantly relaxed against the cushions. Her hot tenant of the past four months was walking up her driveway, toward the garage and the apartment above it that he was renting. She craned her neck to see around a large evergreen in order to follow his movements until he disappeared.The voice at the other end of the line sighed.\"Are you okay?\" she asked her mother. \"You sound… distracted.\"Could it be that Bonnie Gilbred was rethinking her situation? That the reconciliation Lizzie, her sister, Annie, and brother, Jesse, hoped for was just around the corner? Just in time to make Christmas feel somewhat like Christmas again?\"Me? Yes, yes. I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?\"Lizzie nearly dropped the phone when she heard a male roar on her mother's end. She absently rubbed her forehead and closed her eyes, wanting to hang up yet straining to hear her father's words.\"What in the hell did you put in this, Bonnie? Are you trying to kill me, for God's sake? You are, aren't you? Is it arsenic?\"Her mother's voice sounded much too joyful. \"No, it's not arsenic, you old fool. I fixed the meat loaf the same way I always fix it. Your taste buds must not be what they once were.\"\"Don't hand me thatb.s.\" There was a clatter of plates and then her father cussed a blue streak.She heard a door slam.\"Mom?\" Lizzie said.\"Hmm?\"Apparently Bonnie still had the phone to her ear, but wasn't much paying attention to the fact that she was having a conversation with her daughter.\"What did you put in the meat loaf?\" Lizzie asked.\"Salt. Lots of it.\"Lizzie smiled in spite of the exasperation she felt. \"You know Dad's watching his sodium intake.\"\"I know. Why do you think I did it?\"Lizzie rested her head back against the pillow. \"So is there a reason you called? I mean, other than wanting someone to witness your evildoing for the night?\"\"I'm not doing evil. I cooked him meat loaf.\"\"Sure, Mom. Is there anything else?\"She could imagine Bonnie thinking for a moment. \"Nope. I figure that about covers everything.\"\"Good. Oh, and next time you want a buffer between you and Dad, call Annie,\" she said, referring to her younger sister.\"Will do, dear.\"\"Good night, Mother.\"\"Good night, Lizzie.\"She punched the button to disconnect the call and checked for any missed messages. None. So she read Jerry's text message before tossing the phone to the sofa again.God, but she really was a sorry sack, wasn't she?A sound drew her attention back to the driveway. Gauge had reappeared. He was wearing the same hooded sweatshirt and denim jacket he'd had on minutes earlier. She thought maybe he was leaving again. Only he wasn't carrying his guitar case; he was shoveling her walk.She found the action incredibly hot.All thoughts of her mother, Jerry and her missing waffle maker drifted from her mind. Replaced by ones related to the sexy drifter who had taken up residence in her garage apartment in August.His name wasn't really Gauge. Well, his last name was, but his first name was Patrick. Lizzie folded one arm under her chin and took another sip of wine, the alcohol beginning to work its magic by warming her a bit even as she watched Gauge out in the cold.She didn't know much about him. Her brother Jesse's ex-girlfriend, Heidi, had recommended him; Gauge was part owner of the BMC bookstore café downtown where Heidi used to work. He was a musician. A guitar player, if the case he carried and the strumming she'd heard coming from his place when it was warmer were any indication.Their paths rarely crossed. She found his rent—always cash—stuffed into an envelope in her front-door mail slot on the first of the month, and she made sure that any mail that was delivered for him was slid under his door.That was basically it.Well, that and the fact that he was exceedingly hot and she liked watching him come and go, with no particular preference for either, because both front and back views were worthy of a long glance and an even longer sigh.She put her glass back down on the coffee table. Aside from a very brief crush on the drummer that had played at her senior prom, she'd never gone much for the artistic type. Career-oriented, driven guys were more her thing....", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For the Warrior who must find that moral compass that will keep his honor intact, it is a guidebook; for the civilian who wants to know how Warriors see their small bit in the grand play of which they have only a small part, it is a window into their souls. Captain Meszaros has captured the essence of the experience of his fragment of the whole in exact detail. Most of Americans forget how much the present wars impact our citizen soldiers and their families. We also forget how the politics of the world as a whole affect how they do the jobs we ask them to undertake. That is the greatest tragedy of the current political impasse America finds itself in. War is not an easy occupation under any circumstance. Adding a politically correct dimension to the mix and we are asking them to take on a mission profile that is not only more dangerous but in this writers opinion not in the job description of a Warrior. I have nothing but a profound sense of gratitude at the deep commitment with which these part time Warriors dedicate their lives to that impossible task. Interrogation of Morals includes all the above from the bare austere landscape portrayed on the covers to the risk and yes, even the joys inherent in a soldier's life. I found it difficult to put the book down once I started. Captain Meszaros' Interrogation of Morals will stay with you long after you turn the last page. Highly recommended reading in today's media climate. --Review by D. H. Brown, MWSA Reviewer (May 2009)<br /><br />The real story of military intelligence as it is actually practiced in the War on Terror. The author, a reserve intelligence officer, served eight months in Afghanistan, and spent a lot of time outside the wire, getting shot at while collecting information, and terrorists. Here's what a lot of reporters miss, because you really have to live this work in order to describe it accurately. --James F.

Concerned as it is not with narrow matters of piety but with all dimensions of life -- from creation through faith and ethics to the resurrection of the dead &mdash; this book demonstrates the perennial truth and relevance of Martin Luther's historic discovery.\"Carter Lindberg\"Oswald Bayer'sLiving by Faithis a timely address and word of promise to our perennial efforts to justify ourselves and to our double bind of being both 'excuse-making animals' and finding our identities in our achievements. Following Luther, Bayer reminds us that the central subjects of theology are humanity's guilt and condemnation for sin and God the Justifier and Savior of sinners. 'Whatever is asked or discussed in theology outside this subject,' says Luther, 'is error and poison.' With the author of Job as well as with Luther, Bayer understands that the proper issue today, as in all days, is not theodicy but anthropodicy.\"Bernd Wannenwetsch\"Living by Faithis truly a wonderful book. It does not represent just another voice in Lutheran theology; rather, it brings out Luther'sownvoice for today. Conversing with a wide range of philosophical and theological traditions, Oswald Bayer illuminates the liberating power of divine justification in a world full of tribunals and self-justification. Having learned much from the German edition, I am delighted to see this gem -- a rarity in contemporary German theology -- made accessible to English-speaking readers. As a moral theologian, I heartily recommend it.\"Anglican Theological Review\"A fascinating exploration of the topic close to the heart of Lutherans. . .  This book is an excellent introduction to Luther's thought on justification and sanctification, and their place and relationship in today's world. Bayer is stimulating and challenging, making this book well worth the read.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Klatu and his brother and sister have mistakenly crashed their spaceship into the Nevada desert. Hilarious dialogue among the space aliens and the humans they meet follows as Ploo is captured and taken to an army base for study. Klatu and Lek use all the tricks at their disposal to retrieve her, including morphing into human form and chewing English-language gum to communicate with the earthlings. Ploo is rescued by a human girl who proves herself less prejudiced than her adult counterparts. The text is peppered with funny, easily translated alien vocabulary, and the large print and short declarative sentences will be accessible to emerging readers. The book even sneaks in an antismoking message and a short history lesson. Readers will not be able to resist these appealing googly-eyed extraterrestrials with distinct personalities, and the gentle subliminal message that being different is not necessarily bad or scary is welcome. This is a perfect book for those who are beyond easy readers but not yet ready for intermediate fiction.–Quinby Frank, formerly at Green Hedges School, Vienna, VACopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Barnaby is also something of a sleuth, and to absolve a client of her brother’s mysterious murder, he must navigate a motley milieu of aristocrats, servants, police, scholars, and artists. The case ultimately hinges on a chemical mixture for developing photographs; the brew’s side effects include both invisibility and psychological transformations reminiscent of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Stewart and Riddell’s play on the predictable conventions of gothic melodrama will probably go over the heads of young readers, but that will not diminish their enjoyment of the story. Whimsical touches such as the introduction of a protoskateboard by Barnaby’s friend Will Farmer will add to the appeal. Barnaby Grimes fans will enjoy this latest adventure in the series.

Employing his hallmarks keen insight, clear expression, and mentoring wisdom Ron Allen offers postmodern preachers serious (and welcome) help. He depicts dimensions of the postmodern ethos not as pieces of a puzzle to be solved, or ciphers of a code to be cracked, but as facets of a prism with which preachers play a prism continually turned in different directions to catch and refract the colors that dance across the boundless spectrum of Gospel light.\" ---David J. Schlafer, editor ofWhat s the Shape of Narrative Preaching?\"Ron Allen sPreaching and the Othershould be required reading for any preacher who desires to communicate the gospel to today s culture in a manner that is authentic to the gospel itself. With insight, compassion, and wisdom, Ron guides preachers through a cultural landscape that has changed significantly in recent years. In particular, Ron articulates a vision of the gospel that is not just about the other that is, understanding people who are different but also, and especially, for the other. Christ calls us to stand with and for all of God s people, especially those who have been disenfranchised by the world, culture, and all too often the church, andPreaching and the Otherdraws on multiple disciplines to help pastors not only understand this imperative but also to accomplish it for the sake of Christ and the world.\" ---David Lose, Luther Seminary, St. Paul, Minnesota\"Ronald Allen s book turns a critical eye and ear on postmodern notions of the Other and finds treasures and traps for preachers. He mines the wealth of the postmodern movement while exposing challenges for postmodern thinkers who would also be Christian proclaimers. His work is insightful and incisive, cutting through jargon and providing clear examples of his thinking.\" ---Valerie Bridgeman, Memphis Theological Seminary", "related": [], "rank": 1894731, "title": "Preaching and the Other: Studies of Postmodern Insights", "author": "Dr. Ronald Allen", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His violent father's obsession with guns; paranoid fantasies of death, dismemberment, and destruction; and readiness to share details of those fantasies with his young son paved the way for Henry's fearful and angry acting out (yet he does not use them as an excuse). After the boy did a stint in a behavioral-health rehabilitation center, with no explanation of medication protocol upon release, armed robbery seemed inevitable. Reading and questioning the nature of existence in his cell leads Henry to an awakening and awareness of his life and future desires. An epilogue explains that two years later he is married and happy–presumably out of the life that led him to trouble. The abrupt ending is a disappointment, and readers will be left with many questions. Lots of swearing, violent fantasies, and descriptions of sexual experiences make this book most appropriate for older teens. There is certainly a place for memoirs of incarcerated Caucasian  teens, and youth in detention centers (as well as elsewhere) around the country will want to read this book.Amy Cheney, Alameda County Library, Oakland, CA© Copyright 2010.

His historical works include biographies of George Washington, Oliver Goldsmith and Muhammad, and several histories of 15th-century Spain dealing with subjects such as Christopher Columbus, the Moors, and the Alhambra. Irving also served as the U.S. minister to Spain from 1842 to 1846. He made his literary debut in 1802 with a series of observational letters to the Morning Chronicle, written under the pseudonym Jonathan Oldstyle. After moving to England for the family business in 1815, he achieved international fame with the publication of The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. in 1819. He continued to publish regularly—and almost always successfully—throughout his life, and completed a five-volume biography of George Washington just eight months before his death, at age 76, in Tarrytown, New York. Irving, along with James Fenimore Cooper, was among the first American writers to earn acclaim in Europe, and Irving encouraged American authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Edgar Allan Poe. Irving was also admired by some European writers, including Sir Walter Scott, Lord Byron, Thomas Campbell, Francis Jeffrey, and Charles Dickens. As America's first genuine internationally best-selling author, Irving advocated for writing as a legitimate profession, and argued for stronger laws to protect American writers from copyright infringement.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When she sees an absurd performance by \"Mr. Dada,\" she knows she has found her match. However, Mimi must try many Dadaist approaches (sound poems, ready-made art displays, and randomly generated poetry) before the man recognizes her as a kindred spirit. Told in Mimi's voice, this playful story declares that \"art can be anything.\" A dapper cockroach couple provide commentary and explanations, and Mimi's pigeon friend offers wry humor. The cat's quest for Mr. Dada's affection provides the story arc and structure, an important counterpoint to the nonsensical experimentation in the text and the art. Brightly colored mixed-media collage illustrations set the scene. Period news and catalog clippings juxtaposed with zany layouts that scramble art give a feel for how Dada takes the mundane and turns it on its head. Readers are invited to participate: \"Mimi says, Now perform a sound poem./Yes, you./Did I hear a burp?/Thank you-that was a good poem.\" A detailed endnote and suggested reading/listening list encourage future exploration of the Dadaist movement. Like Dadaism itself, this book will probably inspire a wide range of responses from readers, from confusion to disdain to delight. Perfect for art-museum gift shops and art education, and an interesting addition for large general collections.—Heidi Estrin, Feldman Children's Library at Congregation B'nai Israel, Boca Raton, FLCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Illinois pastor Pritchard examines its significance from seven perspectives: what it meant to God, to Jesus, to Satan, to the world, to the church, for human sin and in heaven.

These are both fine topics (with the analysis of Jesus' words making for a more original book), but they are in competition here. Lenten readers may wish to do what Pritchard should have done: divide his careful ruminations into two shorter devotionals, using one this Holy Week and one next year.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Not only is this book a romance story, Ms. Jones has added adventure to the story line. The story flows from one great adventure to the next. Whether it is the hot love scenes or the fierce battle scenes, I found myself wanting to keep the pages turning (scrolling) just to find out what happens next. I recommend reading this story to discover all the adventures that happen when these two meet.

She crafts terrifying\nvisuals and thrilling sequences with brutally short sentences, allowing\nthe natural course of action to take place.IN MISSED CALL-\nWhat this story is huge on is gore, which Doerfler writes beautifully.\nGore-hounds are going to get a kick out of this tasty bit of body\nhorror.IN GAME OVER- It starts with a premise that is, to\nme, a tired cliché of the whole technological-age-meets-horror-stories\nthing. But as I was soon to find out, when Doerfler gets her hands on\nsomething, she really doesn't stop until she completely owns it.Of\nall three stories, I'd have to say that this one is my favorite. It just\n radiates a gothic feel, brimming with darkness, things that go bump in\nthe night, and enough blood-soaked scenes to keep this reader satisfied.\n Doerfler writes like a pro with this one.I have absolutely no trouble seeing her star rise to new heights in this genre.\"- reviewed by Colum McKnight on Dreadful Tales", "related": ["B00GA55824"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His keen understanding of history and legend also illuminates his visits to the island's churches and monasteries, and particularly the ruined palace at Knossos, where the hero Theseus was said to have defeated the \"monstrous Minotaur.\" A reverence for Crete's flora and fauna pervades Unsworth's exacting prose (\"the scrub glows with a soft burnish, flame-colored, forming a landscape almost too beautiful to be quite believed in\"), and he often couples these descriptions with sadness over Crete's invasive, oppressive tourism industry. The people of Crete, Unsworth notes more than once, are \"of great spirit and generous hospitality [but also possess an] implacable vindictiveness,\" often still upholding \"blood feuds\" that originated centuries ago. Despite Unsworth's bouts of melancholy and occasional frustrations, the author's thoughtful journey eventually finds peace and comfort in \"the vitality and warmth of the people and the unfailing charm of the landscape.\"Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Non-technical, but logically rigorous presentations of probability logic, the problem of verisimilitude, and evolutionary epistemology contribute to an accessible text that belongs in any philosophy of science collection.

Sit there at the end of the table, said the round man with cherub cheeks and grey hair. I m Glen Johnson, and you and I are about to become friends.Twenty-one years have passed since that fateful day in October, and there has not been a single day that I have not thanked the good Lord for bringing this gentle man into my life. I am not exactly sure what it was that forged our friendship and the relationship we still enjoy today. I just know I m a better association executive and person because of it.I came to know Glen Johnson as one of the most influential and politically savvy persons on the planet. Over the course of the first ten years as I struggled to learn the ways of Washington he would accompany me and introduce me to Washington s most elite and influential power brokers. He would take me under his wing and mentor me on how to lobby with integrity and purpose, and most importantly, how to win. He would instill in me the importance of never burning a bridge that your most vehement legislative opponent on today s issue might just be your political ally tomorrow.It is my fervent wish for you as you read the pages that follow that it will provide a glimpse into the humility and soul of this great man. A man of humble beginnings, he would rise to the pinnacle of public and private service, never once forgetting and crying out for the little guy. Everyone should be so fortunate to have sat with presidents or some of Wall Street s most powerful moneymen as Glen Johnson has.But you won t hear that from Glen. Everyone has importance and is important to him. He never once forgot about this once young politically naïve boy from Texas.Nor shall I ever forget him.--From the Foreword by Christopher Williston:", "related": [], "rank": 2543355, "title": "A Matter of Trust: Taking a $2 Stock to $140, 000", "author": "Glen Johnson", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A paean to patience? Hardly, maintains Safire, who interprets Job's central lesson to be that we are morally obligated to defy unjust authority and to hold those in power accountable. The New York Times columnist celebrates Malcolm X, Andrei Sakharov and Menachem Begin as dissenters of Joban stature. With mixed success, he draws on the lessons of the biblical tale in order to critique President Bush's failure to topple Saddam Hussein, Bill Clinton's political career and the doings of Pat Buchanan, Richard Nixon, John F. Kennedy and others. Safire movingly portrays Abraham Lincoln as \"our most Joban president,\" one who refused to compromise his principles. His conversationally written gloss sets forth guidelines for how to pursue a \"Joban life\" by refusing to accept injustice from any quarter. An appendix reprints the Book of Job.

But the story of how this Yale-educated midwesterner become one of the nation's first professional foresters and a groundbreaking environmental educator, and developed his commonsensical \"land ethic,\" has not been fully studied until now. Ecologist Newton offers not a biography but, rather, an exacting chronicle of Leopold's intellectual and professional odyssey. Leopold conceived of the land as \"a fountain of energy\" flowing through soil (soil conversation was a primary mission), plants, waterways, animals (Leopold was an avid hunter and the nation's leading wildlife expert), and humans. He knew that to sustain \"land health\" we needed to develop an \"ecological conscience\" and fend off the \"industrial juggernaut.\" Newton's compelling and elucidating close reading of Leopold's keystone works greatly enhances our understanding of his scientific rigor, philosophical valor, and abiding sense of wonder. If only we would take his conservation ethic to heart.Donna SeamanCopyright © American Library Association.

They take all excuses off the table and annihilate them. With diamond-cutter precision, they unveil directly from the mouths and actions of practitioners exactly what raising the bar looks like and how it can be done. --Michael Fullan, author, educational consultant, and special advisor to the Premier and Minister of Education in OntarioRaising the Bar and Closing the Gap is an invaluable addition to the expanding narrative attesting to the educability of all children. The case studies, like a good cookbook, offer many appealing options for building your own system of interventions; your challenge is to find the recipe that suites your taste and prepare it with commitment and care. Our children deserve nothing less. --Lawrence W. Lezotte, CEO of Effective Schools Products, Ltd.For years I have carried Whatever It Takes wherever I go because it shows school leaders in considerable detail what to do if they really want all their students to achieve proficiency not just some. The pyramid of interventions, so clearly described at the elementary-, middle-, and high-school levels in this first book, became the template for schools all over the country to achieve groundbreaking results. But now the authors have added the missing link to bring their vital work to scale.  Raising the Bar and Closing the Gap has all the eloquence and moral commitment of the first book, and all its detail. But now we have a systems approach and a set of guidelines to bring the pyramid to entire school districts and high-functioning PLCs to every building. In the second half of the book, case study after case study provide specific implementation ideas and engaging stories with the unifying thread of using data well combined with strong culture building and determination that all students will succeed.  It is so rare to find a work that combines high moral purpose, a systemic approach, and specific usable ideas. Now that we have this map, everyone must study it and engage it! --Jonathon Saphier, founder and president of Research for Better Teaching, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Though the essay contest seemed like a quixotic gesture at its inception in 2005, it turns out to have been prescient.\" --Publishers Weekly“You are now holding an exceptional book. It is particularly now when the eyes of the whole world are anxiously set on the Middle East that I am so eagerly looking forward to getting to know the stories which often do not make themselves heard among the brouhaha in the media. The essays collected here are a particularly important testimony and close to my heart as they are written by young courageous people who dare to dream of the things their parents never dreamt of. The book clearly demonstrates that no matter where we live or what religion we follow, certain fundamental values are universal.”—Lech Walesa, Nobel Peace Prize recipient, and the former President of Poland\"This is a wonderful book, and a stirring testament to the truth that the desire for freedom and democracy transcends the boundaries of nationalities, religion, ethnicity, race and gender.\"--Azar Nafisi, author ofReading Lolita in Tehran \"For too long, American readers have looked to unreliable intermediaries to learn what's on the minds of the Arab youth.

This collection of powerful testimonies is gripping, heart-breaking, and inspiring, offering the only antidote to the abyss of a society lacking rule of law: educated hope. These pages reveal that the struggle for civil rights in the Middle East is still ongoing--and will require allies the world over who recognize the universality of the struggle for human rights and the responsibility borne by those of us living in freedom.” –Thor Halvorssen, President, Human Rights Foundation \"Arab Spring Dreamsoffers a compelling journey through the hearts, minds and souls of the generation that rocked the world’s most repressive region. A first-hand account of the struggle for democracy in the Middle East, and a terrific roller coaster of burning frustrations and passionate aspirations. Buckle up!\"--Ahmed Benchemsi, Stanford University Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law \"Sohrab Ahmari and Nasser Weddady have assembled a chorus of new voices from across the Arab and Iranian Middle East, and all of the voices are young, and all of them are plaintive. Not everyone among the contributors to this anthology sees things the same way, but everyone is filled with yearning for a better future, and the yearning is touching. Will the better future come about? One thing is certain: a better future for the Middle East and for the larger world will come about only if people from different corners of the world do a better job of speaking to one another. Arab Spring Dreams contributes to that noble cause. And Ahmari and Weddady are writers to watch.\"--Paul Berman, author ofTerror and Liberalismand The Flight of the Intellectuals\"This book is the essential portrait of a generation, an intimate explanation of the forces and frustrations that are shaping the Middle East.

The first issue was a surprisingly strong single story, but the overall premise still seemed to be a touch fanciful and somewhat lackluster - an odd-ball circus that would wander about without rhyme or reason solely for the purpose of being ephemeral catalysts for others' tales? Eh. But then came issue #2; and instantly I was sold.The backstory for the Clown Jexter is told, and it is a marvelously inventive, original, and cohesive origin - three descriptive adjectives I'd feared I wouldn't be able to use for the series. With this sequence the entire epic premise comes into view like the bottom of a stilled-water lake on a cloudless day, and the excitement it garnered, for me, was second to none. A host of new characters within the Carnival are introduced and the series at last revealed its true purpose:one character's story will be told each issue, with a greater, epic arc building within and around each one, until the entire series comes together to form one massive, intricately laced tapestry.\"David Baxter - Broken Frontier", "related": ["B002P8MQ9S"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The latest one comes about when he and his class are summoned to help out on an archaeological dig. There they uncover bones that are not decayed or fossilized but, instead, seem rather recent. What should have been a simple expedition turns into a murder investigation, and Maxwell finds himself meeting a boatload of strange, creepy characters along the way. Maxwell makes a fine sleuth with his own sort of charm--witty, snide, daring, and utterly likable.Mary Frances WilkensCopyright © American Library Association.

Crimes, actually, threats against the members of the planning committee, followed by murders. A suspect emerges early on, even before the murder, but, as DCI Lambert and DS Hook know all too well, what seems to be obvious and true often is not. Unlike Isaac Asimov's Murder at the ABA (1976), which was set at an American booksellers' convention, this novel uses the literary festival merely as a way to get the story going. This isn't a criticism, just a heads-up to fans of literary themed mysteries that this isn't really one of those. But it is a good old-fashioned mystery, with plenty of suspense, twists and turns, and abundantly real characters.

His second book and first dramatic work, Revenge or Love, brings together in a classic and elegant style the timelessly appealing voices of mysticism, philosophy, and esotericism to the modern stage, and to the modern reader who looks to contemporary literature for taste, and meaning. The author's own testimony, How Christ Delivered Me From A Blood Covenant, is convincingly illustrative of how darkness crossed his path, and how he triumphed through faith in God and Christ. Mr. Karnwie is currently completing his fourth book and second dramatic work, Fall of Satan: The Beginning. The playwright is an ardent advocate of world peace and is championing a cause to build monuments called 'Peace Squares' in all countries whose citizens have made the ultimate sacrifice on Peacekeeping and Humanitarian Missions around the world. Mr. Karnwie loves listening to classical music, watching documentaries on ancient cultures, basking in the glories of nature, and writing on themes that verge on theology, philosophy, mysticism, and esotericism. Mr. Karnwie completed a Diploma program in Accounting and Automated Office Systems at the Interactive College of Technology in Chamblee, Georgia, United States, in 2006.The poet and playwright lives happily with his family in the beautiful valley city of Roanoke, Virginia, United States.", "related": ["B00CP7SKB2"], "rank": 2045765, "title": "How Christ Delivered Me From A Blood Covenant", "author": "Julius Gunser Karnwie", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lyman Bracks\nreacts the way I would have under his circumstances, with reason and some\nreluctance, that's true, but with determination. Lyman is a universal geek that\nthrough adversity turns cool, and every geek wants that.\"Lachelle Miller; \"We took a good look at the vampire media, and decided it\nhad travelled too far from the backwoods terror that filled 'Dracula' and the\nolder stories. We didn't want to write about 'beautiful people'; shiny,\nglittery, fashion models that bore no resemblance to the terrifying vampires of\nlegend. So we decided to take the vampire world in another direction; one of\nlust, anger, moral decay and self-preservation. In those sentiments, vampire\nMandy Cross was born. \"Ian Hall; When I touted the series to vampire fans as \"don't worry our\nvampires don't glitter\", I was amazed at the wave of vehement dislike of\nthe current trend, despite the huge fan-base. I'm not sure that vampire fans\nlike the new trend, they just follow because there's nothing gritty out\nthere.\"Vampire High School. Book 2: The Helsing Diaries.This was a wonderful book to write. Its character complexities were schizimed\nfurther by Lyman's recovery from certain death at the end of Book 1. Poor guy;\nhe's now not only got the girl conflict in his life, he has the uncertainty of\nnot knowing if he's a vampire or a vampire hunter; or both!Throw in an old diary, more sexual frustration, and a brand new adversary, Amos\nBlanche, and you'd think the guys had enough to deal with.No. They have to battle against a Helsing leader who won't believe their story,\nand are forced underground to complete the mission.Not an easy task when your girlfriend is the daughter of the aforementioned\nHelsing leader!Lyman Bracks is torn apart in his quest for loyalty; not only to his destiny,\nbut also to the girl he loves.Mandy Cross is a vampire, fighting her own kind, but constantly having to prove\nboth her loyalty and resolve.Mary-Christine Muscat is the poor girlfriend, torn between boyfriend and\nfather. Both despising vampires yet forced to work with one; and a pretty one\nat that.All in all, it's a rollicking adventure that doesn't end until the very last\nline.Books 1, 2 and 3 are now available on eBooks everywhere, and very roughly\nconstitute the \"Alan McCartney Trilogy\".We both hope you enjoy.Ian Hall and Lachelle Miller.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

On a visit to her childhood friend in Corfu, she is overwhelmed with dark memories of a grisly murder while she fights to retain her inheritance and make peace with her estranged father and half brother. Troubled by eerily prescient dreams often portending pain and death, she is alternately perceptive and self-absorbed, desperately craving the respect and affection of her family while resisting the allure of her late husband's best friend, Harry, who has been quietly supportive for years and would love to claim her publicly as his own. Townsend's English romantic suspense is reminiscent in many ways of Mary Stewart's early works, and should entertain admirers of this style.Lynne WelchCopyright © American Library Association.

The son of wealthy parents (both are barristers), he is the drop-dead handsome captain of the soccer team, an outstanding student, and one of the most popular boys in his class. He seemingly has it all. But he also has a closely guarded secret that only his family knows. He is intersex (the new clinical term for hermaphrodite). He is literally half male and half female. Max is comfortable with his circumstance, though, until something unthinkable happens, and his and his family’s lives begin to unravel; for the first time, Max begins to regard himself as freakish. “I feel like for years my family has been pretending I’m normal,” he thinks bitterly, “and I’m really not.” Told from six different viewpoints—those of Max, both of his parents, his younger brother, his girlfriend, and his doctor—the novel is a dramatic, thoroughgoing investigation of the complexities of sexuality and gender. Never overly clinical, this is not a case study, but rather, at its heart, a warmly human coming-of-age story, thanks to the fact that Max is such an appealing character. And so his desperate search for identity is gripping, emotionally engaging, and genuinely unforgettable, as, indeed, is this accomplished first novel. --Michael Cart", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The examples are specific enough to be helpful but also broad enough to allow for flexibility when accommodating individual student difference. School counselors will find this a useful resource as they develop counseling intervention plans as well as when they serve as a consultant to parents and teachers.\"(Amy Milsom, Associate Professor, Counseling 2010-08-25)This book provides a solid foundation of information on mental health disorders and their potential impact on student success.

I just completed an LGBT paranormal novel calledBrush\nwith Catastrophe.It's the sequel to the very popular paranormal novel,Spell\nCat. Both books are about witches--very contemporary witches who live\nin New York City and go to college there. One of the key characters in both\nbooks is a black cat named Aloysius. In fact, the series is called The Aloysius\nTales. Black cats have been\nconnected with witches from the time of the middle ages and before. Black cats\nhave so many myths and legends associated with them it could fill books. It's\nlucky to dream of one but unlucky to have one cross your path. If a black cat lies\non the bed of a sick person they will die, but a strange black cat found on the\nporch brings prosperity. It was largely in the Middle Ages that the black cat became\nassociated with evil. Because cats are nocturnal and roam at night, they were\nbelieved to be supernatural servants of witches, or even witches themselves. InBrush with Catastrophe, my black cat\nis indeed a witches' familiar. His name is Aloysius and he is very powerful but\ncan only use that power to magnify the power of the witch to whom he is bound.\nAloysius is the familiar of  Killian\nBarth, the most powerful male witch in ten generations and the Witch Master,\nbut early in our story he attaches himself to Sammy Raphael, a young witch with\nnp perceptible power except prophetic painting. Occasionally, he paints\nsomething in the middle of the night and what he paints comes true. But his\npaintings always seem to be insignificant -- until he paints a picture of a beautiful\nman and it turns out to be his best freind Ryder whom Sammy has secretly loved\nfor years. Ryder, however, has changed so much over the summer vacation that\nhe's almost unrecognizable. And yet, he's human, not a witch. And then Sammy\npaints an angel--who turns out to be a witch and a student at Sammy's college.\nBut that angel may just be a devil! And Sammy could end up having to save a lot\nof the people he loves from that devil! Aloysius always backs a winner. Why is\nhe backing Sammy?I loved writing this book. Because it's\ncontemporary I got to maintain the laws of the natural world and then allow my\nwitches to violate them a bit. It was fun to ask what the world would be like\nif there were witches that appeared to be mere humans but with more power.

And worship, which ascribes worth to God, becomes narrative-based: it tells the story of God, celebrates God's work past and present, in order to enable Christians to live in hope as players in God's story. --Alan Kreider and Eleanor Kreider", "related": [], "rank": 847348, "title": "Worship and Mission After Christendom", "author": "Alan Kreider", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Then, with the fragments of these smashed idols and their own bare hands, they built pioneering stand-up clubs The Comedy Store and The Comedy Strip.

I became the sole custodial parent of my son when he was just two years old. We did a lot of reading together, well I read and he followed along. If he liked the book he always wanted me to read the same book over and over again. I must have read all the children's books I could find in the library, most of which were long and droll.After a time Kyle became bored with the same books, so one day I made up a story. Kyle laughed very much and wanted to here it again and again. Well I had a hard time remembering exactly what I said, so I started writing down the stories I told him. After I perfected my stories, I thought I was done. However, I was just beginning. Kyle loved my stories very much, but one day he asked me to make pictures so he can see what the characters look like. I told him I haven't drawn anything for a long time and wasn't sure if I could. He asked me to please just try. So I did. Before I knew it I had completed many different children's picture books. Kyle loved my books so much he wanted them in the library so other kids can laugh too. So time went on and Kyle wanted to share my books with his friends and classmates. I lent my books to his elementary school and all the kids loved them and wanted more. They too wanted my book's available. I was asked to read my books for Kyle's class, which I did. All the kids wanted my autograph, which I gave them. It was pretty fun so I decided that, that many children couldn't be wrong. Now here I am with the first of my books published (The Picklepuss Man). This book was chosen first by all the children that I shared my books with. Many more are to follow. All my books I have created were with the eyes of a child and the mind of a parent. As parents know, when you read to kids, you usually have to read the same book over and over again. I kept that in my mind. I tried to keep my books short, entertaining, funny, easy to read and with some kind", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It starts with him committing a $353 million scam. A 24\nyear old PR assistant, Heather Bancroft, is one of the people caught\n up in an elaborate scam. She starts to receive strange emails\npredicting the outcomes of things she can bet on, and once these\npredictions come true she starts to bet even more money so she can save\nher mother's house from foreclosure. These bets take her around the\nworld to Japan and dealing with the Yakuza, Kyrgyztan for a sports\nevents (where she meets the love of her life Gareth, but she is already\nengaged to David) and then onto Istanbul to invest in stocks. She gets\ngreedy and loses it all and ends up in debt owing money to dangerous\nloan sharks.

To commemorate the centennial of that great novel, Carol Margaret Davison has brought together this collection of essays by some of the world's leading scholars. The essays analyze Stoker's original novel and celebrate its legacy in popular culture. The continuing presence of Dracula and vampire fiction and films provides proof that, as Davison writes, Dracula is \"alive and sucking.\"\"Dracula is a Gothic mandala, a vast design in which multiple reflections of the elements of the genre are configured in elegant sets of symmetries. It is also a sort of lens, bringing focus and compression to diverse Gothic motifs, including not only vampirism but madness, the night, spoiled innocence, disorder in nature, sacrilege, cannibalism, necrophilia, psychic projection, the succubus, the incubus, the ruin, and the tomb. Gathering up and unifying all that came before it, and casting its great shadow over all that came and continues to come after, its influence on twentieth-century Gothic fiction and film is unique and irresistible.\"-from the Preface by Patrick McGrath\"A notable collection...

He spent the remainder of his life writing about his experiences and how human beings can come to a deeper awareness of the divine. Swedenborg's ideas have influenced people as diverse as Helen Keller, Johnny Appleseed, William Blake, Henry James, Ralph Waldo Emerson, D.T. Suzuki, Jorge Luis Borges, and Dr. Mehmet Oz. The continuing appeal of his thought undoubtedly lies in his insights into the afterlife, concepts of divine love, and focus on personal and social development.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I just wanted to share my reasons for writing this particular story. I was talking to my husband one night about story ideas, and we hit upon the question what would happen if a wealthy young woman fell in love with a blue collar, working-class man - like a police officer. It's a concept that I've always been interested in because we hear all these studies about how men desire to be the bread winner and how they feel intimidated if a woman makes more money than they do. Plus, I kept reading romances where the hero was always this wealthy, corporate tycoon and the heroine is the one who comes from nothing, and I just wanted to switch that up a little. So, the Pierced Trilogy is sort of my stab at that underused dynamic.

Classes to become an EMT followed, and then 2 more years of training to be a volunteer paramedic. All of this was accomplished while operating a hardware business with my wife. She also had to put up with the hours of firefighting and ambulance runs, day and night. As a paramedic going to nursing school, the challenge to balance my career in the emergency department and my life with my family was a constant struggle. Encouragement from my family plus the help of understanding co-workers allowed me to progress in the skills and demands of nursing. Attending classes while working nights and weekends was not easy, but in the end it was worthwhile. The ability to make a difference in a person’s life was gratifying, each and every time, even in some of the worst cases recorded here. I took pride in the skills and accomplishments made, and even more pride in the lives I saved directly or indirectly. Now retired, I realize there had been just enough excitement in the ER to last a lifetime. When my editor finished each chapter, I would read it as a new passage and enjoy the way it was presented in the third person. This was my choice, because it was not only me but a whole family of co-workers who made everything happen. These included fellow nurses, doctors, technicians, secretaries, auxiliary staff, and the housekeeping staff, all doing their part. It is my hope that after reading this book, the reader will have a much more balanced view of what actually goes on behind the closed doors of any emergency room", "related": ["B00JNK5PTO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Eleven year-old Bernice Givens has two major aspirations: to become a Freedom Fighter and to work as a journalist. Growing up within the rigid strictures of a segregated society (in an achingly poignant scene, the first word she learns to read is \"colored\" so that she will not accidentally offend), Bernice longs to be a part of the struggle for equality.She avidly follows news of the civil rights movement and maintains a scrapbook of major events, believing that actual action is still years away for her. So when news breaks of the planned children's march, Bernice is thrilled by the opportunity despite her mother's apprehension and ultimate prohibition. Bernice goes anyway, never suspecting that her participation will have consequences that will change and haunt her, though she ultimately emerges stronger from the experience.Debut author Gaile offers pacing that is slow enough to allow nuances to develop but swift enough to maintain reader interest. She has an ear for genuine-sounding dialogue and interactions, and is masterful at exploring emotional complexities at the appropriate developmental level; her descriptions of Bernice's parents and their ambivalence about their daughter's activism are particularly authentic and resonant.Bernice herself is about as appealing a heroine as one could hope for, a believable blend of childish naïveté and sophisticated ideology. Most of the supporting characters are also convincingly portrayed, though a few are disappointingly one-dimensional, even considering their minor roles. The narrative is straightforward and focused solely on the main plot; this can feel a bit heavy-handed at times but is overall fitting for the length of the book.There are few surprises for those readers with a basic familiarity of the civil rights movement, but this work is a suitable introduction for those without that familiarity. And, with the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington just past, this book could not be more timely and relevant. A moving, triumphant novel encapsulating a young girl's personal struggle for equality within the larger movement.-- Kirkus Reviews", "related": [], "rank": 4544756, "title": "Fearless Freedom", "author": "Corinne Gaile", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Focusing on FDR’s diplomacy of 1940–41, it features the president’s penchant for relying on personal representatives, who bypassed the Department of State and reported directly to FDR. In this case, their task was to see if Britain in 1940 and the Soviet Union in 1941 could withstand German attack and would, therefore, be worth supporting. After biographical summaries of five envoys—Sumner Welles, William Donovan, Harry Hopkins, Wendell Willkie, and Averill Harriman—Fullilove propels them on their missions to London and Moscow, dwelling almost as much on the details of airplanes, ships, and office decor as on the substance of their talks with Churchill and Stalin. In passing, Fullilove alludes to America’s isolationist sentiment (see Those Angry Days, by Lynne Olson, 2013), which induced FDR to use indirection, as in the deployment of these unofficial emissaries, to lead America toward intervention in the war. With his focus on personalities, Fullilove will hook readers interested in the leading figures of WWII diplomacy. --Gilbert Taylor", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Deanne Rowe A well written romance with a heart wrenching plot, a song with lyrics which touch your soul; nothing is more powerful.  The only way it would be is if you were on a warm sunny beach with white sand and blue water as far as you could see.  I have always loved the power of words.  How they could make me cry, laugh, or provoke all range of emotions.  I wouldn’t be who I am without words.  I learned to feel good listening to songs which filled my heart.  I learned the meaning of love watching all the good romance movies.  Of course, there was sex scattered through the pages of the paperbacks I hid from my parents.  Words have always been my friend, my comfort, my teacher.  It was only logical I would grow up and want to be an author, to spin a tale which would captivate readers.  My life’s journey has taken me in this direction and I can only hope I don’t disappoint those who choose to follow.

Growing up, I spent as much of my time with books as I could.  I still love that  first smell of a book as you open its pages and the wonderful feel of it in your hands. Like most writers, my house is filled with books I’ve read countless times.  I could open my own library! I collect little yellow rubber ducks and stilettos of all kinds and have them sitting on every available space in my office.  They tend to show up in a lot  of my novels as does my micro-mini teacup Chihuahua named “Mouse”.  Believe me though, she’s no mouse.  I should have named her “Killer” instead! I write hot, sexy, sizzling romances where the hero is just what my heroine needs.  He’s strong and confident with broad shoulders, six-pack abs and a pleasure trail that just won’t quit.  His face is more rugged than handsome but he has a heart of gold hidden underneath all his protective armor.

I have the best family man could hope for. Two sisters, Olga and Irene, and a brother, Mark, who I have been very blessed to share my life with. My parents, Macario and Naomi, are just that, my parent’s, who have a love for me just like Jesus, which surpasses all of mans understanding. I lived a great life growing up in their modest home. My parents love was everywhere in our home. You could see it in their eyes and hear it in their voice by the words they spoke to us with. Words they still continue to use to this day. I thank Jesus for blessing me, here on this earth, for the both of them.  I was a man making my way in this world when circumstances beyond my control brought me back home at the age of 45 years old. I left everything behind me in Texas to move to Colorado, it was a very hard decision to make. This would be the first time I would be away from Gods gifts to me, my children.
