The quintessential Jewish Princess with a job in name only in her father's advertising agency, she lunches and shops more than works, but deep down she is unhappy with her lack of real involvement. When her father suffers a heart attack and turns his business over to a hated rival who actually expects her to work for her paycheck, Shelly is transformed. Assigned to low-end accounts like a tire store and Falafel Shack, instead of having a tantrum, she channels her anger, comes to work on time, and puts in a creative effort with profitable results. There are a few bumps along the way, but as she improves her life, she helps bring meaning to her sister's life, too, and romance to her best friend. A bit predictable and slightly oversexed, this will nonetheless provide lightweight fun for Wax's fans and other chick-lit and hip romance enthusiasts.Danise HooverCopyright © American Library Association.

Why do I mainly present the mainstream science and not the anti-mainstream science? Because I battled to find any real science opposing the mainstream. By this I mean verifiable, evidence-based alternatives that explain reality at least as well - let alone better than - the mainstream. Almost all attacks on the mainstream rely on bluster, taking things out of context, implying improper motives on the part of scientists and bogus debating tactics like appeal to authority (a famous professor said this so it must be true). With no hint of irony, many of the people using these tactics accuse the mainstream of them.Much of the attack on mainstream science is political since there really is no serious alternative. The nearest there is is Richard Lindzen at MIT, but his theories have comprehensively failed the test of measurement against reality. The only other serious group of scientists attempting to counter the mainstream are at the University of Alabama at Huntsville. For a while their satellite-based temperature trend was significantly below every other published data set (in terms of rate of increase) but with correction of errors, that is no longer the case.My aim in writing this book was initially to see if there was any merit in the anti-mainstream position. I couldn't find any, so I shifted focus to explaining the mainstream. If the anti-mainstream comes across mainly as emotional, that reflects the reality that I found.In a complex scientific field, there are many areas of doubt and uncertainty. Climate science is no different. We use technology on a daily basis that is based on the same scientific principles (e.g., a GPS system). Amplifying doubt and uncertainty to cause inaction is a political attack on the transfer of science to policy, and does not undermine the science. We've seen the same thing with attacks on the link between tobacco and cancer, the ozone hole and the science of HIV.If you really want to understand the science in all its complexity, you need a science textbook, not a novel. I recommendRaymond T. Pierrehumbert'sPrinciples of Planetary Climate. You need a fair amount of calculus to understand it. The key thing you learn from it is that the modern science of climate is well founded on basic sciences, and the uncertainties are no greater than any application of a range of sciences to a complex real-world problem.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Furthermore this science is presented in a sauce of philosophy, history, literature, gastronomy and imagination from an entertaining personality who needs several alter egos to show all the different ways he can think about his subject. Among the cartoons and drawings are the few lines of optional mathematics which are included for those who like that approach.\" Prof. Charles W. Misner, Co-author of Gravitation by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler \"The unusual format and whimsical style of \"Einstein's Enigma\" should not obscure the fact that this is a serious book,which aims to get across the essentials of the theory of general relativity and some related topics to a readership which is not assumed to be fluent in advanced mathematics. I believe the author, who has a long experience in presenting this kind of material to non-specialist audiences, has succeeded in the task he has set himself; the book will amply repay sustained and diligent reading by even a totally unmathematical reader.\" Prof. Anthony J. Leggett, Nobel Laureate in Physics, 2003 From the reviews: \"The only thing this intoxicating is Salman Rushdie's Haroun and the Sea of Stories.\"  Dr. Richard Isaacson, former Program Director for Gravitational Physics, Physics Division, National Science Foundation, USA. \"...an innovative way of trying to explain some of the most complicated concepts in physics to beginners and it contains one of the best accounts I've ever read of the (almost Damscene) conversion of a newcomer to the pleasure of a night's observing.  As Nietzsche said: 'What would be the joy of a star but for those who behold it?'\" David Reid, BBC Sky at Night, April 2007 \"Vishveshwara’s is among the more successful presentations of a most sophisticated, important, and beautiful theory of 20th-century physics--Einstein’s general relativity and its most fascinating corollary, the existence of black holes. … A book to inform, enrich, and entertain every science-educated reader. Summing Up: Highly recommended. Lower-division undergraduates through professionals.\" (V. V. Raman, CHOICE, Vol. 44 (11), July, 2007) \"The author is a major specialist in the field of relatvity, astrophysics and gravitation, and is currently working in Bangalore, India. ... According to me, this book deserves a very large audience: it is very different from all the popular science books written on the subject and as such will be appreciated even by the non-physicists. The physicists will probably learn new things, while the specialists in astrophysics and gravitation will certainly enjoy this new and fresh insight in their field.\" (Fabrice Louche, Physicalia Magazine, Vol. 29 (4), 2007) \"The author blends fiction, fantasy, physics and philosophy to tell the story of gravitation theory...and the astrophysics of black holes.

[Cunningham] deals with events that cannot be discussed in China today. The media censorship is so strong that students have little idea of what their counterparts did 20 years ago. But more than a million Beijingers had publicly supported the students, and memories must linger in the minds of many, not only in the capital but throughout the country. (The Wall Street Journal)In offering a candid view of the student leadership based on his interviews and interactions with the protestors, Cunningham's account reveals the dissent and factionalism within the student ranks. A welcome addition to our understanding of a convoluted and perplexing historical black mark that media and scholarly pundits have only begun to unravel after nearly two decades of silence, this book will be appreciated by both interested general readers and scholars. (Library Journal)There is great attention to detail, recounting Cunningham's student life, simple pleasures in a developing country with strict government controls. One highlight ofTiananmen Moonis a fascinating interview with protest leader Chai Ling. Like Cunningham himself, the reader begins as an outsider to the movement and gets drawn further and further in, first out of curiosity and then a sense of solidarity. The author—friends with students and other liberal Chinese, and fluent in Chinese—gets as far inside perhaps as a Western eye can get. His account, accessible and readable, is a foreign perspective—perhaps being partially outside the frame helps to see the greater picture at times, to ask the right questions—but one with an insider's fondness for and grasp of China's idiosyncrasies. It is deeply personal and the reader invests much in the outcome, a tribute to Cunningham's highly convincing and moving recounting of events. This is a ground-level view of the struggle, not just ring-side but inside. (Ezra ErkerBangkok Post)A superior—and often brilliant—writer. . . . [Cunningham] presents richly drawn characters and dramatic threads that pull us in like a novel, while providing remarkable yet organic insights. InTiananmen Moon, Cunningham's high points—which are many—are equal to the best of any nonfiction author writing today. The book is not just a well-wrought story, though; it is a seamless blend of memoir and history, past and present, narrative and reflection, gemlike description and unadorned information. . . .Tiananmen Moonprovides the . . . steady, reflective, nuanced eye of someone who knows China and is not afraid to let the truth fall where it may. (Asia Times Online)Philip Cunningham wrote his journal-like book with such honesty and power of observation that he captured my imagination.Tiananmen Moonis a fascinating look not so much at a series of events, but at the incomprehensible nation of China itself. Like Philip Cunningham, we'll never be able to fully understand it, butTiananmen Moonis a good place to start. (The Internet Review Of Books)Offers fascinating detail of the events and glorious description. . . .Tiananmen Moonis a valuable addition to the literature of that Beijing Spring.(Pacific Affairs)[A] splendid firsthand account that anyone interested in modern China should read. Cunningham evokes powerfully the smells, sounds, and shifting mood on the streets, making the reader feel like one is there alongside him as he tries to figure out what is going on, where the protests are heading, and how the peaceful movement morphs into bloodshed. . . . This memoir serves as a moving tribute to all those young Chinese who risked so much to better their world. . . . In finally publishing this animated chronicle, he challenges two decades of organized forgetting and revisionism concerning what happened and what was at stake in 1989.(Japan Times)Philip J Cunningham’s experiences, as portrayed inTiananmen Moon: Inside the Chinese Student Uprising of 1989, provide another perspective to approach 4 June: memories as related by ordinary people who participated in the uprising. His vantage point, then as a foreign student, makes his observation unique and invaluable. . . . As one of the participants in the 1989 uprising, I believe that ordinary people who participated—intellectuals, merchants, workers, farmers, and even the military—played a very important role. . . . In fact, the real force that drove students at that time to uphold their courage and enthusiasm, to steer the movement to a new stage, came from vast popular support . . . which is so clearly portrayed in Cunningham’s book. This is why Cunningham’s observations are invaluable. What he provides us with is a personal account, partly as insider and partly as outsider. He tries to give readers a picture of different reactions from different levels of society about the movement and what ordinary people felt during that time. He has succeeded admirably.(Dan Wang, Taiwan National Tsing Hua UniversityChina Information)An exciting window on China and the Chinese; an important story and a valuable contribution to contemporary Chinese history. (Bill Kovach, founder of the Committee of Concerned Journalists)There is no American more qualified to write about China today than Philip Cunningham. He speaks and reads Chinese, his descriptive writing evokes a clear sense of place and time. He was one of the marchers back in 1989 during the student movement and crackdown at Tiananmen Square. His book, written with the dual perspective of a participant in the movement and as a freelancer working with the international press, is the first and last word on that historic and horrific moment in the rise of modern China.

His is probably not, on the other hand, the voice to bring the \"Big Red colt's\" legend alive for casual readers. Capps's thralldom to Secretariat started two generations back in Meadow Stable's bloodlines, with Secretariat's sire, Bold Ruler and his sire, Nasrullah. Secretariat is always physically present, but the successive trainers and stable managers and jockeys in this legend are only racing diary entries. Capps (Spectacular Bid, also in this series of \"Thoroughbred Legends\") re-creates some of Secretariat's best races (including a record-breaking under-two minute Derby run). He lays on the kind of statistical detail, stable gossip and racetrack argot that fans love, borrowing text excerpts from every major racing journal, and a corny horseman's poems. His best moment of exposition comes after the 1973 Triple Crown Belmont run: \"They were cheering the most incredible two-and-half minutes in American racing history.... Secretariat was no longer a rarity among thoroughbreds. He was singular.\" The casual monotone of most of Capps's account stems from not solving the \"replay problem\" inherent in any sports drama. Despite Capps's digressions into thoroughbred culture, including the origins of the Triple Crown, he does offer a detailed history on Secretariat-including 16 handsome pages of photographs.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I\n want to touch your most sexual organ: your brain. What you do with your\n other sexual organs is of course your own affair.I am a kind\nperson, so I will not brutalize your mind from the very beginning.\nThe first four, five chapters are relatively mild. Gradually however,\nthe mood will darken and at a certain point events will take a sharp,\nnasty turn. You will need a strong stomach.The story is set in a\n slightly alternative reality. Most of it you will recognize but a few\nthings are different and those I have to explain at some length. Bear\nwith me. Of course, feel free, if you must, to scan the chapters for\nsmuttiness.

I knew there was a possibility the stories\nmight not sell, but in typicalBaby\nBoomerrebellious fashion, I refused to make the characters\nyounger, because of how strongly I felt.Why did I do this? Because my youngest child is\ntwenty-six, not sixteen. Because I've had two, yes two, long term relationships\nwhere I continue to happily express my sexuality. I personally know people of\nmany ages who are still falling in love as if they were seventeen and new at\nit. Being older just means you just get to the really profound sex part\nquicker, and there's so much less fumbling in the dark. Thank heavens for\nexperience.MyNever Too\nLateseries characters are older, successful, mostly stable, and yet on the\nbrink of starting over. Things have happened to them that color their judgments\nabout life. They often hate getting older. Cancer has taken a loved one. Their\njobs have ended. Still life goes on somehow. Good thing too, or we would all be\nin a lot of trouble in this world. I don't dwell on how they handle the trauma.\nI just show that they survive, and later thrive by finding happiness despite\ntheir setbacks.

The question was, whether there was any foundation of truth in the story; the statement challenged him to say that there was.  The letters seemed to show that a large proportion of readers prefer their dose of fiction with a sweetening of fact.  This is written to furnish that condiment, and to answer the question and the statement.” “In the dog world, the original of the bull-terrier in the story is known as Edgewood Cold Steel and to his intimates as “Kid.” His father was Lord Minto, a thoroughbred bull terrier, well known in Canada, but the story of Kid’s life is that his mother was a black-and-tan named Vic.  She was a lady of doubtful pedigree.  Among her offspring by Lord Minto, so I have been often informed by many Canadian dog-fanciers, breeders, and exhibitors, was the only white puppy, Kid, in a litter of black-and–tans.  He made his first appearance in the show world in 1900 in Toronto, where, under the judging of Mr. Charles H. Mason, he was easily first.  During that year, when he came to our kennels, and in the two years following, he carried off many blue ribbons and cups at nearly every first-class show in the country.  The other dog, “Jimmy Jocks,” who in the book was his friend and mentor, was in real life his friend and companion, Woodcote Jumbo, or “Jaggers,” an aristocratic son of a long line of English champions.  He has gone to that place where some day all good dogs must go.” “In this autobiography I have tried to describe Kid as he really is – a winner of hearts.”Richard Harding Davis", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Issues surrounding illness are often tough to address to a young crowd. However, this book gives insight into how an illness may appear to a young child as well as concerns they may have. Whether you are helping a child cope with a medical situation, or just looking for a great book to read to your children - this is defiantly a good buy! I believe it should be in every pediatricians office as well as hospitals! In addition, the illustrations in the book (as well as the rest of the \"Annie Mouse series\") are unique and interesting to readers. --Amazon Kindle edition", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Should Christians submit to one another? What about husbands and wives?As Christ Submits to the Churchoffers a fresh look at the ethics of submission, gender roles, and servant leadership in the New Testament. Through his careful interpretation of Paul's letters and broader New Testament teaching, theologian Alan Padgett shows how Christ's submission to the church models an appropriate understanding of gender roles and servant leadership. As Christ submits to the church, so all Christians must submit to, serve, and care for one another. Padgett articulates a creative approach to mutual submission and explores its practical outworking in the church today, providing biblical and ethical affirmation for equality in leadership.\"Exploring critical questions regarding biblical interpretation,As Christ Submits to the Churchoffers a thoroughly Christian understanding of submission and service within marriage and the church. Alan Padgett opens much sky over the heads of those engaged in the evangelical conversation on gender and authority. This book is well worth our time and attention.\"--Mimi Haddad, president, Christians for Biblical Equality, www.cbeinternational.org\"As Christ Submits to the Churchis an insightful, compelling, and much-needed work, not only on the specific issue of women in leadership but also on the distinctive nature of Christian leadership in general. Combining theological and exegetical skills, Padgett has given us a scholarly yet broadly accessible book that moves us beyond some of the impasses the discussion on this hot topic has been bogged down in. Regardless of one's stance on the women-and-leadership issue,As Christ Submits to the Churchis a must-read for all who care about Christlike leadership.\"--Greg Boyd, coauthor,Across the Spectrum", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The more expensive pieces were in the smaller room in the back but he still liked to ease his way through each case. Just a simple cut could change the way a topaz sparkled in its setting, not as arresting as a black opal but there was a fluid beauty in the deep golden color unique to the topaz. Some nights as he watched Arianna shape metal into intricate designs, he had to clench his fists to keep from grabbing the torch and forming his own design.Arianna was still with the customer, a middle-aged woman in spandex, and from the indecision on the woman's face, it could be awhile. Quinn decided to make his way to the studio and pour a whiskey while he waited. He didn't realize anyone was in the studio until he had his hand on the knob. That's when he saw her. Much of her face was obscured by huge goggles as she clutched a blow torch and bent over a piece of metal. He studied the long, lean frame, the black braid reaching down her back as she aimed the blow torch and a bright orange-blue flame spat out, illuminating a slice of pale skin.The woman's slim fingers mesmerized him as she worked the torch with practiced skill, making him think of sex and lots of it.Who was she?Quinn clutched the doorknob, caught between desire to go to the woman and rip off the goggles so he could see her face and the equal need to stay right there, watching.She leaned forward further and he could make out a swell of small breast beneath the black turtleneck sweater. They'd be round breasts, firm, full. He imagined her naked, the long waist, the slim hips . . . The woman turned off the blow torch, set it on the workbench and held up the metal she'd been soldering. His gaze fell to her lips. Full. Red. Perfect. He turned the knob just as she disappeared behind a screened panel. What would he say when she returned?I like the way you work a blow torch?Maybe he wouldn't say anything, he'd pour a drink, no two, and go for the casual,Hi, I'm Quinn, Arianna's friend.He waited. Three minutes, five, six. Finally, he opened the door and stepped inside, expecting the mystery woman to materialize from behind the partition. When she didn't, he edged toward the screen and looked behind it. A tiny hall snaked toward a door that led to the street.

Multiple facial skin grafts and a bulging eye keep Trevor ashamed of his appearance, and he's given a name to the expression of shock people have when they see him for the first time: \"Swallowing their face.\" Cheryl, who's  6'1\" and can dunk a basketball even when she's drunk, narrates the story.

Frank Bowers is author of “Walking By Faith 4 Life: How to Overcome Every Obstacle and Triumph Over Every Situation in Your Life Through Faith in the Word of God”, as well as being the founder of the Walking By Faith 4 Life™ Ministries, and Instructor for the Walking By Faith 4 Life™ Seminars. Frank was born again and filled with the Holy Spirit on June 9, 1977.  For over 30 years, he has  studied the Word of God and sought God to learn the steps and practical application of how to successfully walk and live by faith in the Word of God.  Frank’s journey began when, in the summer of 1985, God healed him of a rare strain  of diphtheria. From this experience, Frank began to seek God and His Word in the area  of healing.  This led to the revelation of faith, understanding the power of the Word of  God, and its practical application in the life of the born-again believer, not only for  healing, but prosperity, wisdom, peace, joy and every other area of life.  Frank realized that the call of God on his life is to exhort and encourage the body of  Christ; to share the true nature and character of a loving God; to teach what belongs to the  born-again child of God through Jesus Christ as outlined in the Scriptures, and how to bring the manifestation of those things into their  own lives by faith in the Word of God.  Frank's teaching includes the steps on how to  be all God has said you can be; how to do all God says you can do; and how to  have all God says you can have.

She lived in the Seattle area from 1993 to 2010. When she moved there, she was able to say, for the first time in her life, that she felt at home. Although she has lived in multiple places all around the Seattle area, her favorite nesting spot was on the Kitsap Peninsula, where she has been able to enjoy waterfront living and bald eagle watching for most of the time she lived there. Before moving to Seattle, she spent eight years in the Asheville, North Carolina area, a place of great beauty and folk art culture. The thing she misses most about living there is the great community of lesbians. You could walk into Malaprop's (a most excellent bookstore) in downtown Asheville and be guaranteed to run into several lesbians, many of whom she’d already know. Before moving to North Carolina in 1985, she lived in Lakeland, Florida, where she attended college, landed her first great job, and found the first of many really cool living spaces. Beth grew up in Winter Park, Florida, a European-style city in the heart of Central Florida. Follow Beth’s work and life at BethMitchum.com and SlicesOfMyLife.net.

Author's note: When reading about the first half of the nineteenth century, it is interesting to note the similarities between issues of earlier times and those of today. The formation of political parties stimulated the use of surrogates and encouraged slanderous campaign rhetoric that has developed into a twenty-first century art form. Nascent interest in women's rights, abortion, racial discrimination and injustice energized the formation of sympathetic support groups which now carry political, social and economic weight. Radical religious leaders and their power to attract followers led to manifestations of social change, many of which are accepted as the norm today.      Awareness of these issues affected the development of Reverberation, The Novel. In spite of these influences, the story line basically remains the tale of two people who committed a crime and what happens to them as a result.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She wrote poetry and short stories in high school and college, until 1993 when her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. After her mother's death in 1998, deep in depression, she found herself unable to write. Nine years passed, and only on rare occasion did she attempt to write. Finally, in 2007, under the urging of friends, she sat down and pecked out her first novel. It was raw and unpolished, but the process had been unquestionably cathartic. The next three years were spent filling her hard drive with seven complete manuscripts. At the beginning of 2011, Monique decided it was time to edit the work and share it with the world.

He is not afraid to tackle big subjects, but he does so with a firm grounding in our world, with a poet's eye for the telling detail, and a doctor's probing determination.This wide-ranging collection covers a lot of ground, but Saidi deftly covers that ground with rich, lively details that put us in hospitals or Tehran, or wherever his stories feel the need to go. While seeking to lift the lid to reveal what's beneath external appearances, Saidi proves to be an intimate, knowledgable guide.His characters struggle with both physical and spiritual disease and death. He offers us no easy solutions to life's complexities some wounds do not heal but these stories inspire with their characters' tough determination to embrace the questions, to follow the tougher paths, to not give in. --~ Jim Daniels, Author ofTrigger Man: More Tales of the Motor CityAll day I think about it, then at night I say it. wrote Rumi, the Persian poet whose spirit suffuses Mo Saidi's fiction.

Set in Iran, America, and elsewhere in the Cosmos, the twentyshort stories in this collection draw on the author's childhood and his medical training, but most notably on his sumptuous imagination. Like such other writer-physicians as John Keats, Anton Checkhov, and William Carlos Williams, Saidi turns to literature to salve the symptoms of mortality. Like Joseph Conrad, Vladimir Nabokov, and Samuel Beckett, he makes an adopted language sing. --Steven G. Kellman, Author ofThe Translingual ImaginationMo Saidi has lived a wonderful life of learning with adventures in two cultures, two countries. Adventures in education, travel, medicine, science, religion, art, and literature. He is allowing us to share these adventures in memorable stories in prose and poetry.

In 1930, he began work as an electrician in a Moscow suburb. In 1934, he joined the design bureau of Viktor Bolkhovitinov, a noted designer of bombers. In 1946, Chertok joined the newly established NII-88 institute as head of the control systems department and worked hand-in-hand with legendary Chief Designer Sergey Korolev.  Chertok became one of Korolev’s closest aides in developing control systems for ballistic missiles and spacecraft, eventually becoming deputy chief designer of the famous OKB-1, the design organization that spun off from NII-88 in 1956. Chertok participated in every major project at OKB-1 (now the Energiya Rocket-Space Corporation, RKK Energiya) until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, when he retired from active work. Academician Chertok currently lives in Moscow and serves as the Chief Scientific Consultant to RKK Energiya.  His four-volume memoirs “Rekety I lyudi” (Rockets and People) were published in Moscow between 1994 and 1999. Asif A. Siddiqi is an Assistant Professor of history at Fordham University in New York. In 2008–2009 he was a visiting Fellow at the Program in Science, Technology, and Society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The men in\nthis book are friends of mine who work and play in the same profession that I\ndo, and are willing to share their knowledge with me.Question: What is it you like about bass\nfishing and being with professional bass fishermen?Phillips: I like bass fishing, because it's a sport I\nbegan to participate in when all I had to do was drop a minnow next to a log on\na line attached to a cane pole, and fight the bass with that limber pole. Even\nthrough all the changes and the new technology that's been introduced to this\nsport, I still enjoy that tug on the line and that wild bass fighting for\nfreedom when it comes out of the water and shakes its head. I like being around\nprofessional bass fishermen, because many of them are some of the best\nbusinessmen I've ever met and the great ones are gifted with a high degree of\npeople skills. They're fun folks to hang-out with, and they've also been my teachers\nand my mentors.", "related": ["B00A39RVWI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science & Math", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Many of his books are founded in personal experience. While researching them he has (amongst other things) chased pirates in the South China Sea, raced big-money multi-hulls in France, and run away from cocaine dealers in Spain.As well as writing novels, Llewellyn has published half a dozen children's books, and works as a journalist for British and American newspapers and magazines such as the London Times and Daily Telegraph. He is a keen gardener, with added interests in ornithology and history and has also sailed yachts - several of which he built himself - all over the world. He now lives with his wife, award-winning children's writer and novelist Karen Wallace, and their two sons in a medieval house in the Welsh border country.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It can never be a bad thing to have fun while learning or vice versa - by depicting the lively, competitive and sometimes fraught lives of the great composers, and Torgov gives readers exactly that gift.\"[Mastersinger of Minsk]is worthy of Hitchcock in the way it uses the interpretation of a song as a plot device ?rather like Die Meistersinger itself for that matter.\"As a crime investigation novel, The Mastersinger from Minsk works well with nicely rounded intriguing characters, a coherent plot, and a mainly reasonable resolution. But its other virtue is that it adds to the world's store of crime novels that coat knowledge about music, opera, and the life of Wagner specifically in a delicious wrapper of entertainment and mild suspense.It's a dangerous business for a novelist to mix real history and imaginary crimes. The combination of the two almost demands that the story be treated with a touch of humour, but that doesn't mean the author is allowed to get cute on us. Torgov has just the right feel for this kind of writing, never coy, solid with his history but not allowing the facts to get in the way of a good joke.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His childhood backyard was separated from the city funeral home by a rickety and easily scaled wooden fence further spurring his childhood fascination with the macabre. Mr. E wrote a comic series at age 12 and penned, directed and acted in numerous home movies with his brother for over a decade. He joined the Army his senior year of high school and was loved and hated by his military superiors for being fiercely independent, outspoken and an extremely influential member of his unit during his service. Mr. E has survived many near death experiences including nearly being swept over a waterfall, falling from a collapsing mountain trail in the black of night and nearly being bombarded by the Russian Army all of which have inspired many of his stories. He married his wife days after being snowed in atop Blood Mountain and now lives in the southeastern U.S. Mr. E is the recently discovered author of the bizarre, voice for the disillusioned and stitch in the side of the self righteous. His writings cover almost all topics of interest and he does not take kindly to the taboo. He dwells with his wife downstairs from his fellow poker player, Hubert Marston, across the hall from Solomon Kane, in the east wing of Hill House beneath the shadows of the Mountains of Madness.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They certainly weren't given any clear instructions or guidance about what to do.Clearly you need to allow time for recovery after having major abdominal surgery like this, butsimply doing nothing at all can make matters far worse.In fact it's fair to say that being sedentary will actually slow down your recovery and could even result in having a wobbly, weak and very unattractive mid section for the rest of your life.It was great fun writing this program and my thanks goes out to all the women who allowed me to test and refine the system on them because by going through this process, I managed to create a unique and effective technique that fitted in to a new moms busy schedule but was also easy to do.Whilst writing the book, the more I researched and learned about the c section recovery process,the more I realized how the actions that many women were taking afterwards was going to leave them with the sort of body they despised.This could lead to depression, lack of confidence and low self esteem and a whole range of other issues with the way their body looked and felt.I knew that I could change this by educating and teaching my clients a safe and effective way of recovering after having a c section so they could reclaim the body the body that they wanted to have.Perhaps more importantly however, writing this book and exercise program also allowed me to help many other women all over the world and this is what I'm really proud of.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Instead, they send him on a\nmission: he must travel across the country and infiltrate a sushi house run by\na booze-addled old man whose harrowing wartime flashbacks send him into fits of\nrage. Strode's goal: to somehow convince the man to retire. It's a thin\npremise, but it allows young Strode to take a wild road trip, and this is what\ncomprises most of the book. Yoshi and Danno, the disgraced sumo wrestlers\ntasked with delivering Strode to the restaurant, are delightfully well-drawn\ncharacters, though some of the others -- especially Strode's parents -- are\nsuch throwaways that the book may well have been better off without them. Also,\nthe writer resorts to employing unlikely coincidences in order to drive the\nplot forward.

By night, he maneuvers the labyrinth of his large city, conveying passengers to their desired destinations. Among them are immigrants, professors, magicians, and lovers. Some of them are regulars, like the generous drug dealer, the altruistic exotic dancer, and the prostitute mother, while others he meets only for the duration of a single drive. Once a child of the circus, Fly is no stranger to the anomalous, and he is both fascinated and disgusted by the stories of his passengers and the worlds in which they live. His only social contact is with his passengers and occasional visits with his political-activist friend, Otto, and his neighbor Mary. Theirs are the stories gathered by Fly and related here with dark, insightful humor, casting a spotlight on the dingy corners and the lost people of the inner city where he earns his living. Rich with imagery and told in a broken narrative that mimics the chaos of the city’s carnival season, Hage’s newest novel is an enthralling page-turner well worth the trip. --Cortney Ophoff", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Their “potential for disaster” sends a chill up his spine, because they are “rough, dirty, unshaven, and carrying enough lethal hardware for a small army.” It turns out that the three are bounty hunters, as unpopular a sort of folks as can be found in the Old West. In fact, one of them, Snake, bears the reputation of a “low-down, back-shootin’ polecat.” It seems the bounty hunters are on the trail of one Alex Bowdre, and the trail has brought them to these parts. (Bowdre is wanted for murder in New Mexico.) The sheriff’s concern is so great, the presence of these dudes so worrisome, that he calls in Marshal Piedmont Kelly, who, along with his old pal Spotted Dog, an Apache, pursues the bounty hunters; they have kidnapped a local rancher who may or may not be the person they are attempting to turn in to get a reward. With a raft of well-drawn, even indelible, characters, the novel also offers a compellingly involved, quite plausible, and tightly woven plot. --Brad Hooper", "related": ["B00J1IN4B4"], "rank": 677706, "title": "Ambush Creek", "author": "Phil Dunlap", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.1667, "rating_total": 25.0}

This book will make you an expert, able to defend against any arguments hostile to Israel. One can use the facts presented here to write letters, Op- Eds, or verbally make a powerful case in defense of Israel and against the rampant and persistent anti-Israel media bias. The facts in this book will enable you to win over ill-informed Israeli critics, be they professors, journalists, congressmen, friends; and to read any article or report about Israel with powerful new insights that will make it impossible for you to be misled. Run, don t walk to get this book. --Mort Klein- President ZOAThe mainstream media's misinformation and vilification of Israel is the Trojan Horse in the modern-day war against the Jewish People. But this horse does not just enter through the gates, it has vaporized and flows through the printing presses, the bandwidths and the aural passages of every sentient human being. Each of us are continuously assaulted with that noxious gas of anti-Israel vitriol masquerading as facts. Kudos to Messrs Verlin and Bender for creating an easily accessible and fact-filled source for decoding the major organs and language of this potent weapon. From the A-Z section laying out the key terms behind which the weapon enters our consciousness, to the just as vital antidote section which lays out the necessary background tools of truth with which we can immunize ourselves from this weapon, \"Pressing Israel\" is a must-have and must-read for all who want to attain a healthy understanding of the truth about what is happening in and to Israel. --Lori Lowenthal Marcus- President, Z STREET", "related": ["B00HS4EQGA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has written novels, short stories, poetry, and plays as well as scholarly articles, a standard history of American humor, and varied essays. He was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, about which he writes in the recent Transatlantic Lives, which also portrays much of France, primarily in WWII, in which he took part and was wounded in the battle for the Remagen bridgehead on the German Rhine. It was during his recovery at the American recuperation center in Biaritz, France, that he met his future French wife in the summer of 1945.  When he returned to the states he studied literature at Bucknell University and received his PhD from Princeton. While studying, he began to write about his experiences in the war. His short stories were published widely in journals like Esquire and Virginia Quarterly Review. His novels, Trial at Bannock and Year of the Cougar, garnered reviews in the New York Times. Trial at Bannock was optioned in the 1960s, and one of Bier's sorest disappointments is that the film was never made.  He taught briefly at the University of Colorado and then spent the rest of his academic career at the University of Montana, with periodic sojourns at universities in California, Pennsylvania, and a year at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, where he was appointed Professeur Extraordinaire in 1991. He chose to return to Montana forever, peripherally to bring up his three children in Missoula. Now, at 87, with his wife falling victim to Alzheimer's, he's returned to humor and writing to bolster him. His children have urged him to bring his writing and his unpublished manuscripts to light. Taking another look at the publishing world, Bier has decided to try his hand at ebooks. He's seen publishing go through several changes over his life and is excited to venture into this newest avenue because \"it presents opportunities the older publishing establishment does not. I have found both agents and editors harder to reach. I also found, in these years, that they're less accessible and efficient than they were. And there are fewer of them. I've been told by fellow writers, 'You're too old.'\" But Jesse has been proving his fellow writers wrong.  His first foray into ebooks, The Cannibal, is available through Amazon. Its story is horrific but with extra psychological and social dimensions that expand it beyond the confines of a gripping shocker.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After spending my early years in the Midwest, I migrated to Southern California where I received most of my education.

Although I've lived in L.A. most of my life, the simple ways of Southern Illinois are still close to my heart. I love the opportunities to get away to the quiet of the deserts and countryside.

The intersection of their experiences as immigrants in the South’s unique Low country city with major political and cultural events occurring at the local, state, and national levels effected the acculturation and transformation of these European settlers into representative Charlestonians by the end of the century. Who were these individuals in search of new beginnings? How did their heritage affect their life in the South’s most historic city? What did they leave behind in the common blood of the city’s ethnic past? Jones’s account reveals the course of these families’ interconnected personal lives during more than eighty years of tumultuous times in Charleston. Robert Alston Jones, a Charleston native, is Emeritus Professor of German at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee where he served as faculty member and administrator for thirty-six years. His degrees in German Language and Literature from Duke University and the University of Texas-Austin heightened his appreciation of his German and English immigrant heritage in Charleston and facilitated his research into the European origins of his extended immigrant family. Here he portrays their experiences against the backdrop of the city’s unique political, cultural and social foundations. A resident of Milwaukee since 1966, Jones still considers himself a Charlestonian at heart.", "related": ["B008GWPA40"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What inspired her to write about it is the fact thatshe got tired of hearing about child molestation in the churches and teachers or coaches taking advantage of children and adolescence who look up to them.But when she looked further into the subject matter,she discovered that child sexual abuse was more prevalent \"inside\" the home which startled herso much that she felt that people really need to know how much this is going on right in their midst.In her opinion,enough isn't being done about it in terms of protection for children and punishment for the perpetrators- family member or not. Sexual abuse is cruel. And when it comes to children, it's outright evil because they can't defend themselves and sometimes they don't even realize that their innocence is being taken away.Although this is just one book, she's just one person and this is her way of exposing the reality ofchild sexual abuseto those who maybe don't know much about it such as the impact it has on the life of the victims in so many ways for the rest of their lives.Children are everywhere; so the more \"normal\" a childhood that boys and girls can have the happier and healthier the world can be.

My mother would get upset with me as all I would want to do is make doll clothes, so Mom would  take the fabric away from me and make me go outside for awhile to play.  As I grew up I started to paint, crochet and knit.  In the late 1960's I taught gardening to High School girls. We would enter the Santa Clara County Fair in landscaping, where we won a few 1st prizes. I won 1st prize for ornaments and other handmade items, not always 1st place.  In the late 1970's I took classes in Brazilian Embroidery. This started me on a path of stitching with a dimensional look. Then I was introduced to beads.  Using beads with stitches also gave me that dimensional look.  Now I use beads on just about everything I stitch.  I have taught quilting, crochet, knitting, beading, cross stitch, needlepoint and now needle painting.  In many classes I taught using my own designs and some classes I use other wonderful Designer's patterns.  My friends asked me to put my patterns into books for others to enjoy and learn from.  Ater thinking about this new adventure I decided that I wanted to do something different than what was out there.  In my book you will find my beadweaving designs and/or cross stitch with stories from my life.  Do enjoy stitching these designs and reading my stories. I hope this will remind you of your fond memories.", "related": ["B005T822RW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jenkins says that discipline is the cornerstone of good writing: Bursts of inspiration may never come but you must keep writing. Chapter Four - Open the Box is a great tool that entails grabbing the name of a character, setting, etc. out of a compartmentalized shoe box, tying the elements together and putting your musings onto paper. Devote one hour per day to writing. Enroll in online writing courses. Avoid emails, internet searches and phone calls when writing. You will be motivated to write a novel in 30 days or start a blog. A Writer on Writing has pages and pages of practical tips that can take your writing career to the next level.I was impressed by A Writer on Writing. As a freelance writer, I have read numerous books on the do's and don'ts of writing. But Sally Jenkins' down-to-earth advice acknowledged the day-to-day obstacles, e.g. juggling family and work, getting distracted and overcoming intimidation when submitting letters to editors by providing realistic solutions. Her style was personable but authoritative. The pace was fast with a format that was easy to follow and concise - just 38 pages -- with lots of takeaways.  Jenkins has has published two anthologies. She has written numerous articles about writing for various periodicals in the UK.  A Writer on Writing is highly recommended for all writers.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After retiring from homeschooling, she found herself at loose ends, unused to having time on her hands.  As a little girl her head was filled with made up stories and that hasn’t changed.  An avid reader, she’s always loved books and the idea of writing one.  Deciding to capitalize on all those years of teaching and editing her sons' essays, she quietly started a project.  She had no idea if she’d produce a decent paragraph, let alone a whole story.  Her first book, Elizabeth’s Hero, was a huge personal achievement that launched a love affair with writing. Her Christian faith is often reflected in her stories.  The main characters are generally good people with strong values and, of course, there is always a happy ending!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.7143, "rating_total": 33.0}

Thompson to quit school three months shy of finishing the eighth grade. His mother sold the homestead down to the wood flooring, and at 13 years of age Paul Thompson left to find work in Texas. He found work on a ranch owned by a man in whom history and myth has so often collided: The very real and legendary Charles Goodnight.Of his employment under Goodnight, Thompson has remarked, \"Nowhere in the world did they feed the men better. At thirteen I received the same wages as the forty or so year-old man riding right beside me. It was none of this 'yer just a kid, you get half wages' as is said today. You did a man's work and got a man's pay. Then again, I don't know very many thirteen year-olds that know how to work, even if they're permitted it.\"Following his ranching employment under Goodnight, Thompson moved on to another brush with history that stands uncontested to this day. He rode for the XIT Ranch, which sprawling out at three million acres, was at one time the world's largest range under fence. Texas used the sale of the XIT to pay for it's red granite capitol, which remains the largest on the North American Continent while boasting of a dome standing seven feet higher than that of the U.S. capitol dome.Thompson moved on into working for other West Texas ranches and by the age of 17 had rode horseback from central New Mexico to Calgary, Canada. His travels via horseback have taken him all over New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and into areas of Utah and Wyoming.With the last vestiges of the West being replaced by a world of mechanization, the 22 year-old Thompson took stock of his life. Now married, the father of two children and by society's standards, uneducated, he had few employment prospects of any value. So once again he grabbed the reins of responsibility and took a placement test that enabled him to entered high school. Although it had been a little late in coming, three months later he graduated the 12th grade with straight A's. He went into Pasadena City College for two years and followed-up that with four years at UCLA. Thompson graduated with a Mechanical Engineering Degree.But even long-after his graduation, with the West relegated to little more than celluloid shadows of reality, Thompson was being beckoned by the call of the West--in particularly, the call of the Western lawman. He answered that call by picking up a deputy Sheriff's badge. His horse had become the automobile and the frontier was now the back streets and alleyways of Corrales New Mexico. But after 2½ years, and having almost bled to death from a gunshot wound, Thompson turned in his badge and hung up his six iron.Having recovered from his brush with death, Thompson made use of his degree in Mechanical Engineering by going on to serve as a consultant for numerous Electric Generating power plants throughout the United States. He retired early in order to concentrate on western epics based upon his exposure to and experiences in the now long-gone Wild West.Thompson reports that every location in his novels is accurate down to the detail.\"If my characters lead me off where I haven't been or don't remember,\" he says, \"I saddle the horse and go see for myself. In 1992 I rode horseback in the Mogollon, Gila Wilderness area of New Mexico and Arizona doing research on eight novels. This little trip took just over three months...\"Narrating in the authentically seasoned dialect of a southwestern storyteller, Paul L. Thompson is himself a tribute to the thrilling and heartbreaking hardships of our nation's western history. His depiction of the epic old west and the authoritative knowledge with which he writes will have you along for a ride in the 1870s. A ride that you'll swear has you atop a steed and racing across a sweeping panorama while colt dragoons are blazing hot in your hands right now!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They review a variety of approaches to metrics and give readers the skills needed to go from metrics as measurement to metrics as a tool for creating deeper, more sustained value. A must-have for all leaders serious about maximizing the impact of their organization and capital.”—Jed Emerson, Chief Impact Strategist, ImpactAssets“This book is a great resource for anyone working to tackle today’s complex, global social challenges. Epstein and Yuthas help us ask the right questions, create meaningful measures, and adapt nimbly to test our biggest, boldest ideas and determine if they will deliver the right kind of impact.”—Steven J. McCormick, President and Trustee, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation“Too often, donors and investors think of social impact measurement as separate from the ‘real work’ of doing good. Epstein and Yuthas have developed a clear and practical guide to impact measurement—not just how to do it but how to think about it and integrate it into every aspect of your work. Essential reading for anyone looking to move from good intentions to high impact.”—Katherina M. Rosqueta, Founding Executive Director, Center for High Impact Philanthropy, University of Pennsylvania“By posing the right questions and providing useful frameworks, Epstein and Yuthas take us on an absorbing voyage of the challenges and solutions available in the field of social impact measurement. The book is a valuable resource for investors keen to generate social impact in a thoughtful, rigorous, and transparent manner.”—Nalini Tarakeshwar, Executive Director, Evidence, Measurement and Evaluation, The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, UK“Whether your annual philanthropic contribution is $5,000 or $5,000,000, this book is a must-read to move people out of poverty faster! Epstein and Yuthas provide a unique balance of introspection and global insights to ensure that impact, scale, and sustainability are achieved.”—Deval Sanghavi, cofounder and Partner, Dasra Strategic Philanthropy Foundation, India“Epstein and Yuthas provide a lucid and compelling framework—a logic model—for investors, civil society actors, corporate leaders, and policy makers to use resources more effectively and yield better social results.”—Rohini Nilekani, Chairperson, Arghyam“This book is an excellent reference point for social impact investing. Epstein and Yuthas have meticulously researched an impressive cross section of companies, nonprofits, foundations, and individuals to build credible metrics and analytical tools, and they offer useful insights to maximize impact.”—Zarina Screwvala, Founder-Trustee, Swades Foundation“Epstein and Yuthas offer a clear and highly accessible approach to measuring and creating social impact. Drawing on a diverse array of examples from around the world, they demonstrate that there are no quick fixes and that systematic measurement is essential.”—Alnoor Ebrahim, Associate Professor, Harvard Business School, and author of the award-winning NGOs and Organizational Change“Measuring social impact is a topic at the top of so many agendas yet with so little real insight about how to make it real, actionable, and meaningful. Measuring and Improving Social Impacts is a practical guide for maximizing and amplifying impact. A must-read for those grappling with how to define and evaluate success.”—Paul Bernstein, CEO, The Pershing Square Foundation“Although this looks like a thorough guidebook for people starting in the field of social change, it is likely to trigger considerable thinking among those who have been involved in philanthropy and the practice of social change for a long time. The desire to bring about social change is quite simple, but doing something about it can be quite complicated—this book helps you to simplify things to achieve your goals.”—Madhav Chavan, PhD, CEO, Pratham Education Foundation“Measuring and Improving Social Impacts offers a useful and timely review of the many measurement approaches available to nonprofits, foundations, and impact investors. Epstein and Yuthas provide practical step-by-step guidance along with real-life stories that show how measurement is applied in action and leads to better results.”—Fay Twersky, Director, Effective Philanthropy Group, The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation“A fascinating read . . . very valuable to corporate foundations like mine that are grappling with effectiveness at the foundation level and also understanding and measuring the added value for the corporation and its employees.”—Vidya Shah, CEO, EdelGive Foundation, Edelweiss Group, India", "related": ["B00C3HENO2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In High School and College, I donned my glasses and disguised my super writer self in my computer nerd persona and while I still told stories and had adventures, they were never made publicly known. Many years later, I decided that it was time to remove my disguise and let my stories out in the world again. My first adventure, Grimm End, was published in 2012 with four more Grimm End novels planned for 2014 through 2016. CJ Kask, the 106 year old explorer from Grimm End, also appears as an eleven-year-old adventurer in the Young Explorers series.The first book, Young Explorers and the Inca Wraith was published in March 2013. The second book, Young Explorers and the Phantom Express was publish in November 2013. In addition, a sprawling swords and sorcery fantasy novel series and a number of computer thrillers will appear over the next several years. Outside of writing, I have adventures with Kay, my wife and future author of her own books, my two wonderful daughters and their families including three grand-children (and one on the way) and two grand-puppies.

I was eating a less than stellar diet and hadn't quite found my way into the traditional/whole foods world yet. I tried cold turkey and didn't last very long. I found that sustainable change in my diet took a gradual approach, yet everything I read about dealing with sugar cravings took it out of your diet right away.I couldn't do that.So I put together an eight week challenge that will gradually help you reduce your sugar consumption!Over the years I've begun to have a much healthier relationship with sugar. I still love it and enjoy sweets every now and again, but they don't rule my life anymore.Take this last Thanksgiving for instance, I made an apple pie with cane sugar and enjoyed a piece for dessert. (with homemade whipped cream to boot!) But it didn't throw me into a \"give me all the sweets in the house\" craving like it used to. I was happy with one piece! Most days I actually prefer to choose treats that are less sweet as many of my old favorites just don't taste as good as they used to.This freedom has been a great thing for me and I stress less about eating and feel no guilt or shame when I do indulge.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I have 60 new words in my head already.Your system is amazing. I am having no problem creating graphic images and they just WORK! I'm able to remember all these new words effortlessly. I'm a very visual & kinaesthetic person, and I even act out some of the images. They just stick in my head.Thank you so much for sharing this system.\"-Amanda Markham★★★★★ \"Metivier actually explains, meticulously, just how to go about building memory palaces and filling them up with the words you want to remember. He tells you what preparation steps are necessary, gives examples of the kind of vivid imagery you're going to use, and even suggests a schedule in which you devote one day a month to each of the 26 letters of the alphabet. I'm 58 years old with an aim to be reasonably fluent in a year: thanks to this technique, I feel confident I can do it. I'm memorizing around 100 words a day now, and it's fun, too!\"-Fiona★★★★★ \"I have read and put into practice the ideas in this book. The ideas presented are not your normal for memorizing vocabulary. that is why the book is good. It presents several DIFFERENT ideas to you that are possible for everyone, if given the time and effort. Don't dismiss this book. If you have struggled with memorizing vocabulary in the past this book will give you several suggestions that will help you tremendously.\"-S.

She is a 1973 graduate of Northpoint Bible College, formerly Zion Bible College, in Haverhill, MA, with a ministerial diploma.   She later returned to college as an adult to complete her bachelor’s degree at the Binghamton campus of Empire State College in NY, graduating in 1996 with a concentration in adult learning and mentoring.  Bonnie began writing seriously when she and her husband moved to northern NY to pastor a small town church. She took a job as a reporter for a weekly newspaper in their community, and later became the news editor. When she and her husband moved to Indiana, PA, she began writing Bible fiction after she was challenged by a Christian counselor to search out a Bible heroine - one who had gone through similar experiences to her own and had come through those experiences victoriously. Her first novel, Daughter of Lot which depicts the life of Ruth, fueled her desire to continue writing Bible fiction to encourage and empower hurting women in today’s world to deepen their relationship with Jesus Christ. In response to the plight of women victims of human sex trafficking, Bonnie wrote Daughter of Scarlet, dedicating a portion of the profits to organizations which aide these victims.

He was one of the original options market-makers on the Pacific Options Exchange in 1976. In 1978, he founded Engmann Options, Inc. to include other traders under a corporate umbrella. Recognizing the need for a West Coast based options clearing company that provided superior service and advanced technology, he founded Sage Clearing Corporation in 1980. Understanding that members of the public could also use better technology, Mike created the public brokerage house Preferred Trade in 1982. In 2001, he took control of RevereData, a small information data provider to the securities industry.      In addition to his fully owned businesses, Mike has been an angel investor in many start-ups and fledgling companies. His experience with the problems of small businesses in regard to regulation and competition with big business has given him an insight into why small businesses are crucial to growth in America. As an expert with 40 years of experience in the investment field, he has an excellent understanding of both macro and micro economics. Understanding political policy has also been an important element of Mike's success as an investor. In addition, his experience with trading and traders has provided him with an excellent understanding of people's behavior when the reward of their activity is not tied directly to their risk involved in it.     Mike's reason for writing this book is \"As a true capitalist and believer in the greatness of America, I have been compelled to write this book. Our great country is being torpedoed by our politicians and our media. I couldn't stand by and say nothing!\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
