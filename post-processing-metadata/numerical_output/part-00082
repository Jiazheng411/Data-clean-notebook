By focusing on your appetite for risk-taking, your ability to manage and adapt to risk, and your pathological patterns of risk-taking, Kiev shows you how to overcome the psychological obstacles of risk that undermine your decision-making process and ability to cut losing trades and stick with winners.With the help of numerous trading case studies, Kiev outlines a risk management program that bridges the gap between investor psychology and quantitative risk management techniques. Filled with expert advice and examples of real market situations, The Psychology of Risk allows you to take action in the face of uncertainty and unpredictability by addressing issues such as:* Risk and the trading approaches you need to deal with it* Psychological techniques that will help you trade independently of emotions: excitement, anger, fear, and stress* Handling problematic behaviors such as perfectionism, decision paralysis, hoarding, and impulsiveness* Handling failure and success* Using the tools of coaching, teamwork, and system building to overcome obstaclesRisk taking does not mean living dangerously; it shows a willingness to act beyond the circle of what you already know. In breaking from the natural inclination to \"avoid risk at all costs,\" you will begin to see risk in a new light-certainly not always as a negative force. The step-by-step approach presented in The Psychology of Risk will provide you with a new and stimulating perspective on risk, which will enhance your trading success and increase your profits.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kim had spent two days in the hospital last week after her collapse at the race track and had then been released as an outpatient. She was always positive in attitude, and her engagement to Wade and the news that a donor had come forward lifted her spirits even more. She wanted to have the surgery immediately, but as a scientist, understood the need for more tests.Hugo was ecstatic. His daughter was finally going to get the transplant she required; unfortunately the surgery was still a week away. In the meantime he had to check out this Nancy Jean Smith woman. If it was Sylvie—\"Join us for lunch,\" Wade urged. \"We have to make sure Kim eats.\"She stuck out her tongue at him.\"You two go ahead,\" Hugo demurred. He had only one thing on his mind at the moment, and lunch wasn't it. He figured these two lovebirds would rather be alone, anyway.\"Come with us, Dad,\" Kim urged, and coiled her arm around his. He knew his protest was futile.She suggested a well-known eatery, famous for its huge sandwiches and rich soups. Hugo followed her sports car in his SUV. Wade was driving. Kim was on her cell phone, probably giving her cousin Rachel the latest news. Justin, Rachel's brother, the driver of No. 448 in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, was in Winston-Salem today, doing a promo for his sponsor, Turn-Rite Tools. Kim would no doubt fill him in later, if Rachel hadn't already.They were in luck when they arrived at the restaurant a few minutes later. The first wave of customers was clearing out, so they were seated immediately.While they examined their menus, Kim steered the conversation to Wade's family back in Tennessee. She'd gotten to spend some time with them when they came up to the Bristol race, and she had fallen in love with the big clan. Sunday dinner at his mother's house, Wade said, rarely involved fewer than a dozen people.Hugo, too, had once entertained notions of having a big family. Instead, he'd become a single father to three children, none of whom was he the biological father of, but whom he couldn't have loved more if he had been. They'd turned out okay, too, more than okay. He was proud of all of them.Yet he'd never stopped waiting for Sylvie to come home.He'd felt so helpless these past months, ever since Kim had been diagnosed with acute kidney failure— even more helpless than he had when her mother had walked out on him years ago, abandoning him and her child. He'd done everything he could to find Sylvie, but she had disappeared completely, vanished without a trace.\"I wish my surgery didn't have to be put off until next week,\" Kim said after they'd placed their orders. \"I'm ready now. I want this to be over.\"\"We've waited this long,\" Wade reminded her. \"A week is nothing, now that we know there's a donor available. Besides, the doc is right, the more time he has to run tests and prepare, the better.\"\"Well, the good news is that I'll be able to go to Martinsville this weekend,\" Kim commented.\"I don't think that's a good idea, honey,\" Hugo said. \"You've collapsed twice at race tracks, last month at Kansas and last weekend at Charlotte.\"\"They were just accidents,\" she argued. \"I let myself get carried away. It won't happen again. I'll be more careful.\"\"You scared the daylights out of us,\" Hugo countered. \"For a few hours, we actually thought we might lose you. I don't want you taking another chance like that, especially right before surgery.\"\"He's right,\" Wade said. \"It's too dangerous for you to go this weekend.\"She frowned at her fiancé, then glared at her father.\"You can watch it on TV,\" Hugo said, \"in air-conditioned comfort.\"\"Spoilsport,\" she said with a disappointed pout.She toyed with the flatware at her place setting. \"I asked Dr. Peterson's assistant this morning about the donor,\" she said. \"He wouldn't tell me anything, said the person insisted on remaining anonymous.\"As soon as Hugo had learned Kim needed a new kidney and he realized that neither he nor his niece and nephew were compatible donors—they were not biological relations and so their chances had been small to begin with—he'd hired another detective agency to find Sylvie. After thirty years of silence, the prospect seemed remote, and in fact, they'd come up dry, as had the previous investigators. He'd had no choice, though. He had to keep trying. He'd have done anything to save his precious daughter. At no point in Kim's life had she needed her mother more than she did now. She had a rare blood type, and Hugo remembered that Sylvie was AB negative, as well. If they were ever going to find a compatible kidney donor for Kim, Sylvie was the most likely candidate, he'd thought, the best hope, and maybe her last hope.\"He told me the same thing,\" Hugo said, aware of his daughter slanting a questioning glance at him. \"You really can't blame the donor,\" he added. \"If the press caught wind of this, they'd turn it into a circus, get in her face, hound her for interviews—\"\"Her?\" Kim's eyes lit and dimmed, almost as quickly. \"You know it's a woman?\"Hugo didn't have to be a mind reader to know what his daughter was thinking or to recognize the forlorn hope he saw in her eyes. Should he tell her he'd sneaked a peek at the medical record and found the name Nancy Jean Smith and that he intended to check her out?He decided not to. It could be another dead end— there had been so many of them over the years. He didn't want to hold out hope that maybe her mother had been found. He knew how devastated she always was when it turned out not to be true.He shook his head. \"Peterson's assistant referred to the donor asshe,but when I questioned him about it, he claimed if the recipient were a man he would refer to the anonymous donor ashe.The guy likes to play word games.\"Wade reached over and took Kim's hand. \"The important thing, darling, is that someone has come forward.\"She smiled at him, then frowned at her father. \"I don't want it to beher,Dad. I don't know why. I can't explain it. But I don't.\" Her hand shook as she reached for her iced tea.\"Hey, calm down, Kim. No getting all worked up.\" Wade stroked her hand. \"Doctor's orders.\"\"Don't you give it another thought, sweetheart,\" Hugo said in his most casual manner, grateful that their food had arrived. \"Whoever the donor is wants to remain anonymous, so we'll just leave it that way.\"But who exactly was Nancy Jean Smith?It was after one o'clock when Hugo was finally able to break away. He loved his daughter and enjoyed her fiancé's company, but his attention had been elsewhere. He'd managed to eat half a club sandwich before he finally understood what it must be like for Kim to have to eat when she wasn't hungry. But the doctor had found her slightly anemic and she'd lost weight, so he had been very insistent that she eat three meals a day, whether she was hungry or not, to keep up her nutrition.The address he'd memorized from the medical record wasn't a familiar one, and for a moment he wondered if she—the donor—could have given a phony address. But he checked a local map and found the street—Hadley Road—on the outskirts of town.How should he approach the situation? He'd never considered himself famous, but as a top crew chief in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, his picture had been in racing magazines from time to time and occasionally in the sports sections of newspapers, so he wasn't completely unknown, especially in the NASCAR world. More than once he'd been stopped in grocery stores or approached in restaurants by people who recognized him and wanted his autograph. After all these years, it surprised him that it still felt like a pat on the back. Even when the circumstances were inconvenient, he did his best to be affable. Trying to hide his identity in this situation, especially so close to home, therefore, probably wasn't a good idea. If this organ donor truly wanted to remain unknown, his showing up could put a jinx on her generosity. He couldn't afford to jeopardize what Kim needed so desperately.Maybe he should watch the place for a while and hope to catch a glimpse of Nancy Jean Smith. Most likely he'd be wasting his time. Stakeouts were a professional investigator's job. He ought to call Rod Callison, the detective he'd hired, and let him handle the situation. But he didn't want to wait.He would go to the address and ring the bell. If a woman he didn't recognize answered the door, he'd say, \"You're not Nancy Smith,\" give her a second to contradict him, apologize for bothering her and walk away. If she said she was, he'd say she wasn't the Nancy Smith he was looking for. There were probably hundreds…thousands of Nancy Smiths.If it was Sylvie…Hadley Road ran through a remote part of the city, an older section that hadn't yet come under gen-trification. Number 743 never would. It was a two-story building with asphalt-shingle siding that was designed to resemble stone and brick. It hadn't fooled anyone in its heyday, and that had been a long time ago. Now it looked derelict. Apartment 203 was the second from the left on the upper floor.Hugo parked his SUV at the curb close to that end of the building, rolled the windows up tight, in spite of the Indian-summer heat of October, and locked the doors. The concrete path that led from the cracked sidewalk was in equally poor repair. The steps up to the second-story balcony, however, were metal and reasonably new. They rang out as he mounted them, an unintended alarm for residents of people arriving.The red door to apartment 203 was metal and faded. Beside it was a bell button with a piece of tape over it, indicating it didn't work.The butterflies in his stomach were taking on the dimensions and temperaments of bats on a rampage.He knocked on the door. No immediate response. Not a sound. Maybe the occupant wasn't home. He knocked again. This time he thought he heard movement inside.He waited, then knocked a third time.Finally the door opened.The woman standing in front of him had a world-weary l...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Elshtain's innovation is to treat Addams like the protofeminist intellectual she was, a thinker whose \"vision of generosity and hopefulness ... made the American democracy more decent and more welcoming today than it would otherwise be.\" Hull-House, for instance, was not merely a poorhouse for immigrants struggling to become citizens; it was a major cultural center that hosted speeches and debates.

Over the past decade the original debates about consumption have been overlaid by a vast amount of detailed research, and it seems unimaginable that a single text couuld do justice to all of these. To do so would involve as much a commitment to depth as to breadth. I was quite astonished at how well Sassatelli succeeds in balancing the two. It covers a huge amount of ground in its three main sections which are roughly historical, theories of consumer agency, and finally the politics of consumption... Ultimately, it's the book that I would trust to help people digest what we now have discovered about consumption and start from a much more mature and reflective foundation to consider what more we might yet do.Daniel MillerMaterial World BlogThe author needs to be applauded for taking on the vast challenge of presenting the enormous width and the manifold implications of consumption on the wider social structure and culture of modern societies. In modern markets, people talk, not money.Marian Adolf and Nico StehrCultural SociologySassatelli's relational approach to consumption certainly avoids falling into deterministic or univocal accounts... She frames her book with a series of dichotomies, swinging theoretical pendulums from apocalyptic pessimism to celebratory freedom... Readers will no doubt be impressed with Sassatelli's refusal to take any single account of consumption without rich and critical questioning.Ashley MearsThe Ambivalence of ConsumptionIn just 237 pages Sassatelli has written an impressive survey of an extraordinarily large and varied literature focusing primarily on developments in Europe and North America... And it is this vast compendium of research studies on consumer practices on these two continents carrying us through the present that makes this book so significant. Moreover, to make its contents accessible to students as well as professionals, it is written as a textbook with eight chapters, each of which is followed by a concise summary. Also helpful to readers is an insightful epilogue followed by a concluding section providing the author's recommendations of additional reading for students of consumer culture... To conclude, this is an intellectually impressive book that takes a fresh up-to-date approach to developments in consumer culture on both sides of the Atlantic. And while the author has far greater familiarity with consumer culture on the European side, major North American developments are not overlooked. the result is a new and helpful international approach to consumer culture at the dawn of the twenty-first century.Monroe FriedmanJournal of American CulturesIn my view, Sassatelli is most successful in offering a thorough introduction to the field... Sassatelli manages to provide useful analyses and to draw interesting connections between the literatures she discusses. I found particularly helpful her discussion of the 'normalization of consumption', whereby consumption that is the product of controlled choice is deemed most legitimate...Sassatelli's advocacy is always qualified. She attempts to incorporate the insights of even the most determinist perspectives, and cautions against going too far in seeing consumption as unequivocally liberating or able to escape structures of inequality.Laura J. MillerJournal of Consumer CultureSassatelli is true to her word. She does address the history, theory and politics of consumer culture. The book offers a comfortable read. I think the most valuable contribution is the rounding up of many theories that have evolved over time about what is consumer society and why this matters... I did enjoy her discussion of practice tied to the notion of consumer capital... Consumption is hugely significant, and the more chances we have to learn about its history, related theories and attendant politics, the better.Sue McGregorInternational Journal of Consumer StudiesThis is a work of impressive scope and depth, covering a substancial amount of ground. The multi-disciplinary nature of the book provides new and revealing insights, and Sassatelli conveys brilliantly the heterogeneity and ambivalent nature of consumer identities, consumer practices and consumer cultures. Furthermore, the author succeeds in discussing these complex issues in a clear and easily accessible way. This text would certainly be suitable for students at the undergraduate or graduate level, and indeed anyone else interested in this area. Newcomers to consumer culture will find this an invaluable primer and introducton to the major concepts and ideas, while those familiar with the field will find Sassatelli's sharp analysis and discussion both refreshing and inspiring.James SkinnerJournal of Sociology", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Freya, soon realizing her sister was murdered, vows to bring the killer to justice. After befriending one of Alex's closest friends, enigmatic Egyptologist Flin Brodie, the unlikely duo find themselves on the run from a host of assassins, spies and government agents—and charging headlong into one of the biggest archeological discoveries in centuries.

Chris' death in a freak auto accident is unexpected, but Anna finds the secrets that unfold from his will even more startling. The story swells to include many well-drawn characters, including Catherine, a newcomer to their town who just happens to be connected to Chris' past; Mattie, a law-school dropout with an old soul who helps Anna unearth some history; and Rosie, Chris' long-lost daughter, who is fighting demons of her own. While the first half is slow and Anna's initial reasons for exploring the past are weak, the tale gets better and tighter as it goes, fleshed out with more external conflict, flashing back to explore Chris' history, his relationship with Catherine, and then tying Rosie's journey in with the other characters in a sentimental, but not overly sweet, ending. --manuscript review by Publishers Weekly, an independent organizationCrisp, well crafted, and mature. First the language comes alive, then the characters and the plot - always a telltale sign of elite writing. Because, there is art here, the reader gets to first live inside the language: then become engaged in the narrative. Both are cozy places to live in this well-told story. Unhurried conceptual space is thus provided for the reader's mind to roam around in. Pace becomes an independent variable. Indeed, there is no need to worry about any structural elements here at all, for the narrative is in the deft hands of a craftsman. The descriptions are exacting; the feel is high quality. This writer can make any story interesting. Five Stars is not enough. --Amazon Top Reviewer", "related": ["B0093ARGLE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.4286, "rating_total": 31.0}

In another piece, West describes the comedic antics of her cat Pounce, and, in a third, laments the space constraints imposed on book reviewers by newspapers. In her book reviews, West calls Dickens a nasty man; Solzhenitsyn a courageous and immensely gifted patriot; and Richard Nixon, she says, had a mind so unsophisticated and so narrowly educated that he has almost no mental context. Throughout, West is caustic and outspoken. But with a scanty introduction by Anne Bobby, who co-wrote and starred in a one-woman Off-Broadway show about West, and no background information about the pieces, these disjointed articles have the feel of leftovers that won't draw in new admirers.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I'm really looking forward to them, it's soul crushing when u find an awesome read and suddenly you're on the last page - nothing I've picked up since has had the same effect on me\" --Fan MailI have just finished reading your book (Losing my Virginity 52 times) and just wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed it. A friend put me on to it by saying, my housemate is reading a book that reminds me of you . He explained it to me and I agreed that it did sound like me! After a pretty tough start to 2008, this year I have had the list , which is a list of things I am doing, that I would never normally do. The list ranges from things as extreme as bungy jumping, to as mediocre as eating beetroot for the first time (completely overrated). So, I purchased your book to take with me to New Zealand a couple of weeks ago (apart from wanting to read it, I figured the title would make me appear really interesting to other people, and could be a good conversation starter, which it was). Whilst there I was able to tick off skiing, bungy jumping and cycling through the Marlborough wine region to name just a few. Sky diving was cancelled due to the weather and unfortunately I didn t have time to reschedule. That one will have to wait. I finished reading your book on the plane on the way home and I thought it was great. I m glad I started my list before your book came out, or else I m pretty sure people would think I was copying you! There are a lot of similarities! Amongst other things, I ve still got singing and playing (guitar) at an open mike night to go on my list, and since reading your book I have added the Sydney Harbour Bridge climb. The mother of one of the Grade One students I teach wants to take me speed dating with her, so maybe I ll give that one a go too! Congrats on the book, I hope it does really well. I loved it and have recommended it to several of my friends. --Fan Mailjust read ur book n wanted to say its awesome..ur interesting and very funny. cheers for keepin me company those lonely nites in bed;) carmie --Fan Mail", "related": ["B007028IXM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The principles and aphorisms contained herein became a staff for me at the time and many of these formed the basis of the belief system that supports my psychology. They transformed the most chronic of problems easily and became the cornerstones and building blocks for a brighter, more positive future. Enlightenment for Beginners aims to educate and enlighten you, increase your awareness and give you an expanded view of what we call life. I hope to share this knowledge with you it comes from the depths of my awareness. With understanding and a solid foundation every problem we encounter becomes a way of extending ourselves and transforms into a gift. After taking \"The Road to Recovery\" and a short journey within, we can safely and confidently return to the mainstream of life with renewed interest and energy. Seeing where we are now, and how far we have come, allows us to settle into life knowing we are guided, gifted, supported and rewarded, throughout this intrinsic tapestry of life. I hope you have at least as much fun reading Enlightenment for Beginners as I did writing it. If I can help one person walk into the future with an open mind and a grateful heart then it would all have been worthwhile.\"Matt Blythe", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When the new teacher arrives , Hannah's mother is persuaded to allow her to go to school. The first day is a disaster, but is followed by better days as Hannah proves that she can learn by listening and finds out that she can get books in Braille. In the end the children band together under the leadership of the class bully to earn money to buy her a Braille writer. This is a gentle story that sensitively portrays Hannah's feelings, especially as she is taken on her first tour of the farm by the new teacher. However, the ending is too perfect, as the bully becomes concerned with someone else's welfare, and learning seems to be an easy matter for Hannah. And if the family has no money for a Braille writer, one wonders how they can get books in Braille. Hannah's mother too readily agrees for her to leave home and go to school, and some readers are sure to wonder why no survival skills were taught to a child of this period. Bowan's realistic pencil drawings are well placed and greatly enhance the book's drama and appeal. Pleasant, but not really believable. --Margaret C.

He served in the Royal Engineers (popularly known as 'sappers') from 1907-19, being awarded the Military Cross during World War 1. He started writing in France, adopting thepen name because serving officers were not allowed to write under their own names. When his first stories, about life in the trenches, were published in 1915 they were an enormous success. But it was his first thriller, Bulldog Drummond (1920) that launched him as one of the most popular novelists of his generation. It had several amazingly successful sequels, including The Black Gang, The Third Round and The Final Count. Another great success was Jim Maitland (1923), featuring a footloose English sahib in foreign lands. Sapper published nearly thirty books in total, and a vast public mourned his death when he died in 1937, at the early age of forty-eight.", "related": ["B00EXRFLBO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

By winter, the bunny has \"found a friend\" to snuggle with in the snow, and by spring, they bring three new baby bunnies to the garden. A slinking elderly cat provides a non-scary chase now and then, but in Schulman's gentle world there are no marauding owls, no Mr. McGregor. The emphasis is on peace and tranquility, and the sweet bunny even takes time to smell the flowers. So's enchanting illustrations seem a bit cramped on these petite pages, but the paintings accentuate the glories to be found in each season. Bright-red poppies dot a sea of wildflowers, yellow maple leaves swirl around orange pumpkins, and the dancing rabbits create circular patterns in the white snow. \"What a wonderful garden someone has made just for me,\" thinks the brown bunny, and readers who are just developing an appreciation for nature's beauty will agree.

Ten years after he began practicing psychotherapy he undertook his first formal vision quest, with the support of a spiritual community. He began to explore how he might integrate into psychotherapy the experiences and learnings such a vision quest offers. He coined the terms ecotherapy and ecodrama in his writings as he worked on this integration. The Sacred Council of Your Wild Heart: Nature's Hope in Earth's Crisis is his latest effort in this integration. The book focuses on the importance of having a spiritual community to support a person in occasional questing after visions in the wilderness. Taegel sees a need for integrating these visions with an ongoing quest for connection with the multitude of selves that resides in each of us. Taegel uses the term Sacred Council to refer to the combination of the inner council of selves and the outer council of ancestral and non-human spirits.While most practicing psychotherapists are unlikely to expand what they do far enough to include the kind of shamanism Taegel practices in wilderness, we certainly can support it with the work we do with clients who choose to undertake such journeys outside our offices.  Not only do we court great adventure in so doing, but we also may put ourselves in a position to make a small but meaningful contribution to the survival of our species.John RheadVoices: The Art and Science of Psychotherapy, 6-2-12", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

One thing consistently seemed to slow people in their ability to retain the information and that was note-taking. Note-taking is a skill rarely taught in schools, but required every day in business. After two years of research on note-taking, shorthand, as well as time management I put together this book.I think you'll find that it is relevant both in schools and in business and covers just about everything you need to know to become a great note-taker. I've tried to make the book concise and interesting, but also a referance that you'll be able to return to again and again.", "related": ["B004UBCX3M"], "rank": 1086842, "title": "Effective Note-taking", "author": "Rick Dearman", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So why aren’t we happier? Why doesn’t the good fortune of the times outweigh the bad? Australian author Malouf offers a penetrating meditation on happiness, quoting thinkers and philosophers from Kant to Plato, from Aristotle to Locke. He gives close examination to Thomas Jefferson’s thinking in developing the Declaration of Independence with its famous evocation of the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and the significance of that evocation at the time and since. Malouf draws on etymology, psychology, religion, and philosophy to explore the meaning of happiness in a developed society, when greater freedom and leisure afford the luxury to ponder what makes us truly happy. In this slim volume, Malouf eloquently weighs the appeal of material goods and well-being against the heft of morality and individual longing for something we can’t always articulate. --Vanessa Bush", "related": ["B00CYUBYCM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her mother also accepts \"Popsicle.\" Her father, who hasn't seen his dad since he was five years old, is less than enthusiastic. However, when the older man has a stroke and can't remember where he lives, Arthur relents and lets him stay with his family while he recuperates. Eventually, Cessie's parents place him in the Shangri-La nursing home. The girl then takes action, finding his home, an old lifeboat named Lucie Alice, and in it a faded photograph of a young French woman and a news clipping from which she learns that the boat had been part of the heroic evacuation of British soldiers from Dunkirk. These items help restore Popsicle's memory and renew his zeal for returning to France to find this woman who had hidden him from the Germans after he was jolted off the lifeboat. Cessie secretly accompanies her grandfather and several other escapees from Shangri-La on an improbable journey across the English Channel. Saddened to learn that the woman hasn't been seen since the Germans arrested her in 1940, Popsicle and his crew head back to England. The family is reunited on the dock and the story ends all neat and tidy. Too neat and tidy, in fact, as are many other contrived plot elements. Aside from Popsicle, the characters lack depth and are fed to readers in such a piecemeal fashion that it is difficult to identify with them and to rejoice at their eventual reunion.Peggy Morgan, The Library Network, Southgate, MICopyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Wells and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (his second pastiche, following 2011's Sherlock Holmes: The Breath of God) offers more action than deduction. Holmes' brother, Mycroft, takes the unusual step of travelling to Baker Street to enlist his sibling's help. Under Mycroft's guidance, the British government's efforts to safeguard the nation resulted in investigations into how humans might be modified to fight in harsh environments and climates. That initiative led Mycroft to the experiments of Dr. Charles Moreau, who fled England after details of his gruesome vivisections were exposed. Subsequently, reports emerged that the scientist had started anew on a remote island, where he created \"absurd combinations of man and beast.\" Mycroft fears that the resultant creatures may be connected with a series of savage deaths near Rotherhithe, which appear to be the work of mysterious animals. Despite an over-the-top ending, Adams' obvious affection for the characters will leaving more traditional Sherlockians hoping he'll uses his gifts at recreating them in a less-fantastic narrative.

H. Entwhistle's rowboat makes it into a remote fishing village on the coast of British Columbia. A group of kids including the narrator, a boy best known as Thumb, take the Englishman to their town, population 138. It is then that the nine children come up with a plan for a school-sponsored visit to a big city. And Mr. Entwhistle, author and illustrator of the Bobby and Bernice Beaver books, assumes a role as unique as his outfit on the foggy day his boat came to the village. The kids realize that they have enough players for a baseball team. Although they've never played the game, they make creative decisions and preparations for the provincial championship in Vancouver, supported by Thumb's father, the schoolmaster. The trip has surprising results while allowing the players to experience a big city, so different from their hometown, which has 42 buildings and no roads. Thumb's voice is wise, allowing humor to arise from his observations of others and their responses to sights and events. The setting is both familiar and exotic; the children are geographically isolated but research baseball and more via the Internet. The characters are appealing and the plot unfolds naturally to create a satisfying and plausible story. Thumb, as an adult, no longer lives in New Auckland but returns with his children to view the trophy and carry on an old family baseball tradition.–Maria B.

Some examples would be the impact from lack\nof spares for high tech military systems or how the battle to secure a large\ncity from gangs might occur. This book series takes it as a given that large, organized gangs exist -\nthey do today and takes the small leap that displaced people will likely become violent - that\nthe two would work together is pure conjecture.The old saw of 'social chaos is\nthree missed meals away' is more truth than not, one need only to look at\nrecent history.The book also takes a small look at possible political issues, how various\ngroups might be treated, used and abused. Finally, there is no happy ending -\nnor would there be in such a chaotic situation - as they say, that's real life.The statistics for loss of life from starvation and disease the characters\ntalk about are at the low end of the open source data I could find in my\nresearch. Once the magic stops - and delivery of food to your local grocery\nstore ceases, the electricity is gone and so is the water, lights and\nrefrigerator - life will be vastly different. For some people, life will be\nmuch shorter as well.As you read this book series, I hope you examine your own situation and take\nsteps to ensure you, your family, and loved ones can weather a storm of any\ntype, natural or manmade.EnjoyDKR/dkr", "related": [], "rank": 1756957, "title": "World of the Chrnyi : Pedro Six Two", "author": "D.

It subscribes to an open, ecumenical current in Catholicism, merging principles with liberal values. Every edition brings substantial views on politics, society, culture, history, international affairs and science, as well as commentaries and columns by recognized contributors.Founded in 1945, Tygodnik has published giants of Polish culture like Czeslaw Milosz, Zbigniew Herbert and Leszek Kolakowski.

I've been cooking for pretty much as long as I can remember\nand have been collecting recipes for most of that time. (Both my\ndaughters already do the same thing - they each started their own recipe\n collection aged about 10.)Because I've collected recipes for so long I have literallythousandsof them! They're in books, files, boxes, spilling off bookshelves and peeping out from behind the bread bin in the kitchen!Putting\n this book together actually started out as a result of me finally\ndeciding to try and put all my recipes in some sort of logical order. It\n was to be a big 'tidy up' operation. One day I thought it would be fun\njust to put together my absolute favorites into a collection I'd be\nproud to share with my friends. And that's how the idea for this book\nwas born.But a big problem soon reared its head - I just have so\n many recipes that it was going to be a huge task and I wasn't sure how I\n could ever accomplish it all. A good friend gave me some very valuable\nadvice and suggested I just break it up into little chunks and tackle it\n one small stage at a time. So that's what I did. If you like what you see please feel free to have a look\nthrough my other titles - I hope you'll find them every bit as\nscrumptious!As I say in the book's Introduction, above all I\nwant you to have fun with these recipes. They're simple to make and they\n really do taste delicious. Over the years I've served them up to plenty\n of  different people who feel the same way, but don't just take our\nword for it - try them for yourself and see.(By the way, I plan to release more recipe books in the future. I like\nto get real warts-and-all feedback before publishing and to do that I\ngive away free copies of each new title. Would you be interested in\ngetting one of these free books to review?

The Portuguese also sought to stamp out the ancient traditions of Hinduism and Islam throughout their Asian territories everyone living in Portuguese India, centered in Goa, was forced to convert to Catholicism. The Witch Hunter gets wealthy by arresting women accused of being the consorts of Satan. As an official, but very much the showman, Andrade is sent to Goa to work for the Office of the Inquisition. There his life is thrown into turmoil when he is convinced that he needs to possess a navaratna, a jewelled amulet. In this historical novel, we follow the Witch Hunter on a Quixotic journey through colonial India. Oblivious of the true conditions of the world which he has entered, he clings to his old ways as he tries to create his own reality. He is poisonedsick and half-crazed, he goes in search of the jewels that he believes will restore his health. He blunders through a tiger hunt, goes to war, does his work in the torture chambers of the Grand Inquisitor and presides over a farcical witch-trial gone wrong. Eventually, he too is thrown into the inquisitors dungeons to face trial for heresy. - See more at: http://christophermatthewspub.com/the-witch-hunters-amulet/#sthash.owbbVbws.dpuf", "related": [], "rank": 1485783, "title": "The Witch Hunter's Amulet", "author": "Marco Lobo", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Barbara starts off by taking a look at some of the crazy things that pet owners do with, for, and about their pets, but she is certainly not talking about the reader as she points those out, right? She also looks at irrational fears from lightning strikes to fear of bears while living in Florida. From there, she goes into an examination of a long list of hilarious irrational fears, one of which is hippotomonstro... (oh, just read the book). Have you ever thrown your back out by sneezing or do you enjoy a hobby that is just a little on the side of lunacy? Barbara's book touches on these things and more in a way that will keep you in stitches as you flip from one page to the next and even do a few \"back flips\" to see if you actually, really read what you just read.\n If you are someone who enjoys real humor that you see in the crazy people around you, but not in yourself, of course, then Barbara Venkataraman's book is a must-read. The stories are quick and easy to digest and will have the reader snorting with laughter. Though these stories are most certainly about people \"other than the reader\", there is always that outside chance she is talking about you. For that reason alone, this book needs to be on your shelf.", "related": ["B00HCS3WGW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 13, "rating_average": 4.3846, "rating_total": 57.0}

Thompson embroils Simon in an outrageous plot: a secret society of power-hungry business students are using subterfuge and scandal to reorganize the university to their liking. Simon and the wacky psychology professor Grebe recognize the perpetrators and their motives just in time to thwart unjust resignations and Simon's expulsion for cheating. This tongue-in-cheek novel mocks the competitive psyche of business majors. Thompson's informal, parenthetical style works better with this zany plot than in his more suspenseful books like A Band of Angels (Scholastic, 1986) . Nevertheless, many will find the writing to be coy, sarcastic, and patronizing and the crude sexual innuendos offensive. The absurdites of ``everyday'' life at Riddle University will probably bewilder most pre-college readers. Wit is not a successful substitute for literary craftsmanship.

Her father fuelled her passion by buying her two books every month, many of them classics. She loved books and one day wanted to write her own. That dream faded away as life got in the way and only once she had a baby and a toddler and spent many hours looking after them playing out-side, did the dream began to reignite inside of her. Thinking that she wanted to write children’s books, she completed a “Writing for Children Craft Course” and wrote three children’s books as part of a series. Then came baby number three and a move back to her home country after living in Zambia for seven years. Only when she went back to work, and had many hours to spare in a quiet bookshop, did she start writing again. After writing one children’s fantasy novel, an idea for an adult novel stirred within her. Thus began her love affair with writing romance. Since then, she has written several romance novels and self-published some books on the web and one print book. Kathy has spent the last few years writing, reading blogs about writing, learning from published authors on how to polish her talent, and studying grammar books. She writes to relax and have time away from her many household duties and her daytime job of homeschooling her three children.", "related": ["B00HNEEAY8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This is my first foray into horror. I was sitting around the house one day, watching television, when it hit me. I wanted to write about zombies.Now, zombies have been around for a long time, and they've been changed from type to type over the years, so I knew I had a challenge ahead of me when I began. The choice I faced was: do I do the familiar undead cannibal, or should I do something really weird?Anyone who knows me will tell you that they would have expected weird. That's exactly what I did, and I had so much fun doing it that I would constantly tell my family about the newest mischief I'd just created. It seems to have worked out really well, I think.Are they zombies? Yes... sort of. Are they gross, evil, and fun? Heavens, I hope so. I certainly think they are. Bleeding Water is dark and gory.

My hope is that pastors and church leaders will reassess what the mandate for the church really is--what the Great Commission really entails--and recognize what large-scale outreach efforts and pressure to evangelize does to people in their congregations, especially people who are gifted for other types of ministry or who have more introverted personalities. The question is, is the outreach pressure in evangelicalism justified by scripture?We send out a message that everyone who is really serious about his or her faith will be an extroverted evangelist, and that those who don't feel comfortable in that role simply need to become more committed and \"get out of their comfort zones.\" I've dealt with that message all my life, and I'm convinced that it's counterproductive. It sucks the joy out of Christian life and invalidates the gifts of all but a narrow group of believers. If we're all allowed to to be who God made us and exercise the gifts we've been given, we can together fulfill the larger message of the Great Commission, making disciples, which includes everything from showing love to people who are hostile or indifferent to the gospel, all the way to sophisticated theological instruction and practical relational discipleship.The domination of people's social lives by the church is a secondary theme developed in the later chapters. Churches under persecution thrive and grow despite being unable to do the kinds of organized outreaches common among churches in the West. I'm convinced that part of the reason for this is that churches under persecution cannot dominate their people's social lives, and so you don't have the problem you do with the church in America of people having their entire circle of friends composed entirely of believers. We can't be salt and light to the world if our lives are dominated by the church. Participation as individuals in community clubs, classes, and activities that we like can be far more effective in creating relationships to reach people than organized church outreaches. But we can't do that if we end up spending all our time involved in church activities.I hope that you likeWhat's Wrong with Outreach,that it helps you evaluate yourself and your ministry in more biblical terms, and that you can find joy in becoming who you were meant to be--not the cookie-cutter version that someone else, no matter how well intentioned, told you that you should be.", "related": [], "rank": 1809329, "title": "What's Wrong with Outreach: Reexamining Evangelism, Discipleship, and the Purpose of Christian Life", "author": "Keith Edwin Schooley", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This new novel, found in manuscript form among his papers, will come as a bit of a surprise to many of his fans. It is, of all things, a pirate novel. Set in 1665, it tells the story of Captain Charles Hunter, a privateer who’s hired by the governor of Jamaica’s Port Royal to steal a Spanish galleon and its cargo of gold treasure. Don’t expect to see Jack Sparrow in this story of pirates of the Caribbean, though: Crichton doesn’t play his pirates for laughs. And this is no typical pirate adventure, either: it’s actually a caper novel posing as a high-seas adventure. All the key caper-novel elements are here: the target, the mastermind, the plan, the motley crew, the ruthless villain, the gadgets, the twist, and the turncoat. Crichton keeps us in a constant state of suspense, never revealing quite what his hero, Captain Hunter, has up his sleeve, and the novel ends most unexpectedly. Pirate fans will love the book for its flashy characters and historical authenticity. Crime fans will enjoy the caper-novel structure and the way the author keeps them on their toes. If this really is Crichton’s final book, it’s a splendid send-off: something new, different, and daring. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The characters I meet along the way often find their way into my writing and of course the world provides me with diverse locations as backdrops.”  He describes himself not as a musician, a songwriter or a novelist, but as a storyteller.

It tries to paint a realistic, or at least reasonably believable, picture of life after a global collapse, of a world thatshouldbe recovering from the disaster, but for some reason, isn't.The narrator, Asuka Jane \"AJ\" Smith, is dropped, quite literally, into 2033 CE Las Vegas, an anarchic crucible isolated from the rest of the world by a vast desert from which there is no practical means of escape. Her arrival and subsequent actions change the delicate balance of power among the various groups and individuals living there, resolving and provoking conflicts among the denizens in equal measure. She finds greatness thrust upon her as a handful of fellow survivors rally around her, trusting in her ability to make rational decisions and keep them all alive. However, her choices strain her sense of morality and justice, and she constantly struggles as her humanity is pitted against the cold, hard math of a situation where all actions have consequences, and one miscalculation could be her last.", "related": ["B00I9E5G3U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Worley offers a masterful guide, providing rich philosophical questions and a clearly outlined method to support teachers in nurturing creative and critical thinking in their students. He has interwoven ethics, theory of knowledge, metaphysics, social philosophy, aesthetics into a narrative 'odyssey', using the iconic story of the human search for truth, beauty and goodness. I can easily see this text being adopted in elementary, secondary and even college level. Wendy C. Turgeon, Associate Professor of Philosophy, St. Joseph's College, New York, USA -- Wendy C. Turgeon What Peter Worley has achieved with The If Odyssey is nothing short of genius! As a secondary school teacher of English, Theories of Knowledge and Philosophy, I find this book an irreplaceable resource. Not only does it present the teacher with crucial pedagogical instruction, but with a systematic program in how to cultivate the requisite skills of storytelling. Moreover, Worley synthesises, with clarity and precision, how to relate key philosophical concepts to each of the stories from The Odyssey. Simply brilliant!? Mark C. Blythe, Teacher and Postgraduate Researcher in Philosophy of Education -- Mark C. Blythe Anything that inspires people to think and to understand how to think is a great boon. This book is just such a boon, and a great addition to the Worley assault on unthinking-ness. ?Professor A. C. Grayling, Master of the New College of the Humanities -- Professor A. C. Grayling Brilliantly thought provoking, the If Odyssey hooks you from the start and draws you in as cleverly, compellingly and seemingly effortlessly as if it had been put together by the 'wily' Odysseus himself. This is philosophy at its most approachable. David Stuttard, writer, classical historian and author of Power Games: Ritual and Rivalry at the Ancient Greek Olympics -- David Stuttard This splendid book by Peter Worley offers excellent material to help teachers introduce philosophical dialogue in their classes. Worley presents a good classic story, adapted to our time while remaining faithful to the original text, and suggests a multitude of activities and didactic orientations. It is one of the most useful books I've ever read. Felix Garcia Moriyon.

That the Blood Stay Pure looks to me like a prize-winner. The author attacks the broad history of race in US history—the ways it has worked, the ways in which it has been portrayed, including by historians and anthropologists—with an empirical focus on Virginia as a particularly illuminating case study. Every chapter takes a provocative, fresh look at its subject.\" —Peter Wallenstein, Virginia Tech\"Coleman has produced a provocative book, dealing with situations that are, as she notes, 'filled with controversy and pain.' From the first arrival of African workers as servants and slaves in 1619, Indian-Black relations have been engaged in, denied, legislated, and above all complicated by sociohistorical constructions of race and the meanings and values of racially defined groups. Sifting through the histories and writing clearly and openly, Coleman seeks to untangle the webs of meaning and fairly represent the individuals and groups involved. This powerful volume is a significant contribution to the literatures on race and race-relations in Virginia.\" —Frederic W. Gleach, author ofPowhatan's World and Colonial Virginia: A Conflict of Culture\"This is strong, innovative work that historicizes and challenges the legal construction and maintenance of ‘racially pure’ categories, as well as established hierarchies of race and privilege. Coleman’s project moves far beyond America’s fading, ‘black-white binary’ as a means of mapping the nation’s racial politics. In doing so, the book suggests a far more multicultural future on the horizon. Thoroughly researched and well written, That the Blood Stay Pure is necessary reading.\" —Ed Guerrero, New York University\"That the Blood Stay Pure provides a crucial missing chapter of America's racial history--the toxic consequences of Virginia's racial purity campaign on Black-Indian identities and relationships. Coleman boldly confronts the taboo topic of anti-Black racism that endures in some Indian tribes, while offering an alternative vision of recognition, reconciliation, and respect. This eye-opening book will expand and challenge your thinking about race.\" --Dorothy Roberts, University of Pennsylvania--Dorothy Roberts, University of Pennsylvania", "related": ["B00EST1O68"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Proudly I admit from the Park Slope area. It is there where my roots began and where my personality and values developed. It's there where I learned the true meaning of friendship and of love. It is also where I learned the importance of laughter and where I formulated my sense of humor. I was fortunate to have been raised by parents so deeply in love that I became a hopeful romantic. Brooklyn is a cauldron of diversity, but when introduced to the Italian culture at a young age by my friend Marie, I was fascinated with it. I was drawn into it with its deep family loyalties, the tightness of the extended family ties, the acceptance of true friends as family and of course the food. In my twenties was the first time I had met anyone who was Deaf. We became friends and she introduced me to the culture of the Deaf world. Intriguingly it is with this culture where I have focused most of my career. I have worked with the Deaf community in a variety of capacities, two of my favorites being the teaching of American Sign Language and Interpreting. I currently live in upstate New York with my two daughters who attend college and my Yellow Labrador Retriever. My true passion is writing. I've seen bumper stickers that say \"I'd rather be sailing, fishing, skiing\" or some other activity. If I could find one I'd put on my bumper: \"I'd rather be writing\".

New findings provide evidence of a principal importance of the immune cells for controlling this interaction and orchestrating multiple events in the tumor microenvironment. The balance between immune cells that support tumor progression and immune cells that sustain tumor-controlling immune surveillance is tightly regulated by various factors originated from both the malignant and non-cancerous cells in the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of multidirectional immunological responses at the tumor site allows forming a new concept ofThe Tumor ImmunoEnvironment, which is introduced and discussed in the present book with a particular focus on the role of immune cells in controlling the tumor microenvironment at different stages of cancer development. The main goal of this publication is to provide an overview of the current knowledge on the complex and unique role of the immune system, tumor-associated inflammation and tumor-mediated immunomodulation in cancer progression in a way that allows understanding the logistics of cellular and molecular interactions in the tumor lesions. Moreover, it is discussed how these interactions evolve during cancer progression and in response to different kinds of anticancer therapy. It is anticipated that the book will attract many researchers and clinicians in the field of basic and applied tumor immunobiology and open new opportunities for collaborative programs aiming at the development of effective and feasible therapeutic approaches to cancer treatment.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bob and his wife Linda are Relationship Mentors who teach children and adults how to build healthy relationships. His experiences have helped him to become a published author.  Bob is the Founder/Director of Youth With A Purpose Inc.  YWAP is a Relationship Mentoring Program that has been working with young people for over 10 years. YWAP Programs can be found in school, after school, in the neighborhood and in the mountains. Our Classroom Mentoring Program helps raise grades and reduce behavioral problems in the Buffalo Schools.            Bob is an experienced wilderness guide who has helped many young people climb the mountains of life as well as the Adirondack Mountains in NY. Children are sometimes safer on top of a mountain than they are on city streets. Buffalo, NY is one of the most impoverished and violent cities in America. As a member of Climbing for Christ, Bob trekked on Mt. Kilimanjaro along with serving in orphanages in Tanzania and Malawi.  Bob loves to see the look on a gang members face as he or she stands on top of a mountain for the first time. The greatest view in the world is the sight of accomplishment as a young person stands atop one of the mountains of life. We believe in teaching healthy relationship skills. A young lady should expect to be respected by a young man. All children are gifted.  Bob is a speaker, songwriter, and published author (Prayer The Book.) His favorite sayings are: \"It's good to see you!\"  \"How can I help you?\"  \"Thanks for your time, go do something nice for somebody!\"  \"Jesus loves you and so do we!\"", "related": [], "rank": 3637036, "title": "Prayer The Book", "author": "Bob Kuebler", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Listening to Fred and the new traditions of old horsemanship puts Ben squarely at odds with his father Pete s ideas of the old  tried and true cowboy up and ride out the buck that he wants his son to learn. All the while, Ben s faced with the realities of dealing with life s lessons in loyalty, responsibility, family, and how we get along with people and horses alike. Although Jan s work is fiction, I can say that, coming from the background I have and looking back at parts of my youth, back in the day, There s a whole lot of truth in the story of Starting the Colt. A great read! --Smokie Brannaman, author of Whisper This... Not to Your Horse, to Yourself and Equiknowlogy 101Jan Young has written an authentic work, both in general and in the details. Her understanding of ranch life in northern Nevada is clear and true. Also her portrayal of the Lucas family is genuine and quite poignant at times. The adolescent struggles of young Ben are played out against a rich backdrop of a world where self-sufficiency and being a good neighbor are considered the norm. His youthful trials and tribulations as he strives to please his father and yet hold true to his own ideals are engaging to read. The author has not only researched her subject well but also has a clear understanding of the changing times with regard to working with horses on a cattle ranch. This is a very enjoyable read! --John Saint RyanJan Young s second novel, Starting the Colt, presents colt starting and horse training at its best. Twelve-year-old Ben Lucas faces a choice many colt starters must make use the traditional method of breaking a colt or step outside of the box and work with the horse and learn its language. Readers also follow Ben through other adventures and anticipate the choices he will make to avoid getting into trouble. It s refreshing to read about rural life through the eyes of youth. Ben s work ethic and his ability to reason through his trials and adventures make him a good role model for readers of his age. Young s experience in Nevada s ranching community adds credibility and accuracy to her novels, which makes reading Ben s story that much more meaningful. --Becky McGuyer, high school journalism teacher and avid horse rider", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a high school student, he played piano, tuba and alto saxophone and feverishly collected re- cords—particularly jazz LPs. Attending The College of New Jersey (TCNJ), including a year spent abroad in Japan at Kansai Gaidai University, he graduated Magna Cum Laude with a degree in Finance. Gregg then worked for Merrill Lynch covering the Asia-Pacific markets, and later for Cas- pian Securities in Manila, Philippines as a food & beverage analyst. Returning to the U.S. in the late ‘90s, he reconnected with his passion for music and began experimenting as a DJ, ini- tially playing house parties for friends. Inspired by attend- ing his sister’s wedding, he invested in his first professional DJ sound system in 2003 and began booking parties under his new company “Ambient DJ Service.” Since then, Ambient DJ Service has quickly grown to be- come one of the top providers of wedding DJ entertainment in Central New Jersey. Ambient DJ Service is a four- year consecutive winner of the WeddingWire “Bride’s Choice Award” and a 2013 winner of The Knot’s prestigious “Bestof Weddings” award in the category of Disc Jockeys. Ambi- ent DJ Service was also voted “Best Disc Jockey Service in New Jersey” in the 2013 Wedding Industry Expert Awards. Gregg performs at over 200 events a year. Gregg currently serves as the President of New Jersey’s largest and premier association of professional mobile disc jockeys, the New Jersey Disc Jockey Network (NJDJN).

As ever, the Stuarts must lean heavily on faith and family as they pray fervently for the safe return of their kin. Join master storyteller Gilbert Morris as he takes you from the Arkansas hills to the jungles of Guadalcanal, from Hollywood to the forests of Germany. Skillfully weaving romance and danger, broken hearts and redemption, Morris offers another fast-paced and thrilling adventure to fans of the continuing Stuart saga.

It is compelled to quickly move beyond the status quo, and to choose a new path of greater light.\"This little book purports to divide the world into two groups--those who read, acknowledge and implement its precepts, and those who don't. It suggests that the life of every human being is equivalent to an apple seed. Our purpose on earth is to learn how to relinquish the seed life, and gain the spiritual equivalent of the apple tree, firmly rooted and bearing fruit for eternity. The biblical account of Jacob and Esau best exemplifies this principle.Jacob, the son of Isaac and Rebekah, pursued the rooted life. He was renamed Israel and gave birth to twelve sons, through whom he fathered the nation of Israel that has produced the world's Messiah. Esau, his twin brother, pursued the seed life, and faded into obscurity several thousand years ago.It is in the pursuit of the rooted life that the seed life becomes transformed of its relatively mundane insignificance, and gains a power far superior to itself. Only then does it have the potential to transcend the tumultuous. Only then does it gain the capacity to lay the foundation for the rooted life.Today, we reenact the Isaac and Rebekah principle--one womb bearing twin brothers who, because of their choices, become two nations with two different trajectories. Similarly, one book, the Creator's Word to his children of the twenty-first century, each having two possible responses that lead to two trajectories (Psalm 95; Revelation 12:5; 17).Irrespective of your religious affiliation, religious title, or spiritual condition, you have two choices at this moment in time. You can be part of the house of Esau. Or you can become a spiritual Israelite which requires of every seeker a conscious and unconditional surrender of the seed life. No one should presume to know how to do so prior to reading this little book because \"there will be no survivors from the house of Esau\" (Obadiah 1:18).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Additionally, she has written multiple screenplays, and contributed her writing to many non-profit and for profit organizations. She launched several blogs over the years, which garnered international attention.  In 2013, Novelle returned to her first love – fiction. Writing under the names Renee Novelle and R.S. Novelle, she has a publication schedule that includes Psychological Thrillers, Suspense, Paranormal Fiction, Contemporary Women’s fiction, Chick Lit, and New Adult. Though she received her Bachelor’s of Science in Communication, summa cum laude, she considers herself a constant student of the written word. She’s an avid reader, an enthusiastic quote poster, and rarely takes “no” as a final answer. She has an unhealthy obsession for theater, dance, music and art, and strongly believes that wine is simultaneously the beginning of, and resolution to, all of life’s problems. She believes in following dreams, and that in the end, you always end up where you meant to be.

There are all sorts of ecommerce sites on the web. Why do so many of your books focus specifically on eBay?Answer. I think eBay offers the best shot for new sellers to gain traction selling online. eBay is easy to get started selling on; it has a built in customer base of over 250 million eager buyers; and you can sell just about anything.Question: That last part is the million dollar question, what are the best things to sell on eBay if you want to make money?Answer: That's the great thing about eBay. It really doesn't matter what you sell. There are so many people on the site, with so many interests, that you can sell just about anything if you package it right.Question: Can you give us a few examples?Answer: Think cell phones, consumer electronics, and video games. eBay has hundreds of sellers moving these same items. The problem is these are almost impossible fields to compete in. You're up against the likes of Best Buy and the other big box giants.Question: So what do you do?Answer: Smart sellers narrow their focus down and serve a niche.     Do you service and sell used cell phones? There's a huge market for refurbished phones on eBay. If you have a ready source of phones, and can restore them to factory settings you're going to do well.     Let me give you another example. My Kindle went crazy last fall and wouldn't charge. None of the computer stores in town wanted to look at it. The one guy I did find who was willing to give it a shot wanted eighty bucks, but he wouldn't guarantee anything. I searched eBay and found a guy who would reset the charger stem (return postage included) for $34.95. When I checked his feedback he was doing a booming business, and he wasn't the only one. Five other sellers were thriving doing the same thing.     In my case, I take old magazines libraries and book stores are begging to get rid and harvest articles and pictures from them that sell for twenty to fifty dollars each. In fourteen years of doing it, I've made over thirty thousand sales.Question: But aren't there too many sellers already? How can the average guy hope to find a new niche that will make them money? Isn't it a little like finding the proverbial needle in the haystack?Answer: Ideas are all around you?     Do you run a local screen print shop? You can do short orders of six, twelve or twenty-five t-shirts and cater to the small business market. Are you an artist? Open up an eBay store and put your masterpieces out there for a larger market to find. Is there a local business in your area that everybody just loves? Test the waters and put a few of their products on eBay.     If you're really at a loss for what to sell, take a drive around town; open up the phone book; follow your kids around for a day and listen to what gets them excited.Question: Earlier you mentioned you can sell anything if you package it right. What did you mean by that?Answer: You've got to be creative in your listings. That means crafting awesome titles loaded with keywords; your pictures need to showcase what you're selling and make people want to buy it; you're item description needs to make customers drool for more.     I keep thinking back to a designer I use on Fiverr. She describes her book covers as being so realistic customers will want to reach out and lick them. Are auction listing so enticing customers will want to lick them. If not, you probably want to go back to the drawing board.Final Question: What's the best way to get started?Answer:  Dive in head first. So many people talk about what they want to do. They put all of these obstacles in their way. I'll do it when I can spare a thousand dollars. I'll start when I'm on vacation next summer and have the time to do it right. I need to get more information before I get started.    Listen to me. That's all a bunch of horse-hockey we tell ourselves to keep from trying. The best way to start doing something is to do it. Make a few mistakes. Who cares?     Read my books. Learn how to sell on eBay. Whatever you do, don't over think it. It's not rocket science.     What's the worst you can do? Loose a few bucks. Maybe make a few extra bucks. You'll never know until you give it a shot.", "related": [], "rank": 1849055, "title": "Make $1000 Selling on eBay Before Christmas (EBay Selling Made Easy Book 9) eBook", "author": "Nick Vulich", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For half a millennium, the Grand Banks cod had sustained international fishing fleets, boosted the world’s economy, become the flash point in power politics, and was the lifeblood of generations of villages perched on rocky outcrops along the Newfoundland coast. Crosbie’s announcement was the final nail in the Grand Banks coffin.What happened? For 16 years, accountability has been dodged. The media has been mute. Successive governments buried the shameful tale under layers of secrecy, subsidies and the “good news” story of off-shore oil.The new cod-fishing fleets – technological juggernauts with the capacity to ravage a sea floor – have denied responsibility. A few courageous marine biologists have spoken up, only to find themselves squarely in the sights of government censors. The in-shore fishery – the small-boat fishermen who plied the cold waters of the Banks for generations – now reflect bitterly on better times.When they saw the stocks decline – and their livelihood with it – they sounded the first alarm, but apparently no one was listening.  Alex Rose asks who is listening now. The answer to who killed the Grand Banks just might be another alarm bell for us today, signalling future environmental and ecosystem destruction. And while theories abound as to what caused the catastrophic collapse – botched science, timorous and fluctuating political will, a boom in the seal population -- it is indisputable that the ecosystem of the cold Grand Bank waters has changed dramatically.Despite a decade of rhetorical hand wringing, served up with dollops of Canadian official denial, Rose has salvaged one hard truth: the Grand Banks cod fishery was wiped out because of made-in-Canada greed and willful blindness. Newfoundlanders and Canadians, now shamed and embarrassed into a stony silence, worked overtime to decimate one of the world’s greatest biological bounties. In a frenzy of collective hysteria, Canadians created an environmental catastrophe here on our own shore.As the oil sands exploration gouges the landscape of northern Alberta, as overfishing hammers stocks of Pacific salmon, the fate of the Grand Banks has become a cautionary tale now told around the world. There’s a price to pay when a society ignores its role as a steward of the environment. This book poses the question of our generation: will the ecological disaster that befell the Northern cod happen again?", "related": [], "rank": 3438870, "title": "Who Killed The Grand Banks?", "author": "Alex Rose", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Como uma viajante internacional e cidadã global, sua curiosidade e pesquisa sobre o significado da vida para diferentes culturas a levou para mais de 45 países. Como resultado, ela aprendeu vários idiomas e entende os desafios e benefícios que um estilo de vida global tem para oferecer. Sua curiosidade sobre os mistérios da vida inspirou-a  a estudar Biologia na Universidade Santa Cecília em Santos / Brasil. Enquanto estudava lá, criou \"Projeto Viajando na Ciência\", uma colaboração de vários profissionais e voluntários, viajando com uma feira de conhecimento por comunidades carentes para incentivar e apoiar os alunos a desenvolver sua curiosidade, contribuindo e valorizando essa conexão.  Este programa continuou mesmo depois que Adriana se formou. O projeto continua a ser uma ferramenta poderosa para o desenvolvimento profissional dos estudantes, além de contribuir com as comunidades locais. Após a formatura, Adriana continuou a explorar as maneiras pelas quais as diferentes culturas lidam com desafios. Ela descobriu como construir pontes em todo o mundo através da criatividade e diversidade. Com cada nova experiência, ela foi tocada profundamente pela semelhança que conecta todos nós. A vida de Adriana foi uma cachoeira de desafios e resultados abençoados, impulsionado por sua curiosidade e amor. Ela descobriu que o sucesso se alcança, assumindo a auto responsabilidade e sendo proativo. Ela sempre foi respeitada e admirada por seus amigos, colegas e clientes por sua capacidade de combinar a sua experiência, sua compreensão das diferentes culturas, e sua habilidade de falar com o coração. Adriana estudou os princípios da Ayurveda na Índia. Ela viveu e facilitou negócios na China e Dubai. Ela participou de expedições pela a África, incluindo a escalada ao Monte Kilimanjaro. Também já trabalhou em missões e tem sido uma defensora para aqueles que sofrem o problema da violência doméstica. Ela já percorreu um longo caminho desde que aquela menina, nascida em uma comunidade muito pobre no Brasil decidiu sair para conquistar o mundo. Ao longo do caminho, ela atraiu uma rede internacional de amigos que se tornaram família.", "related": ["B00B0D2FTA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Some might still consider me to be young, yet I have experienced a lot in my life. There is a Chinese Proverb that says through great pain comes great knowledge, I have found this to be true. One of the main life lessons that I think more people need to understand is the power of positivism. Another saying, I believe it is from Abraham Lincoln is that if you look for the bad in people, you will surely find it. So, look for the good - much like Pollyanna (1960) and play the \"glad game\". After years and years of my mother telling me that I should use my talents and write, I finally listened. I am a Taurus and characteristically stubborn. Several years ago I began my writing career having started composing my first draft. In 2012, through the magic of self-publishing, my first book was set-free! I also blog, just about every day, as I created and write in several blogs.  My career training has mainly been with behavior management in the Special Education field. I started volunteering when I was 14, worked within a special needs school until the birth of my son in 2002, my son has special needs, and I am more of a consultant now. Associates of Arts degree in Psychology from the University of Phoenix. Originally, I wanted to help families with the challenges in life when we are caregivers for individuals with special needs. Coming from both sides of the spectrum, having both worked in the field and as a parent of a special needs child, I believe that I would be the ideal advocate for families.

With his mother and brother, he moved to England in 1919 and attended Rossall School in Lancashire before moving on to Cambridge University to study law. His studies there came to a halt when a publisher accepted his first novel. His third book, entitledMeet the Tiger!, was written when he was twenty years old and published in September 1928. It introduced the world to Simon Templar, aka the Saint.He continued to write about the Saint until 1983 when the last book,Salvage for the Saint, was published. The books, which have been translated into over thirty languages, number nearly a hundred and have sold over 40 million copies around the world. They’ve inspired, to date, fifteen feature films, three TV series, ten radio series, and a comic strip that was written by Charteris and syndicated around the world for over a decade. He enjoyed travelling but settled for long periods in Hollywood, Florida, and finally in Surrey, England. He was awarded the Cartier Diamond Dagger by the Crime Writers’ Association in 1992, in recognition of a lifetime of achievement. He died the following year.To find out more about Leslie Charteris and his work, visit www.lesliecharteris.com.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lovejoy, Director, The Harriet Tubman Institute)Survivors of Slaveryinvites the reader not only to consider the actual words on the page, but also to question context, voice, and what is not being said.(Sandra Morgan, Director, Global Center for Women and Justice at Vanguard University)As awareness of modern slavery explodes, the least heard but most important voices we need to hear belong to slavery survivors. It is a simple fact that if you have always lived in freedom the lived truth of slavery is unimaginable. For the slaves and ex-slaves this creates a deep gap, a sense that they will never be understood. Laura T. Murphy's superlativeSurvivors of Slaverybridges that gap and opens the door to understanding and healing. There are plenty of books to read if you want to understand modern slavery in your head, but if you want to understand the truth of slavery in your heart,read this book.(Kevin Bales, cofounder of Free the Slaves)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Born in Scotland, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a practising doctor when he began to write tales of mystery and adventure. In addition to the Sherlock Holmes stories, Conan Doyle also wrote the Professor Challenger adventures, and his classic, The Lost World, is one of the original fantasy novels. Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) was born in Edinburgh and studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh's Medical School. Graduating in 1881, he set up practice as an occultist, but as patients proved elusive he turned to writing. An important influence upon his literary career was his professor, Dr Joseph Bell, who could observe the most minute detail regarding a patient's condition. This master of deduction became the model for Conan Doyle's legendary literary creation, the detective Sherlock Holmes, introduced in A Study in Scarlet in 1887. Conan Doyle also espoused spiritualism and devoted considerable time and effort to a campaign of support for this cause. He also wrote successfully in genres other than detective fiction. His non-fiction includes military writing on the Boer War and pamphlets on spiritualism. It is known that he felt constricted at times by the popularity of Holmes, but it is nevertheless for Sherlock Holmes and his foil, the ponderous Dr Watson that he is best remembered. As Sherlock Holmes was the first detective to solve cases by deduction rather than due to an error by the criminal, Conan Doyle can be credited with creating the modern detective novel. He was knighted in 1902 for his support of the British cause in the Boer Wars. After the death of his son in the First World War, he devoted the rest of his life to spiritualism on which he wrote and lectured.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A young girl looks out her window and what does\nshe see? Flowers and rain and a bird in a tree. Outside Your Window, written by\nTerri Kelley and illustrated by Josefina Tecson, is a sweet treat. This\nstory has stanzas of poetry with easy rhymes so it reads a little like a song.\nEven young girls can have their own window on the world and experience the\ncolorful landscape.Author Terri Kelley writes the text from the girl's point of view. There is a\nfanciful depiction of Mother Nature who appears as a sort of fairy or garden\nangel. But most people, places, or things outside the girl's window are real\nand natural. The author's dedication to her friend Jenny Wheeler makes a nice\nintroduction to the story. Ms. Wheeler is a school counselor so she may be able\nto see things from a kid's perspective. The illustrations match nicely with the\npoetry, and there is a full range of colors which fill in the drawings' black\noutlines. The illustrations are child-like and that goes along with the\ninnocent wonder the girl may feel as she observes and appreciates nature in all\nher glory.", "related": [], "rank": 477964, "title": "Outside Your Window", "author": "Terri Kelley", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's a rare medical condition also known as CCHS or Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome. My daughter has this rare medical condition as do others. Born with this condition, a baby does not breath while asleep. A child does not outgrown this condition and requires the assistance of a ventilator or phrenic nerve pacing.Hard to believe my sweet child was born with a condition deemed a curse. For years, I cringed each time I encountered the reference and refused to even use the term.This book was written as a way for me to come to terms with the idea of a curse not being necessary a bad thing, but a condition that with planning, perseverance, and faith could turn out better than all right for my child.Note: Sweetest Curse also draws from Grimm's Little Mermaid insofar as the idea of mermaids becoming sea foam since they are born soulless. This story weaves myth, fairy tale, and real events about CCHS together into a fantasy romance set in Miami where I grew up and raised my own daughter.", "related": ["B00HUCDVY8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 20.0}

Usher Evans is an author, blogger, and witty banter aficionado. Born in a small, suburban town in northwest Florida, she was seventeen before she realized that not all beach sand is white. From a young age, she has always been a long-winded individual, first verbally (to the chagrin of her ever-loving parents) and then eventually channeled into the many novels that dotted her Windows 98 computer in the early 2000's. After high school, she got the hell outta dodge and went to school near the nation's capital, where she somehow landed jobs at National Geographic, Discovery Channel, and the British Broadcasting Corporation, capping off her educational career with delivering the commencement address to 20,000 of her closest friends. She determined she'd goofed off long enough with that television nonsense and got a \"real job\" as an IT consultant. Yet she continued to write, developing 20 page standard operating procedures and then coming home to write novels about bounty hunters, teenage magic users, and other nonsense. After a severe quarter life crisis at age 27, she decided to finally get a move on and share those novels with the world in hopes that she will never have to write another SOP again.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
