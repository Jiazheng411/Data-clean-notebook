Unfortunately, neither Daniels nor Littleton have the knack for developing characters; the majority of the large cast (listed helpfully up front) are introduced with lazy cliches (screenwriter Kevin Williamson \"was all youthful exuberance that day, sporting a sweet grin, tousled sandy blonde hair and deep-blue eyes\"), drawing life from behind-the-scenes discussion of deals, partnerships, creative development and ratings wars.

To catch the killer, Grove must delve into secrets of his past, enlist the aid of FBI recruit Edith Drinkwater and make an arduous cross-country trek.

Louise needs Gerry and Kathleen to help her collect on Lionel's life insurance. Lionel, it turns out, did not die of a heart attack, but of a heroin overdose?the question is, did he commit suicide? Kathleen's investigation takes her closer to the heart of power in L.A. but also to the realization that Lionel was murdered. The author of Keeping Counsel and Beyond Malice does what one expects of a good writer of legal thrillers, i.e., drives the plot through unexpected twists without overstretching the bounds of credible law. But Forster adds a bonus by transcending the flat stereotypes of the genre and creating, instead, diverse and realistically drawn characters.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 23, "rating_average": 4.4348, "rating_total": 102.0}

The story is set on Atlantian Earth, on board various ships in space, and on the far off world of Eden. It is full of rich characters, monsters and hardware, but it is packaged in a totally different way to anything that's been done before.Although there are many visual centrepieces, it is the relationships between the principal characters and their understanding of each other that is the main focus of the story. At first opposing one another, many of the characters are forced together and learn that they are very much the same despite their very different natures and origins. All the aliens have different viewpoints and agendas; there are no blind killers, and the borders between the good guys and the bad guys are deliberately blurred. The idea is to break through the barriers of both race and creed and to show that all are the same underneath.More information can be found at thefriendlyambassador.comVisit the author's website at booksandstories.com.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Flaubert's sentences are certainly sonorous in French, and the sentences in this translation reveal a similar attention to sound. . . . We are in debt to Flaubert for his influence on much of the writing we have today; the extent of our debt has never been so clear.\"-The BelieverAcclaim for Lydia Davis and her translation ofSwann's Way\"[Her] capacity to make language unleash entire states of existence reveals the extent to which Davis's fiction is influenced by her work as a translator.\"-The New York Times\"Few writers now working make the words on the page matter more.\"-Jonathan Franzen\"Davis is the best prose stylist in America.\"-Rick Moody\"Swann's Wayis transformed into something even more enchanting in Lydia Davis's new translation.\"-Vanity Fair\"Davis is closer,muchcloser, to Proust's French. . . . [Her]Swann's Wayis one of those translations . . . that put the question oflanguagesout of your mind, and leave you only with questions oflanguage.\"-The Village Voice\"Accessible and faithful to Proust. Davis replicates the hesitations and digressions, the backward looks and forward glances that swell Proust's sentences and send them cascading to their conclusion-without sacrificing the natural air of his style.\"-Los Angeles Times Book Review\"Davis is an extraordinary technician of language, capable of revealing elusive human tendencies through the most unusual means.\"-Bookforum\"[Davis] commands language and imagery, playing the reader like a master.\"-Los Angeles Times\"The subtleties of the French language, in spite of their difficulty, hold no secrets from you. . . . No literary genre deters you. You helped to make known to the English-speaking public some of the finest French literature of the century. . . .

Swaggering in front of the TV cameras, Bonolo takes all the credit for dispatching their captor. Angered by the slight, Claudia presses hard for information about the gated community's dealings, incurring Bonolo's wrath and that of his buddy, the mayor.

That would seem too far for even experienced Polynesian seafarers to cross open ocean, but this book's premise is that such crossings were not uncommon in pre-Columbian times. The idea dates back nearly 200 years, to the first suggestions of similarity in such features as culture, myth, language, fishhooks, boat design, and foods like sweet potato and chicken between coastal North and South America and parts of Polynesia. Based on a 2010 symposium, the dozen topical chapters review such similarities from archaeological and other data sources. Ranging from DNA studies of excavated chicken bones through statistical analyses of human crania (complementing other DNA work) to simple statements of similarity, the reported evidence supports connections between Polynesia and the Americas that suggest significant pre-Columbian contact. Negative views are not well represented, which violates one of the central principles of science, that hypotheses must survive falsification testing. Nonetheless, as reported in the multiauthored summary, the work presented here indicates that this theory is undergoing a strong revival. Recommended. All levels/libraries. (CHOICE)These conclusions have been based on fresh discoveries using newest techniques along with re-evaluation of longstanding but often-ignored evidences. This is a definitive and comprehensive publication.(Current Science2011-09-21)Polynesians in America, stemming from a symposium held at the annual meeting of the Society for American Archeology in St. Louis in 2010, addresses from fresh perspectives the question of contracts between Polynesia and the New World.

The facts of his life, known from surviving documents, are sparse. He was one of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a merchant of some standing in his community. William probably went to the King’s New School in Stratford, but he had no university education. In November 1582, at the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior, who was pregnant with their first child, Susanna. She was born on May 26, 1583. Twins, a boy, Hamnet ( who would die at age eleven), and a girl, Judith, were born in 1585. By 1592 Shakespeare had gone to London working as an actor and already known as a playwright. A rival dramatist, Robert Greene, referred to him as “an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers.” Shakespeare became a principal shareholder and playwright of the successful acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain’s Men (later under James I, called the King’ s Men). In 1599 the Lord Chamberlain’s Men built and occupied the Globe Theater in Southwark near the Thames River. Here many of Shakespeare’s plays were performed by the most famous actors of his time, including Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, and Robert Armin. In addition to his 37 plays, Shakespeare had a hand in others, includingSir Thomas MoreandThe Two Noble Kinsmen, and he wrote poems, includingVenus and AdonisandThe Rape of Lucrece. His 154 sonnets were published, probably without his authorization, in 1609. In 1611 or 1612 he gave up his lodgings in London and devoted more and more time to retirement in Stratford, though he continued writing such plays asThe TempestandHenry VIIuntil about 1613.

On board the Super Chief train, Groucho and Frank run into many Hollywood types, including producer Daniel Manheim with his latest discovery, Dian Bowers. When Groucho scares an intruder out of Manheim's room, foul play is obvious, but can he and Frank figure out who wanted to harm the producer, and why? Once in New York, events take a nasty turn as a real body appears in place of a dummy on a Broadway stage. Between wisecracks and endless renditions of \"Lydia the Tattooed Lady,\" Groucho tries to find the killer.

Interestingly enough, these changes were all up to code, so there was something about the code that overlooked this problem.In my training as a biomedical engineer, I understood certain issues about electrical wiring that are not privy to conventional electricians and applying this knowledge to the problem in a systematic manner did resolve all of these issues while still exceeding local electrical codes.It led me to believe that other homes may have similar built-in problems that should be easy to resolve, given that the correct approach is applied and all local codes are still held in compliance. I also suspect that reviewers of equipment share this same issue and are unaware of its contribution to their auditory impressions and why some insist that dedicated lines are run to power your system.The culprit is the assumptions you make about the outlet into which you plug your stereo gear. What seems to be totally innocent may have hidden problems buried deep within the walls.

It escapes in spurts of ink. Urgency, despair, enormous guilt and anger. A tortured man seeking oblivion from himself. Time and society are his jailors. Secretly written words his only escape. A rose blooms. Petals upon petals unfold, and one awaits the time when there are no more. But there is no taking your eyes from the process. It is like peeking through a hole in the wall, watching a man undress his soul.\" --Luisa Maria Celis, author ofArrows in the Sky<br /><br />\"This is a beautiful collection of poems by one of the most important Greek poets, Constantine Cavafy, translated from the original text by Manolis, another very talented Greek-Canadian poet. Translations are most effective when they pay attention to the contextual integration of the author's culture, its mannerisms, the resonance and reach of the words, making the flow from one language to the other appear natural, not acquired. When a poet translates another poet's work, it is like a musical exchange. This is exactly what Manolis did with Cavafy's poetry: unwrapping creatively the pulse and the rhythm of the original text. He doesn't disturb the breathing and fulgurations of this melodious voice from Alexandria. Actually, he joins these timeless songs which are Cavafy's poems, and sings along in a duet that bridges over from Greek into English in the most harmonious manner.\" --Eduardo B. Pinto, author ofTravelling with Shadows<br /><br />Konstantinos Petrou Kavafis (a.k.a. Constantine Peter Cavafy) lived from 1863 to 1933, mostly in Alexandria, Egypt. Working slowly and meticulously, he wrote 154 poems in his lifetime. He became known as \"the poet of the city\" and is mentioned many times in Lawrence Durrell's The Alexandria Quartet. Manolis, a White Rock writer who was born on Crete, prepared this new translation, attempting to \"unwrap creatively\" the pulse and rhythm of such poems as Craftsman of Wine Bowls and In a Small Town in Asia Minor. In the introduction, Manolis suggests looking beyond reductive statements that have been made about Cavafy's homosexuality and concentrating instead on that \"most sweet, lonely, desperate man who loved life, who loved people ... who was a beacon in the midst of human mediocrity and banality...\" --Editor,The Vancouver SunCavafy, now considered by many to be the best Greek poet of the twentieth century, died at seventy in 1933. Obscure during his lifetime, he lived reclusively and published few of his poems. Manolis, the translator and publisher of this book, describes Cavafy in his introduction as \"the most sweet, lonely, desperate man who loved life, who loved people\" (23).In these, his classical poems, Cavafy recalls the ancient birthright of the poet, so sorely lacking in today's verse-makers: the role of teacher, of cultural archivist, of sage who–like his heroes–will go to the dark place for his readers, to heal our collective wounds.This voice, unlike that of fellow Greek poets George Seferis or Yiannis Ritsos, has the prophetic clarity of Homer, Rumi, Blake, or post-Beatles John Lennon. At times he does employ irony to poke fun at human folly. For example, in \"Nero's Deadline\" a soothsayer tells Nero he'll live to seventy-three, so he goes on a comically debauched vacation, \"which consisted totally of days of pleasure\" (103). Yet Cavafy's fallback voice is tender, free of fiddle or clever wordplay. He is a truth-teller.His other, more personal, poems are frank statements of admiration for good-looking young men, usually wistful memories of lust. These pieces are fragile, quiet–as if penned by a modern masculine Sappho. He recollects trysts from many years past, or simple sightings of beautiful youths in their mid-twenties: reading a book (160), at a casino (122), through a tobacco shop window (117), at the entrance of a café (86). These longings soothe and torture him. It's hard not to imagine the lonely poet, oppressed by the ubiquitous Greek Orthodox Church, daydreaming at his Alexandrian job of thirty years, with its Kafka-worthy title: special clerk in the Irrigation Service of the Ministry of Public Works. Such personal reveries, like his classical allegories, are tales of human corrosion.Cumulatively, these mournful episodes read like spiritual epiphanies. How does he do this? By passing them through \"the High World of Poetry\" (118)? Is this like an Aeolian harp? He was, we are gathering, an odd duck. And what poet isn't? The poems work. The precious few that do not work read like the masturbatory fantasies of a fetishist, with the reader as uninvited voyeur. But, on second thought, even such miscues contain something of the fated tragic inevitability of Hector and Patroklos. The singular vision that links Cavafy's two types of poems declares that decadence comes to a bad end, in civilizations as in individuals.This, like any good poem, eludes category; certainly it doesn't fit into either of my neat classifications. It's haunted, ineffably. This city isn't just Alexandria, where Cavafy was born and died. It's the archetypal locus of remorse, of regret, of shame–of all our unlived lives. The last two lines sound flat, yet this does not detract from the general eeriness of tone or from the devastating line, \"there is no ship for you.\"Manolis deserves kudos for this project: it's ambitious, and not particularly Canadian. We Canucks often leave the work of reinvigorating \"classics\" to the publishing houses of the US and UK. Manolis' translation, in my opinion, is not nimble. He's often wordy, without a strong ear for music. But Cavafy's Greek verse itself has been critiqued as flat. Thankfully, Manolis errs on the side of simplicity, retaining the lonesome urgency of the line and the clumsy honesty of Cavafy's heart.--John Wall Barger, Prairie Fire Review of Books", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With each new story, I get to explore a new world.\" Vanessa Grant's love affair with writing fiction began during a protracted illness at the age of 12 when she decided to write a novel of her own, sitting up in bed using the typewriter she'd been given for her birthday. Not a computer, not an electric typewriter, but a then-state-of-the-art manual typewriter. The story ground to a halt on page 50 but Vanessa never forgot the excitement of bringing her own characters to life. In 1985 Vanessa's novel Pacific Disturbance was published in hardcover by Mills and Boon. She now has over 10 million books sold and has been translated into 15 languages. She also has written what one critic described as, \"by far the best writing book I've ever read.\" Writing Romance, published by Self Counsel Press, won the Under the Covers Best Writing Book Award, and is currently in its third edition. Over the years her love of storytelling and curiosity about people led Vanessa to study psychology, volunteer on a crisis line, complete individual and relationship counselor training, volunteer as a peer counselor for a family life organization, and tell stories about life, love, and secrets. Vanessa is also a university professor, a publisher of educational materials and eBooks, and has given workshops to writers' groups in Australia, New Zealand, the USA and Canada. Vanessa and her husband live on Vancouver Island in the Pacific Northwest with their two Australian Shepherd dogs.", "related": [], "rank": 984211, "title": "If You Loved Me eBook", "author": "Vanessa Grant", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 27.0}

Her books themselves are her way of making her dreams come true and an example to others to never give up with their own dreams. The author explains: Life is a journey.  There are times that the path is smooth and well traveled and others it seems steep and difficult…but if we do not give up, there is so much more that awaits us.  I love to paint paths that lead to ?...  I hope they will lead to where we need to go in life.  I hope there is love, hope, happiness, and wonderful new things that await us at the end.

She is a published romance author, and teaches Creative Writing at various writing conferences across the country. Jen grew up in Rochester, NY, a city with the highest murder rate per capita in the entire state. With notorious cases such as The Alphabet Murders, The Genesee River Killer (Arthur Shawcross), The Murder of Kali Ann Poulton by Mark Christi, and the case of funeral homes stealing body parts from corpses awaiting cremation, Jen became fascinated by the darker side of human nature. She brings this fascination to her romances, creating dark villains who wreak havoc on the hero and heroine, and producing page-turning suspense. Jen received a BS degree in Business Education with a concentration in Marketing and Sales from Nazareth College of Rochester.Â  She taught Business Applications at both the high school level and in Continuing Education.Â  She was a co-leader of Distributed Education Clubs of America and worked with students in developing marketing, sales and public speaking skills.Â  After leaving the teaching profession, she worked as a product and sales trainer for various hardware and software companies such as 3Comm, HP and McAfee, and was the regional merchandising representative for Buena Vista Entertainment. Who Dares Wins Publishing was formed as a vehicle to launch Bob Mayer's backlist into digital publication. It was built on the notion that writers produce the product, readers consume the product and everything else is in between. The 21st century has brought the rise of the digital author. It is time to take control. Write It Forward, a division of Cool Gus Publishing was formed because both Bob Mayer and Jen Talty believe the two most important people in the publishing business are the writer and the reader. The key to being successful in a business where 99% of what is submitted or self-published is rejected or fails is education and understanding. Write It Forward is dedicated to giving writers the tools and information they need to increase their chances of success.

She became a Reiki Master in 1998 and over the next few years trained to the master level in many other energy modalities, and certified in numerous body-centered therapies.  She also spent a month in India and became a deeksha giver in 2006. Shellee Rae’s first book, \"Suffering ~ A Path of Awakening: Dissolving the Pain of Incest, Abuse, Addiction and Depression,\" takes the reader on a 39-year journey through her life, from her childhood years as a victim of sexual abuse, through lengthy addictions to alcohol and drugs, into deep depression, and ultimately to the doors of death.  In 1997, a surprise turning point brought her into 12-step recovery, sobriety, and emotional healing.  After many encounters with several spiritual paths, teachers, and healing methods, she finally awakened in 2008.  Since that time she has been guiding people in their own awakening process by gently pointing to the Truth of who they are from the depths of her own realization. You may be about to take a life-changing step, perhaps you’re already in the fire of transformation, or maybe you’re simply looking for some gentle guidance. Getting support is a wonderful gift to yourself and can greatly ease the process for you and those around you.

Lily's world goes topsy-turvy as she faces the past, her lies, and a living, breathing Alex.Can a love, sidetracked by war, be rekindled when the child born from that love feels betrayed or will Lily's original, well-intended lie cost her the only man she ever loved and her daughter?", "related": ["B00LBFVNQS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 55.0}

America's Economic Way of War is packed with important new insights into how America fought and paid for the wars of the twentieth century in blood and treasure, and how these wars changed America.\" -Mark Harrison, University of Warwick\"Hugh Rockoff calmly demonstrates that America's wars have been far costlier in economic terms than we have been led to believe.

The case grips small town Michigan, especially because of the rumors of a Ouija board warning that predicted Robin would not live to see her 17th birthday.

Around 10,000 a year tackle the GR20, one of France's more technically demanding long distance footpaths. But only a relative few take the paths less travelled, through the forests and along the coast. Gillian Price has laid this magical island bare to walkers of all abilities. In her usual straightforward style, she provides a wedge of information in the front of the book, including a glossary of French and Corsican terms. It's worth mentioning (the book doesn't) that, as well as heavily accented French, Corsicans speak a Genoese-based dialect which, in remote places, might be spoken as the first language. Most places have two names: the Corsu or Corsican names which often end in u, and the Frenchified names where the u translates to o. There are a couple of other small omissions. Gillian fails to point out that a massive influx of summer tourists means prices on the island almost double during July and August. Still, most of these peak-season visitors are beach blobs and some of the more remote walks described in the book will be quiet year round. Nor does she discuss the political unrest created by the independence movement on the island, possibly because this does not generally impact on tourists. Gillian has intentionally excluded the GR20 (covered in Paddy Dillon's Cicerone guide, GR20: The Corsican High Level Route) and instead offers three long-distance walks: the glorious 10-day Mare e Monti (sea and mountains) plus north and south versions of a coast-to-coast. These are infrequently walked, so a guidebook to back up dodgy signposting will erase many of the question marks along the way. Fairly obviously, these walks can be dissected into smaller chunks or blended with day routes described later in the book. My own favourite area, around Evisa with the Aitone cloud forest, rock pools and the Spelunca Gorge, joined together with bits of the Mare e Monti, could keep you happy for days on its own. For the day walker, 18 routes vary from a one-way cliff-top bumble from the pirate port of Bonifacio to the five-hour Paglio Orba loop in the central highlands though, unfortunately, many are linear. The routes are clustered in the north-west and south-east in the two Parc Naturels - fair enough as these are truly spectacular areas - and while the list of walks isn't exhaustive, it provides an excellent basis for planning a holiday. Once you're on the island, with the right maps and the scent of sun-baked mountain herbs floating up your nostrils, you might even cut loose and find your own way.'

Michael Bostwick currently lives in Massachusetts with his wife Kelley.Michael Bostwick is a self taught, multi-instrumentalist, with an emphasis on drums and percussion. While performing with various groups as a drummer/percussionist, Technical Black (1985-1987), Rotary Ten (1987-1988), Thumper Incorporated (1990-1993), Slo Bob (1994-1999) and Morticia's Chair (1998-2002), Bostwick continued to regularly write, record, and perform Pipe Choir music. The song \"Savior\" was originally recorded in the spring of 1990 and was the first song written and recorded by Bostwick exclusively for Pipe Choir. The moderate radio success of \"Savior\" provided enough fuel to keep the project active for the next 20 years.By the year 2002, Pipe Choir started to become less of a side project, and more of a full time operation. In 2004, Bostwick began to shed his peripheral musical commitments, and focus all of his creative energy on Pipe Choir. In 2007 Bostwick began to release soundtrack music under the name Dreams In Over Drive Eternal (D.I.O.D.E.). In 2010 Bostwick introduced his second side project The Marian Circle Drum Brigade (M Circle).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Stranger still, no one has noticed.Throughout the twentieth century, leftists worked tirelessly toward their goal of a proletarian revolution. But they continually fell short. American workers rejected socialism in the 1920s and declined to join the international communist movement in the 1930s. The New Left flowered briefly in the 1960s but petered out with the end of the Vietnam War. When the Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991, radical Marxism seemed to have been defeated and discredited for good.Not so fast, says the political scientist Barry Rubin in this sharply pointed history of the modern American left. Far from disappearing, the radical left has undergone an ideological revolution and has rebranded itself as liberalism. Rubin traces the roots of this new ideology to the ideas of domestic radicals like Saul Alinsky, cultural Marxists like Antonio Gramsci, and Third World revolutionary thinkers like Frantz Fanon. This new brand of leftism constitutes a Third Left that now dominates the liberal movement in the United States.The Third Left's main ideological innovation is the abandonment of the working class as a revolutionary vehicle. Instead it targets the education system, and it has now trained several generations of Americans to think in leftist terms of fairness and social justice. Imbued with this new \"common sense,\" these young people have fanned out through the professions, the government, and the media, where they unhesitatingly advance the ideas and goals of the left: anticapitalism, a state-controlled medical system, the seminationalization of key industries, the redistribution of wealth, and a rejection of America's leading role in the world. As a result, without any real debate or understanding, the citizens of the United States have elected the most radical left-wing government in the country's history.Silent Revolutionoffers a brief, readable, and utterly devastating critique of the radicalism that masquerades as liberalism today.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Parker’s “Surrogate,” from 1982, offers Spenser fans a very early look at their favorite Boston PI; an excerpt from Infinite Jest, Wallace’s 1996 novel set in an ironic near future, should send readers to the library to either read or reread the whole book; Barnes’ “Lucky Penny” offers readers the debut appearance of fan favorite Carlotta Carlyle; and the outstanding stories from Lehane and Hogan are each worth the price of admission all by themselves.

In his current incarnation, Ira is the creator of Les Pages aux Folles, a Web site of political and social satire that will be 10 years old in the first week of September, 2012 (that's positively Paleolithic in Internet years!). Three collections of Alternate Reality News Service (ARNS) stories (Alternate Reality Ain't What It Used To Be, What Were Once Miracles Are Now Children's Toys and Luna for the Lunies!) which originally appeared on the Web site have been self-published in print. Two new volumes of ARNS stories  -  The Street Finds Its Own Uses for Market Lateralization and The Alternate Reality News Service's Guide To Sex, Love and Robots will be published in 2013. Probably. Hopefully. 2014 at the latest. Ira has produced the pilot for a radio series based on stories from the first two ARNS books; \"The Weight of Information, Episode One\" can be heard on YouTube.  Ira has also written a series of stories that take place in a universe where matter at all levels of organization has become conscious. They feature Antonio Van der Whall, object psychologist. To date, four of these stories have been sold. \"A Really Useful Engine\" has been published in Even Birds Are Chained To The Sky and Other Tales: The Fine Line Short Story Collection and \"Escalation is Academic\" has appeared in the anthology UnCONventional. \"If the Mountain Won't Come to Mohammed\" can be found in Here Be Monsters. \"Thinking is the Worst Way to Travel\" has been accepted into Explorers: Beyond the Horizon. Several other stories in the series are currently awaiting editorial decisions at various publications.  Ira's Web Goddess tells him he should make more of the fact that he won the 2010 Jonathan Swift Satire Writing Contest. So, Ira won the 2010 Jonathan Swift Satire Writing Contest. In another life (but still within this incarnation) Ira has a Masters degree in Media Studies from The New School for Social Research which was conducted entirely online. He also has a PhD in Communications from McGill University. Ira taught New Media part-time at Ryerson University for five years.

The story can also be used to sensitize peers and classmates to Aspergers so that they might be more accepting and supportive of the children.This is the first in a new series of therapeutic short stories I am writing for children and their families. Throughout my career, I have worked with a variety of children with many different kinds of problems. Over the years I have noticed that there is a lack of therapeutic literature designed to talk directly to children in a respectful fashion. It was because of this that I produced 3 videos on ADHD which speak directly to both children and parents. Besides being a psychologist, I am also a ventriloquist, and have included my puppet, Elwood, not only in the ADHD videos but also in this story and in a lot of my clinical work.", "related": [], "rank": 583412, "title": "Aspergers Books For Kids", "author": "Dr. Sam Caron Ph.D.", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

One friend asked, \"Are you okay?\" He obviously assumed that I must be out of my mind to tackle such a complex subject matter as fidelity. Another inquired, \"What's gotten into you?\" Probably for the same reason as friend number one. Honestly, I just got tired of reading yet another sensational headline about the latest scandal of fidelity gone awry. It was annoying at best.For the record, I am not an expert. I am a practicing human and have a B.A. in Theatre Arts, not degrees in psychology. However, I have concerns regarding this condition running amuck in our society, and most importantly - the lack ofpersonalaccountability. People cheat, move on, leave a tattered trail behind them and repeat the cycle ad nauseam. I've had my fair share of experiences with fidelity and infidelity. Not proud of some situations, ahead of the game on others. I will not likely compromise my values again. I'm choosing to use my frontal lobe for good. I'll undoubtedly continue to blunder in other areas, personal evolution being what it is - ongoing.I understand there are not altogether simple solutions for conditions that may prove to be more complicated and outside the scope of everyday thought. This book does not fully address the multi-part steadfastly rooted backstories that inhibit and sometime cripple personal growth. If you find yourself in this category seek trained advisors to address these issues, or read books that may prove beneficial as stepping stones toward living a more complete life.The main objective of this book is to present enough useful information, statistics, surveys, and factual life narrative in order to stimulate thought, or at the very least,practicalthought in regards to fidelity, commitment and accountability.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ed., a life-long learner and teacher, writes about topics that transcend the self in order to guide others in what she has learned. She believes that learning and experiencing life is an art form, a gateway to transcend and express abstract dreams into concrete realities, having an opportunity to leave a unique impression on others, changing their lives by seeking answers to the same questions she has had in life--to question things for herself, to find alternative answers, to go back to nature, and encourages her readers to do the same in their lives.Carrie is a bestselling author of several books, including \"The Essay Tutor\", \"Bodymorphosis: A Mind and Body Curriculum\", \"Patience through Perspective\", \"Simplify and Beautify Your Life with Natural Coconut Oil\", and \"The Home Spa Book.\"In addition to writing, Carrie has served as an instructor and tutor of English and writing at Minnesota State Colleges and Universities. She has been featured at organizations such as Edge Life Magazine, Essential Wellness, Smarthinking.com, Educational Testing Service, Writer's Digest, and local community publications.It is important to realize our dreams and do what we love every day by manifesting those dreams into reality through the love from the heart. Health, happiness, and success are major components in life we aim to achieve and maintain. The purpose of Carrie's teachings is to guide others in achieving these goals, with a major component focusing on self-realization. She has spent much of her life studying and applying concepts of alternative healing, metaphysics, and self-realization utilizing her education background, in a calling to realize ways to take better care of the body, mind, and soul.", "related": ["B00AG3KGQY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this entertaining memoir, Peppiatt, who died shortly after completing the book, takes us back to the beginning of his career, showing us how a Canadian kid obsessed with radio drama became a radio producer, got in on the ground floor of Canadian television, and parlayed that experience into a long career on both sides of the border. The book is full of behind-the-scenes stories—Peppiatt worked with Steve Allen, Norman Jewison, Jackie Gleason, Judy Garland, Jonathan Winters, Perry Como, and other notables—but the author isn’t interested in dishing dirt (although we get the sense the dirt is there, but is being tastefully kept out of our sight). This is a likable, entertaining memoir, a look at the author’s life in the entertainment industry of the 1950s through the 1980s and the not-inconsiderable toll the work took on his personal life. For fans of TV history, there’s a gold mine here. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Other chapters describe efforts to meet agricultural demand for water by augmenting supplies with groundwater management, waste water re-use and desalination. The impact of climate change is discussed, along with the international dimensions of water policy, including many examples of conflict and cooperation between Israel and its neighbors, the Arab-Israeli conflict and possible areas of cooperation and conciliation. The last two chapters include a review of the last reforms initiated by the Israeli Water Authority in light of the foregoing issues which is followed by the last chapter, presenting the editor’s assessment and conclusions.", "related": [], "rank": 4614199, "title": "Water Policy in Israel: Context", "author": "Nir Becker", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The law could not help them because a shield of family silence shrouded their shame and pain. Jean Baldwin's heart stirring memoir, \"Why, Mama?\" reveals such a sad tale straight from the shoulder, with no holds barred. It is also a tribute to the resiliency of the human spirit, which refuses to accept the defeated life of a damaged victim. She is a survivor. Her story is one you will never forget. --Charley PierceWhy, Mama? is a heart-breaking story of abuse told by one who lived through it. This incredibly sad tale prompts the reader to turn in on her own childhood memories and Jean narrates it with such compassion. No matter what the content is, it's hard to put down. It's a compelling reminder of what can happen. --Eilene HoganIt's hard to imagine a life of constant and hateful abuse from the one person in all the world who should love and care for you. Jean's book is heart wrenching, tragic and the children full of scars, but at the same time she has proven in her own quiet way that children can survive. There's far more help available today than there was when she lived through her story. Read it and find out how. --Patricia Quinlan", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Identifying the ‘passes’ that some of us get for sharing responsibility for care, particularly men and the wealthy, she calls for a ‘democratic care revolution.’ Though keenly aware of the personal and private character of many care activities, Tronto makes a compelling case for care as a public good and for rethinking the way in which caring responsibilities are carried out in order to achieve the freedom, equality, and justice that are necessary not only to better care, but to better democracy. Her notion of ‘caring with’ as a fundamental democratic ideal brings a much-needed corrective to the literature on care that enables us to think more concretely about how society needs to be restructured to meet the care needs of all citizens. The argument is thoughtful, careful, meticulous, and indeed, riveting.\"-Nancy J. Hirschmann,author ofGender, Class, and Freedom in Modern Political Theory\"Is democracy just a matter of voter turnout? No, Tronto argues in this important paradigm-shifting book—it also connects us to one another through a responsibility to care. The neo-liberal call to an ‘ownership society’ erodes that responsibility by giving out ‘passes.’ With the ‘bootstrap pass’ one can say, ‘it’s enough to care for me and mine.’ With the ‘charity pass’ one can say ‘we’ll help only the few we chose.’Read this book and open your eyes.\"-Arlie Hochschild,author ofThe Outsourced Self: Intimate Life in Market Times", "related": ["B00CZ66L78"], "rank": 1418894, "title": "Caring Democracy: Markets, Equality, and Justice", "author": "Joan C.

I was brought up in the era when gangs like; The A Team, Decepticons, Low Lives, and the Marciano Boys ran the streets. I was a youngster who lost his mother, and who's father frequented the penitentiary. I was parentless and rebelious. Rules and regulations played no part in my life. My ambitions stemmed from what my eyes could see. I had a family that loved me. But, I also had parents who were dead or slowly dieing and no place I was willing to call home, so I made the street, and all it had to offer, my home. To me, there was nothing worse than losing your parents. Bloodlines have restrictions. But street family has only one rule: Loyalty over love. Ju-Ju Bishop, twelve years reign before the reality of consequence.... Prison. Children who didn't know me, women that don't want me anymore, and twenty to years to simmer in my own consequences. Considered notorious, I was a boss for years. Recognized and respected in East New York. But its all a chance taken. Though lessons in life will surley teach me new points of veiw, now I beleive in legacy. What will I leave behind? And to who? I want the world to read my words, I want my children to see an accomplishment made. I came to prison, lost it all. Forgotten and forsaken. Everybody turned their backs. Everyone except my bloodline family. I lost my hope and went back to beg their forgiveness. I was hit with the real jewel: Family is unconditional love. I didn't beleive I was worthy.  I know who I was well, but I am a stranger to who I am. That's when I decided to take some time for self-introspection. I wrote my first book in five days. My hand burned, my mind raced, and page after page covered by my words, my expression. In a cell, nothing but time. ' Bred from Treason ' was alive. Two weeks later ' Why I Am Who I Am ' came to life.  It wasn't until I contacted my family again and told them what I found about myself that they told me of my mothers love for writing. Of how, before her sudden death she compiled a number of journals about her own life and struggles. Of how my aunt had kept safe these journals in her closet for almost twenty-five years, I lost my breath. All this time it was in me to write, and it took for me to lose it all to find the truth in me. This is me, Ju-Ju Bishop, Author. Start the journey..... It begins with \"Bred From Treason\"", "related": ["B00GM4N3MU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Linda, her loving and nurturing mother. Tony, her hard working father. Jeananne, her caring older sister. Scott, her protective older brother who always showed her tough love and stood up for his baby sister on more than one occasion.  Often picked on for her birth defect, Kayla didn't have many friends. Being a big fan of anime and video games, she began to read fan fiction at eleven and even started to write her own at the age of twelve. Reading the work of others also helped her to improve her own writing. Being drawn to romance immediately, that was primarily what she wrote.  Writing was her outlet to happiness, a way to escape the pain of reality. Her own little world.      As a young adult, she finally decided on what she wanted to do with her life. She wanted to be an author. Writing was her biggest passion and she loved it. Often, people that cared about her  expressed their disappointment in what she wanted to do and even more frequently told her that she should go after a bigger, better career because she would never make it in the writing world. Slowly, she weeded out all of the negative influences in her life. Kayla made an inner oath to herself that she would prove them all wrong and she would silently enjoy rubbing it in their faces.       With that thought, she continued to do what she loved. She wrote simple little erotic shorts involving different men from the clan and the Sun Goddess, some of which actually have plot from the original story line. Plans to write the bigger tale explaining how Katherene came to be, how things work within the clan, and the story of the fight for their world's existence is a definite possibility. The best advice Kayla can offer to anybody who might be in a similar situation as she was in is to hold your head high, be who you are, and don't let anybody keep you from achieving what you want in life. After all, life is too short to let the thoughts of others rule you.       “I love and adore being creative, having a brilliant mind and the brain power to think, create, write, and in a way make it real. It's amazing. That's my passion.” -Kayla Smith", "related": ["B00I25I2WS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He asked to\nread it when he was about nine years old but I feared it would give him\nnightmares. It gave me the creeps on more than one occasion. So every time he\nasked I simply said, \"You are too young.\" As he grew and entered high school,\nJoshua developed a serious hatred for reading. His teachers were at their wits\nend. In 2004, we were discussing the story again and he promised\nto read it cover to cover if I would agree to finally do the re-write. There\nwas no way I wasn't nipping at that bait, so I blew off the dust and read the\nmanuscript. Boy was it rough. I was surprised by how much I had learned over\nthe years. Thank goodness the publishers had turned it down! During my down time in the video store we owned I hammered\naway at the re-write. About halfway through the process I encouraged Josh to\nbegin working on his end of the bargain. I'm pretty sure I had to threaten to\ntake away his PS2 to get him going on it. By chapter three he was hooked! He\nbegan to devour the pages the second they came off of the printer. He spent his\nentire summer break hovering over my shoulder as I wrote. He gave me lots of\nfresh ideas and begged me for clues about the ending. The night I finished the\nfinal page (at three in the morning) he was right there to rip it out of my\nhands. The boy who hated to read fell in love with my book; there is no greater\nencouragement for a writer or a mother. In 2005 I had a few publisher nibbles but trouble with the\nvideo store drew my attention away once more. Back to the filing cabinet it\nwent. I lost my husband of 21 years in 2007 then tragedy like I have never\nknown struck our family in 2009. My son, my best friend and my muse, passed\naway suddenly. After that I could not bear the thought of changing one word of\nthe book he loved so much and helped me create. Then in 2012 I dreamed of him\nstanding in front of my printer waiting for the new pages. It was time. I\nre-wrote the book once more, for him. As I did so my fourteen year old daughter\nCrystal filled her brother's awesome shoes and hovered as he once did. So for\nher I will do whatever I can to make it a success.", "related": ["B00BWH9KHE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Thankfully, many relatives were praying for him and the Lord revealed Himself to an 18 year-old directionless young man. From the radical transformation the young man went through, Jesus called the author into Missions which he was in for over 10 years. Having traveled to over twenty different Countries sharing the Gospel, this was an amazing learning time.  God then sent, after much pleading, his better half into his life 11 years ago. Now the couple are settled, married for 9 years, and have the sweetest little girl.  From Missions, to family life, now he feels called to write.  All of us at Torah for Gentiles.com pray we can all grow in our understanding of Gods Word together.

Like, I'd rather tell you about my sex life than talk to you about my prayer life.)But since I spend all my time haranguing you about getting your work out into the world whether you think it's ready or not, I figured I'd better take this opportunity to walk my talk.I think it's going to be a little book called, \"An Artist Talks To God.\"And it's sort-of poems and sort-of not-poems, and they are all written as letters to God from a creative person. Some reflect my own direct experience, some don't.\"****************************************************************I received an avalanche of email back expressing deep joy and relief that I had written something that reflected the struggles of every creative person.So apparently the voice that I thought was sayingCan't show these to anyonewas actually saying,Must show these to everyone. (This is a common misunderstanding that might have happened to you, too - so you might want to check in your dusty files for some art that the world needs to see.) So here they are.You all - the creative people who read these and nod in recognition -  are the bravest people I know, and this little book is inspired by your courage, dedication, your stubborn refusal to do anything the \"normal\" way, and most especially by your life-saving sense of humor.Thank you for your inspiration. -    Sam BennettCarpinteria, CA", "related": [], "rank": 1456320, "title": "An Artist Talks To God", "author": "Sam Bennett", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

One of the guests tells about a governess at a country house plagued by supernatural visitors. But in the hands of Henry James, the master of nuance, this little tale of terror is an exquisite gem of sexual and psychological ambiguity. Only the young governess can see the ghosts; only she suspects that the previous governess and her lover are controlling the two orphaned children (a girl and a boy) for some evil purpose. The household staff don't know what she's talking about, the children are evasive when questioned, and the master of the house (the children's uncle) is absent. Why does the young girl claim not to see a perfectly visible woman standing on the far side of the lake? Are the children being deceptive, or is the governess being paranoid? By leaving the questions unanswered,The Turn of Screwgenerates spine-tingling anxiety in its mesmerized readers.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The second docent was the one who talked about Jane Fisher's previously unmentioned first husband, who had been the most powerful fur trader in the frontier town of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, in the period just after the War of 1812. Another fact learned late was that Jane Fisher Rolette was the first woman in Wisconsin Territory to file a petition for divorce. Leys had been looking for a project to pursue in order to qualify for a sabbatical leave from Milwaukee Public Schools. Working toward a JBA from the School of Journalism at the University of Wisconsin-Madison had taught her how to speed-read through paper documents and interview the best experts about their areas of expertise. Teaching writing - both journalism and creative writing - and editing her students' work had taught her how to critique her own. She had already published freelance stories in the Milwaukee Journal. Research for the novel involved visiting sites, sorting through more than 15 boxes of family papers stored in Madison and St. Louis, and reading other papers from southwest Wisconsin courthouses. Interviews included a priest/history professor at Marquette University and the most knowledgeable local historian in Prairie du Chien. There were books too, since the two husbands were central figures and the first husband was so important that the second in command to John Jacob Astor was the godfather of the Rolette children. After the first draft of the novel was complete, Leys and her husband moved from Milwaukee to a farm in northeast Crawford County. After 20 years there, they moved to the only city in the county, Prairie du Chien, where the author has learned firsthand what it's like to live beside - and keep an eye on - the Mississippi River.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If something new is said, could it possibly be true? The answers to both questions are “yes”! John Dickson has recognized the limited, technical sense of “teaching” in many ancient religious contexts, including Christian ones, especially Paul, and consistently in the Pastoral Epistles. Applying this recognition to 1 Timothy 2:12, he has convincingly demonstrated that even a conservative complementarian has no exegetically based grounds for preventing women from delivering sermons. He wisely bypasses entirely larger questions of ordination and leadership for this one virtually incontrovertible observation. That many complementarians continue to controvert it demonstrates the extent to which, however unwittingly, they are bound to the “traditions of men” rather than to the Word of God!  -- Craig L.

It's my attempt to add to the history of my people. Queerness was recorded so rarely--and then, usually in colorless legal proceedings or decried in ecclesiastical books--that we must turn to fiction to be reminded that we've always been around, and we've always faced down challenges.The story began as an email serial--a way to connect with my girlfriend while we were working and living in different states. It took a couple years to mature and I fleshed it out during a period of unemployment. (Why does it take such large amounts of empty time to be able to write?)I worked to get into the medieval commoner's worldview as much as a 21st century person can. I wanted to show the interplay of Catholic faith, pagan myths, and observations from nature that made up the average thought process. There's a lot of free reign here since 13th century farmers didn't leave written records. But the understanding I gained through my research was helped along by my native urge to magical realism, which medievals completely would have bought. And as characters pushed against their social entanglements, a political aspect evolved including the tension between guilds and the bonds between lord and officers.Try it out and let me know what you think.", "related": [], "rank": 1580636, "title": "The Witch of Wildtal", "author": "Jocelyn McDaniel", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
