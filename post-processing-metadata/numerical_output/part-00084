The book's title comes from a Kurdish poem about the Kurds' determination to be masters of their own lands, an effort that brings about \"a thousand sighs, a thousand tears, a thousand revolts, a thousand hopes.\" Bird deftly describes each of those aspects of Kurdistani culture, from the sighs and tears of women who offer Bird both flavorful dinners and wrenching stories of loss, to the hopes of Kurdish artists who believe their ethnic group's artistic traditions can survive beyond war. Where Bird focuses most, however, is the revolts that have plagued the Kurds for decades. The largest ethnic group in the world without a state of their own, the Kurds number between 25 and 30 million, and live in an arc of land that stretches through Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran and parts of the former Soviet Union. As Bird travels through Kurdistan (a country that isn't on any map), she meets an array of people, from scholars to bus drivers. Each story of conflict, poverty, homelessness and suffering is like a brushstroke in a larger portrait of the Kurdish experience. Bird's talent for blending reportage with illuminating tales from individuals makes this a notable and much needed work.

For Gellhorn, it was the Spanish Civil War; for di Giovanni, it's the series of conflicts that, since 1991, have consumed the republics of the former Yugoslavia. Expanded from a Vanity Fair article, this book presents a harrowing firsthand account of a region's spiral into madness. Di Giovanni, a senior foreign correspondent for The Times (London), was there almost from the beginning: she shuddered through the first icy winter of the Sarajevo siege (the longest in modern history); she sipped tea with Arkan, the dreaded leader of the ethnic-cleansing paramilitary Tigers; she stood shoulder to shoulder with Serb revolutionaries on \"Day One\" of the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic. The book deals primarily with di Giovanni's experiences covering the most recent war-1999's conflict in Kosovo-but it moves through time from the initial dissolution of Yugoslavia to the most recent, guardedly optimistic attempts at reconstruction. Di Giovanni provides ample historical context to the fighting (readers seeking to understand the separatist impulse of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church or Milosevic's \"mother complex\" have plenty of evidence to play with), but eventually, the names and dates of massacres and treaties pale next to the spectacle of pure horror: a dog trotting by with a human hand in its mouth; a crazed woman lying naked in full view of snipers, begging to be shot. Di Giovanni has written a tragic book that vividly memorializes the millions who suffered in the name of religion, nationality and ego.

They are so widespread that almost no one can pretend not to have used or suffered the consequences of one of them.In our earlier companion volume,Evaluation and Decision Models, we heavily criticised formal models but we also argued that they could be useful. On the other hand,Evaluation and Decision Models with Multiple Criteriais a guide, a way of reasoning aimed at helping the analyst to choose a model and use it consistently. We propose, often using an axiomatic point of view, a sound analysis of techniques aimed at supporting the decision aiding process. Our presentation is carried out within a unique framework that can be extended to most decision and evaluation models, as a \"decision aiding methodology\".Evaluation and Decision Models with Multiple Criteriais intended for the aware or enlightened practitioner, for anyone who uses decision or evaluation models---for research or for applications---and is willing to question his practice, to have a deeper understanding of what he does.The authors of this book are European academics working in four different universities and research institutions. They teach in engineering, mathematics, computer science and psychology schools. Their background is quite varied: mathematics, economics, engineering, law and geology, but they are all active in decision support and more particularly in multiple criteria decision support. Preference modelling, fuzzy logic, aggregation techniques, social choice theory, artificial intelligence, problem structuring, measurement theory and Operational Research are among their special interests.The authors are active in theoretical research on the foundations of decision aiding, mainly from an axiomatic point of view.

She also includes transitions that blend joy and challenge, such as retirement, the birth of a child or a desired career change. Her program is well thought out, incorporating four steps—responding, reviewing, renewing and reorganizing—illustrated by inspiring personal testimonies (including her own). For instance, in responding, which means handling emotional swings, the author recommends, among other things, slowing down and seeking the help of a professional. After emotions have subsided, it's time to review by exploring hopeful possibilities, and reorganizing means beginning to find a new sense of purpose. This stage flows directly into renewing, a period of new creativity and celebrating a stronger self. Throughout each stage, Neeld (Seven Choices: Finding Daylight After Loss Shatters Your World) strongly advocates listening to music as an escape, an aid to meditation or simply a soothing activity (she even recommends specific works for particular needs).

He had an almost unobstructed view from his seat in the forward compartment of the huge Boeing 757 cargo carrier, courtesy of one of his oldest friends and allies, Hal Brognola. As director of Amer-ica's most covert antiterrorist organzation, Stony Man, Brognola had requested Bolan's attention for this mission under the behest of the President of the United States. As a friend, Brognola had asked Bolan to accept the mission. And as one friend would do for another under those circumstances, the Executioner accepted.Bolan had come to Cuba seeking one thing: information.\"It's very simple,\" Brognola had told him a few hours earlier in an abandoned hangar at Andrews AFB. \"We need you to fly into Guantánamo Bay, question a prisoner named Basilio Melendez regarding the disappearance of Colonel Mackenzie Waterston and then act based on the information provided.\"\"And when you say you want me to act, you mean…\"\"In whatever manner you deem the best interests of this country,\" Brognola replied. \"Colonel Waterston was in charge of military operations related to Plan Colombia. You have some idea of that initiative?\"Bolan nodded. \"The President's Executive Order 1-1-7-3-Alpha to the Secretary of State. The State Department is charged with conducting all operations, diplomatic or otherwise, necessary to eliminate the drug and arms-running activities designed to support the FARC, AUC and ELN, and to neutralize such operations deemed a terrorist threat to the U.S.\"\"I see you keep up with the times,\" Brognola said with a grin.The Executioner shrugged. \"I have my sources.\"\"Yeah, and it's not as though this information would be necessarily difficult to come by. Anyway, the Chief of Staff appointed Colonel Waterston to the Pentagon with instructions to monitor the activities of a number of special ops units operating out of Guantánamo Bay. Our boys down there got particularly interested when intelligence reports pointed to the possibility there was an ELN training camp operating full-time in Cuba. Up to this point, we'd never been able to confirm it.\"\"And this is where Melendez comes in?\"\"Right.\" Brognola pulled the unlit cigar from his mouth, studied it a moment, then stuck it into the other side of his mouth and continued. \"All Cuban prisoners were returned to their country back in the mid-nineties when we stopped detaining nationals at Gitmo. Under normal pretenses, any Cuban citizen caught there in a crime is automatically extradited to Cuban authorities.\"\"Why's Melendez special?\"\"Just for the reasons you might have guessed. He had information on Waterston before we even asked. And it's not the first time we've encountered him. You see, Melendez has been picked up many times before. It's how we've managed to make contact with him. Normally, we turn him loose to the Cubans and they just chalk him up as a troublemaker.\"\"They probably break out the party hats every time he shows up on MP blotter,\" Bolan concluded.\"Precisely,\" Brognola said with a frown. \"But when we heard what he had to say this last time around, we thought it was probably better to keep him detained for a while.\"\"Why?\"\"Because Waterston's missing and his disappearance fits what Melendez told us. So far, anyway.\"\"How does this tie to the ELN and their training camp?\"\"Don't know yet,\" Brognola replied. \"That's what we need you to find out. Striker, the Man is getting damned nervous about this, and I can't really say I blame him. Waterston isn't the only one to disappear. Two other agents with the Defense Intelligence Agency have been MIA over a week. We have reason to believe they're connected with Water-ston's disappearance. We need you at Gitmo as soon as possible. You'll use the Brandon Stone cover, a special investigator with the Criminal Investigation Division.\"Now dressed in full Army greens, Bolan considered the mission ahead. He didn't have the first idea what Melendez might know, but the Cuban was his only lead to finding Mackenzie Waterston. How the DIA fit into all of it was another mystery—one he'd probably solve once he located Waterston or at least found out what happened to the missing Pentagon official—as well as the alleged ELN training camp. Brognola didn't have to tell Bolan what to do if he actually discovered the ELN operating inside Cuba. Bolan already knew what to do.Identify. Isolate. Destroy.\"Welcome to Guantánamo Bay, sir,\" the Marine corporal said with a salute.Bolan eyed the young Marine's name tag. \"Relax, Northrop, before you strain something.\"The Marine eased up and flashed a sheepish smile. \"Aye, sir.\"Bolan tossed his OD canvas bag in the back of the open-top M998 Hummer—making sure it remained in easy reach—and then climbed in the front. The bag had been loaded aboard the flight and carried two tools of the Execu-tioner's trade: a Beretta 93-R pistol and the flagship pride and joy of Israeli Military Industries, a .44 Magnum Desert Eagle. Spare magazines and holsters accompanied the arms.\"This your first time in Gitmo, sir?\" the Marine asked when they were under way.\"No,\" Bolan said. \"But it's been a while.\"\"It's damn hot down here,\" the Marine said. Bolan looked at him with disbelief at first but then noticed the broad smile on the soldier's face. \"Just kidding, sir. I knew you'd already figuredthatout.\"Bolan nodded, acknowledged the quip with a half smile and then decided to take his own advice to lighten up. They made small talk the remainder of their five-minute drive from the airstrip to the main detention facility. The Marine indicated he'd wait until Bolan finished.\"Might be a while,\" the Executioner said.\"No problem, sir. I'm your escort while you're on the base. Once we've finished here, I'll show you to the VIP billets.\"Bolan nodded and moved inside. He passed through two metal detectors—requiring the removal of all his brass and medals and submission to a hand wand before they cleared him—and then signed in. Once the basics were complete, a Marine cadre escorted the Executioner to a six-by-six room occupied by a bare, gunmetal gray table bolted to the floor and two plastic folding chairs. He waited nearly ten minutes before a door with a wire-mesh window opened and a short man in neon-orange coveralls stepped into the room under heavy guard.Bolan stood against the wall, arms folded, and gestured to the unoccupied chairs. \"Sit down.\"He studied Basilio Melendez as he sat. The man had black hair and a matching beard. His brown eyes possessed a beady curiosity. A pair of faint scars ran down the right side of his neck. His arms were grimy and soiled, and his fingers were stained yellow from years of continuous tobacco use.\"You're Melendez,\" Bolan said.The man said nothing as he obviously perceived Bolan hadn't meant it as a question. That demonstrated he wasn't obtuse, and the Executioner knew he'd have to tread cautiously on this one. Bolan wouldn't get far being coy with Melendez; the Cuban was obviously intelligent. Besides, he'd met guys like Melendez before and he'd found he could never quite trust them. They were always studying the an-gles—looking for the best possible way to get ahead—and they had a knack for manipulating even the most unfavorable circumstances to their advantage given the time and opening.\"My name's Stone,\" Bolan began. \"I'm with the Criminal Investigation Division of the United States Army. I'm told you have information that's of great interest to the U.S. government.\"Melendez didn't say anything for a minute. He just sighed deeply a couple of times and peered at Bolan from under hooded eyelids. It looked as though he'd been through hell. Bolan wanted to offer him something to drink, maybe get him some cigarettes because he knew prisoners weren't permitted to smoke;anythingthat might help establish a rapport with him. That was assuming Melendez wanted to cooperate.Abruptly, and in flawless English, Melendez said, \"What do you wish to know?\"\"That's a start,\" Bolan said, and he took a seat across from Melendez. \"Tell me how you know about Colonel Waterston.\"\"I spend lots of time in Cuban jails,\" he said. \"I overhear things.\"\"Okay, fine, but why would Waterston's name come up in a Cuban jail?\"\"It seems you know very little about my country, Stone,\" Melendez replied. \"You have heard of Havana Five?\"Bolan shook his head, although he knew plenty about them. The crime lords of the Cuban underworld controlled nearly all the illicit trades throughout the country from their power base in Havana, and had done so for the past three decades. Beginning in the early seventies, Havana Five overwhelmed the Cuban community with drugs, guns, sex and every other profitable vice imaginable. Five men, each with a specific piece of the Cuban island, pooled their resources and built the single most powerful crime cartel in history.\"Many believe they do not exist,\" Melendez said. \"That they have never existed. But I, you see…I know better. I know these men are real. I know they exist and I know what they're capable of doing. And I know exactly what they did to your friend, Waterston.\"\"And what's that?\"\"They killed him,\" Melendez said. \"I hear they shot him through the head and they dumped his body.\"\"Where?\"\"How should I know this? The men I heard talking did not say. Perhaps he was buried, perhaps he sleeps with the fishes. The point is that I hear he's dead and I believe it. And if I say more, thenI'mdead.\"Bolan shook his head. \"You're under our protection now, Melendez. We're not going to throw you back into circulation again.\"\"You?

The allegory is peppered with \"Rules of Good Luck\" and other mantras that manage—most of the time—to ring true. The knight who makes his own luck and ultimately succeeds, of course, is the one who sees obstacles and challenges, not insurmountable impediments, and who works to overcome them intelligently. He creates new conditions, seeks to help others, is unafraid to take action, doesn’t give up and realizes that opportunity is always out there. The story is inspiring, and a series of quotes from celebrities and sages near the end reinforces the idea that success comes from learning how to make one’s own luck.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This well-re searched expose attests to the negligence, ignorance and corruption of authorities, and violation of the Nuclear Test Ban treaty. Starting with the initial 1978 suit by fallout victims against the Department of Energy, the author relentlessly traces futile legal actions which culminated in the reversal by the appellate courts of a 1984 award for damages to 10 claimants. The Supreme Court's refusal to hear an appeal supports his contention that the judiciary consistently upheld the government's policy of denial, placing national security above human health.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When Michael is killed in a mysterious accident, Sunny discovers he was not who she thought he was, and creditors and cops inundate her. Looking for solace, Sunny heads back to the commune, where she finds her mother to be the same maddening hippie chick she always was. Again, fed up and out of options, Sunny decides to sell everything and leave, this time for San Miguel Island off the coast of Washington, where, in a little town called Harmony, she tries to rebuild her life. But events from her past follow her to the island, and before long she's heading off-island for some closure.

I loved to sit by her side and listen to her tell her stories of the old country. Some of the stories were of hardship, as she grew up very poor, but the stories she told of her and my grandfather's courtship were sweet and poignant and some were absolutely hilarious. I made a promise to my grandmother that one day I would visit Sicily, to see where these wonderful stories took place.When I turned 42 in January of 1996, my husband Eric and I talked of where we would like to go on vacation. We hadn't been on a real vacation in five years, and we decided we would go somewhere special. He asked me where I had always wanted to go and immediately I said Italy -- everyone wants to someday go to Italy, right? Many years had gone by since I'd even thought of my promise to my grandmother that I would someday visit Sicily. \"But you know where I would really like to go?\" I whispered excitedly. \"Sicily.\"And so it came to pass that we took our first Sicilian roundabout in March of 1996. It was an enchanting trip to a truly magical island. I think Goethe said it best when he wrote: \"To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is not have seen Italy at all. For Sicily is the key to everything.\"Sicily certainly held the key to everything that I loved: breathtaking scenery, ancient history, old customs, exhilarating art and food that makes you want to cry it's so good.

In this admiring biography, Stuart, editor of Hello, Janice: The Wartime Letters of Henry Giles (Univ. of Kentucky, 1992), draws from Giles's personal papers to trace her progression from observer to chronicler. A native of Arkansas, Giles spent most of her life in rural Kentucky. Her keen sense of place captured local color in rustic, regional tales, lending insights to ordinary people and events and giving voice to the Appalachian character and spirit.

Mahoney and Thelen have not only assembled an impressive and illuminating collection of essays showing how and why institutional change plays out as it does in a range of important domains (including a reflection on the field by Peter Hall that would make the book worth having even if it were the only chapter). With their own powerful synthesis of theories of incremental institutional change, they also break important new ground in institutional analysis.\"- Jacob S. Hacker, Yale University\"Mahoney and Thelen extend the boundaries of our understanding of institutional change in this impressive volume. Many people try to bridge the differences among the various theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of institutions. This group of contributors actually accomplishes it! The rich combination of cogent theoretical insight and careful empirical analysis produces important contributions to the fundamental questions of how and why institutions change incrementally. This emphasis on incremental change is a salutary advance on the existing literature.\"-Jack Knight, Duke University\"This is an exciting new contribution to the ongoing discussion in the social sciences on institutions and institutional change. Several disciplines are involved in this worldwide project, including political science, sociology and economics. There has been a continuing stream of highly interesting work for a number of years, and unlike usually in the social sciences, it has produced cumulative progress in the development of concepts and empirical insights. Explaining Institutional Change is another milestone in the exploration of a subject that is obviously of fundamental importance in an era of rapid social and economic restructuring.\"-Wolfgang Streeck, Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, Cologne,    Germany\"The new book answers 'old' questions, raises relevant new ones, and provides original insights...this book is a worthy successor of Streeck and Thelen's Beyond Continuity and a valuable addition to the literature on incremental change.\"Regulation and Governance, Jeroen van der Heijden, Delft University of Technology", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was also a longtime habitué of many of the sex theaters in New York City's Times Square, spending, by his own estimate, \"thousands and thousands of hours\" at the Capri, Variety Photoplays, the Eros, and the Venus. In the 1990s all of these theaters were shut down through new restrictive zoning laws, part of a combined effort by the Walt Disney Corporation and the administration of Mayor Rudy Giuliani to gentrify the area, replacing these seedily memorable institutions with antiseptic, innocuous architectural and cultural creations in the name of health safety. But as Delany reveals in his new book,Times Square Red, Times Square Blue, the decision to clean up Times Square had little to do with public health, and everything to do with corporate greed.In the two essays that comprise this eloquent, provocative book, Delany grieves for the loss of this strip of sexual release. Though he is careful not to romanticize or sentimentalize the peep shows and porn theaters, he does illuminate the way in which these venues crossed class, racial, and sexual orientation lines, providing a delightfully subversive utopia--and a microcosm of New York  life. In the first essay, \"Times Square Blue,\" Delany details his shared erotic and conversational encounters with working-class and homeless men in the theaters (which primarily showed straight porn films) and the genuine friendships that resulted; these immensely personal reminiscences also provide a social history of late-20th-century Times Square. Drawing on historical and theoretical resources in the second essay, \"Three, Two, One, Contact: Times Square Red,\" Delany next builds a thoughtful and passionate argument against the gentrification of the area and the classist, characterless direction in which he sees New York heading. Read together, the essays ofTimes Square Red, Times Square Blueare both heartfelt homage to a beloved city and lament for a quirky vitality increasingly phased out by encroaching capitalism.--Kera Bolonik", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The UN contract ended, but Frank was now hooked on Africa, and worked as a consultant in countries from Kenya to Swaziland and from Mozambique to Botswana. It was during these four years that he developed his passionate interest in the political and cultural history of East Africa. His marriage didn't survive the continental shift back to Australia and he and his 'African princess' divorced some years later. They say that those who have spent time in Africa can't easily forget the experience, so after denying his urge to write for thirty years, when Frank finally began his writing career in 2001, his imagination took him back to Africa. His first novel, Tears of the Maasai made the best-seller's list in 2004.

If the author's explanation of the science of psychoneuroimmunology--which suggests that \"what you know matters less than what you feel\"--is thin, his anecdotes are telling. One patient suffering from clenched jaws lost his pain and his anger after climbing a mountain and screaming obscenities. Hammerschlag recalls how a Native American healer, in teaching him to pray, caused him to lose his cynicism, and how the wishes of dying children remind us how to dream. His musings sometimes stray from the Native American base, but they include worthwhile advice: people should learn to find joy in small, daily things, and doctors should be wary that medical jargon obscures human feelings. Hammerschlag concludes wth a somber warning from the Hopi people, who predict that our \"obsession with seeking material goods\" will lead to our ruin.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I tried using language phrase books, but pronouncing words in other languages was difficult and confusing.

The travel aid I had created worked like magic!  During my trip, when I needed some help I would simply show a local person a photo that identified my need and they would point me in the right direction…”. This travel aid later led to the creation of ‘Get Around Photos’.   Chris is a Bay Area native of Northern California. He has a BA in Business Communications.

A life of misery at the former was described in his story 'Baa Baa Black Sheep', whilst Westward Ho was used as a basis for his questioning the public school ethic in 'Stalky and Co'. Kipling returned to India in 1882 to work as an assistant editor for the Civil and Military Gazette of Lahore. His reputation as a writer was established with stories of English life in India, published there in 1888/9. 'The Phantom Rickshaw', 'Soldiers Three' and 'Under the Deodars' are amongst these early works. Returning to England in 1889, Kipling settled in London and continued to earn a living as a writer. In 1892 he married Caroline Balestier, an American. They travelled extensively in the following four years, including a spell living in America, and it was in this time most of his enduring work was written, not least 'The Jungle Book' and 'The Second Jungle Book'. Kipling once again returned to England in 1896 and continued his writing career, although tragedy hit the family when his eldest daughter, Josephine, died in 1899. Nonetheless, in 1901 he completed 'Kim', often considered to be his best work. The following year, having settled in Sussex, he published 'Just So Stories', a book he had planned to write for Josephine. Having refused the position of Poet Laureate, which was offered in 1895, he did accept the Nobel Prize for Literature, becoming the first English author to be so honoured. By 1910, however, Kipling's appeal was waning. His poems and stories were based on values that were perceived as outdated. There was widespread reaction against Victorian imperialism, highlighted by the incompetent management of the Boer War. When World War I came, Kipling had difficulty in adapting to the mood of the public and after his only son, John, was reported missing in action believed killed in 1915, he became very active on the War Graves Commission.  After the war he became an increasingly isolated figure, although some of his best writing was to come, with 'Debits and Credits' in 1926 and 'Limits and Renewals' in 1932. Kipling died in 1936 in London and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Today, however, he is once again avidly read not just for the quality of his writing and storytelling, but through a renewed", "related": [], "rank": 21749, "title": "The Seven Seas", "author": "Rudyard Kipling", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was as if a jolt jumpstarted her heart. Questions such as why he needed luck and what exactly he would call Snow White crossed her mind. Then she parted her lips for him, her breath mingling with his. He flicked his tongue inside her mouth, taking his sweet time, and she stopped thinking. Shivers ran along her spine, inhaling his scent, tasting the wine on his tongue. When he broke the kiss, there was a strange vibration against her lips, an odd humming noise.She touched her fingers to her mouth, forgetting that she still held a glass of champagne and spilling some down the front of her blouse. \"What was that?\"\"Just a kiss,\" he said, opening with one hand the door behind him, wrapping his other around her elbow and pulling her into the bathroom.\"Hey,\" she said, alarmed and definitely not willing to join the Mile High Club, \"you can't--\"\"You're a bit of a pushover, aren't you?\" He locked the door behind her, took the glass from her hand and placed it next to the sink.His kiss killed whatever words she had on her lips, his tongue a good deal less leisurely than before.He crowded her against the door, a hoarse groan at the back of his throat. She'd been kissed before if never in that toe-curling, bone-melting, straight-between-your-legs way. Searching for a hold, she placed her hands on his shoulders, gingerly, unsure how to touch him, confused that her entire body was trembling.Then he moved closer still, his hips flush against hers, and her breasts flattened against his chest. He grasped her hands, pulled them above her head. His hard-on pressed against her stomach. Startled, her eyes flew open, met his. A sharp contraction inside her womb made her knees buckle, the small surge of pleasure rippling across her skin something she'd never experienced before.The bathroom light flickered on and off, on and off, as if it couldn't make up its mind.Neither could she.", "related": ["B0046H8ZOQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Others, like Dick, create dystopian futures that leave more questions than answers. I believe the real future, like today, lies in the middle--where some of the choices have brought amazing prosperity and progress and other choices in that same future have brought devastation. The difficulty is always knowing the tradeoffs and evaluating the balance.ETERNITY asks the question what happens in a world where people can be given a virus (in the form of a vaccine) that will let them live for 800 years without the diseases of old age? What happens in that world when a single country, or a single corporation, or a single small group of people gets to decide who is allowed to get the virus and who is not? What happens to the resources--both people resources and physical, planetary resources? Then I added the romance. Two people who began as colleagues and lovers, but now find themselves on opposite sides of the virus war are the ones with the ultimate choices. Life and love are never easy, whether now or in the future. I have always believed that individuals, when brought together in a common philosophy with common goals, have more power than large corporations or even entire countries, but they must be willing to stand  up and wield that power together for the common good.", "related": [], "rank": 4297394, "title": "Eternity", "author": "Maggie Jaimeson", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tom, a lawyer, is assigned the job of obtaining an affidavit from Major Marmont, a stage magician, concerning the provenance of a valuable dagger; at the same time, Helen's mother asks Helen to find out whether Eustace Flask, a so-called psychic, is the real deal or a charlatan. Soon Tom and Helen are investigating the death of another psychic, who died under suspicious circumstances, and Helen finds that she has become a murder suspect. Rich in character and period detail (but without being too pushy about it), the novel, like its predecessor, offers a definite change of pace from the author's Elizabethan-era Nick Revill mysteries, but readers of that series will note the same frisky spirit and playful writing style here. Further stories featuring the Ansells would be most welcome...  --Booklist, May 1, 2011The fascination with magicians, conjurers, and mediums in Victorian England brings newlyweds Tom and Helen Ansell to their second case (after The Salisbury Manuscripts). Helen's spinster aunt is about to fall victim to a medium's scam, and Helen's mother asks Helen to go check on the situation in Durham. Concurrently, Tom's law firm wants him to take a disposition from a client, a magician in possession of an exotic item from India; the magician just happens to be in Durham as well. The couple find plenty of intrigue and a bit of danger in this puzzler that shows us how the magic's done but demonstrates that solving a murder goes beyond hidden doors and sleight of hand.  VERDICT This second entry in Gooden's historical series is cleverly plotted and nicely structured in five acts. The cathedral plays a minor role, but this reviewer looks forward to seeing where the couple is headed next.  -- Library Journal, May 1, 2011", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ison serves up a meticulously researched, authentically styled period procedural laced with dark humor and acerbic wit and peopled with engaging characters. --Booklist, April 1, 2011Divisional Detective Inspector Hardcastle (Hardcastle's Mandarin, 2009, etc.) is back to his favorite sports: chasing murderers, rousting prostitutes and harassing his long-suffering sergeant, Marriott. It looked as if all the occupants of 143 Washbourne Street were the unfortunate victims of one of Fritz's zeppelins, sent to terrorize Londoners already weary of the Great War. But one of the bodies in the basement of the bombed-out Victorian shows signs of strangulation. Dr. Spilsbury confirms that the young woman, two months pregnant, was murdered before the blast, and Hardcastle just knows that she must be on the game. So he puts out the cry at Victoria Station, and soon enough, the young toms who work there identify the girl as Annie Kelly, late of Greenwich, who told her parents she was working in London as a housemaid. Now it's up to Hardcastle and Marriott to check out Annie's circle of acquaintances. Her boyfriend, Seamus Riley, seems to have left for the front with the Royal Irish Fusiliers. But her favorite trick, Sir Royston Naylor, is right in town. With his wife, Lady Henrietta, tucked safely away at his country estate, Naylor is carrying on with Sarah Cotton, another lady of the night. Sarah, a deep one, leaves her post at Victoria every night for an elegant townhouse in Cadogan Place. But from Blackfriars to Belgravia, if there's crime afoot, Hardcastle will give chase, telling Marriott for the umpteenth time that you need to tell the taxi to take you to Scotland Yard; if you tell them Cannon Row, you're likely to end up in town. The war may have turned lives upside down in Hardcastle's London, but nothing ever changes in the personal battle against miscreants of all shapes and sizes.  --Kirkus Reviews, June 1, 2011", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In doing so, he takes scholarship to a neglected area of Burke’s thought with considerable implications for subsequent interpretations of his political philosophy and thought.”—Joseph Pappin, III, University of South Carolina, editor ofStudies in Burke and His Time. “There is much insight in this book regarding the role of history and habit in shaping individuals, groups, and societies, and especially the distinction between casuistry and character development in Burke's thought. These points make this study stand out from the ‘pragmatic’ readings of Burke, which make him seem un- or even anti-philosophical, as well as the more strict natural law reading.” - Bruce Frohnen, Associate Professor Law, Ohio Northern University College of Law “This is a timely and provocative contribution, not only to Burke studies, but to contemporary political thought and recent intellectual history in the United States.” - Ian Crowe, Associate Professor of History at Brewton-Parker College, Georgia, and director of the Edmund Burke Society of America.\"Byrne's prose is highly readable, and his reading of Burke both plausible and illuminating.\" –National Review  \"By focusing on Burke's imagination, Byrne illuminates the core of Burke's political theory, his intuitive conception of life. What is especially remarkable about the book is that it analyzes a complex topic in lucid prose and relates Burke's ideas to contemporary political and social life. Consequently, Byrne has provided an analysis of Burke that is both weighty enough for the expert and acessible to general readers.\" - Michael P.

Each chapter also includes a template for implementing therapy models, and realistic case studies-many drawn from actual practice-to illustrate how each model would address common issues.In addition, the volume includes extensive interviews with master therapists such as Albert Ellis, Insoo Kim Berg, Sue Johnson, Susan McDaniel, Derald Wing Sue, and many others. They share their ideas of the ways in which change occurs, how they set goals, and how they perform therapy. For further clarification, each therapist illustrates how he/she would proceed via the same case study. Learning how to perform effective family therapy can be an arduous process of trial and error, yet this resource will ease the way for students and currently practicing family therapists who need to revisit the basics.Modalities IncludedBowen Family Systems TheoryContextual Family TherapyCognitive Behavioral Family Therapy ModelsRational Emotive Behavior TherapySymbolic-Experiential Family TherapySatir Human Validation Process ModelMilan Systemic Family TherapyStructural Family TherapyStrategic Family TherapySolution-Focused Brief Therapy with FamiliesNarrative Therapy with FamiliesEmotionally Focused TherapyMedical Family TherapyFamily PsychoeducationKey Features:Introduces the theory, history, theoretical assumptions, techniques, and components of each modelIncludes a template for using each model, from the initial meeting through assessment, intervention, and terminationProvides numerous interviews with master therapistsIncludes case study commentary and analysis by master therapistsSuggests questions, therapeutic strategies, and/or comments to consider for each therapeutic phaseIncludes a personality inventory to help readers select the most effective modality\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was Barrett's idea to form the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in London in 1882.  However, since Barrett was living in Dublin, Ireland at the time, he was not able to take an active part in managing the Society.  He left that up to three Cambridge scholars, Henry Sedgwick, Frederic W. H. Myers, and Edmund Gurney. Barrett also encouraged Professor William James of Harvard to organize the American branch of the SPR in 1884.  He edited the SPR Journal from 1884-99 and served as president of the SPR in 1904.   Born in Jamaica, British West Indies, Barrett moved to England during his youth and studied under the famous physicist, John Tyndall, serving as Tyndall's assistant from 1862 to1867.  He lectured on physics at the Royal School of Naval Architecture before becoming professor of physics at the Royal College of Science in Dublin in 1873.  He taught at the Royal College for 37 years, retiring in 1910, and was knighted in 1912.         In 1899, Barrett developed a silicon-iron alloy known as stalloy, used in the commercial development of the telephone and transformers, and also did pioneering research on entoptic vision, leading to the invention of the entoptiscope and a new optometer.  He was a fellow of the Royal Society, Philosophical Society, Royal Society of Literature as well as a member of the Institute of Electrical Engineers and the Royal Irish Academy.  Barrett began to take an interest in psychic phenomena in 1874 after hearing of the research of renowned scientist William Crookes (later Sir William) with mediums.  \"In fact I began the whole investigation of these phenomena convinced that [mal-observation or hallucination] was their true explanation, and it was not until after stretching this hypothesis to illegitimate lengths that I found the actual facts completely shattered my theory,\" Barrett explained his early views.  Then 29, Barrett began experimenting with hypnosis, more popularly known as \"mesmerism\" in those days.  He observed a young girl under hypnosis correctly identify a playing card randomly taken from a pack and placed in a book that was put next to her head.  He also observed another hypnotized person correctly identify fourteen cards taken at random from a pack.  As a scientist, he found such results very disturbing.  However, while many of his scientific colleagues simply scoffed at anything paranormal, Barrett was open-minded and determined to find some rational and scientific explanation. As he explained his 1917 book On the Threshold of the Unseen, his prior theories really began to fall apart sometime in 1876 when a prominent English solicitor (lawyer) named Clark spent the summer at a residence near his in Dublin.  Clark's 10-year-old daughter, Florrie, produced various paranormal phenomena, including levitations and spirit \"raps\" that spelled out messages from an \"intelligence\" calling himself \"Walter.\"   As a result of his experiments in hypnosis and his investigation of Florrie Clark, Barrett prepared a paper to deliver to the British Association for the Advancement of Science.  The Association rejected the paper as well as Barrett's request to present it orally to the group.  After Crookes, Alfred Russel Wallace (co-originator with Charles Darwin of the natural selection theory of evolution), and Lord Rayleigh protested the Association's action, Barrett was allowed to deliver the paper but not publish it.   Barrett continued his investigation with other mediums, including Hester Travers Smith, Gladys Osborne Leonard, Kathleen Goligher, and Geraldine Cummins.  In his 1917 book, he recalled the sitting with Goligher, who was being studied then by Dr. William Crawford of Queen's University.  The sitting involved a small family circle gathered in a room illuminated with a bright gas flame burning in a lantern.  \"They sat round a small table with hands joined together, but no one touching the table,\" Barrett explained.  \"Very soon knocks came and messages were spelt out as one of us repeated the alphabet aloud.  Suddenly the knocks increased in violence, and being encouraged, a tremendous bang came which shook the room and resembled the blow of a sledge hammer on an anvil.  A tin trumpet which had been placed below the table now poked out its smaller end close under the top of the table near where I was sitting.  I was allowed to try and catch it, but it dodged all my attempts in the most amusing way, the medium on the opposite side sat perfectly still, while at my request all held up their joined hands so that I could see no one was touching the trumpet, as it played peep-boo with me.  Sounds like the sawing of wood, the bouncing of a ball, and other noises occurred, which were inexplicable.\"     The table then began to rise from the floor some 18 inches and remained suspended in the air.  \"I was allowed to go up to the table and saw clearly no one was touching it, a clear space separating the sitters from the table,\" Barrett continued the explanation.  \"I tried to press the table down, and though I exerted all my strength could not do so; then I climbed up on the table and sat on it, my feet off the floor, when I was swayed to and fro and finally tipped off. The table of its own accord now turned upside down, no one touching it, and I tried to lift it off the ground, but it could not be stirred, it appeared screwed down to the floor.  At my request all the sitters' clasped hands had been kept raised above their heads, and I could see that no one was touching the table.  When I desisted from trying to lift the inverted table from the floor, it righted itself again on its own accord, no one helping it.  Numerous sounds displaying an amused intelligence then came, and after each individual present had been greeted with some farewell raps the sitting ended.\"    Barrett said that he could not imagine how the cleverest conjurer could have performed what he experienced, especially since it was clear to him that there was no elaborate apparatus in the room.  Moreover, Dr. Crawford had been observing the Goligher circle for six months or more before his observations.  \"That there is an unseen intelligence behind these manifestations is all we can say, but that is a tremendous assertion, and if admitted destroys the whole basis of materialism,\" Barrett added.  During his 50 years of studying psychic phenomena, Barrett observed nearly every type of mediumship.  In his reminiscences, read at a private meeting of the SPR on June 17, 1924, less than a year before his death, Barrett said:  \"I am personally convinced that the evidence we have published decidedly demonstrates (1) the existence of a spiritual world, (2) survival after death, and (3) of occasional communication from those who have passed over - It is however hardly possible to convey to others who have not had a similar experience an adequate idea of the strength and cumulative force of the evidence that has compelled [my] belief.\"    Barrett is also remembered for his study of dowsing and deathbed visions. His book, Death-Bed Visions, first published in 1926, the year after his death, is still popular today. It offers a number of intriguing reports in which a dying person appears to see and recognize some deceased relative or friend, some of them involving instances where the dying person was unaware of the previous death of the spirit form he sees.  \"These cases form, perhaps, one of the most cogent arguments for survival after death, as the evidential value and veridical (truth telling) character of these visions of the dying is greatly enhanced when the fact is undeniably established that the dying person was wholly ignorant of the decease of the person he or she so vividly sees,\" Barrett stated in the Introduction.  Several weeks after his death, Barrett's wife, Lady Florence Barrett, a prominent, obstetric surgeon and dean of the London School of Medicine for Women, began receiving very evidential messages from Sir William through the mediumship of Mrs. Leonard.  Over the next eleven years, she sat with Leonard every few months, taking verbatim notes as Sir William communicated.  She also received evidential messages from several other mediums. A book, Personality Survives Death, published in 1937 by Longmans, Green and Co. of London, resulted from these sittings.       Lady Barrett asked Sir William how she might satisfy people that she was really talking to him.  He replied that it depends on the type of mind, commenting that reference to a tear in the wallpaper in his old room might satisfy some people and not others.  Lady Barrett noted that a month before his death he had pointed out a tear in the wallpaper in one corner of his room.  Sir William then said that some higher minds have gone well beyond the need for such trivial verification, mentioning another distinguished British physicist, still in the flesh, Sir Oliver Lodge.  \"Lodge is nearer the bigger, greater aspect of things than most,\" he stated.  Sir William further explained that his objective in communicating with his wife was not simply to add to the mass of evidence already given concerning the survival of consciousness at death but to help find a working philosophy to guide those on earth who are struggling with finding a purpose in life.  \"It seems to me from where I am most people are not even struggling but meandering on purposelessly, blindly, because they have no definite philosophy as a starting point,\" he communicated.  He went on to say that knowledge of the afterlife opens the gates of inspiration and makes the intuition keener.  With that comes greater enthusiasm, greater understanding of the beauties of life, even the perceiving of beauty where ugliness had appeared to exist.   \"Life on my side seems so extraordinarily easy compared to earth,\" Sir William offered in a 1929 sitting, \"because we simply live according to the rules of love.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She prays that it is a mistake, but when Sofie's body is found, Jenna must confront the fact that her young, beautiful daughter is dead. Her ex-husband, Mark, finds her at the hotel, and they console each other physically, something they haven't done since the divorce and Mark's remarriage. Then, after Jenna goes home to California, her life starts to unravel. She can no longer sympathize with her students at a community college: they are alive and her daughter is dead. She also must deal with her younger boyfriend, Tim. He reminds her of youth, and she is having a hard time being alive while the daughter who was everything to her is no more. As Inclan delves into one woman's pain as she reconciles loss with a new life, she grants readers insight into the resiliency of the human spirit in a touching and very human story.Patty Engelmann, BooklistThis unique read focuses on the letters that Jenna writes to Sofie after her death. Writing allows her to find closure and reveal her innermost thoughts. Inclán writes powerfully and movingly about Jenna's enthrallingly triumphant battle with grief.Reviewed By: Sheri Melnick, Romantic TimesIt's the worst thing any parent can imagine - the death of a child.

In Warriors, Bruchac introduces Jake Forrest, a young teenager who leaves the Iroquois reservation where he was raised to live with his mother, a lawyer in Maryland, and attend a prestigious private boy's school. Like many kids his age, Jake wrestles with the difficulties of moving to a new city, fitting in at a new school, and trying to make the best of his one-parent family. Additionally, he endures many little offenses, like the nickname \"Chief,\" and bigger ones, like the biased presentation of events in history class. Throughout the novel, the author mixes just the right amount of universal teen experience and culturally specific perspective to make Jake's story appealing to a broad audience. Plus, as a sports novel, Warriors is just plain fun, with action-packed descriptions of lacrosse that put readers right on the field with the players. One hopes that books like this will encourage more teens, from all ethnic backgrounds, to recognize and internalize their own traditions instead of opting for mainstream popular culture.Sean George, Memphis-Shelby County Public Library & Information Center, Memphis, TNCopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00C033EOO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From now on, \"Brood\" will\n be classified simply as \"Awesome Fiction\". Sterling Strange is a\nPrivate Investigator; Nicky Lang, formerly a psychiatrist, is his\nassistant. Sterling's last name couldn't be a better fit for the case\nhe's on in this book. In fact, his office should have \"Strange\nInvestigations\" stenciled on the door, if it doesn't already.Contacted\n by the ex-wife of Walter Kronski, a disgraced marine biologist,\nSterling agrees to try to find the man, who has been out of contact for\nthree months. Last heard from in the fishing community of Fair Harbor,\nAlaska, Kronski is just one of 17 men, mostly fishermen, who have gone\nmissing from Fair Harbor over the previous 11 months. Why has that not\ncaught the attention of law enforcement personnel?Strange and\nLang arrive in Fair Harbor to learn they are not at all welcome in the\ncommunity. Fair Harbor is filled with hard working commercial fishermen.\n They have little interest in panty-waist city slickers poking their\nnoses into things that don't concern them. Fortunately Strange has a\nfriend in the FBI, so the local sheriff is basically ordered to\ncooperate with them. As far as Kronski is concerned, the whole community\n is apparently happy that he disappeared. But the other missing men all\nhad one thing in common: each of them had lost fingers or toes in a\nfishing mishap just prior to going missing. Coincidence? Not likely.With\n barely nominal help from the sheriff, and outright hostility from\neverybody else, the two P.I.'s work on their own to find and follow up\non clues. What they find is anything except what they hoped to find.\nThey did locate the body of Kronski... but he looked more like a\nhuman-fish hybrid than anything else. And that was NOT the weirdest\nthing that happened in this novel! Official cover-ups dating back\ndecades, government collusion, alien spaceships, bizarre events around\nevery corner... Fair Harbor was a hotbed of the strange, the weird, and\nthe bizarre.Will this be the final case for Strange and Lang?\nHave they finally gotten into something too deep to dig their way back\nout? Only by reading this book will you find out. I can assure you,\nthough; once you start reading you won't be able to put it down until\nyou finish it. I recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense,\naction, science fiction, or just plain awesome fiction! This one rates\nthe full 5 stars.GRAMPY -- AMAZON REVIEWER -- 5 STARS", "related": ["B00EK5T7J6"], "rank": 1261888, "title": "Brood", "author": "Lars Guignard", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 3.8, "rating_total": 57.0}

An enlightening read on the consequences of classism in America, for the middle class this book effectively shatters the myopic cultural lens through which they often view, judge, and justify the subjugation of the working class. For the working class, it is an affirmation of their cultures, lifestyles, and labors. A companion for the class 'cross-overs,' it's a must-read for teachers, psychologists, and social workers.\"—Elissa Mugianis,ForeWord Reviews(Fall 2012)\"Working-class culture is an important topic, but it is most often treated as something to overcome. Barbara Jensen's approach is different: she speaks of working-class life from its strengths, without eliding its pain and oppression. Moreover, she writes beautifully.\"—Jean Anyon, Graduate Center, City University of New York, author ofMarx and Education\"Like Barbara Jensen, I was born in the working class but moved into the middle class. That journey is rife with perils, as a person must move away from the very people who launched him or her to go on to become something completely different. Coming from a tough Brooklyn neighborhood, I was eager to move on with my life. But Jensen, with her stories about the love and decency of her working-class forebears, showed me another way to be working class. It made me rethink some of my core assumptions and reevaluate my initial judgments about where I came from and who I am. Working-class people moving into the middle class rarely see their lives represented. Here, then, is a great example of that kind of life, that kind of experience. Jensen's personal story, combined with her training as a psychologist, make her the perfect person to write this book.\"—Al Lubrano, author ofLimbo: Blue-Collar Roots, White-Collar Dreams\"Whether you're middle class or working class, you need to read this book. And if you’re an upwardly mobile 'crossover,' this book could save your sanity. Barbara Jensen has pulled off something extraordinary: she exemplifies her ideas about the strengths of working-class and middle-class cultures by writing in both voices. A crossover herself, she analyzes previous theories and creates a memorable framework, and she tells us heartfelt stories and uses colorful analogies.

I knew Jimmy's name, that he loved to run, that his brother played baseball but mysteriously gave it up, his parents were divorced and many other details about their lives. But Allison took some time; just as she holds back from Jimmy, she holds back from everyone, hiding a depth of emotion and more to her character.I hope you enjoy finding out about them all as much as I did. I'm considering writing another book with many of the same characters because I like them so much. Maybe we'll follow Jimmy, Allison and Double A into their senior year; maybe Ritchie gets back into baseball. What else?

And yet, Juan Pujol was a real man, driven by his desire to use his intellect to help the Allied war effort in any way possible--even if that meant pretending to be a Nazi sympathizer. Steve Anderson is an expert guide in the ever-twisting world of the double agent, introducing readers to the many players in Pujol's deception, including gullible Nazis and Pujol's wife Araceli, who helped him cement his place as a double-agent but also became the biggest threat to his entire operation.Double-Edged Sworduses firsthand documents and text from secret messages to examine the double agent's motivations and aspirations, as well as snippets of imagined dialogue to bring Pujol's story to vivid life.--Malissa Kent", "related": [], "rank": 543509, "title": "Double-Edged Sword (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Steve Anderson", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 3.4, "rating_total": 17.0}

From 1995 to 2002 he wrote two editions of Excess Heat, Why Cold Fusion Research Prevailed, a report on the revolutionary experimental science at the core of the subject, and the extensive theoretical controversy surrounding it. His papers from that undertaking now reside as a special collection at the J. Willard Marriott Library of the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.

In 1920, when Elsa is just six, her father comes home from war a changed man and begins to physically abuse her. Ninety years later, war brings tragedy again. As a young woman Elsa escapes from home, marries well, and remakes herself, bearing one child, Andrew, who falls in love with lower-class Caroline because she is so unlike his mother. In 2010, Max—the only child of Andrew and Caroline, a golden boy whom Caroline loves more than life itself—dies on duty in the Upper Nile when he steps on an IED. A marriage is strained to the point of breaking, and age and illness cause shifts in power between Caroline and Elsa, the mother-in-law she always feared. Day (Scissors, Paper, Stone, 2012) captures nuances in the relationships between her well-drawn, fallible characters, focusing on one after the other in nonchronological chapters that constitute a vivid mosaic of grief and aging.

Mike once again calls on his dog Harry, who happens to be gifted with ESP. Harry can telepathically communicate information on each batter's weaknesses and strengths to his master. This works early on, but by the game's important climax, Mike has gained confidence and is guided by his own instincts. He pitches a no-hitter. Although this is a sports fantasy directed at the early chapter-book audience, it strains credulity and is so predictable and preachy that all but the most diligent fans of the series will lose interest early on.

It deals with all the important aspects of one of the most important transformations in modern history. It is based on a massive empirical literature and - what's rare - on an author's firsthand knowledge of the transition countries. It should be read by everybody interested in modern history, politics, and economics.' Leszek Balcerowicz, College of Europe and Former Chairman, National Bank of Poland'This book is a heroic attempt to cover the whole of transition from the former Soviet Union and Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe to the Baltics. Anders Åslund is able to cover this vast territory in a substantive way by grouping the transition experiences in a clear and logical manner. It is a timely publication.' Paul Gregory, University of Houston'Anders Åslund has followed post-communist transitions from the outset, and he has got it right. Few economists have seriously studied the transformation of post-communist economies, or more poetically, how aquaria have been restored from fish soup. Åslund has. One of his main conclusions is that early, comprehensive, and radical market economic reforms worked best, and as he rightly points out, Estonia is the best proof that such policies work.' Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the Republic of Estonia'Anders Åslund has repeatedly challenged conventional wisdom. He was right about Gorbachev's reforms, right about Yeltsin, and right about the more recent resurgence of Russia. Anyone who cares about the former Soviet Union, emerging markets, global energy security, and the progress of democracy ignores Åslund and this book at their own peril.' Simon Johnson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology'For more than twenty years, Anders Åslund has been the most perceptive and knowledgeable chronicler of the creation of capitalism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. His excellent judgment and wisdom shine through every page of this volume.' Andrei Shleifer, Harvard University'Anders Åslund is the world's keenest observer of what used to be called 'transition economies'. Everyone concerned with the historical lesson these economies provide or their future should read this important book.'

He then retired to work in industry for seven years before retiring for a second time.  At that point he and his wife bought a yacht and went to live in the Caribbean.  It was this experience that led to the idea for his first book ‘Jacaranda’.  There is so much history in the islands that remains forgotten.  The book and its sequel ‘The Guadeloupe Guillotine’ seek to illuminate a small corner of history that is largely ignored and at the same time provide a thrilling and exciting story for all who love the sea and sailing. Brought up on the books of C S Forester and Patrick O’Brien he was surprised that no one was writing similar stories about the modern Royal Navy, especially with so much going in in previous decades.  As he was himself a Lynx helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, he decided to start there, using his own extensive knowledge of the conflict.  ‘Sea Skimmer’ was the result; a book based on many true stories, the main one being why the Argentinian Exocet missiles failed to explode.  Directly involved in anti Exocet countermeasures and also with a grandstand seat of the final Exocet raid of the war, the book, although a novel, has an authenticity that cannot be bettered.  The next one in the series, ‘The Caspian Monster’ looks at Cold War Operations and the little known fact that 1983 was the year nuclear war almost broke out and no one realised it.  The latest book in the series is about anti-submarine and anti-drug smuggling operations in the West Indies, something else he has first hand experience of.  There are many more to follow. He now lives near Plymouth in Devon, where he works as a full time writer and extraordinarily bad golfer.", "related": [], "rank": 1153599, "title": "Cocaine (Jon Hunt Book 3)", "author": "Larry Jeram-Croft", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kevin VanDam and Rick Clunn each\nhave won four Bassmaster Classics. Larry Nixon has won just-about every major\ntournament in the nation. Mark Davis is the gentle giant of bass fishing. Not\nonly is he a winner, but he draws people to him. George Cochran wins\ntournaments by fishing places no-other angler even will think about fishing.\nShaw Grigsby is a steady competitor, in the money year after year, and he\nteaches thousands of people how to fish on his TV shows. Denny Brauer has proven\nyou can take one tactic and make a reputation out of it, but he's also\nextremely versatile and wins numbers of tournaments, even when he's not\nflipping and pitching. Mark Rose, a young gun, has won big money, is a proven\nprofessional on the FLW tournament trail and is a pro to watch. All these men\nknow how to win. Question: How\ndoes learning how these different people fish help me win a bass tournament?Phillips:\nThese pros have similar tactics, like carefully preparing their tackle before a\ntournament. But each one of these pros also has a completely-different strength\nor weakness. So, if you read the entire book and study what each pro is telling\nyou, highlight the information that can help you and go back to read that\nhighlighted information 5-10 times for 5-10 days, you can learn that strategy,\nmake it a part of your tournament routine and increase your odds for winning. I\nknow, because I've seen it happen with the best of the best.Question: Why do\nyou think this book is important?Phillips:\nEveryone who goes bass fishing wants to know how to catch a bass, how to catch\nthe most bass and how to catch big bass. Once they're able to fulfill these\ngoals, they begin to think about becoming professional bass fishermen. Usually,\nonce an angler starts fishing in a club tournament, he begins to wonder, \"Am I\ngood enough to be a pro, and travel the world fishing tournaments, doing\npromotions for sponsors, teaching bass fishing, speaking at seminars and trade\nshows and possibly having my own TV show?\" Well, to go from being a beginning\nfisherman to a national professional bass fisherman requires one main\ningredient: You have to know how to win a bass tournament. I learned long ago\nthat the shortest distance from where you are to where you want to be is to\nlearn from someone who's already in the profession. Learn from the best, and\nyou can be the best.", "related": ["B00A39RVWI"], "rank": 1203601, "title": "How to Win a Bass Tournament", "author": "John E.

Barton is the author of several fast-paced mystery and thriller series, featuring lively characters and lots of action. \"Miz Scarlet\" (Scarlet Wilson Mystery series) is a teacher-turned-innkeeper, who throws herself into danger with a feisty determination to make things right, relying on cohorts like \"Captain Peacock\" and \"Colonel Grey Poupon\" to help her solve the clues. Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans.

She was accepted into the Walt Disney Studios Fellowship program based on the screen adaptation of one of her stage plays. During her year at Disney, Valerie completed her fourth screenplay, which led to an eleven year career as a network and cable television writer and producer. In 2008, as a birthday gift to her sister, she wrote a short story about a girl detective named Jacqueléne Dyanne.

Many others, however, were not as fortunate.When I was finally able to leave New York City, and head back to Los Angeles, I had very mixed emotions. A part of me was relieved to soon be back in my comfortable home.  Another part of me wanted to stay in New York City, pitch in, and help see this through.As I am writing this, a month has passed since Hurricane Sandy crashed ashore. The storm has dissipated but her impact is still being felt by many and the feeling of how I can be of service to those in need still lingers inside of me.Then I struck idea gold.  I will marry my passion for writing, with my purpose of lending support to those affected by Hurricane Sandy, publish this poetry book and donate all proceeds from the sales to a Hurricane Sandy Relief Fund.\"Searching - A Personal Journey of Hope\",  is my own soul-baring journey, told through poetry and imagery.  It is my joy to share it with you.In gratitude,Jennifer", "related": ["B00AFG0XTW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He accidentally started a house fire at the young age of five resulting in being diagnosed prematurely as mentally ill. This increased his feelings of being out of place, not fitting in, being defective, and resulted in low self-esteem, getting teased, bullied, and having problems in school until being labeled as Emotionally Disturbed and being placed into 'Special Ed'. This escalated into trouble with the law, neighbors, friends, family, and himself.  Years of alcoholism, marijuana addiction, and other drug abuse eventually lead to isolation, depression, and despair. There seemed to be nothing left before reaching near suicide around January 31, 2008. This was soon before entering an outpatient rehab to first become (and remain) sober, clean, and working the 12 steps to recovery.  His first book, \"Honest Open Willing...My Journey From Despair To Hope\" was published in an attempt to show the public that people with addictions, mental illnesses, and different problems need understanding and support. Steven Adelman continues trying to carry the message as a way of expressing gratitude. If others can identify with him then maybe they will know they are not alone and that there is hope for them too!", "related": ["B00C4HXRS4"], "rank": 2958354, "title": "The 12 Steps Said Simple", "author": "Steven R.

Sylvia has been writing since her early teens and her work consists of screenplays and novels.   As with most authors, Sylvia draws on her varied experience from having worked in the field of human resources across a number of industries including the glamorous world of international hotels. In the romance genre, Sylvia reveals a soft spot for older female protagonists who are on the cusp of 40 and beyond. One of her novels, The Other Boyfriend, is loosely based on her own life experience whilst she lived in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Her other romance novel, Like Casablanca, is a romantic comedy about internet dating.   On a more serious note, Sylvia wrote a very touching contemporary fiction drama, The Soul Bearers, which explores issues of child abuse, repressed sexuality, AIDS and gay rights; a story inspired by real life events and filled with hope and inspiration when overcoming fear, loss, and betrayal. At present, the novel is under consideration for adaptation into a feature film. An avid fan of classic black and white Hollywood movies of the 40s including film noir, Sylvia has recently embarked on a contemporary mystery series whose protagonist is an older, spunky and smartarse female of 48, who works in the international world of hotels. The theme is comedic, sprinkled with a little bit of style from the film noir era; the stories are fast-paced and set in the modern day world. The first two novels in the series are Playing With The Bad Boys and The Gay Mardi Gras Murders.", "related": ["B0097HAPDY"], "rank": 2266542, "title": "The Gay Mardi Gras Murders: A Mia Ferrari Mystery", "author": "Sylvia Massara", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.1818, "rating_total": 46.0}

He always marched to the beat of a different drummer. Quitting school at the age of 16 was the climax of a trouble childhood. At the age of 17 he moved in with his wife Betsy. Betsy was 15. They have 2 boys, Jesse and Adam. 40 years later they are still married. For the first 36 years of his life, he struggled with many demons.  21 years ago, Lefty’s life bottomed out and he recovered from alcoholism. Since then, Lefty has reinvented himself, with the help of strong mentorship, in the most successfully positive direction. He went from being a struggling self-employed roofer, to running a successful roofing company. This has expanded into 3 companies which employees mostly people who are looking to get a new start in life. Lefty credits his father with teaching him many basic principles. His father always told him,” Do what you love to do and you will never have to work a day in your life. If you are not doing what you love to do you are hurting 2 people. First, you are hurting yourself because you have a job because of what it pays.  Secondly, you are also hurting someone else because they can not live their dream because you have their dream job. Do what you love the money will follow.\" More importantly he is a mentor to others, showing them the way out of their seemingly hopeless circumstances. Helping others discover and achieve their dreams has been a driving force in his life for the last 21 years. He recently started a blog titled the “7 Day Mental Diet”, adopted from author Emmett Fox. And this is just one of the many tools Lefty uses to encourage others to follow their dreams.  Lefty still marches to the beat of a different drummer and the world is a better place to live.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As an adult I earned a college degree, got married, and had a child, but I never stopped writing. It only got more fun. I wrote through my lunch breaks at work. I wrote on the treadmill at the gym. Eventually, I had dozens of short stories, novellas, and full-length novels piling up on thumb drives and in plastic tubs. Now, I’m ready to share my stories with you, starting with Spell of Summoning and Spell of Binding, the first two volumes in my Dark Caster series.

Although modest in size, these texts are packed with information... in terms of portability and cost... they make themselves serious contenders for the college bags of students of Chinese medicine... In terms of visual presentation, other than the obligatory yin-yang and five-phase diagrams, assistance is limited to a few flow diagrams, which may disappoint more visually-orientated learners. This drawback is largely compensated for by the consistent use of clear tables that facilitate both learning and quick reference. Despite the drawback of the simplification inherent in such texts, some of the chapters are excellent. The chapter on emotions and elements in Basic Theories, for example, is particularly good, as is the chapter on bianzheng in the Diagnostic volume. The chapters on pulse and tongue are also well-written, and designed for quick navigation to allow mere seconds to access, for example, the description and significance of a tense pulse or a grey tongue coating. As such... These texts offer simple, portable, concise and well-structured information that is consistent with the TCM literature already available. On occasion, refreshingly original insights come from the teaching experience of the authors. Whilst this series does not necessarily offer an educational panacea, it may just offer what is missing on the market - an affordable, accurate and accessible series of texts written specifically for a Western mindset and understanding. If the rest of this series of text books are as good as the two reviewed here (Diagnostic of Chinese Medicine and Basic Theories of Chinese Medicine), Singing Dragon Textbooks will definitely become part of the recommended reading of Chinese medicine courses; student in the early stages of their TCM studies o those that require a fresh angle or portable material for revision should certainly consider buying them.'- Journal of Chinese Medicine, Greg Meier'Although the lucidity of this textbook would have been even more leveraged in the first few years of my OM studies, I find its clarity of context heady refreshment as I am approaching the end of my third decade of practice.'- Frank Yurasek Ph.

I feel that this qualifies me to write and share that experience. The book gives you opportunity to walk with me on a daily basis and feel some of the pitfalls and landmines waiting around every corner for the grieving parent. When I brought Ryan to the emergency room late one night in February, he was six and a half years old. Little did I know my life was about to change forever? I carried Ryan to the back of the emergency room. He felt like a wet dishcloth. He was lifeless. They took him out of my arms and started to call his name and shake him to see if he would respond. Ryan didn't respond so they called a code blue. I stood there almost breathless as I watched this scene unfold right in front of me. I felt like I was not there. It felt so surreal. I saw him having seizures one after another. He had at least three. He also had stroked-out which blew both his eyes. The doctors and nurses were trying everything they could to save his life. Here was my helpless child and lying there and I could do nothing to help him. I felt just as helpless watching this happening right in front of my eyes. We as parents are never prepared for a thing like this to happen. Ryan ended up in a coma that lasted for three days. They were three of the longest days of my life. I did not sleep or eat at all I was on automatic at this point. When Ryan came out of the coma, we still did not know what had caused all the many things that happened to Ryan in the emergency room because of this they had to run a whole gamut of tests and that took days. Once again, I found myself waiting breathlessly for them to come back with an explanation of why these things happened, while praying all the time that it was nothing serious. I will never forget the day when the results came back. Here is where it gets hard to write but I am going to try.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bullying in the Workplace will help academics and managers to define bullying, develop and implement practical programs that prevent it, and intervene successfully when it does occur.  For researchers, it provides a foundation to build on in developing a better understanding of bullying and improving the means by which we can address it. For practitioners, it offers a comprehensive guide to issues ranging from identification and intervention to education and prevention. It is a must-read for anyone studying the phenomenon, as well as for all of us working on a daily basis to address it in our own organizations.\"--Eugene W.

As a participant, observer, and insightful critic, Wendy Leo Moore provides a richly detailed picture of the everyday practices by which racial inequality is reproduced. (Jennifer L. Pierce)Despite the seemingly unblemished liberal skin of law schools, racist tendencies remain. InReproducing RacismWendy Leo Moore examines the continuing effects of racism at the institutional level, addressing how racially inclusive and exclusive 'white space' functions in law schools. (Richard Delgado)Professor Wendy Leo Moore inReproducing Racismlifts the smokescreen on racism in two of the most prestigious law schools in the United States, making it very clear that race still structures law school access and acceptance, even among the so-called best and brightest. Well-written and finely argued,Reproducing Racism: White Space, Elite Law Schools, and Racial Inequalityis a powerful contribution to our understanding of racism in the 21st century. (Rose Brewer)Everyone should read this book, a call to researchers to examine the reproduction of racism in other areas. Highly recommended. (Choice)There is a growing tendency to view our major institutions in the United States as being more racially inclusive and less racist. Wendy Leo Moore's meticulous study of two elite law schools shatters the myth that legal education takes place in a race neutral environment. This book is essential for anyone interested in understanding how white privilege is reproduced within the context of an ostensibly colorblind institutional setting.

She says, \"I still don't--but I like it!\" Her imagination became apparent at age three. Sigma was her very first (imaginary) boyfriend. He lived about fifteen miles from her family's farm. She took him chicken noodle soup every night on one of their snowmobiles.(Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring). Apparently he was very ill and \"Thank God\" she was able to take care of him. At eight her love for writing blossomed. Together with her cousins (of course she was the president) they wrote a newsletter and sold it to their family members. Years later she decided to put it back into print to entertain her cousin as she was on an aircraft carrier on 9/11, very far away from home during a scary time for our country. Fast forward to 2012. She read 50 Shades and thought, 'I wanna do that!' (meaning writing). She has two complete series, The Love Series and Wrapped. There are also two new series Burning Souls and Men of Steel that are as of now not complete. Thirteen books in sixteen months. CrAzY and wonderful. She loves love! Her Mom raised her right. She says please and thank you and means it.  Her mother taught her to take care of herself and others. 'I don't like leaving the house without mascara even if I'm in an oversized hoody and warm up pants.' Her Dad taught her how to work hard and never expect to be handed anything. She likes to work and doesn't mind getting dirty. Both taught her to be respectful and the importance of doing the right thing regardless of what people around her do. They taught her about the importance of family and that it didn't always just include blood relatives. They also tried to teach her how to keep my thoughts to myself...she is still working on that. MJ tends to enjoy watching people grow and change with self realization and moments of clarity that just sneak up behind you and smack you in the head. She loves people and has always been able to see both sides of a story. 'Each person that comes into our life leaves us with something it is what we choose to do with it that helps us grow.' She lives in central New York in the middle of nowhere and is surrounded by family and friend most the time. She spends time writing and doing the typical Mommy things. Her house is full of pets, friends, and noise ninety percent of the time, and she would have it no other way.", "related": ["B00L82ZVYE"], "rank": 76650, "title": "Forged (Burning Souls Book 2)", "author": "MJ Fields", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 23, "rating_average": 4.6957, "rating_total": 108.0}

There will be more in book two. But, do you really believe there are energy patterns like that which affect our lives? Let me tell you a few things about thirteen in my life. My name has thirteen letters. I was born in the sign of Scorpio, which is represented in tarot by Key 13. I got my first job at the age of thirteen. I worked there until I graduated from high school. I had one other job after that. Then at the age of twenty-six, thirteen years after I got my first job, I switched to a good paying job which I kept for many years. There are other significant thirteens, but this is a short bio so I’ll skip to the present. On July 13, 2012, a Friday the thirteenth, a freak accident at work broke a bone in my hand. It was bad and needed surgery. I decided it wasn’t a problem but an opportunity; time to prepare myself, and get The Dreams of Sara Knight ready for publication. Exactly one year later, on July 13, I received the edited copy of my manuscript back from my editor. I was ready to go. So, here we are in 2013 and my life course is changing again as I publish my first novel. And by the way, as I do this, I have been studying with a western mystery school for 13 years. So, you decide, is life more about patterns of energy than we normally consider? It certainly is. We are vital energy beings first, and live in an electrical universe. Someday I’ll write the whole story and share it with you. A good place to begin exploring this for yourself would be looking at some short videos about cymatics on Youtube. They are very cool! They demonstrate the relationship between energy vibrations and definite, universal patterns. Do that, and you’re on your way to understanding how energy patterns affect your life. If you follow this clue like an investigative journalist, you’ll learn many amazing things.", "related": [], "rank": 4507293, "title": "Eight Days of Transformation (The Dreams of Sara Knight Book 2)", "author": "Steven Misosky", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When I went there in the first week in February of 1996, it was not the most settled country. I was fortunate enough to live down on the coast in Kampot Town of Kampot Province. In between Kampot and Phnom Penh was four hours of basic \"no man's land\" which had to be traveled to reach the capital. If you wanted to go to Phnom Penh, you left with a convoy and came back the same way. Living in Cambodia gave me a greater, deeper appreciation for my own country. I have been writing all my life, well ever since going to school. It runs in my mother's family. What am I working on right now? I have Redemption at Midnight with Land of the Golden Towers on the back burner. I love to write and find it makes my days better if I am working on my writing projects.

Specifically my parents moved to Morecambe, the seaside and to this day I still love looking at the sea. It's something you'll either 'get' or you won't. But when the wife and I bought our first house together, condition number one was it had to be near the sea. We were lucky enough to pick one with a view right across Morecambe Bay. The town might be struggling, but I've been around the world and have yet to see a better view. Amongst my various qualifications that I have yet to put to use is an MA in Creative Writing from Manchester Metropolitan University. I'd thoroughly recommend the course to anyone interested in writing as it's great to be around like minded folk. I also have a BA (Hons) in English and Urban Policy and a Post Grad Diploma in Management which the NHS (my employer) very kindly paid for. My favourite author is Stephen King and I maintain that when he's on form he's as good as anyone has ever been. Unfortunately, in my opinion, he is often sold short as merely a writer of horror stories. Still, he's hardly struggling for readers. My favourite book is Catcher in the Rye although it's not everyone's idea of fun. I'm also an armchair sportsfan. For football, it's Liverpool. Golf, Tiger Woods. He'll come good. Tennis, Federer, by a distance the best player I've ever seen and I was a big Sampras fan. Most nights I also enjoy an ale. And a gin - specifically Hendricks, there's none finer. I like Port too, but I'm less fussy about the brand. My first novel was Playground Cool, written as part of my MA. It passed with flying colours, I got an agent from my very first letter and then...rejection letters from publishers. I've been close to publication with Transword since with another novel but still the book deal eludes me. I remain undeterred and still write all the time. Plus, the advent of the e-reader has made it possible for anyone to publish so who knows...", "related": ["B00571O3X2"], "rank": 3585481, "title": "Ballroom, Bars and Seawater Baths: Sequel to The 24 Hour Jazz Cafe", "author": "Jamie Sinclair", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Born in 1912, Turing accomplished more in his short 42 years than even most geniuses manage in twice that time. Nazi code breaker, pioneer of computing, innovative mathematician, and apparent suicide, Turing came up with the famous \"test\" that bears his name: if a human can’t tell the difference between communicating with another human or with a computer, that computer (program) passes. As with most historical notables, though, Turing was as idiosyncratic, conflicted, and ultimately interesting a person as he has become as an icon. After World War II, his increasingly explicit homosexuality -- then a punishable offense in his native Britain -- led to his growing alienation and eventual taking of his own life by cyanide. As a primer on the life and accomplishments of this intellectual giant, David Boyle's Kindle Single serves well, marking the House of Lords's long overdue pardoning of Turing's \"sex crimes\" in 2013 with an energetic narrative that weaves the undisputed facts of Turing's life together with an undoing of certain persistent myths and a reverent encapsulation of his import. --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B00GB9ZQHQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
