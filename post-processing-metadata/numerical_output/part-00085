Conley, who has compiled several other quirky dictionaries, became a sort of cult hero when he put an early edition of this one online, where it garnered a huge following among people surfing the web for the odd and amusing. For each letter, Conley gives dozens of meanings, which he often supports with citations from literature, science and pop culture. The definitions are arranged in groups like \"shapes and sizes,\" military and \"people, places, things,\" some of which are common to most letters and others that pertain to only one, like \"exertions of power,\" which has two entries under \"d.\" Conley's own explanations are brief; the bulk of the book is taken up by quotations where he found a particular usage, and these come from sources as diverse as Joyce's Ulysses, Winnie-the-Pooh and the American Medical Association. Many of the instances Conley refers to are arcane or technical, and he does a cursory job of explaining the project and justifying his methods, so some entries will leave readers baffled. (Consider \"v-bob\": \"a strong frame shaped like an isosceles triangle, turning on a pivot at its axis, and used as a bell crank to change the direction of a main pump rod.\") Even so, anyone fascinated by language (and especially fans of word games like Scrabble) will be thrilled with this unique resource.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Morris' exhaustively researched provision of this information seemingly includes every footnotable fact. The commitment to completeness might overwhelm the casual reader, but it does establish a one-stop shop for anyone interested in any member of the corps. Instead of using a biographical framework, the author arranges the material chronologically, starting with the first man to be released from service (John Colter, who turned into a mountain man) and proceeding to the last one to die (Patrick Gass, in 1870). This approach uses separate events to collect the expedition figures, such as unfinished business from the expedition itself--returning a Mandan chief and Sacagawea to the upper Missouri and publishing the expedition's journals. Similarly, the fur trade, farming, the 1811-12 earthquakes, and the War of 1812 centralize the biographies of the members they affected.

This puts more emphasis on statistical properties, and less on the internal decision-making of each agent. There are already some surprising beginning results  including a novel treatment of aggregate demand, and one can expect more when their approach is combined with standard economic reasoning.

It is also the sweetest of all the stand-alone offerings in the series. The ending as well as the rest of the story is delightful. This is one I'll be reading over and over.\"Karen Haas, Just Erotic Romance Reviews5 Cherries:\"I was amazed with the depth of story and character in so few pages. The pace was spot on. To be honest, this is a sweet story told in a spicy way. For me, I would like to see more of these and I will definitely look for more books (of all length) by this author.\"Gardenia, Whipped Cream4 Cups:\"Initiating Christian is a wickedly romantic story about a man's first time, and the woman who is not only his fantasy but his teacher as well. This is a wonderful story, that for once tells the tale of a manss introduction to the art of love by an older experienced woman. This story was an entertaining one that was easy to get into from the first few pages.

Tucking a few uncommon details into, particularly, the early chapters, Skurzynski begins with the development of gunpowder bombs and rockets in China, goes on to explain the ideas of pioneers like Konstantin Tsiolkovksy and Robert Goddard, then recaps the Space Race and highlights of the Space Shuttle Program. After a quick look at the commercial rockets under development by Elon Musk's SpaceX Corporation (but none of his several private competitors), she closes with a highly selective list of alternatives to chemical rockets: the space elevator, solar sails, ion engines, and magneto-plasma propulsion. Further marred by a hard-to-read main text printed in low-contrast gray against a patterned background, and also an incorrect claim that the solar wind is composed of photons, this book may draw some readers with its attractive photos and packaging, but doesn't make a significant contribution to space exploration's history or ongoing initiatives.—John Peters, New York Public Library(c) Copyright 2010.

He enumerates the many natural forces that create waves: the moon's gravity pulls on the oceans; Earth's rotation pushes them; the sun heats them; the wind tugs against their surface; earthquakes displace them. The resulting waves can propagate from one side of the ocean to the other: waves from one storm race outward to interact with waves from another, converging ocean currents force them even higher or flatten them out completely. The complexity of waves staggers the imagination. In modern times, Smith says, with the importance of shipping and the growth of off-shore drilling platforms, understanding waves is more vital than ever—we must especially understand extreme, or rogue, waves that can appear out of nowhere and tower over a hundred feet high. In a chapter on the 2004 tsunami, Smith recounts the harrowing experience of two scuba divers caught in the maelstrom and suggests California could be at risk for a future tsunami. Science is only beginning to understand tsunamis, hurricanes and rogue waves, and Smith's book is for readers who want a serious scientific look at what we're learning.

My family moved quite a bit when I was young and by the time I was twelve we finally settled right where we started, in Northern Wisconsin. Even at that early age, I knew that I didn’t fit into most social groups and felt there had to be more to life than what was on the surface. Growing up in a small town, my adolescence and early adult life was somewhat uneventful and yet never typical. Underlying it all was a feeling that there had to be “something more”. That feeling, along with a good dose of curiosity, led me to try many different things in my search to satisfy that craving and to find meaning and purpose to my life. After high school, I worked manual labor and semi-skilled jobs in my quest... each of them giving perspective, but none providing the answers that I was seeking. I worked at those jobs for six years before attending college and earning a degree in Business/Computer Science.  I worked as a computer programming for a brief time. It was in college that I met, dated and married a girl that I had previously, over a number of years, ‘almost-met’ many times. We divorced ten years later; we had no children, but great lessons were learned. I’ve always written notes to myself, not knowing why I did so.  Most of what I have written comes from my own life experiences. I’ve jumped out of perfectly good airplanes and gone SCUBA diving in remote locations. I became a private pilot to get past my fear of heights and started my own business because I didn’t fit well in the corporate world. I’ve worked as a photographer, ski instructor, crane operator, welder, wood worker and sculptor.  I've built homes, made furniture, created leaded glass windows ‘a la Frank Lloyd Wright’ to combine form with function, among other things – all in an attempt to satisfy a desire for that “something” missing in my life.  I feel that I have finally found that outlet for my creative energies through writing. I currently split my time between Wisconsin and Florida.  I live in a rural area north of Green Bay, WI with my mighty dog Buddy, shooting photos as the mood and light strikes, and Longboat Key, Florida, where I walk the beach gathering shells and ideas while photographing and being inspired by the changing tides.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Williamson ( Ash Wednesday ) resolves this problem in a believable, elegant manner, grounding his thoroughly enjoyable novel in our \"normal\" world. The story centers around a renovated theater in Pennsylvania and is arranged in three acts, plus overture and curtain call. The tension in Act I heightens as the reader must decide if this is a murder mystery, psychodrama, horror or fantasy, with Williamson offering clues to support each possibility. Theaters have a history of ghosts and accidents, but as the number of deaths at the Venetian mounts, the police become less inclined to accept verdicts of \"accident.\" Owner/actor Dennis Hamilton has nothing obvious to gain from the killings, nor could he have caused them, but his strange behavior makes others wonder if he might not have a double or another personality--or something else entirely--that does want the deaths. Williamson's inventive resolution is sure to satisfy.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We were founded with one goal in mind; bring entrepreneurship to everyone.  The founders have over a decade of combined experience with two of the largest consulting firms in the world.  The founders have various consulting experience including mergers and acquisitions, financial analysis, business process improvement, and information technology.  Additionally, one founder is an award winning business plan writer and successful entrepreneur. Why Upstart Business Consulting Group was Founded Entrepreneurship is the true passion of the founders.  There are a lot of business plan templates and business plan writing services available for purchase.  After reviewing many of these plans, the founders realized they were not only lacking critical information, but they were not tailored to a specific business as they had been advertised.  When one founder said, “There has to be a better way”, Upstart Business Consulting Group was born.  The idea was simple; provide detailed, informative, and targeted business plan kits to upstart entrepreneurs so they can open their business faster and with less upfront capital.  We create business plan kits for the entrepreneur who has $10,000 or less of available startup capital.   There is no Better Time than Now It does not matter if you are a recent college graduate, a worker trying to make ends meet and save for retirement, a burned out mid-level manager trying to climb the corporate ladder, or a retiring baby boomer, there is no better time than now to become an entrepreneur.  The founders of Upstart Business Consulting Group have realized this, and now it is your turn to follow your passion and take your future into your own hands.", "related": [], "rank": 4117359, "title": "Wind Chime Business eBook", "author": "Tim Roncevich", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A brave undertaking that goes against the received wisdom of much academic and middle-brow literary criticism, this volume offers many surprising insights through close, lucid, frequently ingenious, and always astute encounters with Ellis's work. Despite—or perhaps better because of—the broad scope of approaches featured, this volume presents readers with a remarkably coherent critical conversation; no doubt to the chagrin of the author's many detractors, this collection of essays ultimately puts forth a convincing counter-canonical argument by positioning Bret Easton Ellis as one of the major American writers of the last thirty years. As such, Bret Easton Ellis proves to be not only an indispensable, and immensely teachable, resource for anyone interested in Ellis's work but also provocative for the study of contemporary literary culture in general.\" (Marco Abel, Associate Professor of English and Film Studies, University of Nebraska, USA)\"If Ellis's fiction is notoriously said to be about \"surface, surface, surface\", this collection of essays duly traces the terrestrial details and faultlines of his prose, to interpret how he diagnoses, reveals and often anticipates the most acute contemporary anxieties, from psychological consequences of materialism through the injunction between politics and media to current questions of literary authorship. What is more, the volume offers, probably for the first time, an overview of Ellis's later career as a novelist fromAmerican PsychotoLunar Park. A must for any scholar and, indeed, with the editor's introduction, for any student or reader of contemporary American literature.\" (László B. Sári, Lecturer in the Department of Literatures and Cultures in English, University of Pécs, Hungary)This collection of essays on Bret Easton Ellis's \"mature work\" (American Psycho, 1991;Glamorama, 1999,LunarPark, 2005) is long overdue. Part of the literary \"brat pack\" of the 1980s (together with Janowitz and McInerney), Ellis has long stepped outside the genre fiction of his early works, becoming one of the most acknowledged critics of U.S. American lifestyle. The main targets of Ellis's biting critiques - postmodern consumer culture, the \"celebrity discourse,\" and the omnipresence of violence are examined in this anthology in ten persuasive essays. With good reason, the book concentrates on three central novels, which are representative of both thewide range of topicsnegotiated in Ellis's works and the \"brand Ellis\" (that is, the writer's self-construction in his writings). The anthology is equipped with an excellent introduction on the \"value and values of Bret Easton Ellis\" as well as introductory articles to each of the three discussed texts. This anthology is not only a wonderful overview of Ellis's oeuvre. It also offers a number of witty and theoretically challenging accounts of the author's most provocative texts. All in all, this book represents an important look at the work of this still active author, covering a basic void in previous criticismof Ellis. This anthology is an indispensable study book for academic discussions of postmodern American literature. (Stefan L.

I haven't read a ton of\nspace operas, but I have to imagine this story is one of the better\nones.This book is a sequel toVerdant Skies; however, considering this is my\nfirst read of the series, I think it stood on its own perfectly well.\nThere was at no point in the story that I felt like I was missing\nsomething that must have happened in the first book.With so much action and drama there was always something new to hold my\ninterest just as one of the other sub plots would wind to a close. There\n was plenty of romance as well. The passionate moments were way more\nexplicit than I think they needed to be, but they were never vulgar.\nThese scenes definitely grant Verdant Pioneers an R rating; but with\njust a few scenes turned down a bit, this story could easily broaden its\n audience.This story had a multitude of characters and I have to admit I had a\nlittle trouble keeping track of them all as well as how all of them\nintertwined with each other.

I dubbed the dark, imaginative and mysterious side of myself with this name because it speaks of the shadows within that walk the boundaries of this world and the next.       Growing up, I always had a fascination with fantasy and horror. I had a wild imagination and have always been ready to challenge my fears. Amongst my friends I was the one who always was sent in first with the flashlight to explore the strange mysteries of the dark. I became a part of the Gothic subculture at the age of fifteen and felt like I had come home. When I had entered college I explored my spiritual side and realized that Wicca is the religion that most fits me. Needless to say, I am very eccentric and open minded.       Writing is my passion and always has been. I started out mainly writing short stories and poems. I currently write articles for Carpe Nocturne Magazine, a dark culture magazine. Recently I have released my first novel on Kindle, Broken Bonds: The Blood War Chronicles. I'm sure you will not be surprised when I tell you it's a vampire novel.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

ThroughoutCritical Excess, Davis choose interesting texts, not always the most obvious ones, in which to explore the given critics' practice . . . Colin Davis' examination of these radically divergent critical practices has much to teach us, or remind us, about the value of and necessity for over-reading or over-interpretation.\"—Clint Burnham,Electronic Book Review\"Davis's book demonstrates, in exemplary fashion, the extent to which practices of overreading have come to constitute one of the key techniques of the philosophical thinking that has emerged in the wake of the closure or deconstruction of metaphysics . . . Davis has produced a work of highly original and important literary theory that draws on the more modest techniques and scholarly protocols of what he rather self-deprecatingly dubs the 'pedestrian critic'. Yet, in so doing, he has demonstrated the extent to which the techniques of literary criticism and scholarship can make indispensable contributions to contemporaryandphilosophical debate.\"—Ian James,French Studies\"These readings in praise of overreading are detailed, patient, and rewarding. At its core, Davis's overreading is an openness to the uncanny potential for works of art to be familiar and strange, far removed from a hermeneutics of suspicion, feeding and feeding on art's—and criticism's—capacity for surprise. In this excess lies criticism's chance to be interesting.\"—Mark Robson,Modern Language Review\"This is an admirable book. Davis writes beautifully, and his readings are models of clarity and precision. They are also narrowly focused, and this is a strength rather than a weakness. Rather than surveying entire bodies of work, Davis examines just a few texts by each thinker—often texts that are not well known. The result is a study which is wide-ranging but not superficial.\"—Robert Piercey, University of Regina,Philosophy in Review\"This is a book about how certain philosophers read works of literature and film, and whether literature and film become or can be shown to be themselves philosophical in virtue of this reading. But what sort of reading? The figures under study here—Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Emmanuel Levinas, Slavoj Žižek, and Stanley Cavell—approach ('attack' might be a better word) literature and film in ways that we lack concepts to describe, and they do not hesitate to call their ways of reading (not to mention what they read) 'philosophy.' 'Overreading' is Colin Davis's covering term for how these philosophers work on their texts, but no one of them is like any of the others, so their ways of reading are to that extent untheorizable. Instead of large concepts Davis gives us close readings of their readings of particular texts or films—this against the background of lucid and accurate accounts of their particular philosophical or theoretical orientations. This is a fine and timely piece of work, and beautifully written in the bargain.\" —Gerald Bruns, University of Notre Dame", "related": [], "rank": 2215887, "title": "Critical Excess: Overreading in Derrida, Deleuze, Levinas, Žižek and Cavell", "author": "Colin Davis", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With their mother dead and father unjustly imprisoned because he's a Chartist - a group fighting for the rights of the working class - the pair is left to endure a bleak existence as street children. Living in a shack and scrounging the river banks for discarded items they can sell for food assures them certain death either by starvation or disease. But they do have one recourse and in desperation turn to a former friend of their father, Mr Turner. Turner takes Maggie and Tom under his wing, but is then murdered by two of their father's enemies. Now fearing for their lives, the children fall in with a rough gang of delinquents who promise them protection in exchange for criminal cooperation. As their young lives become one bad experience after another, they learn that things are seldom what they seem and that few people are trustworthy.

His analysis shifts to Europe, where he examines how different national policies of integration and multiculturalism in France and England have resulted in dramatically different experiences of terrorism. Kepel offers alternatives to the American war on terror that he believes will help to transcend terror and martyrdom and to ensure the decisive marginalization of jihadist radicalism. His prescriptions are as insightful and thoughtful as his critiques, making this a valuable read for those interested in the Middle East and current affairs generally.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hobbs lives in a small town in Northeast Texas, with her husband, son, and the sweetest cat that has ever graced the Earth. She has always enjoyed reading stories filled with romance, adventure, fantasy, and mystery.  In recent years, however, she has taken these passions to a new height in discovering her own voice through writing fiction.This challenge began for her several years ago when she took a huge step and nervously joined an online group of young writers, who had the same passion she did for exploring other possible plots for their favorite stories. She had almost completed her first lengthy such project and felt she needed to find a place where others could enjoy reading it as well.When that project ended at approximately 110,000 words, she knew she could do more and searched for a way to put her talent and love of writing into motion for a more beneficial means.For her, writing is a way of traveling to places and times that would otherwise be impossible to touch and feel.  She has found the ability to create new characters and form their lives rewarding, and it brings her a feeling of accomplishment.Through writing, she has found that she not only feels better about herself, she also has a great sense of satisfaction knowing that she has created something that someone else can enjoy.For this author, romance is a fundamental component in what she enjoys writing.  Whether it is the Native American captive tale or a historical novel set on the rolling, misty moors in 18th century England, she loves sharing the world she has created with others.T.M. Hobbs has had the good fortune of having several of her short stories and novels published.  She has worked with Books To Go Now and Gypsy Shadow Publishing, to name a few.", "related": ["B00ECYVVQC"], "rank": 517095, "title": "Takoda", "author": "T.M.

Daniel has befriended Brodie Farrell, single mom and owner of the search service, Looking for Something?, and he invites her daughter, Paddy, over to look at the stars and planets to celebrate her fifth birthday. But the telescope shows Daniel more than Jupiter-he witnesses a murder on the pier in front of his house. DI Jack Deacon recognizes a pattern in the crime and immediately identifies a suspect, a serial killer who escaped a murder conviction 10 years earlier. Daniel, on the other hand, is uncertain. Brodie, knowing Daniel won't settle for anything less than the absolute truth and fearing that he'll get himself into trouble, decides to begin her own investigation. Bannister (Changelings, etc.) skillfully moves her characters through an intriguing tale of tragedy and death in a small town, exploring their thoughts and motives. Brodie makes a refreshingly realistic sleuth, Jack an appealing detective, but it is Daniel, with his obsession with truth and honesty, his sensitivity to the human condition and his determination, who stars here.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": 1100777, "title": "True Witness (Brodie Farrell Mysteries Book 2)", "author": "Jo Bannister", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After graduating from the University of the Witwatersrand, he was admitted to the bar as an advocate, but almost immediately crossed into journalism. In the early 1990s he took a planned  short sabbatical  into investment banking. He stayed in that business longer than he intended, working on five continents, mainly in mining and resources, in the areas of investment analysis and corporate finance. This sojourn took him from the hallowed halls of London money managers to the Australian outback, and from the electrifying world of Wall Street to the very furthest and deepest reaches of the Amazon. Sergeant became a recognised specialist in West African resources, partially triggering his first encounter with Brett Kebble, in 1996. When the biggest bubble in stock market history burst on Wall Street in March 2000, Sergeant returned to journalism. Sergeant was awarded his first major national South African journalism prize in 1988. During his time in investment banking, he was a  rated  investment analyst in both Johannesburg and London. His journalism has more recently been recognised on a number of occasions, not least as the unanimous-choice winner of The Valley Trust Award for Courageous Journalism, in 2004. In February 2006, he was named a Paul Harris Fellow by Rotary International for  tangible and significant assistance given for the furtherance of better understanding and friendly relations among peoples of the world.", "related": [], "rank": 749971, "title": "Brett Kebble", "author": "Barry Sergeant", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Families zip through, stop at the occasional pull-out for a photo-op, then continue along their way. While most parks cater to motorists, one cannot experience their essence from the comfort of your driver's seat. You must walk among the trees and the mountains. Listen to wildlife all around you. Sit back, close your eyes and immerse yourself in nature. America's 58 national parks are irreplaceable treasures, yet they are our parks, preserved for our enjoyment, and if you want to experience them to their fullest you're going to need a good guide.That's where I come in. I admit my first trip to a national park was your typical affair. A group of friends drove to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. We peered in, snapped a few photos, shrugged and returned to our rental car. Did we know that adventurous hikers were resting their tired legs at Phantom Ranch nearly 5,000 feet below at the canyon's floor? No. Did we know how to reach the North Rim? Probably not. The point is, we didn't know much about the Grand Canyon.I've come a long way since those first steps atop the South Rim. While researching this book I spent two full years exploring and photographing the parks, living almost exclusively in my tent. As I passed from park-to-park I learned that this was much more than an assignment; it became an awakening. It was a communion with life and land as I learned to immerse myself in nature. (I also learned how to get to the North Rim, and even hiked down to Phantom Ranch to prove to myself that people were making regular trips to the canyon floor.) I've exhaustively researched every site in this book, integrating those findings with my unique perspective and with the opinions of hundreds of park patrons and National Park Service employees.These are the footsteps you should follow, and downloading this book is the first step to an unforgettable adventure.", "related": ["B007RSLNOU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The Calgary author, who raised her family in a small Alberta town, is the mother of a son with schizophrenia who spent years coming to terms with the disorder and liberating herself from its stigma. Covering a period of 28 years, the author tells of her journey with her son as a child and as an adult. The book reads like a journal, and covers her family history chronologically. At the start of her journey, Weatherly was a public school teacher raising three children together with her husband in small town Alberta. She had expectations of an ordinary life for her and her family. As time unfolds, Weatherly's idyllic life is turned upside down, as her son, Edward, battles both schizophrenia and substance abuse. A gifted musician and artist, Edward first attempted to manage the debilitating symptoms with street drugs. His strange behavious became apparent to Weatherly and her family, who sought professional help. But like many people with mental illness, he initially struggled to accept the diagnosis of schizophrenia and became non-compliant with his prescription medication. Despite the family's efforts, they couldn't convince him to take prescription medication, not the street drugs, and Edward ultimately became homeless, which isn't unusual for those with untreated mental illnesses. The impact of Edward's disorder was not only painful for him, but also for his mother. As a caring, loving and devoted mom, Bea tells of her tribulations in this beautifully written work. What is so remarkable about Bea is her strength in withstanding the ordeals of her son's illness. Though the book isn't written for public commendation, she deserves the admiration of the reader in learning to live gracefully and patiently with her son's disorder and fully accepting his mental condition. After decades-long roller coaster ride, Edward has recovered from the torments of schizophrenia with the love and support of his family. Today, he is pursuing a happy and healthy life and has seized control of his own destiny. However, like so many, he is still challenged by his incurable and treatable medical condition, but manages it well. For families coming to terms with a loved one's schizophrenia, A Gift of Grace offers hope. For those who haven't been touched by this often-mystifying disorder, the book gently explains one of the most stigmatized mental illnesses. This compelling and compassionate read is also an optimism-booster for those who're recovering from mental illness and/or addictions. By Jamal Ali, a writer and mental health advocate residing in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. His articles have been published in Schizophrenia Digest, Alexandra Musings, The Calgary Herald and other publications. --The Post: A Publication of the Parkland Institude; Volume XIV, #2, Spring/Summer 2009Title: Courage to Reveal Secrets so Deep Most Hide in Shame When Bea Weatherly was born and grew up in \"the little house in the coulee\" in small Alberta, she expected her life would be much like her parents. Finish high school, fall in love, get married, raise children in a loving happy home - most of all that her children would turn out like her and her five siblings. Normal! So dreams don't always turn out exactly how we picture them. Perhaps not even a dream, just an expectation of an ordinary life was what Bea thought was her road ahead. Her Dad always told her to dream big and \"Bea, you should write a book\". She had no idea what to write about in such an ordinary life.  She became a teacher like her mother and her older sister. That was an unspoken expectation too. Because Mom and Big Shari-Lee, as her younger sisters called her, both were teachers, she and her younger sister believed it was expected they become teachers too and they did. Her three brothers all worked in oil and gas technology just as their father did. Bea married and had three children, just as expected. When exactly her life went off track, she is not really certain. It just came upon her gradually until wham! Some life-changing events derailed the anticipated path and created secrets most of us would regard as shameful. Yet when called courageous, this author, businesswoman, speaker and mother of three, doesn't really see it that way. \"Secrets kill, truth liberates\", she says, \"When you share your burdens, everyone is empowered.\" It is not that this was part of her upbringing either. The family she came from was loving and happy, but proud. Maybe proud is not the right word according to Bea. Yet, it was sort of protective pride. Circles the wagons pride. They were close-mouthed, private people. What happened at home stayed at home. What a different route Bea has found! One that is open, public and proud - rightfully so - proud for the obstacles she and her children have overcome and what they all realize should be shared so others can learn from their journey. That is why Bea Weatherly is proud to write A Gift of Grace: A Mother's Journey Through Her Son's Schizophrenia. She tells this secret openly now. Not surprising that other people who rarely spoke of their family's experience with schizophrenia suddenly tell Bea, \"Yes, I know what it is like, my son... my brother... my mother... or... has schizophrenia too.\" And in sharing there is a sense of relief. A sense of not being alone. Sense that would not be there had Bea not shared her story with them. How her life went from mundane to what she calls \"bizarre\" cannot be told in a single breath. It started with baby steps, until she realized what her father must have known the future held in store for her. She felt she had a story to tell. She signed up for a writers' retreat.  She was the best mom she could be. She modeled respect, love and generosity. She sees that in her children. Even though her son tripped and fell, felt he was broken, he was able to pull himself up and carry on. He started learning all over again that he is worthy of love, to forgive himself, to love himself... Bea taught her children that no matter how many stumbles, they can still stand up and be proud. Proud and open. Proud and healing. Proud in teaching the rest of the world the valuable lessons they have learned. Incredibly proud of their mother for standing tall and saying, \"Hello my name is Bea Weatherly. I am a mother, teacher, author. I am here to help you stand proud, no matter what.\" Article written by Xenia Stanford (President, KnowMap), currently the president and chief executive officer of Stanford Solutions Inc., devoted to empowering others to manage knowledge by using practical tools. --Canadian Entrepreneurial News: Equipping the Uncommon Entrepreneur; spring/summer 2008I listen to Bea Weatherly speak at a conference in Red Deer in March 2008. Bea's message was heartfelt, knowledgeable, and inspirational. She spoke about courage, her courage in the face of much adversity. Bea's presentation was touching and at the same time humorous. I laughed; I cried; I empathized. Bea is articulate; her speech was organized and logical, easy to follow, yet held incredible depth. There is no mistaking, she is one courageous woman! Now she is sharing her message in a larger way through her book and to a great audience.

Barton is the author of several fast-paced mystery and thriller series, featuring lively characters and lots of action. \"Miz Scarlet\" (Scarlet Wilson Mystery series) is a teacher-turned-innkeeper, who throws herself into danger with a feisty determination to make things right, relying on cohorts like \"Captain Peacock\" and \"Colonel Grey Poupon\" to help her solve the clues. Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans.

He termed himself a \"Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ\" in True Christian Religion, one of the works he published himself. He is best known for his book on the afterlife, Heaven and Hell. Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. In 1741, at the age of 53, he entered into a spiritual phase in which he eventually began to experience dreams and visions beginning on Easter weekend April 6, 1744. This culminated in a spiritual awakening, whereupon he claimed he was appointed by the Lord to write a heavenly doctrine to reform Christianity. He claimed that the Lord had opened his spiritual eyes, so that from then on he could freely visit heaven and hell, and talk with angels, demons and other spirits. He said that the Last Judgement had already occurred, in 1757, although only visible in the spiritual world, where he had witnessed it. That Judgement was followed by the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, which occurred, not by Christ in person, but by a revelation from Him through the inner, spiritual sense of the Word to Swedenborg. In fact, Swedenborg said, it is the presence of that spiritual sense that makes the Word Divine.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He wrote some 50 volumes of novels, poetry, short stories, fantasy, sermons, and essays. His influential body of work placed him alongside his eras great men of letters and his following was vast. Two decades after his death, his books were pivotal in leading C.S. Lewis to Christianity. He thus became the foundational member of Wheaton's Wade Center Seven.    After his death, most of MacDonald's books eventually went out of print as his name drifted from memory. However, he continued to be revered by an impressive gallery of well-known figures, including G.K. Chesterton (who referred to him as one of the three or four greatest men of the 19th century ), W.H. Auden (calling MacDonald one of the most remarkable writers of the 19th century), and Oswald Chambers ( ... how I love that man! ). In spite of such a following, however, MacDonald's reputation gradually declined throughout the 20th century.   MacDonald's most notable champion of the last century was C.S. Lewis, whose journey from atheism to Christianity was sparked by George MacDonald's prophetic view of God. Lewis persistently acknowledged his debt to MacDonald, whom he called his master. Lewis wrote: \"I dare not say that he is never in error; but ... I know hardly any other writer who seems to be closer ... to the Spirit of Christ Himself.... I have never concealed the fact that I regarded him as my master, indeed I fancy I have never written a book in which I did not quote from him.\" Both in his autobiography and throughout his writing career, Lewis emphasized that George MacDonald was the most significant impetus in his own spiritual pilgrimage.   MacDonald's writings can thus be seen as the spiritual soil out of which the faith of C.S. Lewis emerged. MacDonald's novels, fantasies, and fairy tales provide the imaginative foundation for Lewis's later writings, including the Chronicles of Narnia.   In spite of his own popularity, however, the spiritual roots of Lewis' s faith remain largely unknown. Lewis's words of 65 years ago are still true today. It has not seemed to me that those who have received my books kindly take ... sufficient notice of the affiliation [with George MacDonald]. Notwithstanding Lewis' s frequent emphasis on the Scotsman's influence in his own life, MacDonald's name in the late 20th century drifted into obscurity and his books became unavailable.   A resurgence of interest in the forgotten Victorian began to mount in the 1970s and 1980s, given initial impetus by Wheaton's Wade Center and the work of two Wheaton professors, Dr. Clyde Kilby, founder of the Center, and Dr. Rolland Hein, who released several editions of MacDonald's sermon extracts. MacDonald's name then exploded into public view in the years following, largely from the efforts of MacDonald redactor and biographer Michael Phillips. Building upon the efforts of Kilby, Hein, and others, and inspired by them, Phillips's work resulted in a new generation of readers discovering anew the treasures in MacDonald's stories, and led to a renewed publication of MacDonald's books on an unprecedented scale not seen since his own lifetime.   Now more than ever, thousands the world over are discovering why Madeleine L. Engle called George MacDonald the grandfather of all of us who struggle to come to terms with truth through imagination.", "related": ["B00GLSFJTW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Even as the Mining Syndicate has created orphans and mutants, so its actions have succeeded in forging unexpected connections between residents willing to do anything for freedom - or die in the process. Tools of telepathy, stretching and warping time itself, and more would seem to give the colonists an edge in the battle; but the Mining Syndicate's resources are vast and unending, and Chronos would be doomed without the creative rebellious thinking of its many characters willing to die for permanent freedom. What makes THE BATTLE FOR CHRONOS so exciting is its different layering of military might and strategies that embrace old and new technology and old and new ideas about warfare and battle. Descriptions of these tactics are specific and will prove tantalizing and satisfying to followers of military science fiction who enjoy specific details:  This riveting conclusion to the fine series is simply not to be missed by any who have followed the prior Chronos plots and who want a fine conclusion to an epic saga!", "related": ["B00LDCER4E"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I played with it. As children learning the English alphabet, we play with it as well. Our teachers and parents expose us to the individual letters and letter names. They give us concrete words in our spoken vocabulary that start with each letter's sound, and we see the letters everywhere in our environment. Mastering those letter shapes, names and sounds helps us when we start to pull them together into written words. When we are learning a foreign language with a strange alphabet, we usually don't have that luxury of time and play, but we still need to master the alphabet letters and sounds to more fluidly pull them into words read off the page.Storybook Hebrewis a memory aid to speed up that process of accurate and fluent letter recall.   The book The\nDyslexic Advantage discusses the power of stories to aid memory. The authors cited memory research conducted by former Google CIO Douglas Merrill while earning\na Ph.D. in cognitive science at Princeton.  His research showed that even those who\nmemorize well by rote find memory work easier if they form stories with the\ninformation.  The science of memory explored in Moonwalking with Einstein explains to me why creating stories helped me memorize the Hebrew alphabet so quickly.\nAuthor Joshua Foer wrote that the brains of mental athletes who diligently\ntrain their memories are really no different than anyone's brain.

(kinda long story there, but yes, seriously) and many other foster children that her parents took in over the years and whose names she couldn't even begin to remember at this point in life, never mind list, as there were more than 600 of them. She also grew up amongst many, many cousins and close friends. From a young age, she knew that she was destined for bigger things - as she regularly got her ass kicked and was a firm believer in karma. Her ass kickers (before they morphed into ass kickees) were both the foster kids that lived at her house and the Townie children who referred to the foster kids as her parents' \"rent-a-kids.\" Outside of that, life was grand.The author is known as 'Mary Catherine' only by those who knew her back then. She used to despise the name, but has grown to miss it. And as this book is about memories (real and imagined), she felt it fitting to use that name here. She kind of likes it now. As a pen name only.These days, she lives just outside of San Francisco with her ex-Merchant Marine Captain husband, Tim, her fantastic beyond imagination son, Tadhg, and numerous pets. And she writes \"to make you see\" - but you can learn more aboutthaton her website.", "related": ["B009ISH4OK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He didn t just meet Olympic and World Champions, he studied them, competed with them and became one himself. This book breaks down the twelve elements that separates the elite competitor from the average one. Whether you re an athlete, business professional, salesperson, coach, or educator, this book can empower you. The best of the best in sport, business, education, and life, all have one thing in common. They all think differently from the average person. They follow a different set of guidelines and these guidelines, or elements as Troy refers to them, are what gives them an advantage over their competition. What separates the elite performers from the next tier of competitors isn t planning, and in most cases it isn t the amount of effort or energy that is given. It s not the ability to perform, nor the quality of equipment available. You need all the above, along with experience in order to win. But to reach the elite level it takes something else, something that can only come from within. Troy does an excellent job of cutting out the fluff and getting to the real heart of what makes the elite different and what you can do to join them. --Publisher's Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Endless miles of twisting passageways and perilous chambers stand between them and the exit, and with Albert's box of clues finally exhausted, they will have to navigate the dark corridors all but blind.

Though he is hours behind Albert, Brandy and Nicole, he must somehow catch up and warn them that all may not be as it seems. With Olivia at his side and their new friend, Andrea, along for the trip, he sets out once more on the long, hard journey back to the City of the Blind, hoping he can find them before it is too late. As the morning approaches, decisions will have to be made. Someone is lying to them. Is it the mysterious old man who aided Wayne in his search for Olivia? Or is it the motherly Sentinel Queen? Together, the six of them must decide who to trust.

The weddings came off without a hitch! Janice has since coordinated weddings for friends and is thrilled to incorporate many of her adventures into her stories.

The narrative is classic Woodward: using his inside access to the major players, he offers a nearly day-by-day account of the decision-making processes and power battles behind the headlines. Woodward's information is based on tape-recorded interviews of over a hundred sources (some unnamed), including four hours of exclusive interviews with the president, along with notes from cabinet meetings and access to some classified reports.Woodward's analysis of President Bush's leadership style is especially fascinating. A self-described \"gut player\" who relies heavily on instinct, Bush comes across as a man of action continually pressing his cabinet for concrete results. The revelation that the president developed and publicly stated the so-called Bush Doctrine--the policy that the U.S. would not only go after terrorists everywhere but also those governments or groups which harbor them--without first consulting Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Colin Powell, or Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is particularly telling. Other principals are examined with equal scrutiny. Though National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice emerges as soft-spoken and even tentative during group meetings, it becomes clear that Bush is dependent on her for candid advice as well as for conveying his thoughts to his cabinet. The relationship between Powell and Rumsfeld (and to a lesser degree Powell and Cheney) is often strained, exposing their differences regarding how to deal with Iraq and whether coalition building or unilateralism is most appropriate. Woodward also describes how CIA director George Tenet prepared a paramilitary team to infiltrate Afghanistan to set the groundwork for invasion, and how this ushered in a new era of cooperation between the defense department and the CIA. A worthwhile and often enlightening read, this is a revealing and informative first draft of the Bush legacy.--Shawn Carkonen", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Maybe someday I'll write the rest. Q: Where does the title come from?A: While I was writing the essays for the book, I read a new story about Jack Kerouac. It brought back memories of reading \"On the Road\", and the word \"Paradise\" came to me from his character, Sal Paradise. I don't want to give the meaning of the title away, but as I wrote the Mexican portion of the story, the integration of the word \"Paradise\" into my title just became a natural thing.", "related": [], "rank": 4259743, "title": "Two Dollar Paradise", "author": "Richard Champagne", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His works are widely translated. Son of a doctor, Capek studied philosophy in Paris, Berlin, and Prague. Becoming a journalist,  Karel was firmly entrenched between mutual hatreds for the Nazis and the Communists; promoting a free and democratic Czechoslovakia and supporting those political figures of like mind. Capek's first major success came as a playwright when he created the robot in his 1921 play R. U. R., (Rossum Universal Robots); intended as a satire against the Czech agrarian feudal system.  Karel authored other less successful works but outstanding above them was the utopian type fantasy novel, War with the Newts, another political statement. When the Nazi overtook Europe, Capek was forced to surrender his dreams along with his spirit and, thereby, his life, when Czechoslovakia was abandoned by the Western nations in the pact made at Munich.  He saw his world and time as lost, yet Capek would not leave the country or his beautiful Prague, fully realizing that the decision to stay meant his death.   But rather than death coming at the hands of his enemies, it came from pneumonia...in his home, in his bed, with his wife nearby. Others would not be so lucky.", "related": [], "rank": 1243943, "title": "Rossum Universal Robots eBook", "author": "Karel Capek", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Does the Xeroxed love letter Bingo inadvertently sent her still rankle?), penning his efforts in a missive intended one day to spare his kid brother some of love's agonies. Recorded with brutal honesty, Bingo's near misses comprise an engaging narrative that is, in typical Bingo fashion, poignant and hilarious by turns. His relations with his family members, especially his brother and his father (who is suffering his own disappointments) are tender in their own right.

I finally got an appointment\nwith that bakery everybody has been raving about. And I think I have\nnarrowed down my choices of bridesmaid dresses to three.\"\"Did you make that phone call?\" he asked looking at me, raising an eyebrow.\"Here we fucking go again!\" I thought.\"Nah... I didn't get a chance.\"Adrian was immediately pissed.\"So you didn't even try and call your cousin? I thought we agreed on that last night Pebbles\" he grumbled.\"Bae I have been busy all day long, I had to run errands, do laundry,\n clean up, and the dinner didn't just cook itself you know\" I was fuming\n inside but I tried my best not to show it.He sat stone faced as he listened to my excuse.\"You know what? You are full of excuses. Every time we get on the\nsubject of your family it's gotta be a big damn deal. How would you feel\n if you never met any of my people Pebbles? Shit I was damn near ready\nto show you off the day I met you. But naw a brotha like me ain't even\ngood enough to meet the little family you do have.\"With that he got up from the table and headed for the den with me close on his heels.\"Baby let me explain...I.\"Before I could finish he cut me off. \"Just drop it!\"Adrian didn't make a point of raising his voice at me but his anger\nhad now turned to resentment.  I was perfect in every other way but this\n was the one thing that was hanging over our heads causing drama in our\nrelationship. Adrian was hurt and angry. He was crazy about me and would\n do anything in the world for me but this was one area when he put his\nfoot down and he wasn't budging. He told me that sometimes he would ask\nhimself why it was so important to meet my family since I said I didn't\nreally deal with them. Why couldn't he just accept that and move on?Part of the reason was despite the fact that he loved and trusted me\nhe said that his gut told him that I was hiding something in that area.\nNo matter how much he tried to shake the feeling he always felt like\nsomething wasn't quite right with that whole situation. Another reason\nwas he didn't want any surprises AFTER we got married. He didn't have\nany intentions on backing out of the wedding but the way I seemed so\nhell bent on keeping everything about them a secret was starting to make\n him second guess his decision. Hell we might have to put everything on\nhold till we get to the bottom of this.I could see that Adrian was hurt and disappointed. He had never\nraised his voice at me in the whole two years we were together. It was\nobvious that I couldn't keep feeding him the same lies about not having\ntime to contact anyone. Not only was he stubborn and not bending in this\n situation it seemed like he was beginning to get more suspicious as the\n days passed. There was no way that I was about to lose my fiance over\nthis bullshit right here. This called for drastic measures.After letting Adrian cool down for about an hour I went back in the den.\"Baby we need to talk\" I agonized.Adrian looked at me with knitted brows and maintained his cold disposition.\"About what?\" he grunted.\"About us\"I could tell that he wanted very much to carry out his grudge for the\n rest of the evening and possibly the next day also but upon closer\ninspection he could tell that I was choked up and it piqued his\nattention.\"What's on your mind?\" he asked softening his tone.\"I wanna talk about my family..... I don't know how to tell you this so\n I'm just gonna come right out and say it. My parents aren't really\ndead.\"Adrian's mouth fell open; he paused his game, sat up straight and looked at me.\"You damn sure got my attention.

The title for this volume is \"Establishing God's standards.\" This book was born in March 2004, about the time of my graduation from University of Ibadan, Nigeria. I started writing the first volume in April 24th, 2012. I finished the paper work 1 in July 31st, 2012.\n    The book is divided into five (5) series. The series and their respective characters are:\n     1. Establishing God's Standards: Abraham,Jacob,Judah,Joseph,Joshua and  Gideon;\n     2. God's Family in Pilgrimage: Moses and Elijah;\n     3. God's People in Government: David, Joab, Hezekiah and Daniel;\n     4. The Church Administration: Peter and Paul; and\n     5. The Prince of Life: Jesus.\nThe other four volumes are expected to be completed in 2015.\n    This book is a Bible narrative expected to answer many of the bewildered problems in the sub-Saharan and the globe. Nigeria is God's chosen country to herald the second appearing of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ.If God's kingdom of justice is established in Nigeria, then the Lord's Trumpet would herald His coming without hindrance.\n    Please note that your review, purchase and outright promotion of this volume would go a long way in fulfilling this vision. God bless you as we serve the lord Christ with pure conscience together in His vineyard.

The author provides a complete list of the Indus signs in\nrelation to their respective Brahmi relatives. A symbiotic relation\nbetween the various ancient cultures is discussed in the book. The whole\n work seems to be based upon sound logic and it draws its strength from\nthe complete rejection of any assumption in the process.

The story is a long one about 1240 Kindle pages and with a story that long I better be invested in it fairly early on or I find I struggle to read it. While this one wasn't necessarily a huge struggle I did have some trouble staying completely engaged, so it took me longer than it usually does to read a story of this size.Unfortunately I never found myself connecting with any of the characters, there were too many characters and couples being introduced too close together and that almost lost me. Trying to follow everyone's storyline got a bit confusing but that does iron itself out somewhat, in my opinion a few less prominent characters would have been a good thing. This book will not be for everyone, first it's a historical with both M/M and M/F relationships with on page sex and second there are a lot of battle scenes, both were fairly graphic. As far as romance goes I think because I didn't connect to anyone I didn't feel any romance between any of the couples.This is the author's first work and I thought for a first it was well done and had great potential. The story idea was a good one, I just felt it was in need of a little tightening up. There were some typos, grammar mistakes and confusing sentences but unless that takes me out of a story I over look it. I'm horrible at grammar and I make a lot of mistakes so I never judge on that alone. I'll be interested to see what else this author brings us, I sincerely hope she continues writing.", "related": ["B00KFKXV10"], "rank": 2794279, "title": "WORRLGENHALL", "author": "Monica Luke", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She began her career at the age of sixteen. Her interest in codependency is based in her own experiences. Having had to live through a childhood filled with addiction, abuse, ongoing shame as a way of control and more, she knows what readers are dealing with.   “I had the very real need to share what I have learned along the way about this dibilitating problem. I present codependency in a whole new light and  believe that anyone who commits to what is laid out in this book will see positive changes in their lives.”      Born in Munich, Germany, she was raised in  Ohio. At the age of twenty-two she bought a one-way train ticket to California to escape a violent relationship. She spent the next 28 years there and had an successful advertising career for over twenty years. Yet inside she was still battling the demons of codependency.    In 2007 she received her Bachelor’s Degree (Cum Laude) from Indiana Wesleyan University with a focus on communications.       She and her husband, John moved to Las Vegas in 2012 to be nearer to their grown children in California.         “It’s amazing how many people still don’t understand codependency, even when it is consuming them and those they love. The need to fix others is always easier than accepting we are codependent and need help.”       \"You’re Not Crazy-You’re Codependent\" is Jeanette Menter’s first book. \"Like addiction, once a codependent, always a codependent. The difference is now I control it...it doesn't control me.\" She is currently working on a new version of this book geared solely to helping military families.", "related": ["B00BE23EGK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dee II Professor of Organizational Behavior, Graduate School of Business, Stanford University\"The timing of this book could not be better as the world of business education is facing the greatest challenges and opportunities in its history. More than ever, business schools have to deal with new players, new models of competition, new technology, a new generation of teachers and participants, a new global environment etc. The book is full of ideas and insights that I expect will contribute fundamentally to the rethinking of our current business models. It is without question the most important and useful book on what business education will look like tomorrow.\" - Dominique Turpin, President and Nestlé Professor, IMD\"As highly experienced business school educators, the authors are uniquely qualified to offer a credible new framework for evaluating educational practices. Their observations regarding research and curricula relevance, faculty appointments and workloads, current funding sources, globalization of business education, and the impact of technological advancements are insightful and intriguing. This book is a worthy read for anyone who is interested in how we educate the next generation of business leaders.\" - Thomas S. Robertson, Dean and Reliance Professor of Management and Private Enterprise, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania\"In today's global and complex world, governments and companies need quality leadership to understand the challenges that we face, set a sense of direction, inspire others through example and execute action plans. Business schools were born as institutions to provide a learning context to develop leaders with clear thinking and values-based character to make things happen. This new book provides useful suggestions on how business schools can better contribute to business and society through leadership development.\" - Jordi Canals, Dean, IESE Business School\"This book makes a huge contribution to executive education, mainly due to its having an icon in this field among its authors, Peter Lorange. It will help business schools to review their mission and their role vis-...-vis society.\" - Emerson Almeida, President, Fundacao Dom Cabral, Brazil\"Lorange, Sheth and Thomas have written an insightful and thought-provoking analysis of the past, present and future of business schools, outlining the choices schools will face and strategic decisions they must make to thrive in the 21st Century.\" - Kai Peters, CEO, Ashridge Management College, UK\"At a time when, faced with globalization and digital development, everyone agrees in saying that business schools will have to redefine themselves to survive, Howard Thomas, Peter Lorange and Jagdish Sheth actually propose some clear, concrete directions. This book should greatly interest both people who are skeptical about business schools and those who unconditionally support them.\" - Bernard Ramanantsoa, Dean, HEC, Paris\"The performance of American business schools is coming under increasing scrutiny and skepticism, fueled in no small part by the unethical behavior of some their high-profile graduates. The schools themselves are being characterized as academic cash cows whose faculties suffer from physics envy. At the same time, the demand for business degrees has soared as the skyrocketing costs of a higher education drive parents to tell their offspring to use their undergraduate years as the means to a good job (as opposed to a good education). Meanwhile graduate school professors are teaching less while delivering their product for free on-line. Things simply can't go on like this. As the authors of this remarkable compendium of knowledge about management education conclude, the enterprise is now at a tipping (if not tripping) point. Their unprecedented, comprehensive, global perspective on the challenges facing business schools is scholarly, even-handed, and admirably practical.\" - James O'Toole, Daniels Distinguished Professor of Business Ethics, University of Denver", "related": [], "rank": 2155140, "title": "The Business School in the Twenty-First Century eBook", "author": "Howard Thomas", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This is a splendid, at times deadpan, yet very compelling memoir. It is bound to intrigue and inform anyone interested in the shaping of New Zealand foreign policy in the later years of the 20th century.\"  —Bruce Harding, thePress, onFinal Approaches\"[Hensley’s] account of events in 1984–1985 is an important contribution to the understanding of what was perhaps this country's most serious foreign policy crisis and certainly its longest (as is his recollection of the Rainbow Warrior bombing and its aftermath).\"  —John Armstrong,NZ Herald, onFinal Approaches\"It is aptly called a memoir and will be recognized as a classical example of the genre. It is wry, reflective, not once giving the sense of having scores to settle, amusing, offering insights into the prime ministers for whom he worked, done with an eye for the absurd, and filled with anecdotes that are told economically.\"  —Stuart McMillan, NBR, onFinal Approaches\"Hensley, a superb writer, is wise enough to know that such a volume needs to be m ore than an academic and chronological account. So, he illustrates it with a vivid array of anecdotes and incidents—some of which are news revelations in themselves.\"  —Richard Long,Dominion Post, onFinal Approaches\"I would strongly recommend it be found on the bookshelves of those who pursue an understanding of New Zealand’s modern history. Mr. Hensley has written a superior book on his life as a career diplomat and civil servant. But this is no boring tome. Rather, it is an account of an interesting tapestry of life by an extraordinary man.\"  —Col (Ret’d) Raymond J Seymour,Army News, onFinal Approaches\"These reflections in tranquility on a fascinating life well spent make marvelous reading.

Allen brings the analytical skills of a philosopher, the voice of a gifted memorialist, and the spirit of a soulful humanist to the task at hand, and manages to do something quite rare, find new meaning in Jefferson’s understanding of equality.” (Joseph J. Ellis, author of Revolutionary Summer: The Birth of American Independence)“This wise and rich book is what we need in these troubled times—a robust and persuasive defense of equality and liberty grounded in our national scripture. Danielle Allen is a towering political philosopher of the democratic art of being and a force for good!” (Cornel West, author of Democracy Matters: Winning the War on Imperialism)“Danielle Allen celebrates the Declaration of Independence by reading it closely—line by line, comma by comma—and invites her fellow citizens to do the same. The result is a richly rewarding book that demonstrates the pleasures of slow reading, the power of words to shape events, and the importance of equality to democratic life.” (Michael Sandel, author of What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets)“Danielle Allen's poignant and personal reflection on the Declaration of Independence is a rare and singular work…[S]he has written a book that throws open a door to a large circle of readers: anyone with a stake in democracy. Her observations about the importance of language in building and sustaining a republic are especially resonant and worthy of the towering rhetoric of the Declaration. Our Declaration holds the promise of both discovery and rediscovery whether you've never read the Declaration or have memorized each of its 1,337 words.” (Ann Marie Lipinski, curator, Nieman Foundation for Journalism, Harvard University)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He hitchhiked across the U.S. several times--the last time with his wife and baby. They lived in a nudist camp for 2 1/2 years. Their four youngest children were born at home, underwater, and Dale was the midwife for the birth of their youngest. He's the author of \"All About Tarantulas\" (TFH Pub., 1977). The son of a Methodist minister who instilled in him a religious sense, Dale is now Roman Catholic. He has recently finished reading in order every Pulitzer Prize winning fiction book from the year of his birth to the present.

Antonio currently lives in New Hampshire with his wife and two dogs. His fascination with Disney World started in the mid 1980's when he visited for the first time.

Originally, the blog focused on Disney World news, travel tips, photography, and Disney satire. In 2013 the focus of the blog changed to travel. His first book, Twisted Disney: Satire and Shenanigans was released in early 2012. A second book, CMDTA's Pictorial Guide to Disney World was planned for later that year. During the writing of the Pictorial Guide, A. Antonio came up with an idea for a novel that took place in Disney World. He put the Guide on hold and started writing World Killer. Two weeks later, the first draft was completed. A second draft was published in late 2013. A final draft was published in March of 2014. While Twisted Disney, the Pictorial Guide, and World Killer were being edited, A. Antonio wrote and completed the first drafts of Around the World and Imagineered Death. The two books complete the DW Mysteries Trilogy. A second trilogy has been planned to follow up the DW Mysteries as well as Special Editions of World Killer, Around the World, and Imagineered Death. The special editions will include pictures of the places in the book, detailed notes, and links to videos related to the books. A.

The former wife of a celebrity attorney gave it her best shot proving she was not a prima donna by completing the first nine of the eighteen miles, he intended for them to ride.  Dirt covered her body, her hair was a mess tangled with grass and twigs, and the odor seeping from her was not of an expensive perfume.All that combined, he admired the way she looked sitting under the tree.  Her physical activities consisted of going to a gym, but the fact Regan agreed to go biking with him showed true grit.He finished her bike and grabbed a bottle of water from the saddlebag on his bike.  Sitting next to her under the tree, he pulled his knees to his chest and nudged her with his shoulder.  \"The bike is finished.  When you're done resting, we can continue.\"\"Okay,\" she replied laying her phone on the grass.\"Why the long face?  Did you get some bad news?\"\"Nothing I'm not used to.\"  She poured water on her hands rinsing off some of the dirt.Orlando didn't understand what caused the changed in her attitude.  She went from bubbly to flat an unemotional in the fifteen minutes it took to repair the flat tire.  \"Regan, what's going on?\"She hemmed and hawed, \"Oh, just another rejection letter from a job I applied for.\"\"Sorry, chica.  What did you apply for?\"\"I applied for a position as an anchorwoman at a public broadcasting network.  I can't even get a job at a station that has fifty loyal viewers at best.\"\"I see.  I didn't know you were a television journalist,\" he said drinking his water.She sighed.  \"I'm not.  I have a degree in journalism but no experience in television, newspaper print or anything.  Let this be a lesson, Orlando; never put your career on hold for another person.  My ex-husband is living his dream and I can't even get my foot in the door.

So I was grateful for his internal thoughts.Her back story was more built up and you instantly loved Charisma...I mean with a name like that, it is sort of hard not to. And her relationship with her friend was endearing. There was great character development and her metaphor placement was perfect, but this is more a personal note, since I've known the author since the beginning of her writing and I can tell you she has blossomed quite a lot.There is a Hitchcock-esq part to it that made me grin because it is pure Jenna. I loved that you had no idea where those damn birds came from.At the end I was left with: How did I not see that? Wha-what?
