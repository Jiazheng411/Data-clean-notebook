Surgery finally restored his vision, and a new look at the  world prompted the writer to turn toward autobiography. Lucid, frank, and funny,  his recollections range from an affluent WASP childhood in New York City and its  suburbs to joining the circus in 1951 at age 18, then marrying and divorcing  twice as he roamed the world and discovered his vocation. Hoagland began his  writing career as a novelist, and his early fiction was fairly well received, so  that readers can only be grateful that he concluded, after a few books, that he  was better suited to the \"familiar, unassuming\" tone of the personal essay. That  intimate tone binds the rambling text together, as he pauses in his personal  chronicle to muse on the nature of friendship (we need both the fair- and  foul-weather kinds, he concludes), the burdens and benefits of aging, or some other  more general topic. There's literary gossip, too--after all,Archibald  MacLeishandAlfred Kazinwere  his teachers,John  Berrymanwas a friend, andNorman  Podhoretzwas his second wife's boss atCommentary. But the focus  rightly remains on Hoagland's life experiences and thoughts, in this deceptively  casual but artfully organized narrative.--Wendy Smith", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The boy is immune to this magic, being allergic to cats and loyal to his dog, Billy. Ahlberg piles on some wonderful detail as the moony and distracted parents cater to the cat's exotic tastes and the animal gets bigger and bigger. On seeing the creature, David's friend George utters an astonished \"Christ!\" When David returns from a school camping trip, he finds the cat has morphed into a chair-sitting animal drinking wine from a glass, his father is drunk, and the household is a darkened dump. The boy takes action but neither poisoning, trickery, nor hand-to-paw combat work to defeat the devilishly powerful cat. It takes Billy and all of his canine friends to drive the feline from the house. This story reads like an extended folktale, with vocabulary that will challenge younger readers both with British expressions and by Ahlberg's literate narrator. With its small format and Bailey's appealing black-line drawings, this book is likely to appeal to readers younger than the appropriate audience. But for those sophisticated children who love a scary story, this grounds the supernatural scariness in a very literal, frighteningly realistic, and violent setting in the manner of cinema and television.

Despite the abundance of familiar themes--squabbles over inherited wealth, the missing person, good love gone bad--each story here features an independent heroine whose approach to the case is, by virtue of her gender, unique to the genre. In \"Benny's Space\" by Marcia Muller, Sharon McCone finds that her empathy with a mother protecting her son provides the key to solving a murder; PI Kiernan O'Shaughnessy in \"Death and Diamonds\" by Susan Dunlap knows just enough about what makes a man tick to set a clever trap for one; and patrol officer Laura DeLeuse in Mary Wings's \"Kill the Man for Me\" contemplates wife abuse as she grapples with the murky moral issues surrounding an apparent revenge killing. Familiar sleuths in appearance are Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone, Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshawski and Antonia Fraser's Jemima Shore (in one of the collection's best stories). Headed for equally wide followings are the heroines of Julie Smith, Carolyn G. Hart, Margaret Maron and Carolyn Wheat. Readers of either sex will be enthralled .

Journalist Rowland Smith does a fair job of concisely explaining big ideas, and he offers a surprisingly colorful cast of thinkers from Carl Schmitt to Michel Foucault. He's at his best teasing out the little idiosyncrasies of modern experience, where simply washing your face in the morning betrays a remarkable optimism for the day ahead and fighting with your partner once in a while might actually be a good idea. While occasionally skirting into shallow discussions of some philosophers, the author maintains the central conceit of describing a typical day with admirable resourcefulness. This charming book wears its erudition with ease and suggests that despite what Socrates says, it is in fact the unexamined day that is not worth living.(Mar.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Cordyceps infect insects and alter their behaviour for their own gains. Once the fungi has matured it then flowers from the insect to spread its spores for the next generation.In concept I think its quite gruesome and creepy. Personally I found it quite disturbing. Taking the idea further I thought about if a similar fungus could infect a human being? Altering their state of mind to spread the next generation of the parasitic fungus? The idea was intriguing and led me on to the thought of what a situation of this nature would be like. The closest thing I could think of would be a zombie outbreak. With their minds altered and bodies ravaged by an invasive fungus they would single-mindedly attack and spread the fungus as far as they could.The idea of opening the book at sea was one of many openings I visualised. Originally I started the book off in the forests of the Amazon but changed this as I altered where the outbreak originated. Also it was a little to similar to the film arachnophobia.Extinction Theory as it stands is the third time I have written the book but the first time I have fully finished it. Previously I have half written the book twice which have both been quite different to the finished product.The main character (Sydney Trent) was based on a former tutor of mine. He was geeky but kind of cool in a geeky (for want of a better word) way.For the General I wanted him to appear as stereotypical of an American General as he could be. Although he most likely does not fit the grain of a real General, in my eyes this is how they appear to be. In low budget films at least anyway...With the above inspiration the book turned out to be a zombie outbreak horror type creation but with a twist of a different cause of infection and reanimation of the dead which makes for quite an interesting and entertaining read. Who can resist a good zombie novel these days anyway?", "related": [], "rank": 3254474, "title": "Extinction Theory (Zombie Horror)", "author": "Lee Emerick", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I admit the early creative stories featured me riding the range with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans and saving the West. What a disappointment to learn that Roy was exclusively committed to Dale! Eventually, my best friend from across the street and I decided to become better detectives than Nancy Drew. We drove our parents and neighbors crazy sticking our pert little noses where they didn't belong. About that time I started writing down my adventures, but mostly I was a reader. Not until I read Nora Roberts' early novels did I decide to create my own romance manuscripts. My road to publishing was a lot slower than Nora's was. No surprise there! I still read Nora's books—as well as those of countless other authors—but now I write full time. Unless life interferes, that is.  My Hero and I live one a small acreage in the ranching and horse country of North Central Texas. Finally, my childhood dream has come true and I’m in the midst of cowboys. Our two daughters are grown and in their own homes not far away.  Living with Hero and me now are Webster, our sweet black Shih Tzu, and our two shorthaired cats: Sebastian, a large black and white tuxedo who thinks he's our watchcat; and Bailey Erin, a shy apricot tabby who mostly stays in my office. When I'm not writing, I love spending time with family, reading, traveling with Hero, browsing antique malls and estate sales, and digging into family history and genealogy. Writing about strong heroes and heroines who overcome amazing obstacles to forge a meaningful life together is my passion.  I love to hear from readers at caroline @ carolineclemmons (dot) com.

James Hall started fast and gets better and better.\" - Tony Hillerman. \"James Hall is a writer I have learned from over the years. His people and places have more brush strokes than a van Gogh. He delivers taut and muscular stories about a place where evil always lurks below the surface.\" - Michael Connelly \"Hall nails you to the page until the suspense-laden climax.\" - Clive Cussler.  And for BLACKWATER SOUND (SMP 2002): \"Terrific...If you don't know the fine suspense novels of James W. Hall, this will get you off to a rousing start.\" - Scott Turrow. \"I believe no one has written more lyrically of the Gulfstream since Ernest Hemingway. James W. Hall's lovely descriptions of the Florida Keys and Grand Bahama, his detailed knowledge of the sea and hunt for giant Blue Marlin, his creation of fascinating characters, and his obvious love of the natural world make this book a wonderful reading experience.\" - James Lee Burke. \"A gorgeous and compelling novel about the merciless predators both in and above the waters of South Florida; it is all the better in that it offers the return of James W. Hall's masterwork, the marvelous Thorn. No writer working today uses language as elegantly as Hall, or more clearly evokes the shadows and loss that hide within the human heart.\" - Robert Crais. \"James W. Hall, the king of the Florida-gothic noir, delivers across the board with Blackwater Sound.

By the lethal, realistically ambiguous ending (no neatly wrapped answers here), Carver has uncovered a sad tale of twisted revenge, unrequited love and dark family secrets. He's also been attacked three times by a giant cretin, a truly terrifying character who's trying to stop the investigation, although Carver doesn't know who the giant's employer is. Middle-aged Carver must also deal with his black lover Beth's pregnancy and the still nasty police Lieutenant McGregor?who refers to Beth as \"dark meat.\" Lutz's eye for Florida noir (fast food joints, trailer parks and \"local criminals\" who \"view tourists as game animals\") is impeccable.

Doyle is a total alpha, so utterly compelling in his dominance (don't worry, I don't mean BDSM). He's crude, at times even cruel, in his initial conversations with Lilian, but instead of being disgusted, I was turned on. Why? Because even in those angst-filled moments -- no, especially in those moments -- there was a palpable heat just arching between these two. Trent also has hot dialogue to a T because just hearing Doyle's dark utterances was almost as hot as the real deal. And when Doyle finally takes Lilian, it's the start of many memorable encounters.Reviewed by Barb Chan for Sensual RomanceLouisa Trent's \"Tainted Love\" is a carefully woven historical erotic romance with strong elements of suspense. Ms. Trent slowly and carefully unravels Lilly and Doyle's story, intertwining glimpses to their past to enable the reader to put the pieces of the puzzle together, one by one ... yet, she successfully manages to surprise the reader at the endMireya Orsini for Just Erotic Romance Reviews Ms. Trent describes the lives and surroundings of Lily and Doyle in a way that is absolutely enthralling.Susan White for Coffee Time Romance Lily made the perfect submissive, needing to make reparations for all the pain she caused in the past. She was willing to allow herself to be humiliated both publicly and privately. So much pleasure laced with past pain created some of the hottest encounters before the two ever got to actual penetration.Desiree Farrell for Erotic Escapades Reviews", "related": ["B009OUDVSU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a child, I delighted in the spellbound faces of my friends an I learned to paint good, clean pictures in their imaginations, of science fiction and space travel, maybe with kitty cats as flight crew! Later, many of the stories started out as bedtime stories for the boys; action adventures in the land of 'what if'. Now here I am 60 years later, still telling wild stories. Actually my work is pretty predictable, always clean stories fit for family times with a weird, twisty, happy ending. Sometimes I make Youtube videos to go with the stories. What I imagine they'd look like as movies. Oh, I love it! So, you can type in the titles of my books there and see for yourself! I'm trying to post some here for you also, but life gets so busy, and time gets away it seems. I am on Facebook also. Please, come by and visit! facebook.com/pages/Peggy-Lee-Johnson-Author/110733699000412?fref=tsI have lots of videos on Youtube, book trailers and of course silly cat things! I haven't figured out how to update my blog on Amazon but..oh well! If you enjoy action, adventure, time travel, Pirates, aliens or westerns, there's a bit here for everyone! My recent story was a dare; could I write a story without aliens, ghosts or scifi? It was great fun and is now part of a series of Anne Bonny, and her lady pirate adventures! Life itself is such an adventure! Come play with me. Explore my stories. Let's pretend.

Blossom Seeley (nee Minnie Guyer) was a San Franciscan who had great success as a singer on the West Coast and went to New York City, where her first show, The Hen-Pecks, established her as a star. At the time, it was not uncommon for sports stars to play in vaudeville shows written especially for them, and so it was that the skit \"Breaking the Record\" was put together for Marquard and Seeley. Not only was it a great hit, but the two fell in love and Seeley divorced her husband of just a year to marry Marquard. In 1914, however, the Giants had a bad year, Marquard became less of a stage attraction and his wife went back on the vaudeville circuit as a solo act. They separated in 1916 and were divorced in 1922, as his career went downhill and hers soared so high that George Gershwin wrote \"Somebody Loves Me\" for her. The divorced couple corresponded for 50 years, until Seeley died in 1974. Hynd (The Giants of the Polo Grounds) has captured the spirit of the times in this quaint and entertaining sidelight to sports and show-biz history.

Readers are provided with a rich sense of what renders a novel \"Cormieresque,\" expressed poetically in the lines, \"the music of some minds is naturally in a minor key. Cormier shows us the light by focusing on the shadow that is its consequence.\" The writer's cinematic style, attributed to both his reverence for film and a career in journalism, is aptly echoed in the book's approach; Campbell zooms out and in and back again to tie together his body of work. Early chapters devoted to biography and analysis of overarching themes and influences are continually referenced to make sense of each title discussed in subsequent chapters. This title is undeniably a successful, exhaustively researched examination of Cormier's work that will be well received by anyone invested in criticism of young adult literature.

He was the first writer to successfully merge realism with genre fiction, and by so doing I think he may actually have created the kind of popular fiction that drove the best-seller lists and lit up the American imagination in the years 1960 to 2000. Books as disparate asThe New Centurions,The Friends of Eddie Coyle,The Godfather,Black Sunday, andThe Shiningall owe a debt to Evan Hunter, who taught a whole generation of baby boomers how to write stories that were not only entertaining but that truthfully reflected the times and the culture. He will be remembered for bringing the so-called \"police procedural\" into the modern age, but he did so much more than that. And he was one hell of a nice man. --Stephen KingWay back in the mid-1970s, when I was a new writer and police series were very big, my editor asked me to do a series calledJoe Ryker, NYPD.I had no idea how to write a police detective novel, but the editor handed me a stack of books and said, \"These are the 87th Precinct novels by Ed McBain. Read them and you'll know everything you need to know about police novels.\" After I read the first book--which I think wasLet's Hear It for the Deaf Man--I was hooked, and I read every Ed McBain I could get my hands on. Then I sat down and wrote my own detective novel,The Sniper, featuring Joe Ryker. My series never reached the heights of the 87th Precinct series, but by reading those classic masterpieces, I learned all I needed to know about urban crime and how detectives think and act. And I had a hell of a time learning from the master. Years later, when I actually got to meet Ed McBain/Evan Hunter, I told him this story, and he said, \"I would have liked it better if my books inspired you to become a detective instead of becoming my competition.\" Evan and I became friends, and I was privileged to know him and honored to be in his company. I remain indebted to him for his good advice over the years. But most of all, I thank him for hundreds of hours of great reading. --Nelson DeMilleTo read about how Ed McBain influenced other mystery and thriller writers, visit ourPerspectives on McBainpage.For a complete selection of 87th Precinct novels available for Kindle, visit ourEd McBain's 87th Precinct Booklist.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He earned his doctorate in clinical psychology and masters degree in theology from Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California.  He has held positions as college professor, clinic director, specialist for the US Navy and Marine Corps, as well as intervention specialist consultant for numerous churches and Christian organizations. His formal training in coaching is from MentorCoach LLC. Coach Jack offers hope and practical solutions for severely damaged relationships. “Regardless of the particular problems, no one wants to have a bad relationship.  That’s a common starting point for win-win interventions.” Coach Jack uses no-conflict, positive communication and  down to earth examples to take people, wherever they live, from emotionally distant to emotionally close relationships.  Coach Jack sees a person’s desire to separate or divorce as a willingness to give up what is not working and an opportunity to finally make the relationship a good one.  “People don’t want to break up, they just want a good relationship. Once they are  willing to do what is necessary, their success is practically guaranteed.  The problem with most relationships is that people spend too much time doing what is unnecessary before they are ready to do what is necessary.”  Coach Jack grew up in a small town in Vermont, in a family devastated by abuse and emotional conflict.  “My father was a violent and insecure man; my mother was a loving, but dependent housewife who spent her days wishing she had never married him.  There was no one who could help us to be a family.  They just told my mother to leave him, and she couldn’t bring herself to do that.  Now, I realize he was as much a victim of his behaviors as she was.  Neither of them knew what or how to do what was necessary to bring peace and love into their relationship.  It’s my intention to never let people I coach be left without a way to improve their relationship.” Coach Jack now travels the world coaching, writing, and speaking.  He lives with his wife, and maintains homes in the United States and Japan. His passion is people and relationships.  You can find more information about Coach Jack as well as more relationship advice on his websites at www.GreatRelationshipCoach.org and Relationship-Coach.org.", "related": ["B00JIWJ2VY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Novel Contest, this promising debut introduces black private investigator Aaron Gunner, hired to find the white man who walked into the Acey Deuce bar in South Central Los Angeles to blow away the owner, J. T. Tennell and Buddy Dorris of the Brothers of Volition, a black activist group. Buddy's sister, Verna Gail, feels the murder isn't getting enough police attention and hires Gunner, a P.I. who's trying to quit the business. He discovers that the killer is Denny Townsend, a white supremacist working on the fringes of a campaign to elect Lew Henshaw, a politician running on a law-and-order platform. Before Gunner can talk to Townsend, he finds himshot to death in Gunner's car. The cops are suspicious of Gunner, who soon is framed for the killing of Townsend's friend and possible accomplice, Stanley Ferris. To save his own neck, and to keep L.A. from erupting into racial violence, Gunner must find the connection between the politician, a local drug dealer and the Brother's charismatic leader, Roland Mayes. Haywood has a good ear for the sour voice of the true private eye and the sense of tired hopelessness of the underclass they have always served. One hopes to see more of Gunner.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Later, the dead begin to rise and feed off the living, and Jake realizes that the city—and, by extension, the world—could be wiped out by a plague of vampires. Fast paced, with sharply defined characters and a very clever historical explanation for the modern-day vampires (it involves ancient Babylon and Alexander the Great), the book should find a large audience. It’s worth pointing out that this is no “vampire romance”; it’s an out-and-out horror story, dark and brutal and thrilling. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It marks the grave of Thomas Deacon, the city's nonjurant Anglican bishop in the mid-1700s. (Nonjurants refused to swear allegiance to the ruling House of Hanover, or to recognise its monarchs as heads of the Church.) Deacons name is forever associated with the Jacobite Rising of 1745, for his three sons were officers in the Manchester Regiment the only English unit to fight for Prince Charles Edward Stuart. They suffered the same consequences as most others in the Regiment: one was executed, one died in captivity, and one was transported.  Their names, ranks and fates appear in the latest edition of Muster Roll, along with those of nearly half of their twelve to fourteen thousand comrades who at one time or another served in the Princes army. When ascertainable, civilian occupations are given as well. Each regiment is listed separately, and each listing is preceded by a short regimental history. There is also an excellent Introduction by leading Jacobite historian Professor Bruce Lenman.  Though the listings are far from complete, there are significantly more names than in previous editions. The editors are meticulous in recording the source or sources for each entry these range from such well-known documents as State Papers Domestic and Homes History of the Rebellion (Edinburgh 1822) through more obscure local and clan histories and some of them are likewise new.  The book explodes several common misconceptions about the Jacobite forces. Though they wore Highland dress, they were not a Highland army. Professor Murray Pittock has already observed, in The Myth of the Highland Clans (Edinburgh 1995), that fewer than half were actually Highlanders the rest were Lowlanders, or French regulars of Irish or Scottish origin, or the hapless Manchesters and the names in Muster Roll appear to bear him out. Nor were they a clan army; rather, they were organised into regiments by skilled professional officers. Nor were they necessarily down-and-outers: on the contrary, Muster Roll records some substantial occupations merchant, innkeeper, writer even among the rank-and-file, and most seem to have had employment of one sort or another. It is possible, of course, that a number of them were bankrupts, as several of the leaders certainly were.  Of their motives, Muster Roll tells us little. Religion (nonjuring Episcopalianism, Roman Catholicism), clan rivalries, Scottish nationalism, or the desire to make or retrieve fortunes all played a part. With rare exceptions, quixotic romanticism, in the form of blind attachment to the House of Stuart, did not: even the Gentle Lochiel, Donald Cameron of Lochiel, had the hard-headed good sense to demand an indemnity agreement from Charles before committing himself to the Cause, and he was not the only one.  Of their ultimate destinies, the book tells us a great deal, and a poignant tale it is. The Manchesters were hardest hit. Taken at Carlisle, they paid the price for being English and mostly Catholic. Of the 166 officers and men whose names appear in Muster Roll, 27 were executed (including 18 of the 32 officers and sergeants), 39 were banished or transported, and numerous others are believed to have died in captivity. The toll was not nearly so high amongst the remaining regiments, but it was grim enough, except for the Franco-Scottish and Franco-Irish troops, who were treated, and eventually repatriated, as prisoners of war. On the other hand, many prisoners (including nine Manchesters) saved themselves by turning Kings Evidence. Not all were faithful unto death.  This is a marvellous book. Not only is it a labour of love; it is also a first-rate piece of scholarship: equally valuable as a conversation piece, a serious research tool, or a vehicle for tracking down family legends about Jacobite ancestors. Above all, it memorialises the faceless thousands who followed the oxymoronic Bonnie Prince. They deserve this memorial. They were fools to trust Charlie's promises that France would intervene; that England's Jacobites would rise and even greater fools to trust his military skills. But they were heroic fools.

She always loved playing in the snow, reading and of course, making up stories. When her family moved to Arizona in 2005, she began writing her stories down. Miranda always had too many ideas so she could never manage to finish one because she was excited about a new idea. In November 2011, Miranda and a few of her friends decided to participate in NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month), where the goal is to write 50,000 words of a book in just the month of November. She accomplished this goal and was inspired to finish her book because she spent so much time on it. In April 2012, she finally finished Resist. Miranda has plans to go to college to become an elementary school teacher and pursue writing as a full-time hobby.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She follows science news and enjoys conversations about genetics and microbiology as much as those about vampires and werewolves.

The coins found in chapter 20 were\ndiscovered at the dig in Magdala. Mary of Magdala is a significant follower of\nJesus in all four of the New Testament gospels, but is not mentioned elsewhere\nin the New Testament. The apostles in this fictional love story are all named\nin the gospel stories in the New Testament. Also, all of the New Testament\ngospels refer to the brothers of Jesus (Mk. 3:32 and 6:3; Mt. 12:46-47, 13:55-56;\nLk. 8:19-20; Jn. 2:12, 7:3, 5, 10). The gospels of Mark and Matthew identify\nfour brothers and name them. Matthew 13:56 refers to \"his sisters.\" There is,\nhowever, no historical evidence whatsoever of the activities of the followers\nof the Way in Galilee between 35 and 44 CE.Early\nchurch documents verify the leading role of James―identified as the brother of\nJesus―in the Jerusalem church, and refer to Jude (Judas) as the author of the\nNew Testament letter by this name, and to Joses (Joseph) and Simon as brothers\nof Jesus. In this story I assume that these brothers and sisters are active as\nfollowers of the Way, which is how Acts 9:2 identifies the Jesus movement.Referring\nto the Letter of James, the New Oxford Annotated Bible says: \"This letter takes\nits name from the authority and tradition associated with James, the brother of\nJesus, who eventually became the leader of the church in Jerusalem.\" In\naddition to the references in the story, this conclusion is supported by other\nNew Testament passages (Gal. 1:19 and 2:9, 12; Acts 12:17, and 5:13, 21:18).Most\nChristians think of the brothers and sisters of Jesus as children of Joseph by\na previous marriage, which would make them Mary's stepchildren. The New\nTestament, however, does not say this, although it does contain birth stories\nthat attribute Mary's pregnancy to the Holy Spirit.Yet,\nPaul's letter to the Galatians, written at least twenty years earlier than the\ngospels of Matthew and Luke, says: \"when the fullness of time had come, God\nsent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law [of Moses].\" (Gal. 4:4-5) At\nthis early stage in the development of Christian teaching, around 50 CE, Paul\nseems unaware of any claim to a virgin birth for Jesus.The\nbirth stories of the gospels of Matthew and Luke may have been written to\ndefend the Christian movement against accusations by Jewish leaders that Jesus\nwas a \"fatherless\" child, an illegitimate son. This accusation is given voice\nin the New Testament in John 8:48, where a Jew in Jerusalem accuses Jesus of\nbeing a Samaritan. The accusation that Jesus was a bastard was well known in\nthe second century, and the Greek philosopher Celsus used it to ridicule the\nChristian claim that Jesus was the son of God.Later\nin the second century, rabbis suggested that the birth stories in the gospels\nof Matthew and Luke were written to conceal that Jesus was the result of Mary's\nrape by a Roman soldier. This was a key argument in their struggle to keep Jews\nfrom becoming Christians. Jewish writers identified this solder by name as Ben,\nson of Panthera, using a play on the Greek word parthenos, which means virgin,\nto ridicule the Christian claim that Jesus was born of a virgin.In\nher challenging book,Crossing Galilee:\nArchitectures in the Occupied Land of Jesus, Marianne Sawicki argues that\nthis continuing, public dispute over the lineage of Jesus is evidence that he\nwas likely a child of rape. Sawicki suggests his flawed kinship would have\nmeant that he was ineligible to marry a woman from a family with a status equal\nto his mother's family.Under\nJewish religious law, \"Jesus would have been seen as a defective 'man' and a\ndefective 'Jew' because he was the offspring of his mother's rape.\" Sawicki\nconcludes: \"the Christian traditions indicate that Jesus did not become a\nhouseholder and father. That means he did not achieve full manhood, as manhood\nwas culturally constructed.\"The\ncity of Sepphoris was besieged and then occupied by Roman armies in 4 BCE.\n\"According to provisions later recorded in the Mishnah,\" Sawicki reports,\n\"every girl in a besieged city lost her high-cast marriageability, regardless\nof whether a soldier had laid a hand or even an eye upon her.\" If Mary was\nraped by a Roman soldier, her child would have been a \"fatherless\" child. We\nmay, however, recognize in the witness of the New Testament, that Jesus found a\nFather in his Abba who did not judge any victim of rape for bearing and loving\nan illegitimate child. The Abba of the New Testament gospels is a \"Papa\" whose\nboundless love forgives all sin and embraces each sinner.Why does this love story include a first century account of\nthe Way as led by Magdalene and also a twenty-first century story about a\ndivorced campus minister and her family living in southern California? I have\none foot in each of these worlds, which are very different and yet not entirely\nso. This love story is a way of trying to share the good news that sustains my\nfaith.", "related": ["B0084AIFWS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lauren received a B.S. in computer science from the University of California, Santa Cruz.She spends her free time traveling the world with her geeky mobile-minded husband and daughter. She is an avid nature photographer. Her work has been published in books and newspapers around the world. In South Africa, she dove with 4-meter-long great white sharks and got stuck between a herd of rampaging hippopotami and an irritated bull elephant. She’s been attacked by monkeys in Japan, gotten stuck in a ravine with two hungry lions in Kenya, gotten thirsty in Egypt, narrowly avoided a coup d’etat in Thailand, geocached her way through the Swiss Alps, drank her way through the beer halls of Germany, slept in the crumbling castles of Europe, and had her tongue stuck to an iceberg in Iceland (while being watched by a herd of suspicious wild reindeer).Shane Conderhas extensive development experience and has focused his attention on mobile and embedded development for the past decade. He has designed and developed many commercial applications for Android, iOS, BREW, Blackberry, J2ME, Palm, and Windows Mobile--some of which have been installed on millions of phones worldwide. Shane has written extensively about the mobile industry and evaluated mobile development platforms on his tech blogs. He is well-known within the blogosphere. Shane received a B.S. in computer science from the University of California. A self-admitted gadget freak, Shane always has the latest smartphone, tablet, or other mobile device. He can often be found fiddling with the latest technologies, such as cloud services and mobile platforms, and other exciting, state-of-the-art technologies that activate the creative part of his brain. He is a very hands-on geek dad. He also enjoys traveling the world with his geeky wife, even if she did make him dive with 4-meter-long great white sharks and almost got him eaten by a lion in Kenya. He admits that he has to take at least two phones with him when backpacking--even though there is no coverage--and that he snickered and whipped out his Android phone to take a picture when Laurie got her tongue stuck to that iceberg in Iceland, and that he is catching on that he should be writing his own bio.The authorshave also published several other Android books, includingAndroid Wireless Application Development, Android Wireless Application Development Volume I: Android Essentials, Sams Teach Yourself Android Application Development, Learning Android Application Programming for the Kindle Fire, and the mini-bookIntroducing Android Development with Ice Cream Sandwich. Lauren and Shane have also published numerous articles on mobile software development for magazines, technical journals, and online publishers of educational content. You can find dozens of samples of their work inLinux User and Developer,Smart Developermagazine (Linux New Media), developer.com, Network World, Envato (MobileTuts+ and CodeCanyon), and InformIT, among others.

In 1935 helped excavate Constantine's palace in Istanbul.Duggan came to writing fiction quite late in his life: his first novel about the First Crusade,Knight in Armour, was published in 1950, after which he published at least a book every year until his death in 1964. His fictional works were bestselling page-turners, but thoroughly grounded in meticulous research informed by Duggan's experience as an archaeologist and historian.Duggan has been favourably compared to Bernard Cornwell as well as being praised in his own right as 'an extremely gifted writer who can move into an unknown period and give it life and immediacy.'New York Times", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Together with their two dogs (Copper and Timber) and their three beautiful granddaughters spend their days working in the greenhouses and nursery, making their own potting soil and grow their own flowers, shrubs and vegetables. In the summer, they open a fresh produce stand and sell locally grown fresh produce to the community. Sandy has always been into healthy eating, and by default Mike has benefited from her lifestyle, but it wasn’t until Copper started to have seizures did it sink in for Mike. Mike stumbled upon the ugliness of the dog food industry why trying to find a solution to Copper’s health issues. The more he learned about dog food, the more he thought about the foods being sold to consumers like you. Mike and Sandy truly believe you are what you eat. This goes both for humans and pets. Because of their vast knowledge of nutrition and the use of fresh organic ingredients in their own foods, it was only natural for them to spread the word about healthy eating. Because Mike spends so many of his evenings on the Internet doing research on health issues related to dogs, it was only natural for him to gravitate to places like Facebook, twitter and pet forums to help educate the pet parents everywhere. Mike also wrote the books Pet Insurance Buyer's Guide - Everything a Dog and Cat Parent Needs to Know About Buying Pet Insurance  and Give Your Dog a Fighting Chance to a Longer Life - Healthy Dog Food Buyer's Guide for Dog Parents (The Best Dog Food List) to help pet parents with the difficult process of finding the best pet insurance company, and healthy dog foods that fit their personal needs. Please go to Amazon and take a look at the Authors other books and please leave a review for this one.

Murrow or even my friend Don Kirk, who in his 70s is still slogging around Asia on assignments. Don was young man when he won an award for a book on his coverage of the Vietnam War. Yet as an old man he covered the Iraq War. Now he's back at his home in Korea writing for the Christian Science Monitor, and authoring more books on Asia...about six in all so far. Then there's one of my mentors Colin Dangaard, a real life Crocodile Dundee. He left his Outback Australian home to learn journalism from the old way, on the job, and then literally worked his way around the world on newspapers, spending around six months to a year at each job before moving on. This included sailing a leaky yacht from South Africa to Florida and years later returning to his first love, horses by establishing the Australian Stock Saddle Co. in, of all places, Malibu, California. And has just published a novel \"Talking to Horses.\"  No, this is a story of an ordinary guy who through work, luck and perseverance wound up doing extraordinary things...at least some seemed that way to me. Yet, today, more than anything else, I am one of the dying breed of people who can bear witness to the revolution that has changed newsgathering and dissemination forever. I can still recall holding a printer's stick and setting type by hand in my high school print shop. Then, a short time later, sitting at a Linotype machine, watching a bar of lead melt in its reservoir as I typed out my story.... a story that would be hand carried, still hot, to the lock-up, a large metal frame in which the solidified lead would be secured ready for the presses. A few years down the line, I learned to deal with offset lithography as printing went from hot to cold type. The hot metal was replaced by hot wax used to fix the paper type -- as it was -- to the paper layout sheet from which a photo was made to help mold the sheet metal casting. The age of moveable type was over.... now it came in massive blocks ready to print. But even then, the media industry had no idea how computers and the Internet would soon change everything to such a degree that they would relegate Gutenberg's medieval marvel to insignificance.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Within its confined walls he learned of perseverance…and darkness; as a teen, he set a world record in the deadlift. Most of what he’s accomplished can be contributed to straying away from the pack, and the free time to better one’s self that comes with it. His mind can be found looking down from the moon but only when he’s not writing or delving into the dark place.

But the night before the duel, Jacombe's body tumbles over the Grand Cascade at Vauxhall, ruining the Prince of Wales's gala. Spotted with a gun in his hand, Nevill is promptly arrested. Brummell, however, knows that Nevill's accusation of false play was well founded. In his search for other suspects, Brummell discovers that the seemingly upright Jacombe had wronged many people besides the young lieutenant, of whom the Beau is very fond. Exactly why he's fond of Nevill is hard to judge, because only the Beau, as narrator, has any character at all. Poorly drawn secondary characters, a contrived plot and an unlikely denouement-it's hard to imagine the murderer caring enough about anything to do Jacombe in-mar this effort. A wonderful description of the Grand Cascade at Vauxhall serves to remind readers that Stevens, the author of several Regencies (Crime of Manners, etc.), is capable of better.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Reclaimed by his mother, Maggie, whom he presumed dead, from a loving but bleak Catholic orphanage, Duncan maintains an aura of purity and goodness. He settles into a dreary life with his mother hard by the battered wharves of the San Francisco Bay among the forgotten poor. This literary novel soars and at times flat-out wanders off into reveries about pain, waste, angels, death, the ethereal beauty of song, traumatized Vietnam veterans, and Duncan’s imagined fate of the Apollo 11 astronauts who never return to earth (the title refers to Buzz Aldrin’s description of the lunar surface). O’Malley writes shimmering, luminescent prose. But the novel feels episodic at times, and the litany of despair may tire some readers. Yet it is a deeply spiritual novel about dissipation and waste. Although Duncan remains an enigma, Maggie is a fully realized character, a great opera singer whose career is snuffed out when her vocal chords are shredded following her breakthrough brilliant performance. Regrets, resignation, and a spiraling alcoholism fill her days as an occasional saloon singer, as she nevertheless provides Duncan with a love of great purity, filled with uncertain adventure. --Jonathan Schwartz", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They tell us of normal lives shattered by trauma, suffering, violence, and redeemed by love, resilience, courage or hard-earned wisdom.  I read these oral tales with a knot in my stomach, frightened and moved, and finally amazed by this lesson: when people find the strength to tell us what has happened to them, no matter how horrendous, a terrible yet universal beauty somehow emerges, always casting light on the mystery of being human.\"—Francisco Goldman, author ofSay Her Name\"Outside the U.S. media's lights and whir, the largest crisis in the world of forced displacement from home is taking place in Colombia. Throwing Stones at the Moon makes it personal through these narratives of loved and difficult life, vivid and specific to Colombia's places and to the families torn and struggling amid the long war. Brodzinsky and Schoening convey these people's tender and bitter stories, of resilience and loss, of cruelty and solidarity, in their own full voices. Stories that don't end with an act of violence, but that call out for compassion, and for justice.\"—John Lindsay-Poland, Director for Latin America and the Caribbean of the Fellowship for Reconciliation\"Poignant.\"—Kirkus\"Human rights journalists Brodzinsky and Schoening geographically organize intimate oral histories from individuals living through pervasive violence among Colombia's drug cartels, military forces, and rebels. Often astonishing quotes double as headings...piquing readers' curiosity and conscience...Readers concerned with human rights and Latin American politics will find this account of violence and survival both sad and inspiring.\"—Publishers WeeklyPraise for the Voice of Witness series:“These books are amazing … beautifully produced, with incredible editing and literary sensibility. Voice of Witness has done a better job than I’ve seen anybody do with having people tell their stories in a way that really engages you.”—Rachel Maddow“The series does not so much weave a tapestry from different experiences as braid a rope, a lifeline by which we might haul ourselves into a less ignorant, more actively compassionate future. In them, the specific illuminates the general, destroying preconceptions, stereotypes, and cop-out responses along the way.”—Richard Vernon,Sojourners Magazine“In a time when history is told in cheap television re-enactments, if at all, and personal tragedy is gobbled up in rapidly digestible magazine photos and reality shows, this project goes against the grain.”—Guardian UK“The soon-to-be-released book, Throwing Stones At The Moon (Voice of Witness, 2012) reads like a collection of literary short stories, but, in this case, the stories are both real and horrifying. The stories of those gathered in Moon are told by the Colombian victims of human rights abuses themselves…Given that these voices are rarely heard, this book is invaluable.”—Huffington Post", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Shapiro, the father of two, shares not only his own experiences as a dad but what he's learned from his patients, men's groups, workshops, interviews, surveys, the literature on fatherhood, and even electronic bulletin boards. Central to his work is the belief that a man who wishes to be a better father must understand both his actual father and his internalized image of him, for this ``inner father'' shapes a man's emotional reactions and behavior when he himself has children. In addition to describing in considerable detail how to conduct the essential probing of the father-son relationship, Shapiro offers advice on becoming a ``good-enough'' father. He counsels men to become actively involved with their children and warns them against imitating mothers, since fathers have their own roles to play- -most importantly, the traditional male role of protecting and providing. According to Shapiro, learning fathering skills is a lifelong process, one that he divides into eight stages, beginning with preparing for one's firstborn and ending with becoming a grandfather. The single father and stepfather are covered in the section on ``Hard Fathering,'' while ``Resources for Fathers'' provides sources of further information, plus some commonly asked questions, with very short answers. Shapiro brackets his text with two deeply personal and revealing letters about fatherhood--one to his own father and one to his children. More effective as an aid to understanding one's father than as a manual on becoming a better father, and more appropriate for men with sons than for those with daughters. --Copyright ©1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Allow me to tell you a little about myself...I grew up in an Irish Catholic Parish on the south side of Chicago. My mother was an artist, and the aromas that wafted through our home were the respectively lush, musky and piquant scents of oil paint, linseed oil, and turpentine. Depending on the time of day, you could find my mother and her easel perched in the glow of whatever window was shedding the best light. Art was in her DNA; she lived it, breathed it and passed her love for it down to us.My first lyrics popped out in the spring of second grade when I was hurrying home for my daily fix of chicken Rice-A-Roni, ice cold Nestlé's Quick and a thirty minute visit with Bozo T. Clown. The day was grey and unseasonably warm and as I rounded the final corner of my block I was suddenly infused with an overwhelming surge of emotion. Caught up in a baffling interplay of bittersweet longing and inexplicable joy, I belted out my first original song right there in front of stupid Johnny McManahan's Hamilton Avenue bungalow. I'm almost embarrassed to tell you that I recall the lyrics and the tune, verbatim, to this day.I've been writing ever since. My evolution from lyrics and poetry to mysteries and thrillers was a natural one. Again, I harken back to my childhood when a wintry afternoon spent with a newly cracked Nancy Drew and a toasty-hot cinnamon Pop-Tart was my idea of heaven on earth.The inspiration for my current novel, A SILENT KEEP, came from an actual experience. As a junior in high school I really did go on a \"Spring Week,\" white-water adventure, I was the only girl to sign up for the trip, and the bad guys did show up at our isolated north woods campsite. However, in real life when the defining moment came, the nightmare didn't happen. I thank God for my good fortune on that pivotal, terrifying night, but, as a writer, I've always wondered, what if...Ergo, A SILENT KEEP.Aside from the original kernel of inspiration, A SILENT KEEP is entirely fictional. The people, places, events and dates are all figments of my alarmingly over-active imagination.I sincerely hope you enjoy my book.All the best,Linda", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But in Palestine’s infamous Gaza Strip, Ireland’s beloved octogenarian travel writer exposes harsh truths that are often stranger than fiction. Using a combination of history and her personal experiences, Murphy uncovers the intricate social and political realities of the Gazan people that are often glossed over by headlines. On a series of day-trips that range from the quietly tragic to the abjectly horrifying, she visits extended families living in squalor, sheltering in and around their bombed-out homes and desperately trying to keep a few olive trees alive as a symbol of hope. As children starve, rich patrons at a fine restaurant nearby use precious lemons to clean their hands between courses, and every desk at an oil-funded school needlessly bears its own electric pencil sharpener. Although Murphy’s occasional lead-thick, date-heavy lectures on history aren’t the best introduction to Palestine, the light she sheds on one of the world’s greatest humanitarian crises is as moving as it is invaluable. --Adam Morgan", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He immigrated to the United States in 1951. He was immediately drafted and spent four years in the United States Air Force – his last duty station was the Pentagon. Upon his discharge from the Service, he attended the Universities of Maryland and Connecticut, where he graduated with a Master of Science Degree in Physiological Experimental Psychology. His lifelong scientific interest has dealt with learning theory and brain function.  Upon leaving the University of Connecticut, he joined North American Aviation in Columbus, Ohio where he worked in their Advanced Engineering Division on special equipment concepts for the U2 highflying spy aircraft.   He was then recruited from North American by the Department of the Navy as a Civilian Scientist where he became involved in their renowned saturation diving and ocean floor habitation experiments, focused on ocean floor habitation to depths of 1400 feet to facilitate scientific, industrial and military interests involving man living on the ocean floor of the continental shelves of all of the world’s land masses. While working for the Department of the Navy, he returned to the University of Connecticut and matriculated for his Ph.D. He also became significantly involved in (1) inshore warfare; (2) fluid breathing; (3) saturation diving;  (4) the rescue and recovery of nuclear submarines lost in deep water; and (5) the separate development by the Navy of marine mammals as biological weapon platforms. He was put on loan by the Department of the Navy to the CIA to assist in the development of their dolphin weapon systems, wherein their dolphin and whales became and remain as the underwater precursors of the CIA’s present-day pilotless drones (the CIA and the Navy’s work with marine mammals were entirely separate and duplicitous) .  After a very successful career as a government scientist, he left the Department of the Navy and focused on the concepts that have always guided his thinking, mainly a clear and humanistic definition of what the real scientific priorities of this country are, or should be, if America is to prevail as the world’s leader. Towards this end, upon leaving the government, he became a college teacher, lecturer, and writer and continued as a notable scientist heading significant research groups and corporate enterprises. His ongoing work involves the Pangaea Technology which he currently anticipates taking to China.", "related": [], "rank": 2972076, "title": "Peter Fisher's Odyssey: Marine Mammal Warfare", "author": "Michael Greenwood", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 2002, Maria gave birth to her son, Frankie, and in 2005, she had her daughter, Nicoletta. Maria feels her greatest accomplishments are being a mom and an elementary school teacher.

Intended for the public librarian, 'this work demonstrates how public libraries can position themselves as active and vibrant centers of community life in the twenty-first century' (p. vii). Drawing on real-life examples, the co-authors demonstrate through case studies how libraries of all sizes, demographics, and budgets in the United States can and do work to become community-centered. Drawing on what has already been done, sharing tips, tricks, inspiration, what to do, and what not to do, this book will encourage and enable any public library to become more community-centered. Librarians in other types of libraries can also benefit from selected chapters, based on the community needs, whether looking to find the importance and relevance of being community-centered; how to allocate the resources, collaborate, and obtain grants; or determining how to focus on civic action, sustainability, the arts, or other purposes. Down-to-earth and practical, yet packed with ideas and inspiration, this work is beneficial to any public library’s professional collection.(American Reference Books Annual)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Woman's Weekly 'A gripping read.' Lancashire Evening Post 'Fyfield at her best compelling disturbing but always elegant ... ' - Minette Walters 'Her knowledge of the workings of the human mind - or more correctly the soul - is second to none.' - Ian Rankin 'Undiluted brilliance.' - The Times 'Frances Fyfield is now universally acclaimed as one of this country's finest crime writers, with a depth of psychological understanding quite the equal of the previously unassailable duo of PD James and Ruth Rendell. The intense and expressive quality of her prose illuminates narratives that both celebrate traditional storytelling values and explode them. Undercurrents may well be her most disturbing work yet. In the past, some male readers may have been discomforted by her recurring preoccupation with male violence against women, but Henry Evans, the protagonist of this novel, is the perfect conduit for both the male and female reader into a truly mesmerising narrative. When Henry was backpacking around India some 20 years before, he encountered the beguiling Francesca Chisholm. Francesca's father died, and Henry's reluctance to alter his travel plans obliged her to leave without him. For all of his adult life, he has regretted this decision, and finally resolves to travel to the English coastal town of Warbling (the name is the book's only miscalculation) to track her down. But Henry is in for a shock. It's a very wet February, and his hotel is flooded, so he is obliged to stay at a strange alternative hostel. The solicitor who has traced Francesca suggests that he regard her as dead but Henry persists. He discovers that Francesca has confessed to killing her five-year-old son, drowning him in the sea. She is imprisoned and the case appears to be closed. But is it? Henry decides to find out precisely what happened. And his scarifying odyssey into the dark night of the soul--both his and hers--is something he finds himself unprepared for. Fyfield adroitly presents her protagonist with an implacable mystery--but the solving of this mystery is no mechanical trick, as it so often was in the golden age of crime fiction. The journey Henry undertakes will change him forever, and the insights into the troubled Francesca's psyche are as rich and profound as anything in literary fiction. As always with this author, the characters are fastidiously created, and the taut structure of the plot is accentuated by the relative brevity of her narrative. Some may wish for a longer book, but there isn't a wasted word here, and anyone in doubt as to Fyfield's position in the pantheon of English crime writing should not hesitate.' - Barry Forshaw, Amazon.co.uk", "related": ["B00HHCFV5S"], "rank": 888059, "title": "Undercurrents", "author": "Tamara McKinley", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My other interests are watching my boys play football…The round ball version; I am happy to admit to being an addict of social media and I owe a lot to my Facebook and Twitter family in promoting my work; I am also rather partial to a glass… or bottle of wine, a nicely chilled Marlborough Sav Blanc being my favorite.

Kellian York owns the Silken Aces Saloon.  Kellian has just arrived, inheriting the saloon from his brother Kyle.  He is all too aware of the do-gooders in town wanting to close him up and be rid of his ladies, but when the saloon is burned to the ground, Kell is unprepared for the vision that awaits him in the form of spinster Annie Muldoon. Convinced that Annie is responsible for the fire, Kell insists she take him and his girls in as boarders in her boardinghouse.  Annie's followers are happy to take the blame for the fire, though Annie knows nothing about it.  Annie, much to their dismay, gladly takes in the soiled doves but she has her own agenda.  Annie doesn't want to run them out of town, she wants to reform them, leading them on the path to righteousness. Annie's followers soon turn against her because of her apparent friendship with the ladies, and Annie soon finds that it can be the upstanding citizens that need a lesson in casting the first stone.  Kell and Annie are attracted to each other, but Kell refuses to give in to his feelings, still unsure of Annie's motives.  But once Annie takes a few lessons from the girls, Kell doesn't stand a chance!  And when accidents surround the rebuilding of Kell's saloon (until the arsonist is caught), and Annie could be in danger, Kell must face his feelings and, with the help of the girls, propose to the woman he loves.Darling Annie is a lighthearted, humorous romp filled with the love of a lifetime! Ms. Cantrell has found the formula for mixing oil and water and creating champagne! Ms. Cantrell creatively opens the eyes of those who would judge, and gives them a whole new perspective!

For as long as I can remember I have had a deep fascination with history and always wanted to know more and more about the past. Growing up in the shadow of a range of Iron-Age hill forts may be a contributing factor! From an early age I was always encouraged to read and fed my passion for history with historical fiction. Academic books are great for knowledge, don't get me wrong, but historical fiction always brought history to life for me and always made me want to know more. I consistently did well with History in school at GCSE and A Level – so this gave me the justification to study History at university. I studied History at Bangor University, North Wales, and it was there that the desire to write burrowed itself deep into my mind and refused to go away. It was whilst I was studying 11th and 12th century Wales that I discovered Gruffudd ap Cynan, and I knew instantly what I wanted to do with my life. I was gripped by Gruffudd's truly remarkable story. The man was a true adventurer, a political master who revolutionised Gwynedd and tried to unite the Welsh people under one banner, a talented tactician, formidable warrior and womaniser – I couldn't believe it, I mean seriously, how had nobody written a historical fiction about him!? More to the point, why did not many people know of him outside academic circles? It was then I thought, why don't I do it myself? I knew that if done properly a historical fiction of Gruffudd would tell a pretty decent story! So I thought, why not, I'll give it a go – and I did.  It's difficult to write about yourself and your book and I really don't want to bore you. It really means a lot to me that you have taken the time to read my book; hopefully I have opened your eyes to Gruffudd's story and a period in British history that isn't very well known at all – and just maybe Gruffudd's story has gripped you too.", "related": ["B00L6CTWBE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rodger is a British science fiction & fantasy author and game designer best known for his novels set in a near-future world of corporate and political intrigue. So far he has published eight novels; five that are set in the same world: God Seed; Dante’s Fool; Iron Man Project, Edge and Living in Flames and three, Dog Eat Dog, The Black Lake and The Social Club set within the world of Yellow Dawn. Yellow Dawn is a role-playing game set in the same future world as his novels, ten years after it has been devastated by a terrible mutagenic virus. Rodger's novels often combine high-tech intrigue and political/corporate machinations with elements of the Cthulhu Mythos, as created by H.P. Lovecraft. Rodger's contributions to the Mythos include the creation of several new Great Old Ones through his novels Edge, Dog Eat Dog and Living in Flames, and the use of the Outer God Nyarlathotep in the novel God Seed. In Yellow Dawn Rodger's interpretation of the Mythos, in particular the Great Old One Hastur, is a major part of the background material. Rodger also published Shadows of the Quantinex, a large-scale campaign expansion for the Yellow Dawn game. Rodger has also written Cloudy Head, a children's story illustrated by Kenn-Ole Moen, and Murder at Sharky Point, a murder mystery game. Rodger recently put together a collection of his favourite short stories of the last 15 years in Songs of Spheres, including a brief intro about each story. Rodger spent 8 years working for a non-departmental government agency, developing a virtual communications service within the IT Division, before moving into commercial project management for a UK media company. In 2000 Rodger's presence on the Internet got him a place in the BBC documentary Through The Eyes of the Young, directed by Chris Terrill. Rodger now lives in Bristol, England, with a Braun coffee-maker, writing from a house on a hill with a view of Earth's curve.", "related": [], "rank": 2345966, "title": "The Social Club eBook", "author": "David J Rodger", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Myers, PhD, LPC, BCIA (EEG), coauthor ofCounseling for Wellness\"A new generation of clinicians, expert in self-regulation of the neural networks, will return repeatedly to this book for insight and clarification.\"—Douglas Dailey, LAc, BCB, BCN, QEEG diplomate, founder of TAG Sync Neurofeedback\"Neurofeedback is a constantly evolving and emerging intervention. With limited academic venues professionals rely on the writings and expertise of their colleagues. Drs. Russell-Chapin and Chapin have provided an accurate yet digestible account of the historical and scientific underpinnings but perhaps more importantly have provided a framework for the professional to integrate neurofeedback into their practice.Neurotherapy and Neurofeedbackis an excellent resource for both the new and experienced neurotherapist.\"—Leslie H.

He was diagnosed with Meniere’s disease, but the full impact of having Meniere’s disease was to come later. He was to lose not only his health, but his career and financial status as he knew it. He began to lose all hope that he would fully recover a sense of well-being. But it was his personal spirit and desire to get ‘back to normal’ that made him not give up to a life of Meniere’s symptoms of severe vertigo, dizziness and nausea.  He decided that you can’t put a limit on anything in life. Rather than letting Meniere’s disease get in the way of recovery, he started to focus on what to do about overcoming Meniere’s disease.  These days life is different for the Author. He is a fit active man who has no symptoms of Meniere’s disease except for hearing loss and tinnitus in one ear. Following his own advice he continues to avoid salt, stress, takes vitamins, exercises regularly and maintains a positive, mindful attitude. He does not take any medication.  All the physical activities he enjoys these days require a high degree of balance and equilibrium: snowboarding, surfing, hiking, windsurfing, weightlifting, and riding a motorbike.  Meniere Man believes that if you want to experience a marked improvement in health you can’t wait until you feel well to start. You must begin to improve your health now, even though you don’t feel like it. The Author is a writer, painter, designer and artist. He is married to a poet. They have two adult children. He spends most days writing or painting. He enjoys the sea, cooking, travel, photography, nature and the great company of family, friends and his beloved dog, Bella.", "related": ["B00HZ1YTDG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She had an overactive imagination very early on, and wasted no time in getting most of her friends in trouble due to her unrealistic and completely ridiculous ideas. Seeing as she was so lazy and also afraid people would think she was bonkers, she didn't write down any of the story lines that played out in her daydreams. During her high school years, she took pen to paper and filled more notebooks than she is proud of with angsty, depressing, self-depreciating poetry. This led to her writing down more things: notes, ideas, character bios, plot twists that had no plot yet to twist. After years of cleaning up her own scraps of imagination with nothing solid to hold on to, she sat down and wrote the story that had been in her head the longest. Fueled by coffee and her unwavering and perfectly normal devotion to Dave Grohl, she discovered a writer living inside of her. She still lives in the Midwest, though not as close to the Black Hills as she would prefer, with her alarmingly handsome husband and their fearless child. They eat more pizza than God intended and she listens to her music the same way she lives: loudly.", "related": ["B00I5NBD5K"], "rank": 482537, "title": "In Your Honor (Double Blind Study Book 2)", "author": "Heidi Hutchinson", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.8571, "rating_total": 34.0}
