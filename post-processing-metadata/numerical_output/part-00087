Her quest for sexual wisdom leads her to an ancient spellbook that brings a Pagan German Priestess back to life and Katie on a path of unlocking sexual magic long-since forgotten.Sharonis a short, spicy-sweet story that finds a young man and woman spending the night in a haunted mansion. Without giving any secrets away, let's just say this as an urban legend that let's the main character do a lot more than talk.The Infectedis probably the steamiest tale in the collection.

There were times when I was reading it that I felt like I wasn't reading a story at all, rather watching the events unfold like a fly on the wall.

During a lecture Grayson attended on the parallels between new physics and ancient mystical thought, he became convinced that mind, energy and matter intimately connect all humans and all living beings together-a concept he deemed to have great consequence for improving relationships. Most marriages are ego-based and characterized by partners who want gratification, pleasure and security from each other, he says; if our desires are not met, we attempt to change our partner's behavior, which can create a downward spiral of disappointment and dissatisfaction. Grayson believes that conflict will dissipate and marriages will grow when husbands and wives surrender their egos. He describes, for example, how a wife's hostile fantasies towards her husband were a factor in his verbal abuse of her. When the woman began to think of her husband as the man she loved, he stopped attacking her with words. Put into practice, a spiritual marriage requires that unconditional love be given without the expectation of receiving anything in return.

Now on the outside, he begins to view their superstitions skeptically: demons do not dwell in the forbidden slough, after all; and the wolf dog, Ram, despised by the clan, becomes Tao's devoted friend. This is an exciting, fabulously descriptive story set against violent times. Denzel's knowledge of the Stone Age enhances the action; moreover, with his tender, somewhat melancholy insights into ostracism and loyalty, he transcends the period.

The narrator is Zohr, an upper-class girl whose letters (79 in total) to a character in The Thousand and One Nights form a jumbled narrative that touches frequently on female sexuality and the spirit world. The sections follow no chronological order, nor do they build upon each other to develop the conflict promised early on, the \"take-no-prisoners battles\" between Zohr and her aunts, especially the wild Jummo, who as a child was possessed by an animal spirit. Instead, the book is a compilation of passionately written yet confusing vignettes that display the powers of geniis, spirits, and dervishes. The authors (who collaborated before on the novel Fatma) present a dizzying picture of Mecca's mysticism, but the scattershot structure and lack of direction are frustrating.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Michael \"Mickey Boy\" Messina has just been paroled from prison after having been set up by Little Vinnie Calabra, son of Don Vincenze Calabra, most powerful boss of the Five Families. Messina begins a steamy, explicitly described love affair with his younger brother's ex-girlfriend, Laurel Bianco, as Don Vincenze sets off a war among the Families in order to purge the Mafia of the unfit and reduce the number of Families to two. The gradually revealed relationship between Messina's mother and Don Vincenze, while no surprise, makes a nicely integrated subplot. Girard's authoritative grasp of the Mafia's inner workings, his narrative skills and ability to create credible characters easily compensate for his occasional lapses into clumsy prose.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B007X5L2ZW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But Laura is not the only one with a secret life of the mind; her neighbors and acquaintances--including her son's teacher, the mother of one of his classmates, a little old lady and her beloved dog, and Laura's own husband--also carry their own hidden agendas and desires. A YA novelist and Academy Award–nominated screenwriter, Nicholson (The Wind Seeker) has a knack for crystallizing his themes in pivotal moments and deserves credit for not clouting the reader over the head with his affirmative message about the viability of two rapidly fading institutions: long-term marriage and English country life.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His military and technical background has given him a uniquely well-informed perspective on the military, technological developments and their impact on world events. Gerald is a lifelong science fiction fan and has had over a dozen articles published previously in various small gaming magazines on the BattleTech game. 'Unwanted Gifts' is the first in a series of near-term science fiction novels that feature a family whose special gifts transform the world and people around them through the generations. Gerald is also a United Methodist minister's spouse. Christian themes run throughout 'Unwanted Gifts', its first sequel 'Hidden Gifts' and their sequels to come.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Orphaned at nine, he was brought up by an elderly aunt and educated by French tutors until he matriculated at Kazan University in 1844. In 1847, he gave up his studies and, after several aimless years, volunteered for military duty in the army, serving as a junior officer in the Crimean War before retiring in 1857. In 1862, Tolstoy married Sophie Behrs, a marriage that was to become, for him, bitterly unhappy. His diary, started in 1847, was used for self-study and self-criticism; it served as the source from which he drew much of the material that appeared not only in his great novelsWar and Peace(1869) andAnna Karenina(1877), but also in his shorter works. Seeking religious justification for his life, Tolstoy evolved a new Christianity based upon his own interpretation of the Gospels. Yasnaya Polyana became a mecca for his many converts At the age of eighty-two, while away from home, the writer suffered a break down in his health in Astapovo, Riazan, and he died there on November 20, 1910.Anthony Briggs has written, translated, or edited twenty books in the fields of Russian and English literature.Anthony Briggs has written, translated, or edited twenty books in the fields of Russian and English literature.Anthony Briggs has written, translated, or edited twenty books in the fields of Russian and English literature.</div>", "related": [], "rank": 67678, "title": "Resurrection", "author": "Robert Shea", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The trouble with this \"novel of erotic realism\" is that its reach exceeds its grasp. If the author had only set out to write a pornographic potboiler then this book wouldn't be nearly so appalling.

Her heritage shows from head to toe -- in her tough, work-worn hands, and in the easy, flowing cadence of her mountain voice. Always curious, she wants to know everyone's story and has a knack of getting it -- from the old timers of her childhood to all the other people she has come across since -- from laborers to affluent developers. One cannot encounter Peggy without sharing stories. Many of her stories have roots in her own experiences: Her dad grew beans and raised livestock. Her mother worked at a local factory to supplement the farming income. Relatives, extended family, and church provided a unique atmosphere for living and learning the old mountain traditions. She married at seventeen, finished high school, and started a family. She furthered her education at Appalachian State, but the responsibilities of six children quickly made formal study impossible. She did manage to write a few manuscripts on an old portable typewriter. Her husband teased about her spelling and sentence structure, causing her to become somewhat disillusioned with writing. She turned to crafts to assist in the struggle for survival, marketed her crafts through Blue Ridge Hearthside Crafts Cooperative, and became a board member for the organization. Moving to her own farm, she continued to raise her own food, adding a milk cow and other livestock. Tobacco was the main cash crop. Christmas trees were planted to assist the children through college. Being active in agriculture, Peggy became a board member of Farm Bureau Insurance, the local Christmas Tree Association, NC Agricultural Extension Advisory Council, and NC State University. These positions enabled her to experience some of the life beyond the mountains. For more than thirty years, Peggy assisted her husband -- a land surveyor-- with the field and office work. Through contacts made with a developer client, she started selling her Christmas trees on a lot in Naples, Florida, becoming known there as the Christmas Tree Lady. The survey business gave Peggy additional insight on the impacts -- good and bad -- to the community as the mountains became a tourist and second home destination. As the children grew up, went to college, married and had families of their own, there became time for writing. Wanting to know if she was good enough to write seriously, she attended many classes and joined a local writers group. During a luncheon, Terry Kay told her \"All words are the same. It's how you use them that makes the difference\". He also advised her to write something that wasn't personal. Her first (2003) published novel, Heaven-High and Hell-deep, resonates with Peggy's unique strong voice and storytelling ability. Always resourceful, Peggy decided she would not only write books, but she'd make and market them herself. Consequently, every book is uniquely hers: she writes the stories, paints the cover picture, then prints and binds each one at her farm. Whether from her experiences, shared stories, or from the spirits of the past; characters keep evolving in Peggy's imagination. Then they nag her until she relates their story. Often she is working on seven or eight novels simultaneously, completing one for the character that becomes the most persistent. They just have to deal with Peggy casting their stories in her beloved mountains.", "related": ["B00IQ3094A"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The debate now wrestles with some fourteen or so\nvolumes and counting, and mainly revolves around publication order versus\ninternal-chronological order. I favor internal chronological, with a few\ncaveats. I have always resisted numbering my volumes; partly because,\nin the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because\nif I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately\nwithCaptain Vorpatril's Alliance) it would upwhack the numbering\nsystem. Nevertheless, the books and stories do have a chronological order, if\nnot a strict one. It was always my intention to write each book as a\nstand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with\nthat book that's in your handright now, don't put it back on the shelf!\nWhile still somewhat true, as the series developed it acquired a number of\nsub-arcs, closely related tales that were richer for each other. I will list the\nsub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats. Shards of HonorandBarrayar.The first two\nbooks in the series proper, they detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of\nBeta Colony and Aral Vorkosigan of Barrayar.Shardswas my very first\nnovel ever;Barrayarwas actually my eighth, but continues the tale the\nnext day after the end ofShards. For readers who want to be sure of\nbeginning at the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these\ntwo. The Warrior's ApprenticeandThe Vor Game(with, perhaps, the novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" tucked in between.)The\nWarrior's Apprenticeintroduces the character who became the series' linchpin,\nMiles Vorkosigan; the first book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet\nby accident; the second how he fixed his mistakes from the first round. Space\nopera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things one can best\ndiscover for oneself),The Warrior's Apprenticemakes another good place\nto jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male protagonist. After that:Brothers in Armsshould be read beforeMirror\nDance, and both, ideally, beforeMemory. Komarrmakes another good alternate entry point for\nthe series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read\nbeforeA Civil Campaign. Borders of Infinity, a collection of three of the\nfive currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure\nsampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit\nthemselves to length. (But it may make more sense if read afterThe Warrior's\nApprentice.) Take care not to confuse the collection-as-a-whole with its\ntitle story, \"The Borders of Infinity\". Falling Freetakes place 200\nyears earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with\nthe main body of the series. Most readers recommend picking up this story\nlater. It should likely be read beforeDiplomatic Immunity, however,\nwhich revisits the \"quaddies\", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in\nMiles's time. The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear\nin italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words\nand 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.  Falling FreeShards of HonorBarrayarThe Warrior's Apprentice\"The Mountains of Mourning\"\"Weatherman\"The Vor GameCetagandaEthan of AthosBorders of Infinity\"Labyrinth\"\"The Borders of Infinity\"Brothers in ArmsMirror DanceMemoryKomarrA Civil Campaign\"Winterfair Gifts\"Diplomatic ImmunityCaptain Vorpatril's AllianceCryoBurn  Caveats: The novella \"Weatherman\" is an\nout-take from the beginning of the novelThe Vor Game. If you already\nhaveThe Vor Game, you likely don't need this. The original 'novel'Borders of\nInfinitywas a fix-up collection containing the three novellas \"The\nMountains of Mourning\", \"Labyrinth\", and \"The Borders of Infinity\", together\nwith a frame story to tie the pieces together. Again, beware duplication. The\nframe story does not stand alone, and mainly is of interest to completists.  The Fantasy Novels My fantasy novels are a bit easier\nto order. Easiest of all isThe Spirit Ring, which is a stand-alone, or\naquel, as some wag once dubbed books that for some obscure reason failed to\nspawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are the four volumes ofThe Sharing\nKnife--in order,Beguilement,Legacy,Passage, andHorizon--which\nI broke down and actually numbered, as this was one continuous tale divided\ninto non-wrist-breaking chunks. What have come to be called the\nChalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written,\nlike the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and\ncan in theory be read in any order. (The third book actually takes place a few\nhundred years prior to the more closely connected first two.) Some readers\nthink the world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in\npublication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the\nfirst (but not the third.) In any case, the publication order is: The Curse of ChalionPaladin of SoulsThe Hallowed Hunt  The short story collectionProto\nZoawas an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three\n(1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but\nnot in this handy format. The novelette \"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" may be of\ninterest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is the first story in which that proto-universe\nbegan, mentioning Beta Colony but before Barrayar was even thought of. My latest original e-edition isSidelines: Talks and Essays, which is\njust what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of my nonfiction\nwritings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions,\nand some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove an interesting companion\npiece to my fiction. Happy reading!  -- Lois McMaster Bujold.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So to beat her to the punch and, in essence, to turn chagrin into pride, I'll share it myself.  In my wee tender years, prior to kindergarten, my mother sat on the living room floor playing a game with one of my brothers. The game required reading and this was a talent I had yet to master. When told I couldn't play I threw myself back against the wall in a fit of despair, slid down to the floor and said, \"See what wonderful things you can do when you know how to read?\"  Seriously. In all honesty, I do vaguely remember this, so I know she's not making it up.  As a five-year-old I already recognized the value of such knowledge, and every day since I gained the precious ability to read I've done so with avid hunger. When other kids played that silly mash game (you know the one, with the spiral and the cars and the boys) and declared their future professions would be as a lawyer, doctor, teacher or firefighter, I wanted to be an author. Forget needles and numbers. Forget corporate America.  Reading and writing will be a passion with me until my dying day.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I loved it! The chemistry between Taylor and Max is enough to burn down a building, and the secondary characters added life and pizzazz to a story that's already hot! From the cranky landlady and two feisty dogs to Taylor's twin sister and Max's uptight uncles, Male Wanted is populated with the most bewitching (and hair-raising) characters I've met in a long time. Betty Jo Schuler has a definite knack for romantic comedy, and I'll be eagerly watching for more from this author.--Sally Laturi, Ivy Quill ReviewsMale Wanted by Betty Jo Schuler is a refreshing taste of romance and comedy all wrapped in one beautiful gift of love. This is one romantic tale you won't want to miss. Taylor and Max are determined to avoid love at all costs but find themselves irresistibly drawn to one another. Warning! If you begin Male Wanted, you won't be able to put it down. It's a fabulous read!~ Kim Gaona, Kim's ReviewsTaylor Gayle is going for her degree by living a life proving clothes make the man or woman. Fully fitting into the required look involves Taylor finding a man for social functions. Placing a personal ad seems to be her best course of action. Taylor's subsequent trip to The Town Crier leads her to the very handsome Max Stuart. Max, filling in for his sister Penny, doesn't quite have the knack of The Crier but nonetheless is eager to serve. Taylor's look doesn't have to compete with her fraternal twin Dani when it comes to catching Max's attention. Will her ad do the trick or will her priorities change? Male Wanted is humorous, sweet, and full of good fun. You'll like it.

Their mother Candy was a B-rated actress who is broke and living with Zara.  They both want to get their mother a place of her own so she won't have to live with either one of them, and Zara has the perfect solution.  Zara negotiated a two million dollar deal for a prop ray gun that was used in one of Candy's movies, but she is in Australia and the deal has to be done today, so Emma reluctantly agrees to be Zara, meet the man and do the deal. Emma, dressed as her sister, goes to Zara's office to retrieve the gun but a client is waiting.  Emma tries to get rid of him, but he refuses to be put off.

Dosse, a French professor of history, traces these lines of influence, placing the pair's work firmly in the context of the May 1968 student uprising, and both authors' strained relationships with a megalomaniacal Lacan. The intellectual background of each writer is examined: Deleuze's texts on Bergson, Nietzsche, and Spinoza, and Guattari's work as director of a psychiatric unit outside of Paris where distinctions between patient and doctor were obliterated. The author strives to re-establish Guattari as an integral collaborator, one whose contribution was overshadowed in later years by Deleuze's celebrity. However, despite the wealth of research, the author too often resorts to paraphrases of their writings, and the book would have been well served by judicious editing. Nonetheless, as a glimpse into a remarkable period in French intellectual history where politics, philosophy, and literary brilliance coalesced, it is captivating.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dr. Bryant Raleigh comes to a clinic in Flint Hills, Kans., to study and treat women with multiple personality disorders. His brother David, a journalist with a taste for the macabre, accompanies him to write a book about the project--and perhaps to begin to surmount the effects of his wife's suicide. The clinic, run by Dr. Russell Guerin, turns out to be a strange place indeed: Guerin's mysterious wife, confined to her room for years and grown disgustingly obese, rules over it as an unseen, frightening monarch; their hemophiliac son is a morose and brooding presence. Moreover, the patients are killing themselves one by one for no discernible reason. Epperson strains credulity by providing every character (except for the blue parrot who needs a daily dose of Oprah! ) with a secret trauma in his or her past and by introducing a weird, wildly gratuitous blood ritual as a plot element. As horror novels go, however, this is an intriguing and mesmerizing addition to the genre.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B006LAX1VS"], "rank": 701419, "title": "Nightmare", "author": "S.K.

He obtained a bachelor’s degree in finance from Southwest Missouri State University.  However, shortly after launching what had started out to be a successful career, Robert was stricken with a mysterious and debilitating health challenge.     The condition impacted the nervous system and was quite debilitating.  Though doctor shopping and experimenting with medicines and therapies became a full time endeavor, none of them resulted in lasting or significant improvement.   Over several years, Robert became a researcher in his own right.  Since medicines were obviously not the answer, he focused on natural therapies and practices, such as acupuncture, herbology, yoga, meditation, breath work, chi kung, and other Taoist practices.   The journey, eventually lead to living in India on two occasions for a total of about three years.  There, Robert continued his studies and practice of Eastern philosophies, practice and medical therapies, including ayurvedic and Tibetan medicine, acupuncture and body work.    The journey continued and resulted in living in SE Asia, where Robert regularly spent lengthy stays at Buddhist temples, where he practiced vipassana or insight meditation. Along  this journey,  Robert had the opportunity to study or spend time in the presence of some extraordinary Healers and Teachers.  Some of whom are revered in their respective country.  One such person was an 86-year-old Tibetan monk, whom had been the personal physician of The Dalai Lama.  The list goes  on…... It was this eclectic background of research and experience that eventually lead to the book Why You Suck at Weight Loss.", "related": ["B009EB6VV8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has written several children’s books, all placing on Kindle’s Best Seller top 10 list for school-age children.  \"Peyton Penguin Prefers Peas\" was written for her  oldest daughter, Peyton. In this revised edition, professional illustrations were created by Richie Williams using Peyton's original drawings. This adorable book has a cute rhyming structure that is easy to memorize, and young kids love hearing it over and over. The story details a picky eater who needs to try new foods. It's super if you have a child who doesn't like to experiment with different things. Tammy's second book, \"Kendall Macaw Loves Her Ma\" depicts a baby bird who needs to leave the nest and start preschool. This book, named after her second daughter, shows the perspective of a Mom’s separation anxiety as well as the child’s need to branch out. Professional, water-painted illustrations are beautifully depicted in this rhyming story. As a Bonus, there are 7 pages of black and white illustrations throughout the pages that the child can color in to truly personalize it and make it their own. Tammy also writes Christian short stories in a series called the Little Luke Series.   She also likes writing for adults and her book, \"Kids, Summer and a Shoestring Budget\"  has been a successful Kindle book to help parents and care-givers save money when the kids are out of school. Previously ranked #1 on Kindle’s best seller rank for Parenting, this book can save you thousands of dollars every year if you follow the author’s tips. Tammy is blessed to have a wonderful husband and two healthy beautiful daughters. When she is not carting them to travel soccer games, karate, school, or church, she spends time writing and reading or going boating.  Tammy has enjoyed living in Palm Beach County for over 12 years, but is originally from the Carolinas. Though she misses the changing seasons almost as much as her family who still live in Charlotte, she  loves the beaches, warm weather and the ocean.  Tammy’s favorite saying is, “God is Good!”", "related": ["B00GXKJEQ2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 3.9, "rating_total": 39.0}

That was what Pippa told her security detail anyway. She knew the truth. She was running from memories. Memories and the possibility that there was only one man for her and he was the one man she couldn't have.\"Stop it,\" she told herself, staring at the empty beach in front of her. Azure waves dappled onto white sands. By noon, there would be quite a few more bodies enjoying the beach. At six in the morning, however, she was the only one around. She debated turning on some music via her smartphone. She usually welcomed the noise, hoping it would drown out some of her thoughts. Today, she was searching for a little peace. Maybe the sound of the waves would help, she thought, and started out.One foot in front of the other, she ran for two minutes, then walked for three. It was called interval training and the different paces suited her. Pippa had never been athletic. From the time she'd learned to read, she'd always been happiest with her nose stuck in a book. Her nanny had been relieved because her brothers and most of her sisters had been more demanding in one way or another.Running again, she inhaled the scent of the salt air. The humidity was low today and she could feel the moisture on her skin begin to evaporate. Slowing after three minutes of running, she took a swig of her water and trudged onward.Along the shore, in the distance, she spotted a long figure walking. She would wave and be friendly. Pippa was a royal and Chantaine royals were not allowed to be snooty. Other runners might be able to put their blinders and zip past everyone in their path, but not a Devereaux.As she drew closer, she saw that the figure was that of a woman. Short white hair crowned her head, and a sundress that resembled a nightgown covered her petite frame.Pippa nodded. \"Good morning,\" she said.The woman looked away and stumbled.Curious, Pippa vacillated as to whether to approach her. Perhaps she was longing for solitude just as Pippa was. The woman stumbled again and Pippa felt a twist of concern. She walked toward the woman. \"Pardon me, may I help you?\"The woman shook her head. \"No, no. I'm fine. It's so beautiful here,\" she said in a lilting voice that contrasted with the lines on her face and the frailness of her frame.Something about her seemed familiar, but Pippa couldn't quite identify it. The woman stumbled again, and Pippa's concern grew. Was she ill?\"Yes, the beach is lovely. Are you sure I can't help you? I could walk you back to where you started,\" she said. \"Or perhaps you would like some water.\"The woman's face crumpled. \"No, no. Please don't make me go back. Please don't—\" She broke off and collapsed right in front of Pippa.Alarm shot through her. \"Oh, my God!\" she exclaimed and bent over the woman. This wasonetime when she would have loved to have had her security detail close by. Pippa put her arms around the woman and lifted her, surprised by her light weight. Glancing around, she pulled her toward a small stand of palm trees.Frantic, she held the woman and gently shook her. \"Please. Miss. Please.\" She spilled water from her bottle onto one of her hands and gently patted the woman's face. \"Please wake up. Please.\"Terrified that the woman was dying, she reached for her cell phone. The woman clearly needed emergency medical attention. Just as she put her finger over the speed dial for her security, the woman blinked her eyes. Huge and full of emotion, her eyes captivated Pippa.She held her breath. \"Are you all right? Please take a few sips of my water. It's clearly too hot out here for you. I'll call for help and—\"\"No,\" the woman said with a strength that surprised Pippa. \"Please don't do that.\" Then the woman closed her amazing, mesermizing eyes and began to sob.The sound wrenched at Pippa. \"You must let me help you.\"\"There's only one thing I want,\" she said and met Pippa's gaze again. \"I just want to die in Chantaine.\"Pippa gasped. Then a lightning flash of realization rocked through her. She looked at the woman and saw the resemblance of Nic in her eyes. His bone structure was a stronger, more masculine version, but his eyes were all Amelie. \"Amelie,\" she whispered. \"You're Amelie Lafitte.\"The woman reluctantly nodded. \"How do you know?\"\"I know your son Nic.\" Pippa also knew that Amelie was in the final stages of cancer. Her time was drawing painfully close.Amelie looked away. \"I just wanted a little walk on the beach. I bet he's quite peeved that I left the yacht.\"Peeved wasn't the word that came to Pippa's mind. \"I'll call him for you,\" she said.\"Then all my fun will be over,\" she said with a cute pout. \"He's such a worrywart.\"Stunned at how quickly Amelie's spirit had returned, she hesitated a half beat, then dialed his cell. Despite the fact that she'd deleted it from her phone records months ago, every digit was engraved on her brain.Five minutes later, a black Mercedes came to screeching halt on the curb of the road above the beach. Pippa immediately identified the dark figure exiting the driver's side of the vehicle. Nic. As he strode swiftly toward her and Amelie, she could see the tension in his frame. Seeing him after all these months set off a visceral response inside her. Her stomach clenched. Her heart beat unevenly.\"Hi, darling,\" Amelie said, remaining seated on the sand under the tree as she sipped Pippa's water. Pippa was still surprised at how quickly the woman had recovered after fainting. \"Sorry to be a bother, but I woke up early and I just couldn't resist the chance to go for a walk on the beach.\"\"I would have been happy to walk with you,\" Nic said and turned to Pippa. What she wouldn't give to get a peek behind his dark sunglasses. \"Thank you for calling me. I'll take her back to the yacht now and you can continue your run. I didn't know you were a runner.\"She felt her face heat with self-consciousness. \"I'm more of a combination walker and runner.\"He nodded and glanced back at his mother. \"Dad's beside himself with worry. It was all I could do to keep him from tearing after you.\"\"Paul can't hobble with crutches let alone tear after me with that broken foot of his. The doctor said it will be ten more weeks before he can put any weight on it at all,\" she said, then turned her head thoughtfully to the side. \"You know what I'm in the mood for? Crepes. There used to be a wonderful cafe on the edge of town. They made the most delicious crepes.\"\"Bebe's on Oleander,\" Pippa said. \"It's still there, and Bebe's granddaughter helps makes the crepes.\"\"Oh,\" Amelie said, clasping her hands together. \"It's still there. We must go. And we can bring one back for Paul.\" She turned to Pippa. \"You must come, too.\"Pippa blinked at the invitation and slid a quick helpless glance at Nic.\"Mother, do you know who Pippa is?\" he asked as he extended his hand to help her rise to her feet.Amelie studied her for a long moment and frowned. \"She looks a bit familiar. I can't quite.\" Her eyes widened. \"Oh, dear. You're a Devereaux. I can see it in your eyes and your chin. Oh, dear. This could get a bit messy.\"\"Just a little,\" Nic said in a wry tone. \"But let's give her the choice. Would you like to join us for crepes, Your Highness?\"Pippa heard the hint of goading challenge in Nic's voice. She'd heard it before, but it seemed to hold more of an edge than ever. The truth was she didn't want her photo taken with Nic and his mother. To say it could cause problems was a huge understatement.\"That's okay,\" he said before she could respond. \"Thanks again for looking out for my mother. Ci—\"\"I'm coming,\" Pippa said impulsively. \"Unless you're rescinding the invitation,\" she tossed back at him in her own challenging voice.He paused a half beat and tilted his head as if she'd taken him off guard. The possibility thrilled her. \"Not at all. Would you like to ride with us in my vehicle?\"\"Thank you, but no. I'll drive myself and meet you in about fifteen minutes,\" Pippa said and turned her gaze to Amelie. \"I'll see you soon. Please drink some more fluids.\"\"Thank you, darling. Isn't she delightful?\" she said to Nic. \"She fusses just like you do.\"\"Yes,\" he said in a dry tone. \"Delightful.\"Fifteen minutes later as Pippa put a ball cap on her head and adjusted her large pair of sunglasses, she wondered if she'd lost her mind agreeing to join Nic and his mother, the notorious Amelie, for crepes. Glancing in the rearview mirror, she could easily imagine the horror on the face of the royal advisers. Running on the beach at 6:00 a.m. in her current state was one thing, but walking into a public place of business was quite another. She thought of Nic's goading attitude and made a face at the mirror. Well, she couldn't back down now. Stepping from her car, she could only hope she wouldn't be recognized.Because she'd spent far less time in the public eye than her siblings, that was on her side. Her hair, however, was very distinctive and not in a good way. Wavy and brown with a tendency to frizz, she hoped she'd concealed it adequately by pulling it back in a ponytail and covering it with a cap.She walked into the old but elegant eating establishment that featured every kind of crepe one could imagine. As soon as she stepped inside, she spotted Amelie, who also saw her and lifted her hand in a wave. Nic, sitting opposite Amelia, turned his head around to look at her and also waved. His gaze said he was surprised she'd shown up,...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cohen (Belle de Seigneur) begins his memoirs almost reluctantly, telling himself to \"whistle softly to imagine things are not all that bad, and above all smile.\" The resulting portrait is of a passionately devoted mother who sold her jewels for her son's spending-money, but also of an outcast, a \"timid child with her over-plump face pressed hungrily against the window of the cake shop of social life.\" Cohen is by turns reverential (she was \"a true saint\"), embarrassed (\"So awkward, poor darling\") and self-pitying (\"God loves me so little that I am ashamed for Him\"). Although his attitudes toward his dead mother are complex, descriptions of her inner life dwell cartoonishly on motherly devotion: \"Like a good and faithful dog, she accepted her humble fate, which was to wait, alone in my flat and sewing for me.\" In this intensely public forum, Cohen seems to be coming to grips with his mother's death through all the typical stages of mourning?numbness, denial, anger, guilt?with pen in hand. Although this process is not without its bouts of melodrama (\"O Maman, my youth that is no more!\"), other outbursts powerfully reflect a disgust with mortality and a baffled sense of abandonment. Certain phrases (\"My mother's love,\" \"Nevermore\") are repeated like incantations, or because, Cohen, says, \"that is what ruminating grief is like, its jaws weakly in perpetual motion.\" This is a heartbreaking little volume, worth reading twice.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I do think however that references to music, phrases and other things\nfrom 'old Earth' were too many and put me in the present instead of up in\nthe stars.

Born in Massachusetts and educated at Fisk, Harvard, and the University of Berlin, Du Bois penned his epochal masterpiece,The Souls of Black Folk, in 1903. It remains his most studied and popular work; its insights into Negro life at the turn of the 20th century still ring true.With a dash of the Victorian and Enlightenment influences that peppered his impassioned yet formal prose, the book's largely autobiographical chapters take the reader through the momentous and moody maze of Afro-American life after the Emancipation Proclamation: from poverty, the neoslavery of the sharecropper, illiteracy, miseducation, and lynching, to the heights of humanity reached by the spiritual \"sorrow songs\" that birthed gospel and the blues. The most memorable passages are contained in \"On Booker T. Washington and Others,\" where Du Bois criticizes his famous contemporary's rejection of higher education and accommodationist stance toward white racism: \"Mr. Washington's programme practically accepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races,\" he writes, further complaining that Washington's thinking \"withdraws many of the high demands of Negroes as men and American citizens.\" The capstone ofThe Souls of Black Folk, though, is Du Bois' haunting, eloquent description of the concept of the black psyche's \"double consciousness,\" which he described as \"a peculiar sensation.... One ever feels this twoness--an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\" Thanks to W.E.B.

Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in 1804 in the city of Salem, Massachusetts to Nathaniel Hathorne and the former Elizabeth Clarke Manning. His ancestors include John Hathorne, the only judge involved in the Salem witch trials who never repented of his actions. Nathaniel later added a \"w\" to make his name \"Hawthorne\" in order to hide this relation. He entered Bowdoin College in 1821, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1824, and graduated in 1825. Hawthorne anonymously published his first work, a novel titled Fanshawe, in 1828. He published several short stories in various periodicals which he collected in 1837 as Twice-Told Tales. The next year, he became engaged to Sophia Peabody. He worked at a Custom Houseand joined Brook Farm, a transcendentalist community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem, the Berkshires, then to The Wayside in Concord. The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to The Wayside in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, and was survived by his wife and their three children. -wikipedia", "related": ["B0082Z1FCC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ordinary people, but with extraordinary qualities that makes their story worth telling. With splashes of sometimes black humour or simple satire, his stories can develop from the simplistic to the complex and back again leaving the reader to decide if it is time to laugh or cry. Or both. Born in Australia, but now living in Switzerland with his wife and a black cocker spaniel, his stories cross a wide geographical range but often draw from elements of his life and experiences in the two countries he calls home. From the rugged, dry and hot desert country of Australia and its crowded cities to the cafés of Europe and the peaks of the Swiss Alps. The hustle and bustle of Sydney to the quiet life of the Swiss countryside. When not writing, he is usually doing what he equally enjoys.

A Tale of Two Journeystells the story of a\nmysterious illness that stumped a parade of doctors, and the newfound\ndiscipline of writing that became the unexpected by-product of years of\nmisdiagnoses. After simultaneously running a mortgage company, seeing over two\ndozen physicians, writing five novels and self-publishing one,Once Upon a Lymewas a story I felt I had to tell. The book chronicles the search for an\nanswer to my far-flung roster of symptoms and the creative outlet I chose in\ncase I became bedridden.Not having the luxury of a plausible diagnosis or\nthe ability to suspend my life until one was found, I kept going, doing my\nbest to ignore the growing list of debilitating maladies. Though I tried to\navoid it, my deteriorating health would force me back into the medical arena--time\nafter fruitless time--where I was diagnosed with everything from Ankylosing\nSpondylitis to Restless Leg Syndrome.It took nine years from the onset of my symptoms to\nlearn the name of my nemesis. Because the diagnosis was so long in coming, I\nnow had late-stage Lyme, which is next to impossible to cure. My only hope at\nthat point was going the \"alternative\" route, which required leaving normal and\ntaking a huge leap of faith, resorting to methods that are part new-age, part\nmedieval. I would soon learn getting the correct diagnosis was only half the\nbattle.Throughout my struggles, three things saved me from\ncomplete despair: an overabundance of willpower, an appreciation of the absurd,\nand writing. My experiences during that time make for a candid, comic and\nsometimes harrowing look at what I endured at the hands of medical\nprofessionals. What I got for my trouble was a craft that has allowed me to\nchannel my overactive imagination into writing books, which is now my sole occupation--besides\nfighting Lyme.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His father, a renowned and outspoken liberal rabbi, had been expelled by the regime.  He began his own professional life as a rabbi serving, along with his father, a thousand-family independent synagogue in Newark NJ.  Active in civil rights, he was a founder and Board Vice President of the first Community Action Anti-Poverty program funded by the 1964 Equal Opportunity Act.  Leaving the pulpit in 1968, he moved to New York with the hope of entering government service and politics.  Robert Kennedy's assassination effectively put an end to those plans. Over much of the next decade he served as a communications executive on Wall Street.  That led to a thirty-year career in corporate and brand identity.  As President of The Schechter Group, his work focused largely on the consumer brands of Fortune 500 clients.  He led the team that created branding for diet Coke, the most successful new product launch ever.  Some years after he and his partners sold their firm to the Omnicom Group he established his own branding practice, this time working primarily with small companies, startups and non-profits. Transcenders: Living beyond religion and the religion wars reflects Prinz' own journey from the pulpit to living a life beyond religion.  In exploring a subject that impacts on the lives of 60 Million Americans including one third of today's Millennials, he seeks to help them and others gain a better understanding of what it means to be a transcender in the 21st Century.  Beyond working on a new book, he regularly writes a blog: Beyond All That commenting on current affairs, religion and politics.  After many years in New York City, he now lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.  Outside of work, he pursues his passion for art, music and cooking.  He has two grown sons.", "related": [], "rank": 641078, "title": "Transcenders: Living beyond religion and the religion wars.", "author": "Jonathan J.

Over time that term has often been used derisively, though sometimes lovingly. I use space opera to denote a particular type of science fiction that I read as a youth; works penned by such old masters as Arthur C. Clarke, Issac Asimov, L. Sprague de Camp, Robert Heinlein and E.E. \"Doc\" Smith. Smith in particular defined this genre for me with his Skylark of Space series, the first novels I recall purchasing for my own reading pleasure.Many, though certainly not all, of the novels from these giants of SF started on Earth, more or less in the present day. Not long ago, in a galaxy far, far away; not star-date 24-something-or-other; but in the here and now. That is what hooked me on Smith's first Skylark novel--the heroes were contemporary human beings that, through their own intelligence and effort, managed to construct a spaceship and blast off into the Galaxy on an amazing adventure. In short, the reader could imagine such a thing happening to them.Few books are written like that anymore. Most seem set in a distant future and the ones that are set in the near term are usually dark, gloomy portrayals of post industrial dystopias. What a bummer. So here is my modest attempt at an old fashioned space adventure, an adventure that anyone could find themselves in the midst of with a little luck. The science within is either based on present knowledge or is possible without violating current understanding. The boundaries are stretched a bit, after all this is a work of science fiction.", "related": ["B00LDCER4E"], "rank": 895148, "title": "Parker's Folly (The T'aafhal Inheritance Book 1) eBook", "author": "Doug Hoffman", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 4.375, "rating_total": 70.0}

A glossary of key terminology and an index to subject matter is included. But this is no ordinary textbook. In the words of the author, Richard Nelson-Jones, this is a 'personal journey'. This book provides an extensive, nuanced look at most of the major individual approaches to counselling and therapy to date, with all their limitations and possibilities'- PsycCRITIQUES: APA Review of Books`Richard Nelson Jones' updated edition of his compendium of 16 approaches to counselling and therapy remains a clear, concise and informative aid to both counselling trainees, practitioners of counselling skills and those who wish to gain an overview of the principles and practices most common to the therapeutic world…. [F]or anyone wanting to gain a clear idea, in a nutshell, of one or more of the main approaches, this book is invaluable' -Therapy Today'An excellent summary of Rogers' life and work and of the latest developments in person-centred therapy'- Professor Brian Thorne, Co-founder of The Norwich Centre, NorwichFrom reviews of the Third Edition:`Richard Nelson-Jones' book has become so much a part of the counselling theory literature; it is hard to imagine discussing the topic without reference to it. ThisThird Editiongives testimony to its continued value. It is hard to fault this book, its readability and detailed referencing, alone, will mean that it will suit a wide readership. If you have to buy only one book on counselling and therapy, this is it' -Professor Philip Burnard, Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing`Richard Nelson-Jones takes this complex subject and explains the whys and hows of each different type of therapy about as well as it can be done. There is no better introduction' -Amazon Review`This book will be useful to the student, one book to cover all the course topics; to the practicing counsellor, to improve their work and to the lecturer, who wants to learn how to explain theories simply to their students. Richard Nelson-Jones writes in a way that makes it hard to put down, a compliment more often associated with fictional rather than academic books. Do not worry about the price it will save you buying three other similar books' -Amazon Review`The complexity of Jung's metapsychology is made accessible to the interested reader' -Ann Casement, Jungian Psychoanalyst`Excellent summary of Rogers's life and work.

Simpson (classics and philosophy, CUNY) has produced a fresh and lively translation that is perhaps more logically ordered. He makes a strong case for rearranging the standard order of the books of the Politics to provide a sequence more in keeping with Aristotle's intentions, positioning Books 7 and 8 to follow Book 3. The text begins with a translation of Book 10, Chapter 9 of the Nicomachean Ethics, which Simpson argues is a precursor to the Politics. A comparison with standard translations, such as those of Jowett and Barker, indicates that Simpson put much effort into this version and clarified a number of points that earlier translations left unclear.

Moffat, MD, MSc, \nFRCSC General SurgeonFrom General Surgery Matters, Winter 2013:Dr.\n Paul Hardy has done something really special with his second novel. \nReintroducing us to our favourite fictional surgeon Dr. Jim Smythe, this\n time taking us to a younger Smythe, sitting at this kitchen table \npondering the letter he is about to open. The letter that will contain \nthe reply to his application for surgical residency. Seasoned \npractitioners will recognize the classic disease presentations that \nunfold as the story is told, and new trainees may even learn the answers\n to some favourite Royal College exam questions. The non-medical readers\n will enjoy the story and enjoy the window into medical practice and \nsurgical training in particular. Like his first novel \"Surgical Heights\"\n Hardy weaves a realistic take on the practice of medicine (and acute \nsurgery in particular) in and out of the story he tells. True to form \nHardy once again carries us along to a suspenseful climax, and manages \nto throw in a twist at the end that I never saw coming. All essentials \nof a great read and fine novel. Everyone will enjoy this story. Surgeons\n will inevitably find themselves matching their wits and acumen with the\n protagonists in the tough cases that come along. Hardy has given us two\n Jim Smythe novels. I hope he has the inclination and time to make this \nseries a trilogy. Great read, exciting medicine, compelling story. Just \nwhat the doctor ordered. Note of caution though - I started this book on\n a Friday evening and couldn't put it down until I read the whole thing.\n - Ralph George", "related": ["B00JNK5PTO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I joined the Royal Navy straight from school, did four years at engineering college and then went to sea for three years in destroyers. I took a commission after that and joined the Fleet Air Arm as a helicopter pilot. I was married, had two kids and now have four grandchildren and one great grandson. I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": ["B00BDBZ7XA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Popping, Poplocking and Bopping, I had two groups that were known back in the day The Bionic Boogaloo's and The Masters of Illusions we performed in many contests, talent shows, local clubs and Malls etc, we were from the South Bay area of Carson, ca, this dance has had many innovations and changes since it's conception which dates back to the late 1960's until today, I have written a couple of books but in two different genre's so I won't go into that here. This dance has finally gotten recognition on the same level playing field as ballet and modern dance in the eyes of some, it's been a longtime coming, I know my book is one of the first of it's kind I say that because there's a book and a movie coming out soon from Kenny Ortega \" The Underground Dance Masters\" The History of a forgotten Era, both of our book project's are just as valuable to the people as it pertains to history and information that will help for years to come and fill in many gaps and misconceptions regarding it's origins and it's credibility, my interests are writing, martial arts, and of course dancing, I guess you can say I was born to tell this story and deliver it to the people of the world like the movie the book of Eli.

He has lost most of his original stories, typed or handwritten, in the numerous moves he has made from his hometown of Fraser, Michigan to Northern Michigan, to Las Vegas and back to Fraser, where he now lives. Moats became one of the causalities of unemployment in 2009, and had time on his hands to finally pursue a life long dream of writing a full blown crime novel. Thus was born the first book, \"Classmate Murders\".  What followed was a series of books starting with \"The Classmate Murders\" which introduces the main character, Jim Richards, who has to admit he has become a senior citizen, reluctantly. Richards, one day, receives an email from a childhood sweetheart asking for his help, but by the time he reaches her, she has been murdered. His life turns around and he is pulled into numerous murders of women from his high school who he hasn't seen in forty years. Along with a friend of his, Buck, a big, mustached biker, they go off to track down the killer before he can get to one former classmate, Penny Wickens, a TV talk show host who Jim has just fallen for while protecting her. The killer is also murdering the women right out from under police protection, driving homicide detective Will Trapper crazy, and he slowly depends on Jim to help. There's humor, suspense, wild chases across suburban Detroit with cops, classic cars and motorcycle clubs; murder, mayhem, a good amount of romance and a twist ending.", "related": ["B005M3IN72"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 25.0}

Returning\nhome to ask for her hand in marriage, they're both terrified when\nConor's shapeshifting secret was discovered and a mob greeted them at\nher doorstep. Star-crossed, unknowing fear and an accident cuts short\ntheir potential life together. In the present day, Trinity lives out in\nher grandparent's old cabin in the woods. One afternoon when she's\nattacked by a bear, a silver wolf rescues her. Conor only has this one\nlast shot to right the wrongs done to them, and he hopes to show\nTrinity/Maddie just how much he loves her.A really interesting\nstory, this is quite a different take on your average werewolf/shape\nchanger kind of story. With a dash of angst and plenty of twists the\nauthor takes you on a wild ride full of adventure and passionate\nromance. The is plenty of unresolved sexual tension, but not a lot of\nexplicit romance in this book - so those wanting to only dabble on the\nspicier side may find this a wonderful place to start. There were a few\nsub-plots that, while they felt a little tacked on, definitely added a\ndepth and more dimension to Conor and Trinity's reuniting. This short\nstory was definitely a unique look on not just a tale of lovers finding\ntheir right time and place, but also the mythology of werewolves.A fun and different read, this short story is definitely worth reading. -LAS Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A few\nyears into the actual writing of it, I realized the story had potential\nto be something very different from its beginnings.  While I enjoyed\nwriting medieval fantasy, my muse nagged me to paint a larger canvas for\n the characters' intertwining stories.  The story I longed to tell\ncouldn't be told in just one world, and I wasn't wholly comfortable\ndoing so.  I struggled with the idea of genre-blending for quite a\nwhile, and then, the notion of Shifting Worlds popped into my head like a\n neurological Big Bang.The Shifting Worlds universe is a blended\n setting for readers of medieval fantasy and readers of soft science\nfiction.  Each book in the first trilogy is set in the Shifting Worlds\nUniverse.  The first book takes place in an Earth-like medieval fantasy\nenvironment.  The other books in the trilogy are set on multiple worlds, each with its own special flavor and degree of social evolution.If you enjoy readingEntrapments, please consider leaving a review here for others to read.Thanks for stopping by!Morgen Rich", "related": ["B00LJAYUTW"], "rank": 22559, "title": "Incorrigible", "author": "Morgen Rich", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her father was always saying she was making up the craziest stories. Most remained unwritten though as writing wasn't Dakota's strong suit. That all changed in junior high when she took her first typing class. Problem solved for the dyslexic Dakota. There was no stopping her after that. She wrote her first novel her freshman year about a girl who could speak to animals on an old electric IBM typewriter and never looked back. Writing in several different genres, she is now a published author with multiple books under belt. When Dakota isn't writing she's a crazy mom of three wild Indians who are posing as children, a loving wife to the man of her dreams and a full time student.

Barton is the author of several fast-paced mystery and thriller series, featuring lively characters and lots of action. \"Miz Scarlet\" (Scarlet Wilson Mystery series) is a teacher-turned-innkeeper, who throws herself into danger with a feisty determination to make things right, relying on cohorts like \"Captain Peacock\" and \"Colonel Grey Poupon\" to help her solve the clues. Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans.

You make a deal, of course! A\nhilarious, outrageous and truly fun deal that involves you placing a\npersonal ad to get out of your own rut. As Henry's heart-to-heart with\nhis son spirals into a conversation about his own life, Beate Boeker\ndoes a great job of showing how a father and son come back to life after\n the death of their wife and mother. Mischief in Italy is the perfect\ntitle because it is filled with mischief, and lies and secrets, and a\nbeautiful house at Lake Garda. Henry wants to avoid a gold-digger and\nJosh seems intent on only going after gold-diggers. Nevertheless, they\nmake a deal and hilarity ensues.Mischief in Italy is told from the point of view of several different\ncharacters -- some important and some not so important -- which produces a\n truly great and well-rounded story. Not only do you get to know plenty\nof different characters, but you pick up little tidbits that make the\nstory even funnier as it progresses. Beate Boeker has written a\nhilarious story of love, miscommunication, and secrets. Plus, you can't\nreally go wrong with a companionship ad that begins with \"old geezer\nwith no hair on his head but plenty on his back,\" especially when the\nold geezer gets more than one reply! The story, above all else, is\ntremendously witty with a lot of action but it isn't fast-paced. In\nfact, it feels like a relaxing boat ride on Lake Garda.Reviewed by Natasha Jackson for Readers' Favorite", "related": ["B00CV9QJ1M"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.4286, "rating_total": 31.0}

He read History at Oxford University (Mansfield College) where he was a scholar and after a Masters degree at Oxford, completed a PhD from the University of Southampton.

It is very well laid out, well written, concise, and covers a great deal of ground with a combination of erudition and self-assured elegance. The arguments are well-made and substantiated.(Stephen Quilley, Department of Environment and Resource Studies, University of Waterloo)This is a very welcome contribution to the public debate on climate change and peak oil. It contains sharp and attractively formulated insights, which should help to increase support for an urgently needed, effective international climate agreement.(Jeroen C. J. M. van den Bergh, ICREA Research Professor, Deputy Director of the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, and Professor of Environmental and Resource Economics, VU University Amsterdam)This book discusses the 'twin' challenges of energy scarcity and climate change, and it does so in a way that gets deeper than most books. Its sections on the dissemination of knowledge and the moral questions concerning the two issues are novel, as is Friedrichs's take on major historical transitions and how they can be applied to contemporary energy scenarios.(Benjamin K. Sovacool, coauthor (with Marilyn A. Brown) ofClimate Change and Global Energy Security: Technology and Policy Options)Jörg Friedrichs explains with clarity and force how industrial civilization is imperiled by climate change and energy scarcity -- and why we probably won't act until it is too late to forestall fatal disruption and massive suffering. A sobering and salutary portrayal of an unfolding tragedy.(William Ophuls, author ofPlato's Revenge: Politics in the Age of EcologyandImmoderate Greatness: Why Civilizations Fail)The Future Is Not What It Used to Be provides a potent antidote to wishful thinking about the scale of global problems and a brutally honest high-level assessment of humanity's failure to act. For pessimists there is much to confirm one's world-view and insight into how to avoid the traps of despair or denial. For optimists the book is a gruelling but ultimately enlightening experience. Falling into the latter camp, I found the book a dark masterpiece. A sober check against reckless hope, it contains a message that anyone interested in civilisation's long-term future needs to hear.(Robin LovelaceEnvironmental Values)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

You can tell that every poem was written straight from her little innocent heart.

She even touches...on the formidable topic of death which demonstrates the strong and courageous spirit that lives inside the mind of this young and motivational writer. It's always a joy to see children who are driven and excited about life and actually put in the time and hard work to achieve their dreams. Sumayyah is a shining star and I encourage every boy and girl to pick up a copy of her book and get inspired. 5 stars \"-- UBAWA's Booksellers\"This is a good children's book. It teaches self esteem, love for one's self,\nfamily, and community. It encourages people to read, which can lead to a good\neducation and wealth. However, I like how she stresses that wealth isn't only\nabout having money and material things, but it's about sharing and helping\nothers. \" -- R. White\"Young Sumayyah shows us that wisdom doesn't come with age in this cute book of\ninspirational poetry. I was enlightened, amazed, and even surprised at the poems\nthis eight year old had to share with us. My favorite ones were \"Death\" and\n\"Love Yourself!\" She explains how death can be frightening and how everyone\nshould give themselves a hug once in awhile and just love the skin your in. It\nwas very nice seeing what kids her age think about and how they view life. I was\ninspired to tears while reading this and I hope others will be as well. ...\"-- D.

The book is immensely readable, not only for the content which is a very well crafted story of a love affair fated by class distinctions, but writing in the format of email 'letters' adds just that extra contemporary spark of underlining the certain degree of momentary or instant infatuation developing on a rough sea of reality that internet and social media have imposed on us: meet, speak and act fast, disparage later.The two writers and thus characters of this story to whose lives we have privy via reading their constant email correspondence are Charles, a elegant, 'older' British aristocrat whose promiscuity and playing out of passion in a society that still prefers proper dating is limited to hired men of the night, AKA hustlers. His current dalliance is with a young, handsome but 'low born' product of the wrong sector of British citizenry named Edward. Edward supports himself on the street as a hustler and becomes one of Charles' procurements. But there is a definite attraction and eventual love between these disparate men, and Charles introduces Edward to the finer things in life that money can buy, including trips to all the finer spots in the world of luxurious living. But as time advances Charles' eye wanders and his inclination to purchased evenings continues.  Grady Harp, November 13", "related": ["B00KFKXV10"], "rank": 1401420, "title": "Charles And Edward", "author": "Beau Garon De La Nuit", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.1818, "rating_total": 46.0}

Her last words will be, “Watch this.”  She’s usually on a dirt bike, raft or pair of skis, and if she can’t be found outdoors, she’s probably baking. Carol gave birth to two Zen masters, daughter Whitney and son Mike, and was “como la mama” to forty others.  She believes that raising good children is the most important thing one can do in life. Carol attended Wellesley College, Wesleyan University and received her law degree from Washington University in St. Louis.  She has won multiple awards for her legal work and her writing over the years. Her bags are always packed and sightings of her have been reported in New Zealand, Hawaii and the catecombs under Paris.  She loves languages and makes passable attempts at French, Spanish, Greek and Navajo—not bad for the daughter of a hard-rock miner with a ninth-grade education. “Being friends with her is like getting a new little red wagon every day.”—David Long.", "related": ["B00FH34BKU"], "rank": 3579161, "title": "Between the Tracks", "author": "Carol Bellhouse", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My wife and I once ordered the largest volume of mushroom compost in one delivery for our garden, and much to our shock, it came in an open-topped eighteen-wheeler. Because of power lines, the only place they could dump it was in my brother's driveway next door. Boy was he surprised when he came home! I described it very accurately in the book--\"rising steam attested to prevalent methane gases\". And the strong aroma, well, that lasted for several days. You could smell our compost a block away! It took me all summer to move the pile to our garden one wheelbarrow at a time. My brother was good natured about it. We paid him back in vegetables. Fortunately, unlike Simon, we live in a rural area, not an Atlanta suburb, but it prompted me to ask some \"what if\" questions, leading to the story. Other stories reflect life experiences. \"Long Return Home\" was inspired by my long involvement with the Muscogee Creek people, and by my adopted uncle, the late Bear Heart Williams, an Oklahoma Muscogee Creek spiritual leader. For many years, in the late 1980s and 1990s, I was involved with several native people and civil rights activists protesting the prominent figurehead of Andrew Jackson in our local Springtime Tallahassee parade and festivities.  Don't know about Andrew Jackson and his role in the Trail of Tears? You'll learn more by reading \"Long Return Home\". Eventually, a compromise was reached and the protests died down.\"Slave Canal\" is another favorite story. I've paddled North Florida's Wacissa River Slave Canal numerous times and have always found it to be wildly beautiful, and also just a bit disturbing when considering the price men paid to dig that canal through the swamp. Moss-covered boulders piled high give silent testimony to their toil. It is not an easy place to paddle, given the snags, and perhaps that is appropriate.", "related": [], "rank": 4796459, "title": "Simon's Wondrous Garden", "author": "Doug Alderson", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her cosmopolitan life began in New Haven, Connecticut. As a teenager she moved with her family to Sydney, Australia, where she studied English Literature at Melbourne University. Then she lived in England, India, and Los Angeles before finally settling in Jerusalem in 1986.  In 2010, her story \"Green Stockings\" won a prize for fiction in Women in Judaism’s First Annual Writing Competition. Her short novel for young adults and the whole family,\"Red Rock Adventure\" (2103) is an engrossing adventure story which depicts with sensitivity and humor how six Israeli boys on vacation in Jordan cooperate with their Bedouin friends to thwart a terrorist plot in the ancient city of Petra. Working together to reach common goals, mutual respect for different cultures, and true friendship are recurring themes in her writing. In 2014 she published \"Wanderings; Hyderabad Diary\", the story of a spiritual journey from India to Israel. This continues the theme of honoring human beings from different traditions, yet finding one's own place within the continuum of shared human values. Forthcoming publications include a short story collection and a memoir.

Kansas City bakers and restaurant owners prepare for the arrival of the ARTOS convention, a gathering of bread bakers who promote natural breads and loathe assembly-line products. Heaven plans to attend the events with her daughter, soon to return to college, and her baker, Pauline. Tragedy strikes when General Irwin Mills, head of an experimental grain laboratory, falls to his death from a silo in front of hundreds of ARTOS members. A former attorney with a youthful boyfriend, Heaven gathers her resources to expose the cause of the general's death?and then a second ARTOS-related death occurs. Temple includes a variety of recipes from the heartland, in traditional culinary mystery fashion. But her humor is too often smothered by a thick dough of cooking digressions and stilted conversations. Her plotting is nimble enough, but her characterizations are weak, ultimately producing a mystery that, despite some heat, fails to rise.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The professor enlists the aid of Johnny's friend Fergie in a desperate search which climaxes in a confrontation with an evil wizard's spirit in a spooky churchyard and an exorcism. This story is only mildly scary, and the plot bears an uncomfortably close resemblance to Bellairs' earlier The Curse of the Blue Figurine (Dial, 1983). Many characterizations are not fully developed, with the notable exception of the lovably cantankerous Professor Childermass. Unfortunately, his comic foil, timid Johnny, is in a coma for the better part of the book. Definitely not one of Bellairs' best, but above average entertainment for young readers, and as usual, Bellairs skillfully incorporates educational tidbits into his narrative.
