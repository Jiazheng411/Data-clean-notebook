McGrath's sixth novel unfolds in a series of flashbacks, from Jack's childhood in England to Greenwich Village in the 1950s and, eventually, to the Honduran town of Port Mungo, where Jack develops a style he calls \"tropicalism\" or, more sinisterly, \"malarial.\" The birth of daughter Peg threatens the marriage, and her mysterious death, at 16, dooms it; Jack moves in with his sister in New York. Ostensibly, the search for the truth behind Peg's death propels the narrative, but the mix of flashbacks and present action is confusing, and Gin's role feels trumped up. The book becomes even more baroque when Jack's second daughter, raised in England, moves to New York and agrees to let her father paint her, in the nude. It's a provocative conceit, but the whole is less than the sum of the parts. Despite McGrath's intelligent, lyrical prose, the story lacks the urgency of his earlier work.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When he searches for his own name on a dating Web site and finds 20-something Maya, whose ad reads \"Write like Prem Rustum, think like Prem Rustum... be Prem Rustum,\" he seizes the chance and follows her from New York to Paris, where she has a writing fellowship. Both of them draw great pleasure and creative power from the long seduction that follows, and over the course of the book Dawesar (Babyji) shows off her own superior dirty-bit skills in plenty of sex scenes and daydreams. She also firmly entwines readers in Prem and Maya's family lives and creative meditations. The breezy tempo of Dawesar's assured prose belies the gravitas of her subject, conveyed through believable dialogue between people who are serious about art, ideas, reading and writing.(June 20)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And if I am, why doesn't it feel like it? Why do I feel as though I'm teetering on the edge of a precipice?The questions whirled in her head as they'd been doing for the last twenty-four hours, but outwardly the façade held. Anyone surveying her would see Melody Taylor, cool and collected as always and certainly not the type of woman to panic.You asked him here because he's the best lawyer there is and that's what your mother needs right now. Personal issues don't feature in this so get a grip.The self-admonition was sharp and brought her full mouth tightening in determination as her thoughts sped on.You're going to show him that you're managing just fine without him, OK? It's easy as long as you don't lose your nerve. You handle difficult situations every day and you can handle Zeke Russell too.The sitting-room door opened and her mother walked in, cutting short Melody's reverie. The look on the older woman's pale face brought Melody hurrying to her, her voice soft but firm when she said, \"Don't look like that; it'll be all right. I promise.'\"You don't know that, Melody.'\"Yes, I do, and you've got to believe it too. It's half the battle with something like this.'\"Oh, darling.' Anna Taylor touched her lips to her daughter's cheek in a fleeting kiss. \"What would I do without you?'The endearment revealed the extent of her mother's distress. Melody had always known her mother loved her but Anna never demonstrated this physically or verbally except on the rarest of occasions.The two women looked at each other for a moment and then Anna said, \"I don't like you having to ask a favour of Zeke either, not after everything that has happened.'\"I'm not asking him for a favour. We'll explain the situation and if he thinks he can take the case we'll pay him like any other client.'\"You know what I mean.'Yes, she knew what her mother meant. And if she was being truthful she'd have to admit that if there had been any other way out of this than contacting Zeke she'd have taken it. But there wasn't. As a lawyer he was second to none and he won cases that appeared hopeless to everyone else. Those were the facts, unpalatable as they might be.Melody shrugged. \"He agreed to come here so at least we don't have to go to his offices,' she said shortly. She didn't add \"and see Angela', but it was in both women's minds. Angela Brown was Zeke's sexy secretary and mistress—if their affair was still continuing. Melody ruthlessly put the thought of the other woman out of her mind. She had enough to concentrate on with Zeke arriving any minute.The ring of the doorbell caused them both to freeze for a second, then Melody pulled herself together. \"That must be him now,' she said calmly, as though her heart wasn't trying to escape from her chest. \"Why don't you go and put the coffee pot on while I let him in?'Another imperious ring made her soft, full mouth tighten. Forceful, determined, arrogant—Zeke obviously hadn't changed in the six months since they had last seen each other, not that she'd expected otherwise.Her mother having fled to the temporary sanctuary of the kitchen, Melody walked out into the hall, taking a deep breath and composing her face into a polite smile before she opened the front door. She felt her eyes widen but hoped the tall dark man standing on the doorstep hadn't noticed. In spite of the way she'd tried to prepare herself for this moment all morning, the sight of him still took her breath away.\"Hello, Melody,' the deep, masculine voice murmured. There was only a faint trace of the American accent which proclaimed his early origins. \"How are you?'\"I'm f-fine.' She heard the slight stammer with an annoyance which provided a healthy shot of adrenaline. Her voice her own again, she continued, \"And yourself?'\"Wondering what your mysterious phone call is all about.' His head tilted slightly in the characteristic gesture she remembered when the razor-sharp brain was trying to make sense of something. \"I gather Anna's in some kind of trouble?'Melody nodded. \"Do come in,' she said courteously, trying to ignore how very overpowering his presence was. At six feet four, Zeke was taller than most men and broad with it. She knew from experience there wasn't an ounce of fat on the massive frame, however; it was sheer muscled strength which padded his shoulders and chest. His face, with its sharply defined planes and angles, was attractive rather than handsome, the overall impression of hard cynicism etched into each feature. But his eyes… His eyes had always had the power to make her weak at the knees. A curious golden-amber colour, with thick, coal-black lashes which matched his close-cropped hair, they had the ability to hold an onlooker captive with seemingly little effort, an attribute he used to devastating effect with hostile witnesses in the courtroom.The thought lingered as he strode past her into the hall, whereupon she shut the door and turned to face him again. By the end of their relationship, when everything which had been so right was so wrong, she had felt just like one of those poor unfortunates, she thought wryly. And it had been then she'd really understood why he was considered such a brilliant and formidable lawyer in spite of being a relatively young thirty-five years of age.He waited for her to lead the way into the sitting room and she was careful not to brush against him as she passed. Nevertheless she couldn't help catching the faintest whiff of the delicious aftershave he used and her stomach muscles contracted and tightened as her heart galloped for a moment.Steady, girl, steady, she warned herself silently as he followed her into the wide, pleasant room. This is a man who is an expert in reading people's faces to discover what they're thinking. You know that. Don't give anything away or you'll live to regret it. She turned, her voice civil and her eyes devoid of emotion. \"Sit down, Zeke. Mother's bringing the coffee through in a moment.'The words hadn't left her lips before her mother appeared in the doorway, a large coffee tray in her hands. Melody moved to help her but Zeke got there first, taking the tray out of Anna's hands as he said quietly, \"Allow me. You're looking well, Anna.'\"Thank you.' Anna had adopted the role of hostess, her earlier distress hidden. \"So are you.'Zeke Russell placed the tray on the long beech coffee-table in the middle of the room before straightening and surveying the two women. Still as alike as two peas in a pod, he thought in the moment of silence which ensued. You only had to look at Anna to see what Melody would look like in twenty years' time. Even at fifty, Anna was still quite dramatically lovely, her blonde hair shiny and sleek in an expertly cut bob and her skin showing little signs of ageing except round the eyes. Tall, slender and finely boned, the two of them could have passed for sisters rather than mother and daughter, albeit Anna seeming a somewhat older sibling. Of course their eyes were different, Anna's being a light blue which could be chilling on occasion, certainly when they focused on him. Melody's, on the other hand, were a warm, smoky grey with passionate undertones…His body hardened but his voice was mild when he said, \"So, how can I help?'It seemed to bring the two of them to life.Melody pushed her mother down into a chair as she said, \"I'll see to the coffee, you explain what's happened.' And then, when Anna seemed incapable of beginning, Melody said, \"It's the business,' looking straight at him as she motioned for him to seat himself in a chair opposite her mother. \"You remember Julian Harper, Mother's personal assistant?'Zeke nodded. Of course he remembered Anna's lapdog. He didn't think he'd ever met such an obsequious little toad as the small, greasy-haired individual who prided himself on being at Anna's beck and call, but whenever he'd made his feelings known in the past Melody had defended the man to the hilt. Julian was devoted to her mother, she'd protested. Absolutely devoted. Her right-hand man in the business and a good friend too.Zeke raised his eyebrows when it appeared Melody found it difficult to continue. \"Julian?' he prompted quietly.\"He's been fiddling the books.' It was Anna who cut in and her voice was steely now. Zeke recalled the tone. She had rarely spoken to him in any other way.He turned his gaze to Melody's mother but she was looking somewhere over his left shoulder and wouldn't meet his eyes.\"Along with other dubious business practices,' she added bitterly. \"False orders, altering advice notes, inferior material…' She took a deep breath. \"And he's been clever too, making it look as though I was in on everything.'\"How?' Zeke had sat up straighter, his face suddenly intent. \"Forging your signature?'\"Nothing so obvious as that. I…Ihavesigned things apparently that I shouldn't have. He'd bring a batch of papers for my signature and if I was busy…' Her voice trailed away before she added, \"I'd just sign them.'Zeke looked at her with very real astonishment. He privately considered Anna Taylor to be one of the hardest women he had ever come across, a beautiful ice queen with a heart as frozen as the North Pole. He disliked her intensely and he knew the feeling was fully reciprocated. If someone had told him Melody's mother would ever sign a paper without reading it first he would have laughed them out of court.She glanced at him and he knew she was fully aware of the nature of his thoughts.Melody broke the contact by passing him a cup of coffee.It was black and strong, exactly how he liked it, but then if his former fiancée didn't know his preferences, who would?Their hands touched for the briefest of moments before Melody jerked hers away so abruptly the coffee was in danger of landing in his lap for a moment.

His blend of simplicity and challenge makes him the most popular poet in Iran today. Bly and Lewisohn (a world-class Sufism expert) present clear and memorable versions of Hafez's renowned lyric meditations, though they forgo the original ghazal form (with its intricate repetitions) in favor of unrhymed pentameters. Sometimes their Hafez offers good advice: Let's be faithful to what we love./ And keep our spirits high. Sometimes he describes his warmth and contentment: The delight of a few words/ With a soul friend for us is enough. Just as often, though, he shows how the ways of his seeking, and the distance between divine immanence and earthly travail, can disturb even the most sincere follower: Don't imagine us to be like the tulip, he concludes; rather look at the dark/ Spot of grief we have set on our scorched hearts. Though Hafez does not (yet) have the immense Western popularity of that other Sufi mystic, Rumi, his verse has all the ingredients to make a similar splash.(Apr.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ure's book spans thirteen centuries-from the birth of the trend, after Constantine's conversion to Christianity, in 312, to John Bunyan's allegorical \"The Pilgrim's Progress,\" in the seventeenth century, by which time pilgrimage had become, in the words of Sir Walter Raleigh, \"an interior journey.\" The author, a retired British diplomat, favors an anecdotal—indeed, sometimes garrulous—approach, and appends an epilogue of his own pilgrimages.Copyright © 2006The New Yorker", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Junior matron (nurse) Elizabeth Sorrill is the first crush of most of the boys at Foxton's, an English public school, and she unwittingly encourages the lustful fantasies of senior student Alexander Belmayne, son of the lord chancellor. Only a few years older than Alexander, Elizabeth cannot deny her own attraction, and the two have a brief affair that ends badly. Angry and hurt, Alexander goes off to Oxford and launches a career of debauchery at the same time he begins his law studies. Pregnant with Alexander's child, Elizabeth returns briefly to work at her father's carnival, but is rescued from this tawdry life by wealthy art dealer Edward Walters, whom she marries. The older man becomes obsessed with eradicating Elizabeth's memories of Alexander, while her former lover marries Jessica Poynter, upper-crust bohemian, as a kind of perverse penance for his previous womanizing. There are many other complications, related in a breathless, portentous style, and though the plot often strains credibility, fans of the genre may find a new favorite here.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B0048EK41Y"], "rank": 262293, "title": "Dance While You Can", "author": "Susan Lewis", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sardonic, generous, eccentric and sad, itseems as original now as it must have done in the 1970s, before successive waves of historicaland post-colonial fiction dampened the memory of Farrell's achievements in this line.His 'trilogy' is concerned with the gap between imperial ideals and imperial practice--withthe idea that 'a nation,' as one of his characters comes to suspect, 'does not create itselfaccording to its own best ideas, but is shaped by other forces, of which it has little knowledge.'Yet the novels are never earnest or pompous. On the contrary, they are oftenextremely funny, combining vivid historical backdrops with an ironic, absurd sense ofhumour pitched somewhere between P G Wodehouse and Samuel Beckett.\" -ChristopherTayler, The New Statesmen\"In the post-Warhol world, where any wannabe can grab 15 minutes of literary fame,it's a rare writer indeed whose reputation is still growing 30 years after his death.

It is a model of close interpretation that does not dispense with history but displays the many additional historical and rhetorical dimensions in which an ancient text might negotiate the politics of gender.\"-- David Frankfurter, author ofReligion in Roman Egypt: Assimilation and Resistance\"Ross Kraemer'sUnreliable Witnessesprovides a sweeping, authoritative, and wry retrospective on three decades' scholarship on women and Graeco-Roman religions, by one of the field's founding mothers. This is a must-read for anyone who cares about the manifold relationships of theory to historical reconstruction. Bravissima.-- Paula Fredriksen, author ofAugustine and the Jews\"The book presents a very complex and intriguing account of how one can responsibly speak about women in antiquity and more generally write histories about women (real or imagined). The book draws together stunning philological, exegetical and methodological insights and then interrogates previous scholarship in a sharp and clear manner. It is a model of scholarship; the contribution to gender studies, history and religious studies is extraordinary.\"-- Hindy Najman, Director of the Center for Jewish Studies, Associate Professor of the Department and Centre for the study of Religion at the University of Toronto", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He first flew into Vietnam in 1965 and flew extensively in the combat zone as a C-130E Instructor Pilot in 1967-68. He was awarded the Command Pilot rating in 1979. For many years he was an FAA Certified Flight Instructor (CFI), and still holds an FAA certificate with ratings in Single and Multi-engine aircraft with Instrument Rating, and holds Type Ratings for the civilian commercial versions of all the military transport aircraft he has flown. He is co-holder of the previous C-130 endurance record of 29.7 hours when deployed non-stop as leader of a two-ship formation with four air refuelings from Hurlburt Field, FL to Andersen AFB, Guam, in 1979. The flight was a prelude to the Iran hostage rescue attempt in 1980. At the time of the Grenada mission in October 1983 he was the senior Instructor Pilot in the 16th Special Operations Squadron, 1st Special Operations Wing, at Hurlburt Field, FL, having flown the gunships since 1978. He retired from the USAF with 20+ years of service effective 1 March 1984, and after two years working in the burgeoning retail computer business, was employed in Civil Service as a Mechanical Engineer at the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate at Eglin AFB, FL. In late 2004 after over 19 years of service, he retired for the second and last time in the grade of DR-III Senior Engineer (equivalent to GS-14). Major Couvillon now resides with his wife of 49 years in Fort Walton Beach, FL, and enjoys each day working on projects in his many areas of interest. He has four grown children and seven grandchildren, some residing locally and others living within visiting distance in southern metropolitan areas. He is a Life Member of the Fraternal Order of Daedalians for military pilots, and a Charter Member of Seagull Flight #61. Volabamus.

At the time of his death in March of 1970, in Ventura, California, Gardner was \"the most widely read of all American writers\" and \"the most widely translated author in the world,\" according to social historian Russell Nye. The first Perry Mason novel, The Case of The Velvet Claws, published in 1933, had sold twenty-eight million copies in its first fifteen years. In the mid-1950s, the Perry Mason novels were selling at the rate of twenty thousand copies a day. There have been six motion pictures based on his work and the hugely popular Perry Mason television series starring Raymond Burr, which aired for nine years and 271 episodes.As author William F. Nolan notes, \"Gardner, more than any other writer, popularized the law profession for a mass-market audience, melding fact and fiction to achieve a unique blend; no one ever handled courtroom drama better than he did.\"Richard Senate further sums up the significance of Gardner?s contribution: \"Although the character of Perry Mason is not unique as a 'lawyer-sleuth,' he is the first to come to anyone's mind when it comes to sheer brilliance in solving courtroom-detective cases by rather unconventional means. Besides 'Tarzan,' 'Sherlock Holmes,' 'Superman' ? 'Perry Mason' qualifies as an American icon of popular culture in the twentieth century.\"Gardner's writing has touched a lot of people including a number of high profile figures. Brian Kelleher and Diana Merrill say in their 1987 book, The Perry Mason TV Show Book that Harry S. Truman was a fan and that it is rumored that when Einstein died, a Perry Mason book was at his bedside. They further describe that when Raymond Burr met Pope John XXIII, the actor reported that the pontiff \"seemed to know all about Perry Mason.\" Federal judge Sonya Sotomayor frequently mentions how Perry Mason was one of her earliest influences.Starting with his first book, Gardner had a very definite vision of the shape the Perry Mason character would take:\"I want to make my hero a fighter,\" he wrote to his publisher, \"not by having him be ruthless to women and underlings, but by creating a character who, with infinite patience jockeys his enemies into a position where he can deliver one good knockout punch.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The point of his memoir is not simply to tell you his amazing story, but to show you the way towards a journey of your own. One could look atLike Trees Grow Together as sort of a Cliff's Notes to the land of visions and voices from the next world. What makesLike Trees Grow Together work so well is the fact that Coull is able to accomplish both goals and still have produced a high readable memoir.After trudging through an awful and devastating divorce, Coull finds himself having these strange and seemingly unexplainable out-of-this-world experiences: visions of teachers he has yet to meet, voices from people who have passed over into the next life and a strong connection to seemingly unconnected individuals. His writing is elementary and straight-forward -- taking a topic that can confuse and confound readers and turning it into a simple matter of fact. He makes no apologies for his experiences and, thus, gives others the room to do the same. A worthwhile read if you're interested in the subject matter. San Francisco Book Review.", "related": [], "rank": 4316846, "title": "Like Trees Grow Together:A Spiritual Journey", "author": "Clifford S.

She is former newspaper reporter and photographer with daily newspapers across the south, such as the Mobile Press Register of Mobile, Alabama; the Mississippi Press Register of Pascagoula, Mississippi and the Hattiesburg American of Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

She now lives in Tarboro, North Carolina with her significant other, musician Ben Windley, and her miniature Boston Terrier, Buster.

My formative years were spent on my knees in the corridors of some of the most prestigious schools in suburban Chicago. The nuns tried to break my spirit on a daily basis but I persevered.   I started working on cars in high school, which I still do. Modern chemistry has allowed me to purge my fingernails of the grease from my first Fiat--finally. I studied engineering in college, then I left for the Marine Corp Reserves. I worked on making screws and ladders. When things were still made in America, I made 'em. And, the government gave me two patents for it. I also owned and operated a woodshop and a gift shop sequentially. I stood in front of high school students for years. Unfortunately, I believe, I have profited much more from it than they. In the name of economy, I bought cars that needed work. The terminally ill were saved from the salvage yard just before their last breath. I helped them recapture their youth and usefulness. Some day, I will own a car of this century. Places I've lived: state with most governors in prison (Illinois), state closest to the Arctic Circle (Minnesota), and now paradise (Florida). For the unknowing, Naples FL is paradise. Several of my friends who have died and gone to heaven have said: \"Hey, this ain't as good as Naples. I wanna go back.\" If you forget the balmy temp, there are still the lovely palm trees and flowers that scent and cover every inch of this leisure land. I couldn't have found a nicer place to settle. I'm having a fun filled life with a wonderful wife (my neighbor's) (just kidding) and grown son and daughter-in-law. I am presently writing a new Steampunk mystery  and a volume of short stories and things. Both my mysteries, Next Time We Steal The Carillon and Witness Unleashed are available  in paperback.

All are uniquely crafted, with intentions to either destroy or save the kingdom. Brief chapters juxtapose longer prose, fueling a high-paced story line that flies from one end of the world to the other. As the author shifts from one point of view to the next, readers slide through a rich mosaic of betrayal, greed, loyalty and honor. Of its manifold strengths, the novel is fluid and full of surprises. Readers will question the characters' loyalties to the king as they ponder the mysterious identity of the final member of the Ten. As the book draws to a close, the final lines are likely to send shivers up readers' spines. The author masterfully crafts vivid battle scenes and heart-pounding chases across oceans, over snow-peaked mountains and into city sewers. Neither diehard nor casual fantasy readers will be able to resist this trilogy's rousing start. An exemplar of storytelling and character-driven adventure. --KIRKUS REVIEWSA Kirkus Reviews \"Best Book of 2012\"", "related": [], "rank": 1644463, "title": "The Ten (The Kingdom of Graves Book 1) eBook", "author": "Leland Myrick", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Within an hour after being struck, the ship burned, flooded and sank.  Before dawn the next morning, one thousand and fifteen American troops, three Red Cross personnel and one hundred and twenty crewmen perished.  Hundreds died when the missile struck the Rohna at her shelter deck level and exploded near the after end of the engine room and the No. 6 troops deck.  Others perished from cold and exhaustion when darkness and rough seas hampered rescue efforts, while many, ironically, were killed during frantic attempts to rescue and be rescued.THE ROHNA DISASTER, WORLD WAR II'S SECRET TRAGEDY is about this disastrous, yet virtually unknown, at-sea incident during World War II.It is important that history be chronicled, and that this story, an important part of our history, be told, heard, taught and remembered. It is also important that those who played roles in this incredible drama, the survivors, rescuers and casualties, be given their due honor and recognition, and that the families of those who perished, who have a right to know what happened to their loved ones, be given an opportunity to learn that truth. This book was written for those reasons.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This is a sweet romance\nwith just a touch of sensuality to it, and all love-making is mental and\n\"spiritual\" instead of physical. Perhaps I am somewhat jaded, but the spiritual\naspect of the love-making didn't really work for me and reminded me just a\nlittle too much of the series romances of the 70s and 80s. The relationship\nbetween Rhett and Carrie is still very enjoyable to watch unfold, and Ms.\nBarbour has done a very effective job making their interactions both interesting\nand entertaining. Rhett professes to be selfish and abrupt, yet he shows\nsurprising insight when dealing with Carrie and her issues. Carrie is a very\nrepressed character, but with Rhett acting as her coach and mental cheering\nsection, she finally grows a backbone. Romance fans are bound to enjoy this\nnovella. Assuming that there will be a third story in this series, I personally\nam curious as to how Ms Barbour is going to continue the theme and whether she\ncan keep it as fresh and unique as He's Her undoubtedly is.Reviewed by:\nWhitney", "related": ["B00IM1TT24"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 24, "rating_average": 4.2917, "rating_total": 103.0}

The first is King Henry III's elephant. The second is an encampment of Tartars, an Eastern tribe that has vanquished parts of Europe and now seeks an audience with the English king. Hostilities between town and university, as well as within the Tartar tribe come to the fore when the Tartar leader, Chimbai, is brutally murdered. Falconer investigates the death with the help of Peter Bullock, the city's constable. Suspects abound, including Chimbai's smug successor, Guchuluk, and a disgruntled English knight. The clue may lie in the hands of an old Jew, Bellasez, whose own murder prolongs the investigation. Set in 1268, the novel is permeated with period details. Morson skillfully draws parallels between Oxford's suspicion of the Tartars and the townspeople's attitudes toward the elephant: both are alien to the insular English, who regard the interlopers with a mixture of fear and awe fed by wild imagination. And once again, Morson uses Falconer's only weakness, his secretive personality, to lure readers into an enjoyable addition to a well-written series.

Sherry can attest first-hand to the fact that a whirlwind marriage can indeed last. Sherry credits her frequent moves and long separations to her ability to feel her characters’ desire to find true happiness.  Sherry has worked as a private nanny and is a certified dog trainer. She is the mother of three adult children and has four wonderful grandchildren. Her hobbies include reading, walking, Pilates, and spending time with her “friends” — which is how she refers to the characters she creates. She believes in daily affirmations, positive energy and feels that karma will have the final say.  Sherry A. Burton currently resides in Chesapeake, Virginia. Sherry’s books include Tears Of Betrayal and The Scars Between Us.

Living with the condition...\nthat's the hard part. Join Alyssa as she stumbles through the world of the\n\"Unnatural.\" Book 1: Immortalis\nCarpe Noctem  - Newbie vampire Alyssa\nnever asked for this life, but now it's all she has. Rescued from death by\nLysander, the aloof and sexy leader of the Peregrinus vampire clan, she's\nbarely cut her teeth before she becomes a target. Kallisto, an ancient and\nvindictive vampire queen - and Lysander's old mate - wants nothing less than\nfinal death for her former lover and his new toy. She's not above letting the\nActa Sanctorum, and its greatest vampire hunter, Santino, know exactly where\nthe clan can be found.With no time to mourn her old life, Alyssa's survival\ndepends on her new family. She will have to stand alongside Lysander and fight\nagainst two enemies who will stop at nothing to destroy them. Book 2: Hunters &\nPrey-  Rule number one: humans and\nvampires don't co-exist. One is the hunter and one is the prey. Simple, right?\nNot for newly-turned vampire Alyssa. A surprise confrontation with Santino\nVitale, the Acta Sanctorum's most fearsome hunter, sends her fleeing back to\nthe world she once knew, and Fallon, the human friend she's missed more than\nanything. Now she has some explaining to do. However, that will have to wait.\nWith the Acta Sanctorum hot on their heels, staying alive is more important\nthan educating a human on the finer points of bloodlust. Book 3: Pandora's Box-  After a few months as a vampire, Alyssa\nthought she'd learned all she needed to know about the supernatural world. But\nher confidence is shattered by the delivery of a mysterious package - a\nPandora's Box. Seemingly innocuous, the box is in reality an ancient prison,\ngenerated by a magic more powerful than anyone in her clan has ever known. But\nwhat manner of evil could need such force to contain it? When the box is\nopened, the sinister creature within is released, and only supernatural blood\nwill satiate its thirst. The clan soon learns how it feels when the hunter\nbecomes the hunted. Book 4: Soulstone-  It's a desperate time for rookie\nvampire Alyssa, and her sanity is hanging by a slender thread. Her clan is\nstill reeling from the monumental battle with Aniketos; a battle that claimed the\nbody of Lysander, her sire and lover, and trapped his spirit in a mysterious\ncrystal. A Soulstone. Unfortunately, no amount of magic has been able to\nrelease Lysander's spirit, and the stone is starting to fade. Weeks of effort\nhave proved futile. Her clan, the Peregrinus, have all but given up hope. Only\nAlyssa still believes her lover can be released. In despair, Alyssa begs the\nhelp of the local witch coven, and unwittingly exposes the supernaturals of\nBoston to unwanted attention from the Acta Sanctorum. The Saints converge on\nthe city and begin their cleansing crusade to rid the world of all things\n\"Unnatural.\" In the middle of an all-out war, but no closer to a solution to\nthe dying stone, Alyssa is left with an unenviable choice: save her mate, or save\nher clan. Book 5: MoonlightGood girls don't wear fur, or fight over men, and they\ncertainly don't run around naked, howling at the moon. But then, no-one ever\ncalled Fallon a good girl. As a humanunofficiallymated to an Alpha werewolf, Fallon is being pressured to \"become\"...or be gone.\nHer mate Aiden, the interim leader of the Olde Town Pack, is in a position that\ndemands he either choose a wolf mate...or leave the pack forever. No matter how\nhot the sex with Fallon is, he can't ignore centuries of tradition. Become a\nwolf or not. If only the choice were that simple. Fallon's options are further\nclouded by the overt presence of other females desperate to be the Alpha's\nmate. And when these bitches get serious, it's not just claws that come out. If\nFallon wants to keep her man and take the title she'll have to exert a little\ndominance of her own. Book 6: Dark\nSalvationA gathering storm of violence is on the horizon. Whispered\nthreats of the Acta Sanctorum's return have the supernatural world abuzz. Only\nrecently aware of the other world hidden behind our own, Kitara Vanders has\nbarely scratched the surface of what being supernatural truly means. A special\nwoman in her own right, she possesses unique telepathic abilities, gifts that\nhave recently come under the scrutiny of the Acta Sanctorum, a fanatical\norganization whose mission is to cleanse the world of anything supernatural.\nTargeted, and marked for death, Kitara's only hope lies with the lethally\nseductive yet emotionally scarred warrior, Nicholas.Knowing full well the atrocities the Acta Sanctorum is\ncapable of, Nicholas is all too eager for the battle to begin. Fueled by pain\nand rage from the loss of his mate, he's itching for a fight, but one thing\nstands in his way, Kitara: a beautiful dark-haired woman with unique psychic\nabilities and an unusual link to the Saints. Despite his resolve to remain\nfocused on his mission, a purely physical relationship binds them together in a\nway neither of them expected. And when her life hangs in the balance, Nicholas\nfinds his own is teetering on the edge too.", "related": ["B00JZEUTBC"], "rank": 446672, "title": "Moonlight: A Paranormal Shifter Romance (Olde Town Pack Book 1)", "author": "Katie Salidas", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 31, "rating_average": 4.2903, "rating_total": 133.0}

When Boyd turned eighteen he refused to attend church or practice the beliefs of the Catholic Church.  Boyd was somewhat disowned by his parents and forced to move out of the family home.  Boyd packed up his belongs and moved across country from the east coast to the west coast and has not looked back. Boyd has traveled and backpacked through many parts of the country and dabbled in eastern religions and philosophies.  Boyd attended a few Scientology meetings in his early twenties but now in his thirties wanted to learn more about the controversies, values, beliefs and myths of Scientology. Nowadays Boyd describes himself as “spiritual” verses religious.  Boyd loves new experiences and meeting new people.  Boyd encourages everyone to live in the moment and love with an open mind.

She must not show jealousy, grief or fear, and she should present herself as an interesting, independent woman, no matter how helpless she feels. Confrontation with the \"Other Woman\" might even be necessary. The book does not address the cases of husbands whose \"flings\" are more than casual, who may in fact no longer love their wives. Instead of helping women express their feelings honestly and deal with the real issues couples need to face together, the authors present a rosy, simplistic, \"surefire\" formula that avoids frank communication.

He is the father of actor Daniel Day-Lewis and documentary filmmaker and television chef Tamasin Day-Lewis. Day-Lewis was born in Ballintubbert, County Laois, Ireland. He was the son of the Reverend Frank Cecil Day-Lewis and Kathleen Squires. After Day-Lewis's mother died in 1906, he was brought up in London by his father, with the help of an aunt, spending summer holidays with relatives in Wexford. Day-Lewis continued to regard himself as Anglo-Irish for the remainder of his life, though after the declaration of the Republic of Ireland in 1948 he chose British rather than Irish citizenship, on the grounds that 1940 had taught him where his deepest roots lay. He was educated at Sherborne School and at Wadham College, Oxford, from which he graduated in 1927.", "related": [], "rank": 1137763, "title": "The Private Wound", "author": "Nicholas Blake", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Four years later I find myself doing marketing for a \"Chuck E Cheese want-to-be\" restaurant chain. I was living in my hometown (Flint, Michigan), working eighteen hours a day, making great money and feeling like I sold my soul to the devil (or in this case, a giant kangaroo that looked exactly like Chuck E. Cheese). Fall was in the air and so was change, so I quit my high-paying job to make $90 every two weeks working four hours a day, Monday through Friday on a radio station in Cadillac Michigan. Only making $45 a week and only working twenty hours I had to keep busy cheaply. I did the only other thing I ever wanted to do in my whole life and that was to write.I wrote romances and detective stories while in high school and sent them to pulpy magazines. After 30 rejection slips, I switched to writing novels and wrote them for only me. That is until I met my wife, who read them, loved them, and said let's share them with the world and make ten million dollars. Fast forward to now, I'm still at it years later, still on the radio, still writing, still sharing and still working on those millions. I live in the coolest city in Texas, Austin, the home of Willie Nelson, Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock and a serious bunch of hipsters.I play tennis four days a week and work everyday on ways to become a better writer. I am married and live with two kids, three fish, a lizard and two white miniature schnauzers named Max and Samsung.I have been published on Twitter (Alex_Austin)and my work often appears in Facebook (bit.ly/AlexvoxFB).

I got the idea several years ago when someone sent me an email full of ironic quotes, one of which was by a man named Thomas Andrews, an engineer on the Titanic project who said, \"She is as nearly perfect as human brains can make.\" I was in business school at the time and was doing a case study presentation about risk and decision-making so I decided to add a slide with this quote followed by an image of Titanic as a way of introduction.I'd always been fascinated by the Titanic story and wondered how could they have failed so spectacularly? I started reading about the history behind the ship and ultimately, this led me to realize no one had ever told the story from a business perspective. I then spent two years researching and writing what turns out to be an amazing story that far from the case study of how not to do things, is actually about how good, strategic decisions can lead to disastrous outcomes.While parts of the story read like they are out of a novel, you will discover how the decision-makers had deep understandings of customer demographics and preferences and politics and law (and how to get around both of them), were savvy marketers and financiers, and actually took a very conservative and safe approach to innovation. In the final analysis, you will learn how a dramatically better strategy led to seven arguably good business decisions - the kind you are likely making in your business - to compete globally - that resulted in overconfidence and a blindness to the accumulation of risk that eventually - but unknowingly - reaches catastrophic levels. It is simply a story you will never forget.", "related": ["B007OJCEAY"], "rank": 1864403, "title": "Collision Course - How Good Business Decisions Sank the Titanic and Why eBook", "author": "Joseph Mortati", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Had one-time north Idaho journalist Ned Hayes made this tantalizing question the centerpiece of his debut novel, he might have only created a derivative retelling of an all-too-familiar serial killer plot. Instead, he takes the plot for this well-written literary thriller from the historical facts of the still-unsolved Sunshine Mine disaster in 1972, and winds it tight around the troubled central figure of Matt Worthson, a one time candidate for Sheriff in Coeur d'Alene. Worthson, suffering from a broken marriage and a suspect car accident, is pulled into a tangled history of corrupt politics, separatist plots, and powerful interests who control the lucrative Idaho mining industry.  The novel opens with the discovery of the mutilated body of a chaplain who works with the police department, and seems to point towards a local serial killer who is again on the loose. But this tried and true plot soon moves in a more complicated direction, as Worthson's own motivations and past crimes are brought under the microscope.The story of the Sunshine Mine disaster itself is told in a flashback that is both compelling and heart-rending, as Worthson struggles with his father's impending death, and the secrets his father still refuses to reveal about the mine disaster - the truth of which has important implications for Worthson's investigation.Coeur d'Alene Waters is a solidly written murder mystery with a haunting finish, reminiscent of the best of Ridley Pearson or the early work of fellow Washington writer Jess Walter.", "related": ["B00C5TJTI8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 20.0}

I often wished there was a simple guide that I could read in an hour or two and have everything I needed to start brewing right away and not waste time and money on trial and error and needless supplies. So I decided to create such a guide for those considering home brewing for the first time. My goal was to make it easy to follow , yet complete enough to cover anything the first time homebrewer might encounter.  I think I have accomplished my goal with this guide and still kept it at a very affordable price so that the \"newbie\" could have a quick and affordable way to determine if they wanted to get involved in home brewing of beer. Of course, I couldn't possibly think of everything, so please feel free to leave a review and tell me any thing I missed or anything you believe should be added to the guide.Yours TrulyPablo Maiorino", "related": ["B00BBJCN9K"], "rank": 1915796, "title": "How to Become an Expert Home Brewer in a Weekend-A beginner's Guide to Home Brewing", "author": "Pablo Maiorino", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I put this book together because the very first time I did Key West swim, I had a lot of questions about what it was all about. I first did this swim one month shy of my 50th birthday. There's nothing amazing about my age and competing in this event. What is amazing is that 6 months prior, I couldn't swim 8 laps in a 25 yard pool without getting winded! With the help of my coach, I was able to gain the skills necessary to successfully complete the race. I share this information with you because you might not think you could ever swim non-stop for hours. Think again!If you are considering a long-distance swim, and especially a long-distance swim around Key West, I've written this book for you. In this book, I'm going to give you 21 tips. These were some of the questions that I wanted to have answered before the race. Also included are questions that I wished I had asked that I hadn't! I hope you enjoy these tips and that you get a lot of benefit out of the pages that follow.I wish you the greatest success with your swimming endeavors!Rich Greene", "related": [], "rank": 579880, "title": "Going the Distance", "author": "Richard B.

Since then I’ve enjoyed many a night, freezing until I can’t stand it anymore, looking at the delights of the Universe and the magical wonders of alien worlds.  I started my career in computing, but presently work at a college helping students to improve their maths and English. The rest of my time is worked around my writing.  I live in Northumberland, England, with my husband and three cats. Whenever possible, we (not the cats) like to fit in some walking and mountain biking in the magnificent Northumberland and Kielder hills.  I have been writing for ten years now. In that time I have written the novella, Time Split, the novels: Distant Suns, Distant Suns - The Journey Home and Islands Beneath the Sea.  I strive in my writing to give you a rollercoaster ride of emotions and excitement, mixed in with a good dash of fear – all from the safety of your armchair.", "related": ["B00IVE3IUQ"], "rank": 690460, "title": "Distant Suns - The Journey Home eBook", "author": "Patricia Smith", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Some say New York or London, but no one really knew for sure.\" New Orleans is infested by zombies like the other cities, and two long-time friends struggle to stay alive in their beloved historical town. Time is against them, as they strive to find how the disastrous plague came to be. Written by Lazarus Infinity, Occupation is a gripping zombie story bringing a fresh twist to the genre. The author first introduces us to the Devereaux family with historic ties in Louisiana corruption and organized crime - making them a powerful force to be reckoned with for many years. Initially, I didn't know how the Devereaux fitted into the story until I read the ending. I enjoy reading how long-time friends, Barabbas Purify and Nicodemus Jackson, keep each other alive in the zombie-infested city. I even love their quirky names. The action scenes are tense, fast, and vividly portrayed, making it absolutely enjoyable to read. Amid all the chaos, the uninfected, living people still look forward to the Super Bowl that takes place right in the middle of the annual Mardi Gras season. The truth behind the virus is interesting and realistic indeed - one that will make readers think deep about our political situation today. I find the quality of the writing is high and straightforward. The editing is mostly flawless. Humor is perfectly balanced with the gore and horror. On the whole, a fast-paced novelette that is on a par with any zombie novels. Fans of the genre would find it highly satisfying.", "related": ["B00K31USUS"], "rank": 3854075, "title": "Occupation eBook", "author": "lazarusInfinity", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Whereas others have simply presented the text of Warren Hilton'sThe Trained Memoryin \"new editions\" of this work, I have painstakingly gone through each passage and clarified Hilton's amazing ideas. Whereas some of Hilton's language is dated and esoteric, most of his memory strategies remain fresh and useful. Those ideas that are less useful have been highlighted in my commentary and I have provided alternative solutions to the problem based on the principles of the Magnetic Memory Method. Judging by the excellent reviews and emails I have received from readers, I feel that my goal has been reached.To the reader of Warren Hilton'sThe Trained Memory, I offer this advice:Depending on your devotion to improving your memory, this book may or may not be for you. In order to fully benefit from this book, you should have already struggled a bit to improve your memory so that you can feel the full benefits of the implementing the advice given by this book and my additional commentary.", "related": ["B00HI0L8YC"], "rank": 710032, "title": "The Trained Memory (Newly Revised Edition with Commentary", "author": "Warren Hilton", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His acclaimed memoir, A Year of Sundays (Taking the Plunge and our Cat to Explore Europe) shares the eccentric tale of his yearlong adventure in Europe with his spirited blind wife and headstrong, deaf sixteen year old cat.  In his historical novel, Soul of Toledo, about Spain in the 1440s, the diabolical nature of mankind stands out as madmen take over the City of Toledo and torture suspected Jews 40 years before the Spanish Inquisition.  Webster also likes to tinker with fictional characters, putting strange people together to see what they’ll do with/to each other. In his latest novel, The Gentle Bomber’s Melody, a nutty woman, bearing a stolen baby, lands on the doorstep of a fugitive bomber hiding from the FBI. The result is irresistible insanity.  From the happily unusual of A Year of Sundays to the cruelly perverse in Soul of Toledo, Edward D. Webster shines a light on offbeat aspects of human nature.  Webster lives in Southern California with his divine wife and two amazing cats.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Burkhead is an Indiana Air Force Veteran and writer of Science Fiction and Fantasy.\nHe has also written on technical topics for The World & I magazine\nand High Technology Careers.In addition to his writing, he works in a consulting laboratory in\nAtomic Force Microscopy and Nanotechnology.  His work ranges from\nmeasuring samples in the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) to refurbishing\nused AFM's for resale to writing software for measurement of AFM images.\n  More than half the DVD production in the world, and the development of\n Blu-Ray, is supported using measurement software he wrote.David L. Burkhead is one of the originators of the SpaceCub concept. In\n1994 David and Geoffrey Landis proposed SpaceCub, a reusable manned\nsuborbital rocket. SpaceCub was intended for tourism and \"thrill rides.\"  SpaceCub provided a model for private businesses to make money in\nsuborbital flight, an approach that could, with incremental\nimprovements, lead to private manned orbital flight.David and Geoff presented the SpaceCub concept at the 1994 Northeast\nSpace Development Conference, the 1995 International Space Development\nConference, and other venues. Short articles appeared in Popular\nMechanics and the Brazilian magazine Istoé and David was interviewed\nabout SpaceCub for an AAAS radio broadcast. Shortly after these events,\nother people started talking about reusable, suborbital rockets to carry\n humans into space.  As a direct consequence, Peter Diamandis created\nthe X-Prize foundation and the original Ansari X-Prize.  The prize goal\ncould have been taken directly from SpaceCub's proposed specifications:\n a reusable rocket carrying passengers to an altitude of 100 km.  This\nprize lead directly to the development and successful flight of Dick\nRutan's SpaceShip One and to the ongoing work by the Rutan's and Richard\n Branson's Virgin Galactic.  Rutan and Branson, in offering private\nsuborbital tourist flights, continues the model originated with\nSpaceCub.", "related": ["B00J70YY0G"], "rank": 1221313, "title": "Live to Tell (FutureTech Industries) eBook", "author": "David L.

He was a prolific writer for newspapers and journals in a wide variety of subjects with comparatively few publications in his specialism of Roman Law. He collated the text of Theophilus' Greek paraphrasis of Justinian's Institutes but failed to finish his extensive work in this field. However, his translation of Theophilus was published in 2010 as the parallel English text accompanying the Greek in the new edition. He also wrote two biographical works in Scottish history: Sir William Wallace (1898) and King Robert the Bruce (1899) in the Famous Scots Series published by Oliphant, Anderson and Ferrier. Lack of money took him into journalism and he was editor of the Educational Times (now the Times Educational Supplement) from 1902 to 1912 and on the staff of the Daily Chronicle. He even had time to enter politics and he stood as a Liberal Party candidate in at least three General Elections: for the Glasgow and Aberdeen Universities constituency in 1906 and for the Glasgow Central constituency in December 1910 and January 1910 and lost on all three occasions to a Conservative candidate. He died on 8 June 1934 at his home in Clapham Common, London.", "related": [], "rank": 1645502, "title": "Sir William Wallace (Illustrated) eBook", "author": "A. F.
