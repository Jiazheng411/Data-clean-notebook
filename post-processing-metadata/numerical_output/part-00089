Soap actress Kelly Trent, who plays bitchy advice diva Marla Valentine, is given a lengthy, unsought leave of absence after a number of death threats, some near-lethal \"accidents\" and the murders of three real-life advice therapists. Her consolation prize is a starring role in a music video for the rock group Kill Me Quick, to promote their new song \"Tango to Terror.\" Filming will take place on a private Florida island—Dead Man's Key. Can it be that Kelly's in danger? She doesn't think so, but her manager does. Enter Doug O'Casey, not-quite-retired private eye and tango instructor. Kelly resents his insistence that she needs his protection, but she's attracted in spite of herself. \"One of the very slow, rueful smiles she found so appealing curled onto his lips.\" Graham introduces enough red herrings to make a seafood salad, while the ending leaves no doubt that Doug and Kelly will exchange rueful smiles forever after.

Wilson, Stanford University School of Medicine\"In the 19th century, Darwin’s theory of evolution was initially integrated into the new science of psychology by pioneers such as Lloyd Morgan, George John Romanes, and James Mark Baldwin. But in the 20th century it was as if their efforts had been wasted; a self-names ‘science’ that insisted on ignoring conscious experience itself, as well as any of its determinants that might be of direct or indirect genetic origin, took over academic departments of psychology. But Plotkin compellingly describes how 21st century psychology, which will be about consciousness as well as the brain, will probably incorporate findings from ethology, sociobiology, and evolutionary theory (including ideas about ‘selfish’ genes)…a must-read.\"David J. Murray, Queen’s University\"This book is a true reflection of its title, a history of evolutionary thought within psychology, building on Darwin's original ambition to extend his theory to a science of the human mind. It runs through the eclipse of this thinking by behaviourism and its return in the last 20 years in the various forms of evolutionary psychology. A very readable introduction to the field.\"Scientific and Medical Network Review, Summer 2005\"Plotkin gives an erudite and engaging account of the intellectual currents that influenced the relationship between psychology and evolutionary thought over the past 100 years.....Interspersed throughout are interesting anecdotes, colorful descriptions of personalities, and accounts of twists of fate that affected careers and influenced the history of psychology....For any psychologist interested in the history of ideas -and how intellectual currents, politics and chance events can affect scientific paradigms-it is a must read. It's lasting value is that it provides a lucid and well-documented hisotry of the intellectually shameful exculsion of evolutionary thought in psychological theory during most of the 20th century. Thankfully, that exclusion is being remedied in the 21st century.\"Personnel Psychology, Summer 2005`This is science writing of a high order, and I hope this book has the wide readership it so strongly merits.'Michael Ruse, Journal of the History of the Behavioural Sciences, Autumn 2005", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

By pulling together some of Lama Yeshe s introductory teachings on Buddhism, meditation, compassion and emptiness, and combining them with the definitive explanation of tantra, this one valuable volume will inspire students to go more deeply into the Yoga Method of Buddha Maitreya a tantric practice. But isn t tantra secret? you ask. By now so many books have been published on tantra that the Dalai Lama himself said that appropriate books should be published, to correct mistakes made by inauthentic writers. Lama helps us to understand all the ways we can use meditation to develop transformation and gain transcendent experiences. It s still important to find a fully-qualified teacher like Lama or seek out a group deity yoga retreat, but this new offering from the Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive is a very good explanation of Universal Love. Highly recommended. --Mandala magazine", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From childhood, her remarkable artwork began gradually to cover her homestead, so that \"it was a canvas, a roadside attraction.\" On the day Maud buries her supportive father, she meets George, her future husband and a control freak who, over the years, saps her talent, paints over her house and is then killed in an automobile accident. Through Maud's eyes, readers meet various townsfolk, each undergoing some sort of artistic crisis. Her best friend Wynn, renowned for her knitting, loses her lucky needles; dairy farmer Jacques Leon \"T-Bone\" Thibeault can no longer tap-dance for his herd. All comes right in the end, as conflicts and creative blocks are resolved. Initially, Roberts's premise and characters charm, but the prose soon suffers from awkward imagery; while Maud's homespun wisdom grows forced and precious. Despite the lack of a strong regional voice, the novel's quirky details (amusing chapter headings include \"Cows Juggling Pine Cones\") and unusual situations bode well for more mature work from this new talent. $20,000 ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 3.9, "rating_total": 39.0}

He details how this powerful and effective 'social-service complex,' bringing together public and private, state and local, business and nonprofit, left and right, has grown and succeeded because of, indeed in spite of, the trauma of federal budget cuts of the 1980s. Erickson extends the vision to education, health care, and community development and argues that an ever-changing network of specialist producers who are connected with both the capital markets and community residents, can, with an appropriate level of financial support from the federal government, bring back and sustain our nation's poorest neighborhoods--those being devastated by the current financial crisis--and can do it with efficiency and compassion. --Ellen Seidman, Senior Fellow, New America Foundation, and Executive Vice President for National Policy and Partnership Development, ShoreBank CorporationToday's housing crisis requires and enables policymakers to redefine the role of government in housing policy. This redefinition, David Erickson argues, is ongoing and reflects decades of trial and error. Erickson makes a compelling case that community-based networks are the foundation for a new generation of housing policy that calls for and benefits from a holistic approach to community development. Turning the clock back is not a plausible option. --Nicolas P. Retsinas, Director, Joint Center for Housing Studies, Harvard UniversityThe deep economic crisis gripping our nation has only intensified the need to find a more rational, productive relationship between Washington, states and localities, and the nonprofit and private sectors. David Erickson engagingly portrays all of these actors uniting over the past four decades to address America's affordable housing needs and becoming poised to respond to our evolving challenges. In demonstrating how this decentralized network combines political and policy savvy, flexible collaboration, and understanding of private markets to meet community needs and achieve societal goals, Erickson serves up a valuable playbook for advancing a smarter, 21st century federalism. --Alan Berube, Research Director, The Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Throughout the book, the authors share their own personal experiences of specific parenting dilemmas, allowing readers to feel that they are not the only people who experience such difficulties. This anecdotal style of writing adds a wonderful humorous and personal touch to the book, making it a thoroughly enjoyable read. The end of each chapter presents the bottom line of each issue that was explored, providing a useful summary of the key points as a reminder. This book is well suited to all parents, or prospective parents, and anybody working with children or families.\"– Esther Yoder Strahan and Wallace E Dixon Jr online atwww.youthinmind.info\"There is certainly a need for an evidenced-based approach to parenting. Too much of what has been published over the years on this subject has been written by nonprofessionals and geared to popular trends. The authors—a clinical psychologist, a developmental psychologist, and a family physician—do an admirable job of explaining to the layperson and professional alike their approach to dilemmas such as nutrition of breastfeeding versus bottle feeding, preventing childhood obesity, the ins and outs of toilet training, parenting through the dark days of adolescence, controlling a child’s exposure to pop culture, disciplining, and whether hitting your child can ever be justified.\"– Mardi Allen inPsycCRITIQUES\"Almost every day there is a story in the news announcing another supposedly scientific finding pertaining to children, parents or families.Parenting with Reasonnot only offers thoughtful guidance but, much more significantly, provides parents with ways of thinking about what they read and ways to thoughtfully weigh the evidence behind the many claims they encounter. As a result, this clearly written, engaging volume should prove useful to all parents who want the best for their children.\"– Professor Jay Belsky, Director of the Institute for the Study of Children, Families and Social Issues, Birkbeck University of London\"What makesParenting with Reasonexceptional is that it treats parents like grown-ups– overwhelmed and baffled grown-ups sometimes, to be sure, but grown-ups never the less. What they offer is something different – research-based evidence for parents to take into account when faced with the many important dilemmas involved in bringing up their children.\"– Rachel Gould, counsellor and mother of 2\"I would definitely recommend this book to friends as it is so informative and insightful. There is such a wealth of information in this book and I like the way it explodes parenting myths that are not based on science\"- Joanna Brown, mother to 5-year-old twins", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Grant was born Hiram Ulysses Grant on April 27, 1822, in Point Pleasant, Ohio, the oldest child in the family.  When he was a year old, the family moved to Georgetown, Ohio, where his father worked in the tanning business of John Brown’s father. When he was nominated for admission to West Point, Congressman Thomas L. Hamer mistakenly wrote his name as Ulysses S. Grant, which he eventually adopted, although the “S” didn’t actually stand for anything.  Some historians believe that it came from his mother’s maiden name Simpson. While at the military academy, his nickname became “Sam” for Uncle Sam.  Grant was a poor student, but managed to graduate in 1843.  During the Mexican-American War, he served under Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott. In 1848, he married Julia Boggs Dent, sister of his West Point roommate.  They had four children.  A heavy drinker, Grant was forced to resign from the military in 1854 and take a job on a farm with no success. Inheriting a slave from Julia’s father, Grant freed him, instead of selling him, even though the family was desperate for money.  When Fort Sumter was attacked, effectively beginning the Civil War, Grant volunteered to recruit and train volunteers for the Union Army. He worked his way back into the military, but due to heroism at Fort Donelson, he became known as Unconditional Surrender Grant and was finally put in command of the entire Federal Army.  In 1865, Grant was able to force the surrender of Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House, effectively ending the war. Five days later, he turned down an invitation from Lincoln to attend the theater, as he had plans to visit his family and Lincoln was assassinated.  Joining with new President Andrew Johnson, Grant traveled the country, but Johnson began to see him as a rival and sent him South. He was elected President in 1868 and served two full terms.  Although he was a popular official, others around him were found to be involved in scandals, which caused the party to not nominate him for a third term.  Instead, he and Julia went on a two year world tour. Due to being swindled out of his remaining life savings, Grant was now bankrupt and forced to sell off his possessions.  In 1884, he was diagnosed with throat cancer. Mark Twain then convinced him to write and publish his memoirs.  He finished writing them just days before his death on July 23, 1885, at the age of 63, in Wilton, New York.  He is buried in New York City.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cutting through the forest of opinion on worship, Dr. Payne gets to the heart of the matter in a brief but succinct account of what constitutes the heart of corporate worship. Nothing is more important than the public worship of God, but our age has yielded to the gods of flippancy and utilitarian- ism. It seems all too obvious to ask, what has God commanded that we do when we gather together for public worship? The answer? Here it is in his book! I cannot recommend it too highly. It deserves to be in every Christian home. --Dr. Derek Thomas, Professor of Systematic Theology, Reformed Theological Seminary, JacksonIn the Splendor of Holinessis clear, well-reasoned, practical, and, above all things, thoroughly biblical. And it is as needed as it is helpful. I will consider this as essential reading for officer training classes, and it is suitable for distribution to prospective new member classes. Through Jon Payne's work we hear the voice of our Good Shepherd on a subject that has become part of the ruins of evangelicalism. Thankfully, with pastors like Dr. Payne, our Savior's church will be fed and led. This is a tool that every Reformed pastor should want his people to know and love. ----Dr. David W. Hall, Senior Minister, Midway Presbyterian Church, Powder Springs, GA...In the Splendor of Holinessby Jon Payne is an excellent instrument to communicate the elements of true, biblical worship as well as a training manual for both the leadership and membership of a local church in fulfilling God's call to exalt in the praise of His glorious grace. --Dr. Harry L.

Jake, an American drifter in an unnamed Mexican town, becomes a suspect in the murder of a local sculptor, Pancho. The search for the true culprit unearths the town's incestuous politics, and its economic tensions. Jake, meanwhile, has a fling with the seductive but virtuous Marta, Pancho's fiancee, despite unnerving visits from Pancho's ghost. Along the book's sleepy path we meet Jordan Freeman, a semideranged African American painter, as well as Hector Munoz, a driven but unsettled chief of police who balances his allegiance to the law with duties to two separate families. The murderer's identity comes as no surprise, since Skwiot introduces few reasonable suspects. He gives his story an impressively crafted, labyrinthine setting, but some clumsy writing, overheated subplots and cliched sex scenes detract from the book's cohesion. But Jake's adventure is gripping nonetheless, largely because Skwiot does not hide its more gruesome sides and handles scenes of grotesque violence with admirable restraint. Snappy and often funny dialogue keeps the novel and its characters moving through the crumbling houses of Skwiot's town. (Dec.) FYI: Skwiot's novel Flesh won the Hemingway First Novel Prize and will be issued by Eaton Street Press.Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Nathaniel Pereira, son of a New York Jewish merchant, gets dispatched to revive an uncle's South Carolina plantation, but his story is derailed by the interspersed accounts of several generations of women driven from slavery in Timbuktu to bondage in the United States. On a slave voyage, the brutality is as vivid as the prose is lurid (\"What happened next, we can never truly know, unless we find ourselves forced into the immediate degradation sometimes suffered by the victim, usually female, when man turns beast and instinct—raw, foul, animal, devilish, destructive instinct—overpowers her\"), and once the plantation slave Liza becomes an object of purplish desire for Nathaniel (a \"tincture of desire now flavoring the spittle that we mingled in our mouths\"), readers will realize that things cannot end well. After the convoluted story finds its way to a fiery conclusion, Cheuse tacks on a rushed and tidy resolution that undermines the novel's strongest feature: its depiction of the horrors of slavery.

A few characters reappear intermittently, and careful readers will enjoy piecing together the connections. Nye sets her short stories in the U.S. and abroad, and her characters run the gamut from Texas natives to immigrants facing prejudice in this country. Current events are important to the narratives; news of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and protests in Jerusalem, for example, reach her characters via newspaper, e-mail, and TV. With prose that reads like poetry, Nye’s powerful book can be savored story by story over time or devoured in one sitting. This offers a unique perspective on today’s teenagers, who are growing up in an increasingly troubling, and increasingly small, world.

Cameron is actually finished with the corporate life; this is his last assignment before changing careers. Ella's property in Wiltshire outside of London takes his breath away, as does its beautiful owner. Recognizing Willowbrook's historic value, Cameron promptly quits his job. He will do anything so that Ella can hold on to her property--and maybe him as well if he can convince her that he is a friend, not a foe.

He feeds on the hatred building between the white men and the Comanche.  The prophesy says that there will be one, the White Eagle, who will be able to defeat the Night Stalker if he can join with the one who dreams of the eagle. Crazy Genny.  That's what they had called her because her dreams had always come true.  But as a schoolteacher in some little known Texas town, she could start over.  Genny arrives in Bakerstown, Texas, with one obsession in her heart - to forget the new dreams of the white eagle.  However, as soon as she steps off the stage and falls into the arms of a half-breed bounty hunter they call Keenan Eagle, she once again feels her sanity begin to slip.  Deep inside her heart starts breaking all over again, knowing that she has come all this way to find herself exactly where she least wants to be. The Comanche prophecy has nothing to do with Keenan Eagle's reappearance in Bakerstown.  Having been chased out of this town years before, Keenan Eagle has used the hatred of these people to make himself into the best bounty hunter in Texas.  The killing had not relieved the pain and torment he had suffered at their hands. The past does not die easily, and the fact that a new schoolteacher now touched him with a softness in her heart and tenderness in her eyes. It just couldn't be happening all over again. Although a historical by nature, Dreams of an Eagle is a most compelling fantasy romance.  Lori's talent lies in her ability to mix genres with a passionate hand.  Intensity drives Dreams of an Eagle.  Reaching new heights with this story of Comanche spirits and dream weavers, Lori spins a romance that will set hearts flying.A romance that honors fantasy fiction! True legend in the making!  You'll find yourself embracing the power of the white eagle! Lori Handeland bridges the Comanche spirit world with passion and tenderness! Karen Ellington  --Copyright © 080198 Literary Times, Inc.

Albrecht (1894-1985), a descendant of seventeenth-century English Puritans, Nantucket Quakers, and Dutch settlers on Long Island, did graduate work in history and English at Syracuse University Library School and taught in a private school in New York State until her marriage. She began working as assistant children’s librarian at the Westfield Athenaeum in Westfield, Massachusetts, in 1927, and was the first curator of its Edwin Smith Historical Museum, serving from 1928 to 1952. The museum’s Colonial Kitchen is now named after her. The Albrechts lived for many years in Westfield, where Mrs. Albrecht became interested in the town’s three centuries of history. It was to teach history that she first started writing short stories for children set among the real people and places of western Massachusetts and created the story of fictional antique doll Deborah. The stories she wrote about Deborah’s adventures in Westfield’s history eventually became the full-length children’s book _Deborah Remembers_. Publishers at first turned down a book about a doll’s memoirs, but encouraged Mrs. Albrecht to write more historical children’s stories. She then wrote _Hannah’s Hessian_, which appeared in 1958 and was an immediate success; soon her publisher was eager to publish _Deborah Remembers_, which has since become the best-known of her books. _Deborah_ was followed by three more stories set in Westfield and western Massachusetts in the colonial and Revolutionary eras, _The Grist Mill Secret_, _The Spinning Wheel Secret_, and _Susanna’s Candlestick_. Mrs. Albrecht’s granddaughter, historical author Susanne Alleyn, is delighted to bring Lillie V. Albrecht’s books, with additional annotations and background, to a new generation of young readers. Susanne Alleyn (editor & notes) is the author of _A Far Better Rest_, a retelling of Charles Dickens’ classic novel _A Tale of Two Cities_; the Aristide Ravel historical mystery series, set in Paris during the French Revolution; the nonfiction _Medieval Underpants and Other Blunders: A Writer’s (and Editor’s) Guide to Keeping Historical Fiction Free of Common Anachronisms, Errors, and Myths_; and _The Executioner's Heir: A Novel of Eighteenth-Century France_.

Despite being educated in Raffles Junior College, a prolific feeder school to America’s Ivy League universities, the author squandered the privilege by misspending his youth chasing skirts and trying to build a candy empire (it didn't work).   Charles ended up with an unimpressive set of results in junior college – a disastrous outcome in a culture where academic achievement is everything.  But a crucial turning point in his life came when Charles resolved to take the path less trodden and pursued a part-time degree from the University of London instead of settling for the guaranteed mediocrity of a local college education.   After three taxing years, he graduated with a 1st in BSc Banking & Finance and was offered a full scholarship to study at the London School of Economics and Political Science, where he attained a Masters in Finance & Economics.   Charles is a CFA charterholder, and has dreams of running a quaint restaurant in the idyllic countryside when he eventually retires.", "related": ["B00AUZ3LNI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was raised \"under a church pew\" in a fundamentalist Christian sect, an insular community in which the devout were forbidden the enjoyment of movies, pop music, television, school sports, alcohol, jewelry, makeup, skirts shorter than knee length and most other temporal pleasures worth mentioning. Today, Mr. Cordair resides and works in Napa, California, where with his wife, Linda, he enjoys some of the world's best wine and food and owns an art gallery brimming with lovely nudes and other sensuous delights. When not painting, he writes romantic, adventurous fiction that celebrates a markedly different perspective of life on earth than the one under which he was raised.      While many things in his youth were proscribed, the reading of fiction was not, and it was amidst the library shelves that his eyes were opened to a marvelous and exciting world beyond the church's walls. He immersed himself in boys' mystery books and was captivated by the stories of Stevenson, Defoe, Wyss, and Doyle. In his mid-teens, he was discovering the dramatic tales of Fleming, Follet, Sienkiewicz and Hugo, and by his late teens was basking in the ingenuity of O. Henry and the genius of Ayn Rand.      After serving four years in the United States Marine Corps, he launched his writing career. His first short story was published in 1991. To support himself while writing, he learned to paint and began taking commissions and selling his work at art fairs. The Quent Cordair Fine Art gallery was opened in 1996, and in 2008, the Cordairs moved the gallery to downtown Napa, where today they offer the finest selection of Romantic Realism in the world. Quent's present efforts are devoted to his writing. In addition to publishing short stories, he is completing a novel of grand scope inspired by his life's journey and passions.      The Cordairs live in Napa with their two cats, Lexie and Sadie, and their adopted malamute-mix, Ruby.", "related": ["B0091MHW0O"], "rank": 1678017, "title": "A Prelude to Pleasure", "author": "Quent Cordair", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But he mastered Russian as an adolescent and journeyed through Eastern and Western Europe during his successful, multifaceted career as a journalist, playwright, poet, fiction writer, ethnographer, and public speaker. Fluid in his identities and loyalties, An-sky never fit neatly into his society's categories, constantly reinventing himself as he shifted between his Russian and Jewish, traditional and radical, selves. His lifelong dedication to the Russian peasants often blinded him to their anti-Semitism, and his WWI diary reveals his sympathy for both the Russian soldiers he met as an aid worker and the Galician Jews they brutalized. His marriage to a much younger woman collapsed after she (fed up with a husband \"who had more time for his cultural mission than for his wife\") became pregnant by a lover. Although scholarly, this biography by Safran, a Stanford associate professor of Slavic literature, is lucid, accessible, authoritative, and nuanced and does justice to the restless, passionate artist and revolutionary. 26 photos; 1 map.

His father was the secretary and attorney for the bishopric of Noyon. Calvin was a brilliant scholar and studied law in Paris, Orleans and Bourges.After what he called a \"sudden conversion\" at the age of 23, Calvin became a fervent Christian and scholar of the Scripture. Calvin did not immediately break with the Roman Catholic Church, but rather worked toward its reform. His pleas for reform soon brought upon him the hatred of the Catholic Church, and in time he was banished from Paris.Calvin fled to Switzerland, broke with the Catholic Church, and joined with the reformers. In 1536 he published his famous Institutes of the Christian Religion, which was a systematic presentation of the Protestant position.In 1559 he founded what later became the University of Geneva. Here he taught his beliefs to thousands of students who in turn carried \"Calvinism\" back to their homelands throughout Europe.John Calvin died in Geneva, Switzerland on May 27, 1564.]]>", "related": ["B0065PZIPQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Did it take a while to \"find yourself\" and have you finally succeeded in your quest?Jude Hardin:Ha! Maybe I was trying to find myself, or maybe I just can't hold a job. But really, I've always been a writer, even though I've mostly paid my bills doing other things. I went to the University of Louisville right out of high school and earned my bachelor's in English, and from there I didn't really know what to do to make money. I tried freelancing for the Louisville newspaper for a while, but spending two weeks on a feature article and then getting paid $50 wasn't cutting it. I bartended for a while and then joined the Navy and learned electronics, and after the Navy I went back to bartending and did some other things and finally went back to school for a nursing degree. I've been working as an RN for fifteen years; but, through everything I've done, since I started working on My English degree when I was eighteen, really, I always thought I would sit down some day and write the great American novel. When I turned forty-three, I figured I better get started before it was too late. I thought it would be easy. I thought I would write a book and send it out to publishers and they would line up with their checkbooks and fight over it. I was deluded, of course. It wasn't easy, at all, and nobody fought over that first book. Or the second. Or the third.Q:How did you get involved in The Dead Man series and what attracted you to it?JH:It was really quite a coincidence. I was working on a horror novella called Unborn at the time with the intention of self-publishing it, and I thought I might like to collaborate with someone else on a different self-publishing project. I approached author J. A. Konrath and asked if he would be interested. He had too many other things going on at the time, but he knew that his friends Lee Goldberg and William Rabkin were rounding up a posse of writers for a series of action-adventure/horror novellas. He gave me Lee's email address, and I sent him a short query and he agreed to take a look at the first few chapters of Unborn to see if I might be a good match. I sent the chapters and he wrote me back the same night and offered me the Dead Man gig. I was ecstatic and accepted without hesitation.Q:Is it hard writing a book in a series that you didn't create? What have you learned from it?JH:It was harder than I thought it was going to be. Nobody, and I mean nobody, knows a character like the author who created that character. It's sort of jarring, like you're not in Kansas anymore. Lee Goldberg and William Rabkin loved my villain right away, but it took me longer to nail the main characters in the series--their characters. Lee and Bill are television writers, so it was interesting developing the story with them from that perspective. It was a great experience.Q:How much does Fire & Ice draw on your own experience working in a chemical plant?JH:Most of the action in Fire and Ice takes place inside the plant, so I used my memory from a job I had in the early-to-mid 90s to construct the setting. I worked there for three years. It was a big steel building with no climate control, and I can still feel the heat of the place in the summer and the cold in the winter and the noise and the smell. I often draw on real-life experiences when composing my fiction, and I think it adds a certain verisimilitude for the reader--a portal to what John Gardener calls the fictional dream--that looking things up on Google can't always match.Q:What's next up for you?JH: I recently signed a multi-book deal for my Nicholas Colt thriller series, so that's going to keep me busy for at least the next couple of years. Colt is the main character in Pocket-47, my debut novel. New York Times bestselling author Tess Gerritsen says, \"POCKET-47 sucked me in and held me enthralled. Author Jude Hardin keeps the pace frantic, the thrills non-stop, but best of all is his hero, the wonderfully ironic Nicholas Colt. This is a character I'm eager to follow through many adventures to come.\" So that's what's next up for Colt and me--many adventures to come!", "related": ["B00GHOI0NM"], "rank": 780802, "title": "Fire and Ice (Dead Man Book 8)", "author": "Jude Hardin", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.6, "rating_total": 46.0}

That can wait till January. What we need are short-and-sweet, but highly effective solutions: the kind of strategies that fit in with our hectic Christmas preparations and are easy to apply.My aim is to provide you with bite-sized inspiration, to help you feel less stressed and have a happier Christmas.Far from being lightweight, the techniques in this book are based on sound psychological principles. However, they are presented in a way that I hope is much more digestible than Grannie's mushy sprouts and I'd love them to leave you more enthusiastic about enjoying Christmas than unwrapping yet another of Aunt Mabel's reindeer jumpers.This book is not intended to be a permanent fix for all the stress sources and habits in your life. It's Christmas and you're busy. Permanent fixes can wait till the New Year! It's about relieving the stress - here and now - so you can get on with enjoying your Christmas.Some of the 101 techniques and ideas may be familiar to you. But there will also be many that offer solutions to your current holiday stresses.I hope you will try them out and find them useful.Remember: those that work best for you can help you throughout the coming year.\"De-stressing is for life, not just for Christmas.\"Wishing you a wonderful Christmas and a happy year to come.Clare Josa", "related": ["B006GIHQBQ"], "rank": 2665851, "title": "101 Ways To De-Stress Your Christmas ~ Practical Inspiration For A Happier Festive Season", "author": "Clare Josa", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He returns home from years of incarceration to discover that his house and wife are gone, the latter having left him for his best friend. To add insult to injury, a local gang leader threatens to kill Sweeney unless he repays the $65,000 he claims Sweeney owes him. So when an old Cuban associate of his deceased father approaches Sweeney and offers him a half-million dollars to smuggle his granddaughter out of Cuba, the desperate man reluctantly agrees, setting off a life-changing chain of events. Waid and Corridan have constructed a tightly written, extremely entertaining caper with an engaging, witty protagonist. The story deftly balances comedy and suspense, with Sweeney wryly narrating his increasingly bizarre situation in a self-deprecating voice. As outrageous and funny as the novel's events can be, however, the authors ground their tale and characters in emotional reality. The desperation that drives Sweeney and Maria, the woman he rescues, maintains verisimilitude, even during the story's most action-packed moments. The same can be said of the authors' fully realized depictions of Cuba and Guantanamo Bay, which lend plausibility to the novel's far-fetched turns, particularly regarding the unfolding love story. The novel also delivers several masterful twists that seem simultaneously shocking and, in retrospect, inevitable. \"GITMO\" is an appealing, satirical, action-tinged adventure.An exciting read that should appeal to fans of Carl Hiaasen, espionage thrillers and caper comedies.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 27.0}

Someone placed an incendiary device in the fire, turning it from an enjoyable spectacle into a lethal explosion that kills one woman and injures scores of others. After a second, near-fatal incident, and after the dead woman's autopsy reveals she died not from the explosion but from another cause, Max is filled with trepidation. What is happening, and can he stop the deadly chain of events? Despite his sometimes confusing plot, Darrell offers up a satisfying thriller with plenty of suspense and an eye-opening glimpse of the life of a military policeman.  --Booklist, November 1, 2011", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Some scholars take that stance to exhibit close engagement with contested doctrinal questions of the day: matters ecclesiastical, sacramental, sacerdotal. Other specialists, not least Doerksen (Univ. of New Brunswick, Fredericton, Canada) hold the opposite view, finding Herbert's position to be a welcoming centrism that avoids doctrinal disputes to focus on portraying (\"picturing\") the experiences common to all Christians in their dealings with God. Doerksen locates Herbert's model in representing these spiritual conflicts in the Psalms, especially as understood by Calvin in his widely read commentaries. Doerksen insists on a Calvin far more centrist, engaging, nonpolemical than generally imagined—concerned not centrally with abstract questions like predestination but with the day-to-day life of faith. The book will be required reading for participants on either side of the debate. For those on neither side, Doerksen's volume will prove especially valuable as a helpful chrestomathy or collection of choice passages from Calvin that illuminate (whether as sources or analogues) key motifs of Herbert's spirituality.Summing Up:Highly recommended.(CHOICE)With his customary grace and deep learning, Professor Doerksen addresses the close connection between George Herbert and John Calvin. Doerksen demonstrates that the outlook of both poet and religious reformer is fundamentally moderate, scripturally based, and deeply concerned with spiritual struggle and enlightenment. Calvin’s great influence on the English church and on Herbert himself is convincingly portrayed, with many brilliant readings of the poetry. These explications show Herbert’s often explicit yet always sensitive appropriation of Calvin’s scholarship and exegetical genius. But Doerksen wisely avoids the tendentious and easy conclusions of an influence study; rather, he gives us a remarkable work of profound and lasting significance that teaches us how to read Herbert in Calvin’s light.

Doerksen reminds us of what Bemerton’s priest-poet owed to the reformer of Geneva in his literary art: a profound sense of Psalmic form; a trained humanist’s eye for textual—especially scriptural—detail; and above all a heart-deep, unsparing, but ultimately joyous devotion. Going beyond Herbert’s well-established doctrinal and theological debts to Calvin, Doerksen juxtaposes Calvin’sInstitutesand hisCommentary on the Psalmswith scores of Herbert’s lyrics, yielding striking and fresh insights: Herbert’s likely borrowing of Calvin’s phrasing in poems like “The Flower,” “Man,” “Miserie,” and many more; and pervasive thematic parallels with Herbert’s poetic sequences on human glory and depravity, on the Eucharist, on affliction and on spiritual conflict and reconciliation. In the end, what emerges is a portrait not merely of incidental allusions, but of permeating influence. (Christopher Hodgkins, University of North Carolina at Greensboro; director, George Herbert’s Living Legacies Project; co-editor, The Digital Temple)Daniel Doerksen'sPicturing Religious Experienceis an impressive book that offers a genuinely new perspective on Herbert's devotional verse.Doerksen gives us, in Chapter 2, a powerful and compelling . . . history of the reception of Herbert's Temple. . . . . Chapter 5 . . . goes far in providing readers of Herbert with a new way of understanding the literary and spiritual paradigms that shape his lyrics.[T]his is an impressive work by a major Herbert scholar who has clearly thought as long and hard about Herbert as anyone else in the field. . . [I]t offers a rich trove of convincing new analogues for the figures and structure of George Herbert's meditative lyrics, and will prove a valuable source of information about the surprising nature of some of Herbert's biggest literary influences. (John Rogers, Yale University)The most significant publication of the year was Daniel W. Doerksen’sPicturing Religious Experience: George Herbert, Calvin, and the Scriptures...Doerksen here is...correcting misconceptions about Calvin and Calvinism, focusing in particular on the often ignored experiential dimension to Calvin’s writing. In the psalms Calvin found the full range of human emotions and responses to God, and his works were of significant influence on English Protestant writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including Herbert.(The Year's Work In English Studies)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His rational, plausible take on the complex problems, and possible solutions, while not offered as a panacea for an industry in turmoil, is fresh and bold. For once, consumers are not ignored as hapless victims, or un-savvy consumers. Instead, they are given practical tools and a voice, which may just be the future path to simultaneously cut costs and improve the quality of the care they so well deserve. Well done David!—Andre B. Van Niekerk, PhD, Dean, School of Business, Woodbury University, President, (LBR) Luxury Branding Research, Los AngelesManaged Care in the New Millenniumis more than a very readable future history of managed healthcare. It’s a call to action for those who must make decisions on how healthcare services should be delivered and how the financing on managed care should be carefully structured towards common medical and financial goals. Managed Care in the New Millennium should be required reading for everyone needing to understand how managed healthcare worked in the past, is now \"working\" in the present and how managed care will evolve in the future. Mr. Samuels presents valuable information for medical and hospital administrators, healthcare insurance companies, legislators, human resource managers, consultants, and individual patients that is long overdue.—Lawrence R. Lievense, FHFMA, FACMPE, Healthcare FINANCIAL Experts, Inc.,David Samuels’ book comes to the market just in time for health plans, physicians and hospitals to consider new options in a post reform environment. An expert in reimbursement and the mathematical fundamentals of prospective payment for over three decades, David has updated his original book, Capitation, in line with the refocused needs of providers and payers to collaborate over value instead of fighting one another over manipulated fees schedules and volume. In short order we get a 15-year update on where managed care went wrong in its reimbursement and how the use of performance data and more thoughtful application of care management techniques can build accountability into a mutual framework of payment and service for purchasers and providers. The author then goes one step further into offering innovation upon a theme to expand the thinking and capabilities of providers and purchasers to share savings and put in place key performance indicators using predictable formulas.

To be fair, I was born in Miami (in Jackson Memorial hospital) and lived there 27 years. After leaving, I often came back, and I continue to visit to this day. Old Florida is gone, for sure; but new Miami is not a bad place by any means. The traffic's bad, I-95 is a nightmare, South Beach is faux, and the Grove is too hip for itself; but the place is international, now. It has a distinct personality, something it had lacked for decades.I wanted to capture that kinetic energy and multi-national flavor, while still making it seem like home to the characters in my story. In a lot of South Florida novels, the main characters hate Miami; they hate the people and the place. I love Miami - the people and the places; the smells and the sights; the light and the sky. \"Versions of the Truth\" has (as one reader said) a very strong sense of place, and of Miami in particular. She asked me how I was able to capture, so accurately and colorfully, the locations in the book. Simple: I've been to every one of them and found them all to be special in their own way.Miami is also a city of intrigue. It has a history - not always pretty, but often exciting...and dark. I wanted to explore that dark intensity with characters who knew and loved all that Miami was and is. They may be caught up in some awful aspects of city life, there; but they accept South Florida for all that it is - or at least do their best to cope with it. So my story unfolded as one of mysteries left alone for too long, sadness that festers, longing for old times; and what would two brothers do to solve a family mystery if they didn't see, had never seen, and apparently could never see, eye to eye about their own history (or anything else for that matter). One a rich playboy, the other a salaried cop; both the sons of one of South Florida's most notorious drug importers.Add to that an international conspiracy with (factually accurate) covert operations based real agencies and events, today - and I had my story. Lots of research, an extra trip (or three) to Miami to cruise my locations and soak up the feel of those places and the people in them, and \"Versions of the Truth\" became as real for me as Miami, which is more of a character itself in the story than a setting. I hope, as always, that you will enjoy this story of searching for one's dark roots in the darkest city of light: Miami - with its own \"Versions of the Truth.\"", "related": [], "rank": 2637029, "title": "Versions of the Truth", "author": "Glenn A.

Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in 1804 in the city of Salem, Massachusetts to Nathaniel Hathorne and the former Elizabeth Clarke Manning. His ancestors include John Hathorne, the only judge involved in the Salem witch trials who never repented of his actions. Nathaniel later added a \"w\" to make his name \"Hawthorne\" in order to hide this relation. He entered Bowdoin College in 1821, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1824, and graduated in 1825. Hawthorne anonymously published his first work, a novel titled Fanshawe, in 1828. He published several short stories in various periodicals which he collected in 1837 as Twice-Told Tales. The next year, he became engaged to Sophia Peabody. He worked at a Custom Houseand joined Brook Farm, a transcendentalist community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem, the Berkshires, then to The Wayside in Concord. The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to The Wayside in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, and was survived by his wife and their three children. -wikipedia", "related": ["B0063XL6U6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The record is clear to anyone who bothers to look. I spent a great deal of time in Europe at Vimy Ride, at Arras, at Amiens and many other far off places including Jigsaw Wood, Burlon Wood and Castle Boves. I stood in now peaceful fields that were once battlefields of the Hindenburg Line which Canadians shed blood to cross. And I said a silent prayer over the hallowed ground where many remain. The evocative aspect of WWI Commonwealth War Grave Commission cemeteries are that they are the spots on which the soldiers drew their last breaths and almost all are situated on ground that leads up hill. The fact that Canada was not yet a formalized nation but a Dominion at the close of the war may be the reason that the country has not been given the credit it is due. In a small way I hope this short book opens some eyes. I am not Canadian yet I have a profound respect for guts, heroism and the tenacity expended to keep pushing forward when the war was at its darkest. There are few wars which can match the horror of WWI with perhaps the exception of the American Civil War. And that is why I believe people are so fascinated by these events. They illustrate the limit of human endurance as well as the depth of its depravity. General Sir Arthur Curries sums up war best at the end of this book and it is fitting that he has the last word. I hope you enjoy the story.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As soon as I could reach the counter top my mother gave me free reign in the kitchen. I was allowed to mix and mix and mix, building my masterpieces. They were nothing more that wild combinations of flour, sugar, spices and water; but, to me it was creating at its best. When I finished with each endeavor, I tossed it all and happily cleaned up the kitchen, looking forward to the next time. My creative spirit in the kitchen had taken root.My first adventure in writing came my senior year in high school when I decided to take a writing correspondence course, which was very forward looking for the time. I experienced the first thrill of putting pen to paper, and all these years later it is still one of the most pleasurable activities in my life.If I had my druthers, I would write all the time. In fact, that is pretty much what I do because I have reached a point in my life where it is now possible.In addition to the \"Mama Legacy Cookbook Series\" I have two other cookbooks, \"Cake Making Made Easy\" and \"Candy Making Made Easy.\" They are not only cookbooks; they provide detailed instructions on how to make cakes and candy. The cake book includes 60 delicious cake recipes and the candy book includes 17 starter recipes so the instructions can be applied immediately.I loved writing both instruction books, especially the candy book, because it brought back so many wonderful memories of candy-making with my family on those long summer nights when I was a young girl.", "related": ["B00E3ERICC"], "rank": 2035440, "title": "Sauce Recipes - 50 Tasty Choices (Mama's Legacy Series Book 7)", "author": "Nancy N Wilson", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 4.8889, "rating_total": 44.0}

I was part home schooled in high school and found it gave me\n flexible time to spend on my hobbies, such as drawing and writing.One\n feature I enjoy about writing is the ability to share a story/moral\nwith people and it can be delivered in varying narrative contexts such\nas board game creation, cartooning/storyboarding, comics and video\ngames. I've always been a fan of mixing media to tell a story, which is\nwhy for Mental Damnation I included a lot of visuals through the glyphs\nand illustrations.

No matter how much lubricant Ashley sprayed into the nooks and crannies, it always stuck. Her mechanic brother had tinkered with the motor and made it purr like a kitten, but he hadn't had a chance to work on the radio, air conditioner, or top.We stepped over the ruts in the field road and started crossing through the weeds between the road and the gate. We all were dressed for the adventure in jeans and sneakers. I noticed from the back and in the shadows that it was hard to tell Ashley and Emily apart. Both had shoulder-length brown hair, though Ashley's was a couple of shades darker and Em's had natural red highlights. And each wore a dark hoodie--Ash in black and Em in purple. I might be indistinguishable from Ashley and Emily in the night, too, because of my black hair, except that mine was in a pony-tail while theirs hung loose. My denim jacket was light blue, and I put it on because I didn't want to lug it around anymore.Halfway to the gate, we stepped out of the shade of the trees and the light from the full hunter's moon flooded over us. Bella's short blonde curls, glittering when the moonlight hit them, and pink and white windbreaker made her stand out from the rest of us.\"Hey, hand me that bottle,\" Ashley called out to Bella.After Bella turned it over, Ashley tipped it up, sipped, and then handed it off again. It made the rounds twice by the time we got close to the gate.\"Should we wait here?\" Bella took the final swig and put the top on it. The bottle was already half empty, but none of us were buzzed.\"If they don't show up soon, let's leave.\" Emily pulled the edges of her hoodie together and crossed her arms. \"No fun without the guys. And it's getting creepier by the minute.\"\"We could go in and wait for them,\" Ashley suggested. \"Someone might see us, as bright as the moonlight is.\"\"Yeah, Weird Willy might be skulking around,\" Bella said.\"Don't call him that,\" I said. \"He's not weird, just quiet.\"\"Whatev.\"\"Besides, it's his parents' farm. If anyone has a right to be out here, he does.\"\"Okay!\"It was a sore point between us. Well, between me and most of the kids our age. Will Jones had been three years ahead of us in school. He was tall and tanned and good looking in that rugged, outdoorsy way, with thick black hair that always looked like it needed a trim and serious golden brown eyes. But he wasn't one of the popular kids and wasn't on any team sports. He'd taken Ag and been involved in 4H and Future Farmers of America because of his family's farm. He was quiet and kept to himself, though, and that made him a target.The year we were freshmen, he was a senior. He and I had study hall the same period, and on nice days we were allowed to go outside and sit on the bleachers. Will and I sat together sometimes, but we hardly ever talked. I was fifteen and he was nearly nineteen at the time, so we didn't have much in common. But I got to know him a little, and I could never understand the nickname the others had given him. He wasn't weird at all.I saw him around town occasionally, and we'd chat a few minutes when we had the time. Sometimes, I'd see him with one girl or another, but he never seemed to be serious about any of them. He was still tall and tanned and now brawny from working on the family farm. And still soft-spoken and reserved.\"But it's the quiet ones you have to watch out for,\" Bella added and dodged when I faked a swing at her.We ended up throwing an arm around each other's shoulders and charging the last few yards to the gate. We all had words from time to time, but the annoyance never lasted. We were friends. Opening the gate was easy enough, and we all filed in. The last to enter, I secured the latch behind us.Before us lay the maze, covering about four acres of land--or, as Will Jones once explained to me in study hall to help me visualize the size, like four football fields laid out two by two. Densely sown cornstalks, eight to nine feet high, growing out of the earth formed the two-foot thick walls. It was impossible to see through or over them. The dirt-packed but dusty pathways between the walls were five or six feet wide, the distance across the tractor that had cut swaths through the stalks to create the maze pattern. I knew from experience over the years that rain would make the paths slick with mud and half the fun during those times was making it through the maze without slipping down. Fortunately, autumns were usually dry, and this night was no exception. Not a cloud in the sky.\"I'm calling Jordan.\" Emily dug into her jeans' pocket for her cell phone.\"I'm trying to reach Ryan now.\" Ashley, holding her cell out in front of her, moved around in different directions. \"That's funny. I can't get a sig--\"The sharp, loud rustle of cornstalks made Ashley break off mid-word. Before any of us could react, feral howls and growls came from inside the maze. The nearest wall of cornstalks exploded apart and something rushed at us hard and fast.", "related": [], "rank": 2243107, "title": "The Legend of Jack Straw", "author": "Lane Champion", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sherwin's “coming out” happens when Muriel's brother starts guiding him behind Sherwin's mother's back. With a plethora of secondary characters who add both humor and heart to this tale, two endearing lead players, and Regency England to round out the story, A GRAND DECEPTION is a delightfully entertaining and quick read. --Romance Reviews TodayIn  this Regency romance, Marks marries the trappings of courtship with  touches of comic relief.

She now has two other published titles in the humorous memoir genre.  \"I PROMISE TO STAY MARRIED (THIS TIME)\" was published in July, 2011.  \"CHILDREN, I'M HOME!\" is her latest published work.  She also writes humorous verses, most of which are reflections of senior life, and has amassed a compilation of over forty selections.   Ms. Becker is by profession a tax attorney, licensed in Illinois and New York, with a concentration in income tax.  She is also a licensed Florida Family Mediator and currently lives in West Palm Beach, Florida, with her husband, who is a retired book illustrator and animation artist. Lea holds an undergraduate degree from DePaul University and a law degree from DePaul Law School.  She also attended classes at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University and Columbia College in Chicago.  She is an active senior and continues to work part-time, as well as pursue her writing.  She is fascinated with the study of science, psychology, art and nature.  A key change in her life occurred when she remarried and moved to upstate New York after years of being a single working mom.  Her husband was her high school sweetheart and he was a widower living in Ulster County who had become a passionate country living outdoorsman, while Lea had been a long-term city girl with most of her social and professional ties to Chicago. Although Ms. Becker's humorous memoirs appear to be lighthearted on the surface, there is considerable psychological introspection in her work, since she is a survivor of a difficult childhood and has had to adapt to technological and lifestyle changes which span three generations.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I was born in Houston Texas an only child full of opportunity from a supportive family. When I was in my adolescent years I was involved in baseball for about 7 years where I was trained to be the best I could be in the sport. Later in middle school I was involved in band where I learned to play the saxophone. Learning music is a seed planted in all of us. It becomes a gift you'll never forget. Somehow I became involved in BMX freestyle and breakdancing and started to love being good at what I was subjected to in this world. Becoming a young man I started to learn that edcuation with skills can bring promising results when you put your mind to it. In 1997 I graduated a program in medical administration with a 3.5 GPA. The clerical skills learned there landed me a job with NASA as a dispatching clerk. There I typed reports daily on material being moved on and off the base in support of our spacestation. I went back to school for radiography and billing and coding which also inhanced my clerical skill. I was fascinated by the medical imaging world. After 3 years of radiography I trained into MRI. Those images really inspired me to produce quality diagnostic scans where a Radiologist would report on pathological findings. During all these years I did understand claustrophobia on a one on one basis. I learned how to communicate effectively with all my patients to get them throught there exams. There are only about two secrets to beating the MRI claustrophobia blues and I hope you uncovered in this book. Last I would like to say thank you for buying my book and hope that one day I will be scanning you physically in hopes to comfort your experience with MRI.

An emphasis on characters' emotional problems may initially dismay readers drawn to the derring-do prevalent in that earlier yarn, but here the author adds important SF twists, and allows suspense, as well as military and political action, to run high. Fans of military SF will especially enjoy reading about Tristan's training, some of it based on Asian martial arts.

What followed was years of writing workshops as well as correspondence courses in writing for children through the Institute of Children’s Literature in Connecticut.  She credits the award winning author, Troon Harrison, as the instructor who helped her find her literary voice.  Marta’s first work of juvenile fiction, BEING SAM, NO MATTER WHAT was published in 2005, followed by EVERY WHICH WAY BUT KUKU! in 2006.  With her more recent endeavors, Marta has shifted her writing focus to “women’s suspense”, a genre she fondly describes as having “strong female protagonists with closets full of nasty skeletons and the odd murder or two to complicate their already complicated lives”.

Williamson is the story of Ben, a researcher of particle physics. Out for a jog one night, it initially appears he's in the wrong place at the wrong time as he catches a glimpse of a UFO before it vanishes. The military descends upon him and whisks him away for questioning, leaving him unaware that for Elle, the pilot of the UFO, he was in exactly the right place, at the right time. CAI, her Computer Artificial Intelligence, identified him as one who possibly had enough knowledge to help her solve the mystery of Tachyons, a solution she desperately needs before she can time travel to the day her parents are killed in a car accident. With limited time, they must evade Russian agents, the US Military, and MI6, all the while trying to perfect the equations of Tachyon.I liked this story, and though it is a sci-fi romance, J.M.J. Williamson didn't overwhelm the plot with too much technical information or equations. The budding romance between Ben and Elle wasn't overshadowed by the layered plot of time travel. It unfolds nicely throughout the story, and was handled well without graphic descriptions. There is a very nice balance here with all aspects, and you get a really good sense of all the characters involved. It's the good character building and an entirely feasible, well laid out plot that moves the story along at a good pace despite the changes of POV that occur often. Collision will be enjoyed by sci-fi and romance readers alike, as it has inter-woven elements that are appealing to both genres without being overpowering in either aspect.", "related": ["B00H30I99O"], "rank": 452489, "title": "Collision eBook", "author": "JMJ Williamson", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her vision is to make sure that our troops know how much they are respected, appreceited, admired and honored on a daily basis.       \"I was raised around soldiers, tanks, guns and the military lifestyle. I clearly remember the war in Viet Nam and how our country was torn apart. I can still hear “Taps” being played at my brother, Mike’s funeral, and seeing my father cry, a heart break that will never heal. I went along my life’s path, doing my best to be a productive citizen, and a good American. Then 9-11 happened. Until the moment I witnessed the second airplane hit the tower, I thought that had I ever been in a war, I would have lay down and played dead until it was over. That day changed everything for all of us. I knew that I would stand shoulder to shoulder with the strongest and bravest among us. But from my place on my small path, I had nowhere to put my newly found machismo. Until one day…      Finally, an avenue to possibly touch a soldier’s day. Finally, something I could contribute to the war effort, if you will. My verbal victory garden. So began my campaign. In my letters I tried to talk to each and every one of them as if they were seated across from me at the dining room table in my home. I hope that feeling transcended the distance those letters traveled. I hope the letters left them with a feeling that there was a candle in the window expressly for them. And that they were thought about. That was my intention.\"        Margaret continues diligently sending letters to our troops in all theaters.

He was educated in Philadelphia Public Schools and, after three years of military service, at home and abroad, at the University of Pennsylvania, where he developed a strong interest in China and Chinese literature. He also immersed himself in  east Asian political and cultural history in general, learning Korean and Japanese in addition to Chinese. Being at Pennsylvania in the 70s and 80s was quite an enriching experience for one interested in China, as so many Chinese came there to learn and teach, from every region of China. Nathan began translating the Ping Yao Zhuan as a labor of love in 1980, upon finding an old edition in the University's Van Pelt Library, and it became, in a way, one thread of his life's work as a writer, poet, translator and language educator. Since 1983 he has lived and worked abroad, in Japan and China as teacher and writer, teaching in many Japanese universities, public and private schools for two decades. In 2001-2 he taught English and studied Chinese intensively at Beijing Foreign Studies University's Beidaihe Training Center. He also spent two recent years spent teaching ESL and Chinese in South Florida. After his return to Japan in 2005, Nathan has lived in Takasaki, Gunma Prefecture, with his wife Masako and US-educated daughter, Naomi. After receiving an advance review copy of this book and completing various revisions, Mr. Sturman died of cancer on June 6, 2008.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The 1913 Derby remains the most fascinating and elusive of contests, and Tanner weaves its many strands into a compelling narrative that make it racing's book of the year.' Racing Post  'I am currently reading the tome and can thoroughly recommend it.' Guardian Sports  'The mix of tragedy, rancour and resentment is cleverly exposed by Tanner whose painstaking research produces some fascinating moments...It all makes for a fascinating tale told beautifully by Tanner in a very readable style. Racing enthusiasts need not be concerned that the book deals principally with the suffragette movement - there is much here to enjoy and to learn about racing in the Edwardian era.' Kingsley Klarion  'An impeccably researched interweaving of real-life racing thriller with social history.' The Spectator  'Tanner has put together a gripping book and also a most valuable social history of a time well gone.' The Irish Field 'Tanner has examined all the interlinking events in forensic fashion in a landmark book, the Suffragette Derby - the research that Tanner must have put into the book was exhaustive but it was well worthwhile - this book is a huge contribution to turf literature and a compulsive read.' Blackpool Gazette 'Michael Tanner has scoured public and private sources, drawing on unpublished diaries and interviews with descendants of the principals, to provide a definitive account of what led to the events of that day and how they unfolded - In a Channel 4 documentary earlier this year, Clare Balding attempted to make a case for her so doing. Tanner's evidence is far more convincing - Tanner is an acclaimed racing writer - His near forensic examination of the facts and his analysis of events, make this a thoroughly absorbing read.'

Undercover FBI agent, Donovan Prentice, is posing as a lawyer to gain access to the documents. Donovan thinks there is evidence of terrorism hidden in those papers and it is up to him to convince Alaina to hand them over. Anna Wells makes it clear from their first early morning drugstore meeting that they'll be doing battle in and out of the courtroom. The sparks fly immediately and after their first meeting you just know that all that simmering sexual tension has to boil over...eventually.Anna Wells' story has all of the elements to make it great; fast paced witty banter, gunfire, sexual tension, and a mystery. Even though Donovan thinks Alaina may also be a suspect, he is unable to fight his attraction to her, nor hers to him, and the inner struggle adds needed depth to the story. Although I really liked Donovan, at times he came across as sleazy so I struggled with loving him and loathing him. And the sex? Well, that was as hot as I knew it would be and I love that Alaina tried to convince herself it was just sex when she found out he was lying. I mean, I understand lying to yourself, and it being his job is no excuse, but even Elise didn't believe her and I found the interaction particularly hilarious. Trust Me is a funny erotic tale that touches on some important privacy and civil rights issues that are more than a little relevant in the United States today.Anna Wells has proven herself to be a solid story teller, capable of weaving love, sex, humor, and intrigue into one great tale.", "related": ["B00JORD84K"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 35, "rating_average": 4.1143, "rating_total": 144.0}

This is the best modern study of Clara Schumann available in English.\"—New York Times Book Review\"The marvelous originality of Reich's book lies in the way she places the marriage and the celebrated friendship with Brahms in perspective among other critical factors in Clara's life. Reich's painstaking, scholarly detail and feminist insight recover not merely the events in the life, dramatic as they were, but its major themes, movements and connecting threads.\"—Women's Review of Books\"Reich's first edition contributed to the increase in interest in Clara Schumann and in the performances and recordings of her music. The publication of this revised edition will continue to stir interest with the availability of new documents, letters and the extensive list of newly published music; further, this new edition offers a much more detailed look at Clara Schumann's life and music.\"—Journal of the International Association of Women in Music\"In addition to telling us the story of Clara Schumann's life, Nancy B. Reich . . . includes chapters on Clara Schumann's children, her work as editor, performing artist, and teacher, and her relationships with Brahms, Joachim, Liszt, and other major figures of the era. . . . There is also a list and analysis of Clara Schumann's compositions. . . . Reich has written an eminently readable, well-researched, and thoughtful book that gives historical and psychological insights into one of the major artists of the nineteenth century.\"—Classical Music Guide Forums\"Foremost among the strengths of this book is the delineation of Schumann's character. While pointing out the overwhelming challenges and devastating losses that dogged her entire life, Reich makes no attempt to paint her as a saint or hero. . . . The first edition of this book has gained acceptance as a standard resource on Clara Schumann. This revised edition preserves the strengths of the first edition while adding additional information and a fine-tuning of the presentation, assuring that Reich's work will remain central to the subject for the foreseeable future.\"—Notes: Journal of the Music Library Association", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She believes she’s being charged with aggravated battery, but at the sentencing hearing, she learns she’s being charged with attempted murder. While she lets readers know that the victim is an ex-husband, she saves the rest of the details for later. After describing her desperate situation in jail, Van Sant recounts her life story, beginning with a somewhat troubled childhood thanks in part to her alcoholic father. A pregnancy at age 20 helped spur her into marrying her boyfriend. Having never cooked a meal or washed a load of laundry, the young wife found herself in over her head, but it was her husband’s habit of sowing his wild oats that brought about the marriage’s end. For the author, that began a pattern of marriages that didn’t work out. Abuse, both mental and physical, men who rely on her to pay the bills, and an ex-husband who kidnaps their infant daughter and runs away to Canada are just some of the issues with which she had to contend. Thanks to Van Sant’s colorful life and the characters she ends up marrying, the memoir is free of dull moments. While readers will likely cringe at some of the decisions she made, including the one that landed her in jail, she remains a sympathetic figure whom readers will want to see find the right path.An engaging cautionary tale; those who’ve had their own relationship struggles will relate and may even realize that they don’t have it as bad as they thought.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Os heterônimos, diferentemente dos pseudônimos, são personalidades poéticas completas: identidades que, em princípio falsas, se tornam verdadeiras através da sua manifestação artística própria e diversa do autor original. Entre os heterônimos, o próprio Fernando Pessoa passou a ser chamado ortônimo, porquanto era a personalidade original. Entretanto, com o amadurecimento de cada uma das outras personalidades, o próprio ortônimo tornou-se apenas mais um heterônimo entre os outros. Os três heterônimos mais conhecidos (e também aqueles com maior obra poética) foram Álvaro de Campos, Ricardo Reis e Alberto Caeiro. Um quarto heterônimo de grande importância na obra de Pessoa é Bernardo Soares, autor do Livro do Desassossego, importante obra literária do século XX. Bernardo é considerado um semi-heterônimo por ter muitas semelhanças com Fernando Pessoa e não possuir uma personalidade muito característica, ao contrário dos três primeiros, que possuem até mesmo data de nascimento e morte (exceção para Ricardo Reis, que não possui data de falecimento). Por essa razão, José Saramago, laureado com o Prêmio Nobel, escreveu o livro O ano da morte de Ricardo Reis.", "related": ["B007PVHTSS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Photo: © CorbisWhat can a portrait teach us?Common Core takes advantage of every opportunity to build students’ cultural literacy. That is why the cover of each book we publish is illustrated with an important work of painting, sculpture, or architecture. We select images that we know students will love to look at again and again. These works relate to ideas taken up in the book. In the 1800s, artist George Catlin painted a series of portraits of Native American leaders. Unique in his time, Catlin painted Native Americans not as types but as individuals, much the same way as presidents and national heroes historically had been painted. The power of individualism is a central theme of the books that comprise the basis for this volume.Common Core, Inc.

His favorite classical authors are Voltaire, Goethe, Dante Alighieri, Kafka, Kant, Camus, Scott and Emerson. Other favorite authors include Joyce, Trumbo, Remarque, Orwell, Huxley, Golding, and Philip K. Dick, who he refers to as a “prophet”.  Mr. Pastor often pays reverence and homage to these authors and many more. His books contain numerous allusions to these other works, but blended with references to modern pop culture. Yet you will find J. F. Pastor’s work to be unique and extra-ordinary. His first five novels have themes, storylines, plots, and character arcs, the likes of which you will not find in any other book. You will find his writing very politically incorrect, what he refers to as “button-pushing.” His storylines can be dark yet enlightening, profane yet profound, gut-wrenching yet soul-inspiring, intellectual but down-to-earth enjoyable to read.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Doug's book is a joy to follow, well thought through and well written. The camera company should be employing Doug to write their cameras manuals!-Robert D.A Pro Right There with You- If you want to get the camera up and running with the feeling of a pro right there with you then I would strongly recommend it. He walks you through setting the camera up and gives you his reasoning for the settings. He leaves the door open to change them based on your level of experience. After the basic settings tour Doug then gets down to the heart of this great camera: the custom settings and focus system. His explanation is first class and he explains how various custom settings are related to each other. Doug does a fine job explaining what can be very intimidating areas of this camera. All in all a great read.  Camera in one hand and reader in the other and dig in.-Tim S.A Must-Have Accessory- What a great addition to my bag. This is a well written, full body of work that explains, in plain English, how to get the most out my new camera. Doug provides the knowledge and experience to bring you to the next level. I look forward to learning more every time I open the book.-StevenI now feel that I have control over the camera.It's the first guide I've read which has taken me through all the settings in an understandable way.-Peter S.Really Focuses on the \"Why\"- I found the (official) manual good for understanding how to set things up but not much on the why - this book really focuses on the \"why.\"-Benoit A.This manual is a clearly written,concise and useful explanation of the rationale for the seemingly infinite and often confusing settings options.-W.L.S.It's clear, concise and gets to the heartof the camera's multiple and often confusing options. Very highly recommended - for experienced user and beginner alike.-G.S.A.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
