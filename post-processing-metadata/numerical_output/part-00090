In a fogbound setting evocative of Conan Doyle, newly appointed Superintendent Monk and his river patrol watch helplessly as two young lovers plunge to their deaths from a bridge. Monk's exhaustive investigation, aided by his activist wife, Hester, soon reveals a deadly conflict between the two lovers' families over the hasty construction of a vast sewer complex built to prevent a recurrence of the \"Great Stink\" and typhoid epidemic of 1863. A riveting pursuit of an unknown assassin brings Monk in contact with the city's most destitute, one of several incidents highlighting the growing conflict between the abject poor and those whose houses have such luxuries as sewers and gas pipes. Some readers may have trouble with the cockney dialogue, but all will relish the last-minute twists that lead to a compelling resolution.(Mar.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The novel opens with an arresting scene: Nathan Staples, a commercially successful but artistically failed novelist, is in the process of hanging himself. Nathan survives, and decides instead to bring Mary, now 19, the daughter he hasn't seen since she was four, to the island on a writing fellowship. Mary Lamb makes the seventh member of the Fellowship,  and she has no idea that Nathan is her father, or why she was chosen for her stipend or, for much of her residency on Foal Island, the nature of the Fellowship and their odd frequency of incidents \"in the risk-taking area.\" Kennedy is richly, boldly imaginative, both in the scenes she conceives and in the language and images she uses to convey them, alternating exposition with internal monologue and scraps of manuscript and winding from one arresting figure of speech to the next. Foal Island is much closer to Prospero's Isle than it is to the London literary scene which Kennedy excoriates with lacerating wit (\"This is what hell will be like, you know?\" says one editor about to leave a London publisher's party. \"In heaven there are many mansions and in hell there are many houses all of them publishing\"). Kennedy's complex, prickly and uncompromising quest for an understanding of the life of the spirit draws her into dark waters, but she keeps a tenacious hold on warmer truths, too the human heat-seeking instinct is at the generous heart of her tale. (July 26)Forecast: This is Kennedy's biggest, most ambitious work yet, and one of the most important literary novels of the summer.

She lives in her parents' garage apartment, and works for them cleaning cabins at their vacation lodge. Her older sister, Ruth, decides to play matchmaker for Hannah, setting her up with Will Garrett, the newly elected County Sheriff. Will is best friends with Ruth's boyfriend, Destiny's Chief of Police, Ray Palmer.    Hannah and Emma both fall head-over-heels for Will's kind and gentle, yet strong and protective personality. The feeling is mutual for Will, who starts spending a great deal of time with Hannah. Destiny is a typical small town, everyone is involved in everyone else's business, and the townspeople can't help but be concerned for Janie Zimmerman, who is Hannah and Ruth's childhood friend. Janie has been looking more sickly and weak as the days pass. When Janie dies and her death is determined to be murder, rumors start to fly that Ruth wanted Janie out of the way because she was in love with Janie's boyfriend. Hannah steps up to get to the bottom of the mystery and save her sister's honor.     In the midst of the investigation and Hannah and Will's newfound relationship, Hannah begins to pursue her dreams of opening a mystery bookstore, named Death Warmed Over. Ruth's help in this venture is crucial.    DEATH WARMED OVER is the first book in the Death Warmed Over mystery series. Cindy Daniel is off to an excellent start. The characters never take themselves too seriously, and this endears them to the reader. Hannah is trying to do the best for her daughter, but she doesn't sacrifice her own chance at happiness. And it's great to read about characters who enjoy chocolate as much as I do! Ruth's character makes a good contrast to Hannah's--she's wild where Hannah is conservative, spontaneous where Hannah is orderly. This gives the story balance.    The pacing of DEATH WARMED OVER is brisk and doesn't drag. I --M. Parcel (Kelso, WA USA) - Amazon reviewerI'm not a reader and I really loved this book.....,     I can't tell you the last time Ii read a book. Being from the area mentioned though, I had to have it.   I think I read it in just a few days. It was about a family that was loving, supportive, honest and Texan. Kind of like mine. You love your family, but don't always have to like them.   5 stars...... --Robin Cieszinski (Dallas, TX United States)A light, fun read!    Hannah and her six-year-old daughter, Emma, move back to Hannah's parents house following her divorce. She is going to help her parents out by cleaning cabins at their lodge. It doesn't take long for her to decide that she wants to open a bookstore instead.   Hannah meets Will Garrett through her sister, Ruth, and Ruth's boyfriend Ray. Sparks fly between Hannah and Will, but Hannah has trouble handling the romance after her divorce.   A suspicious death in occurs town. Ruth seems to have a motive for the crime. Since Will is the sheriff and Ray is the chief of police, they are sure to get to the bottom of the story. Hannah has to help get her sister out of this jam.   Hannah and Ruth make you laugh with the sibling rivalry that is common even as an adult. When the chips are down the loyalty kicks in, Hannah is right there to help her sister in any way that she can.   The characters are real without any added fluff. They are from a small town that I can easily relate to.   Death Warmed Over is a quick light read that will make you giggle at times with the sisterly jabs. However you can't wait to get to the end to see who really committed the murder. Cindy Daniel is an up and coming author with more to come with this series. I can't wait to see the new ones coming up. --Ingrid Taylor \"Author, Book Reviewer\" (Springfield, MO USA) - Amazon reviewer", "related": ["B004XJ4M1C"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She had intended to make her way to one of the pavilions put up for the wedding celebrations, but had become distracted by the magical, intoxicating atmosphere of it all.The male voice was authoritative and deep—velvet-rough, Keira decided, as though the nap of the fabric had been brushed to reveal the strength that lay beneath the silky surface. Just hearing it made her feel as though that same fabric had brushed against her own skin, and the sensual effect on her sent small electric shocks of awareness darting through her. His accent was recognisably English public school, and university honed: the accent of a man who took both position and wealth for granted as his right of birth. The accent of privilege, power and pride.Would her accent give away as much about her? Would he sense the Northern accent she had learned to conceal beneath the tones she knew worked best for her in her business as an interior designer?She turned towards him, her lips framing an apology for the fact that she had been so intent on watching what was going on that she had inadvertently blocked his way along the narrow path that led from the courtyard to the gardens. Her eyes widened as she realised she was looking at the most sexually compelling and dangerous man she had ever seen.As though her whole body and all her senses had been hard-wired for this moment, every nerve-ending she possessed was reacting to him with a silent but violent intensity. It was like being physically attacked by her own body—like being mugged and having the protection of her normal caution stolen from her. She was frozen and wide-eyed, as aware of the dangerous nature of his impact on her as if she had been standing in front of an oncoming train.The power of his sexuality slammed into her, leaving her unable to defend herself from it.Jay didn't know why he was wasting his time standing here letting the woman stare at him in the way that she was, blatant in her awareness of him.Admittedly she was beautiful. But she wasn't the only European guest attending the wedding, though with her looks and figure she would have stood out no matter where she was. Tall and elegant, she had a refined air about her whilst the lush curves of her body and the soft fullness of her mouth said clearly that hers was the kind of sensual nature he most enjoyed in a woman.In bed she would display a sensuality that came straight from the most erotic pages of theKama Sutra,enticing any man who became her lover into pleasuring her until she cried out against the intensity of that pleasure. He could see her now, her dark hair spread out against the pillows, her eyes luminous with arousal, the lips of her sex curving softly and moistly, waiting to open to his touch like the petals of a lily open to the heat of the sun, exposing the pulsing heart of their being, giving that most intimate part of themselves up to the sun's heat, spreading their petals in open appeal for its possession, the scent of their longing filling the air.The sudden intensity of the sharp surge of desire hardening his body caught him off guard, causing him to shift his weight from one foot to the other.At thirty-four he was more than old enough to be able to control his physical reactions to a desirable woman, and yet somehow this woman had him reacting to her so fast that he had been caught by the wayward direction of his own thoughts—and his desire for her.She hadn't made any attempt to don the costume that the female Indian guests were wearing so confidently and elegantly, as some European women did when attending Indian celebrations. But none of those things would normally have been enough to counteract his belief that she was covertly suggesting to him that she was available, and thus by the law of probability was also available to any other man who might have chanced to cross her path. He waited for the desire she had aroused within him to be chilled by the distasteful idea he had deliberately conjured up, and frowned with the recognition that it had not done so.He was even more stunned when he heard himself asking her, 'Bride or groom?''I'm sorry…''I was asking which side of the wedding party you belong to,' he told her.His choice of the word 'belong' stung her pride and her mind with the familiar pain of knowing that there was no one in this world to whom she 'belonged', but it was somehow overwritten by the intoxicating fact that his question suggested that he wanted to prolong his contact with her.He was undeniably handsome. Tension bit into her, as though some instinct deep inside her had pressed a warning button, but to her shock her senses were refusing to listen to it. How old was she? Certainly too old to stare in open awe at a man, no matter how good-looking he was. And yet, like a child hooked on the adrenalin kick of sugar, despite knowing that it wasn't good for her, she just couldn't stop looking at him.He was wearing a light tan linen suit of the kind favoured by wealthy Italians, and everything about him breathed cosmopolitan upper-class privilege, education and wealth. His skin had the right kind of warm olive tint to it to carry off the suit, just as his body had the height and the muscles. Were his shoulders really that broad? It looked like it from the way he moved.And yet, despite everything about him that proclaimed old money and social position, Keira could sense within him another darker side, a marauding, dangerous ruthlessness that clung to him so powerfully she could almost smell it.She fought not to be drawn into the aura of magnetism that surrounded him. If anything was intoxicating her then surely it must be this most wonderful of wedding venues.Originally a summer palace and hunting lodge owned by an ancient maharaja, it had been converted into a luxury five-star hotel. Formerly an island palace, it was now connected to the shore by a handsome avenue, but the impression created as one approached was that the palace and gardens floated on the serene waters of the lake that surrounded it.If it wasn't the venue then perhaps it was the sensual scent of the lilies resting on the still water of the pools that was having such a dangerous effect on her senses? Whatever the cause, it was in her own interests to remember that she was supposed to be a rational adult.Keira took a deep, calming breath and told him firmly, 'Both. I'm a friend of the bride and the groom.'A swirl of activity refocused her attention on the wedding party. Late afternoon was giving way to early evening darkness, and preparations were almost finished for the evening reception. The small flickering flames of hundreds of glass-covered tea lights were scattered artfully around the large courtyard and floating in the pools and fountains, and the lights reflected in the lake beyond it giving it a magical aura of romance.Richly embroidered pavilions in jewel colours were being erected as though by magic, their gold threadwork catching the light, and the branches of the trees in the gardens beyond the courtyard dripped strings of tiny fairy lights, illuminating the paths that led to individual guest suites in what was now one of India's most exclusive hotel and spa resorts.Soon the newly married couple and their families would be changing for the evening, and she needed to go and do the same, she reminded herself, and yet she made no move to step aside, thereby ending their conversation and allowing him to walk away from her.Perhaps it was something to do with the late-afternoon sun that was transforming the sky above them from deep turquoise to warm pink, or the languorous heat turning the air soft with a sensuality that was almost like a physical touch against her skin that was causing her heart to thud with heavy-laden beats. Or perhaps it was the effect the man standing so close to her was having on her.Something inside her weakened and ached. It was India that was doing this to her. It had to be. She was beginning to panic now, caught off guard and out in the open with nowhere to run by the shockingness of her own vulnerability to instincts over which she had previously believed she had total control.She needed desperately to think about something else. The wedding she was here to attend, for instance.Shalini had used the magnificent venue for her wedding as the inspiration for her choice of traditional clothes. Tom had thrown himself into it, and had looked amazing in his red and gold turban, his gold silksherwanisuit and scarf embroidered to match Shalini's gold and red embroidered lehenga.Keira would have wanted to attend Shalini and Tom's wedding wherever it had been held; they, along with Shalini's cousin Vikram, were her closest friends. And when Shalini had told her that she and Tom had decided to follow up their British civil marriage with a traditional Hindu ceremony here in Ralapur, nothing could have kept Keira away.She had been longing to visit this ancient city state. It had captured her imagination immediately when she had first read about it. But Keira hadn't just come here for Shalini's wedding and to see the city. She had business here as well. She most certainly hadn't come looking for romance, she decided, before elaborating on her presence at the wedding.'I was at university with Tom and Shalini,' she explained, before asking curiously, 'And you?'It was typical of her type of woman that her voice should be low and husky, even if the slight vulnerable catch in it was a new twist on the world's oldest story. He had no intention of telling her anything personal about himself, or the fact that his elder brother was the new Maharaja.'I have a connection with the bride's family,' he told her. It was after all the truth, since he owned the hotel. And a great deal more. He looked out across the lake. His mother had loved this place. It had become her retreat when she'd need...", "related": ["B001E28M2Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While Buddhism fueled the Beat movement's resounding critique of the United States as a spiritually dead society, Beat writers and others have shaped how Buddhism has been presented to and perceived by a North American audience. Contributors to this volume explore how Asian influences have been adapted to American desires in literary works and at Buddhist poetics, or how Buddhist practices emerge in literary works. Starting with early aesthetic theories of Ernest Fenollosa, made famous but also distorted by Ezra Pound, the book moves on to the countercultural voices associated with the Beat movement and its friends and heirs such as Ginsberg, Kerouac, Snyder, Giorno, Waldman, and Whalen. The volume also considers the work of contemporary American writers of color influenced by Buddhism, such as Maxine Hong Kingston, Charles Johnson, and Lan Cao. An interview with Kingston is included.\"This book in your hands is a trove of the best we can do putting the Dharma into words.\" -- from the Foreword by Maxine Hong Kingston", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He encourages readers to imagine God as the giver of love, Jesus Christ as the gift of love, and the world as the recipient of extravagant love. Stanley, whose 15,000-member church in Atlanta is regularly on the receiving end of his passionate preaching, shares 100 short vignettes with accompanying to-the-point prayers and topical Scripture verses. Stanley aptly touches on the diversity of life's challenges as he discusses developing one's spiritual barometer, embracing God's eternal perspective, generating a heart given toward good works, appreciating Christ as a divine scapegoat for sin and learning to live beyond the perimeters of legal bondage. Addressing relationship barriers, he boldly admonishes Christians to take the unsafe course of aggressively tearing down the protective walls that arise from actual or perceived injury. From there, he claims, Christians can follow Christ's example of unconditional love. Citing Matthew 5:22-24, Stanley proclaims that frail humans build walls that God hates. Like Stanley's previous works, this book consistently displays his overriding passion for obedience to God. Although it's not earth-shatteringly original, his inspirational collection of devotions is an easy and accessible read, living up to his reputation for excellence in communication.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Angel comes up with the laudable notion of comparing and contrasting their views in a single volume. This is a bold venture, since he is an Orthodox rabbi and his predecessors in the Amsterdam Jewish community excommunicated Spinoza as a heretic in 1656, just two years after the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue was founded in New Amsterdam (now New York). Angel, born into Seattle's Sephardic community, became the New York synagogue's rabbi in 1969 and now serves as rabbi emeritus. Although he is respectful of many notions advocated by Spinoza, Angel makes clear his preference for the thinking of Maimonides. He explores what each of them had to say about faith, reason, God, Torah, superstition, and the relationship between Jews and non-Jews, invariably advocating the positions espoused by Maimonides. This thoughtful presentation will appeal to everyone interested in religion, Judaism, theology, and philosophy.(Dec.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Only wanting peace and quiet, not true happiness, he is nonetheless pulled into a series of magical adventures, each of which teaches him how important it is not to assume things. Readers will enjoy the many fun characters, from marauding adolescent unicorns to a sassy magic mirror to any number of princesses whose appearances belie their true natures. The wizard, while appropriately kind and patient, has blind spots of his own that keep readers rooting for him. Perfect for kids who want a breezy, humorous fantasy, this book won't gather any dust on library shelves.Eva Mitnick, Los Angeles Public LibraryCopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B0092G1BOC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Most of all, the stories told by Derek Haines are about people, their feelings, regrets, hopes and struggles with life. Ordinary people, often a loser, but with extraordinary qualities that makes their story worth telling. While some stories reflect his own thoughts and beliefs, others are told from the view of characters who are sometimes dark and complex or childishly open. With splashes of allegory,  black humour or simple satire, his stories can develop from the simplistic to the complicate and back again leaving the reader to decide if it is time to laugh or cry. Or both. Born in Australia, but now living in Switzerland with his wife and his dog, his stories   cross a wide geographical range but often draw from elements of his life and experiences in the two countries he calls home. From the rugged, dry and hot desert country of Australia and its crowded cities to the cafés of Europe and the peaks of the Swiss Alps. The hustle and bustle of Sydney to the quiet life of the Swiss country side. In addition to writing, he is also a songwriter, singer and musician with a number of albums to his credit. Writing now full time, there are always manuscripts in varying stages of development, but one always has top priority and occupies the current project page of his website.", "related": [], "rank": 2787824, "title": "The Adventures of HAL", "author": "Derek Haines", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Mental health specific to veterans is explored, including PTSD and the impact of military separation on identity. Helpful web links, clear explanations of important laws and benefits, and facts and figures necessary to taking full advantage of benefits are provided. The book also has a softer side, with a detailed guide to marital health, including housing, dividing chores, and increasing domestic harmony. Sections on entrepreneurship and business provide info on writing a business plan and simple crash courses in financial management. The authors delineate which benefits and services will be unavailable post-military and encourage readers to \"use it or lose it.\" The tone is always approachable and encouraging, and appendices include useful websites, transition checklists, a guide to entrepreneurship, and a list of VA facilities. The authors aim to compile all the information that readers need (without having to pursue themselves). They've admirably met that aim. (Publishers Weekly)Wounded Warrior Handbookcoauthors Hill and Don Philpott and Cheryl Lawhorne, who works with the Wounded Warrior Regiment in Quantico, VA, use their extensive experience working with veterans to put together the information veterans need to more easily transition to civilian life. They offer practical advice on finding employment or education, obtaining VA medical benefits, and planning finances. The authors provide the specifics of benefits, including the names, phone numbers, and websites of the appropriate VA agencies for each claim. The four appendixes list an abundance of transition-related websites, transition checklists for the recovery care program, a guide to entrepreneurship, and lists of VA facilities by geographic area. Excellent for a new vet, this is an essential purchase for public libraries.(Library Journal, Starred Review2011-07-01)Hill (consultant), Lawhorne (Wounded Warrior Regiment), and Philpott (freelance writer) created this book by extracting valuable material from federal Web sites and supplementing it with their own content as necessary. The covered topics (leaving the service, developing a career, becoming an entrepreneur, finding a home, returning to school, managing finances, acquiring transition benefits, and obtaining health and other insurance) are all pertinent to new veterans. Much of the content introduces readers to federal programs and services for veterans. Though the writing style is matter-of-fact, the authors do a good job with topics that call forth emotional responses, such as the marital effects of military service. The chapters on career development and entrepreneurship are especially strong. The text uses many headings and subheadings, making it easy to browse....Appendixes contain a list of useful Web sites, the transition checklists used for the federal Recovery Care Coordinator Program, a guide to entrepreneurship, and a listing of VA facilities. This book is more an all-around guide than others that focus specifically on career development. Many veterans will appreciate the print version, but with its reliance on information published online and referrals to additional Web links, the e-book version has definite benefits.Summing Up:Recommended.

Infiltrating Tretower, the fortified ranch of former Chicago mosbster Nick Tellios, Obie offers to work as an informer for the suspected cocaine broker. The imposter meets Tellios's niece Katherine (\"Kori\") Price, his ward for 14 years since her parents were murdered when she was six. Falling in love with beautiful Kori, Obie becomes more determined to fight Tellios and his henchmen, creating attenuated side plots whose outcomes are practically telegraphed. When Kori is in dire danger, the super cop happens to accidentally arrive in time to save her. Similar incidents ensue, testing Obie during his crusade against the \"unindicted co-conspirators\" amongst Charter's prominent citizens, even those in the police department.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 42.0}

M. Howell was born in Romford, England in 1949 and aged about 2-1/2 accompanied his parents to Malaya (now Malaysia). It was an idyllic place for a young boy, especially Malacca where the house was only yards from the white sandy beach. Aged ten Paul returned to England and was immediately dispatched to a boys boarding school. Being fluent in Malay and Chinese cut no ice with the French & Latin teachers however and Paul struggled to keep up with his peers. But it was at this time that his lifelong love and appreciation of the English language and the written word was hatched. This was due to a series of inspiring teachers and the discovery of P.G. Wodehouse. On leaving school in 1966 Paul defied the odds and landed a job as a junior reporter on a local newspaper. He did not excel here either, but learned some valuable lessons which helped in later years when he embarked on writing his first novel, \"Caveat Emptor-Buyer Beware.\" For most of his working life Paul owned his own fine art and antiques business, having premises in Connecticut, New York City and Barnwell Castle in England. In 2002, after nine years back in the old country, he, his wife Kate and daughter Olivia returned to the USA and settled in Kansas, Kate's home state. Paul keeps busy as a portrait painter, a voice over actor and as he now proudly claims, a published novelist. He is currently working on his second book in the Phillip Fairfax series", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After graduating from Texas Tech, he went to work with the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal as a sports writer, sports photographer and sports cartoonist. He worked there until he was invited to join the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, working for city-side. Lee worked in Fort Worth for five years, then went to Spain as a freelancer, to try his hand at a first novel. After a year in Europe, he went to work for the Denver Post, where he stayed for five years, until an international PR firm (Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.) hired him to work in Akron, Ohio, where he stayed for two years. He then went to Mexico for another year of freelancing. When he returned to the states, he worked on two new novels. He was offered a job as editor-in-chief of the Tehran Journal, an English-language newspaper in Iran, but chose to return to graduate school. While studying for his master’s in West Virginia, he served as stringer for the Associated Press and taught a photography class for the WVU School of Journalism. Once he finished his master's degree and started teaching at American University in Washington, D.C., he was asked to handle magazine-article classes. He knew little about magazines, so he started writing articles for a broad range of magazines, from top consumer markets to lower specialized markets while teaching at the University of Arizona, New York University, Cal State Long Beach, University of Idaho, and University of Memphis. He published materials in some thirty different magazines during this period. Later, after he quit teaching, he added several hundred magazine articles when he began reviewing computer games for four different computer magazines.

What makes this better than other recent studies of grassroots democracy in Brazil is the closer analysis of the different ways that PB develops across cities. . .

Keating,Choice\"Insightful, subtle, and persuasively argued,Bootstrapping Democracyis a wonderful contribution to political theory and comparative politics.

This clear, original work fills a very large void and really is incomparable.\"—Philip Oxhorn, McGill University\"Bootstrapping Democracyis an exciting breath of fresh air in an era when the intellectual debate on how to construct effective democratic politics seems in danger of becoming sterile.

In Kim Jong-il: North Korea's Dear Leader, Revised and Updated Edition, internationally renowned authority on Korean issues Michael Breen raises the curtain on the true nature of the man whose ability to simultaneously fascinate and terrify is as remarkable as it is alarming.Addressing common myths and fallacies—including the mistaken belief that Kim was primed to inherit the Presidency from his father from childhood—Kim Jong-il  sheds light on the \"Dear Leader's\" hold over a country ravaged by poverty and famine. Filled with North Korean history, personal anecdotes, and fascinating insights into this nation of twenty-three million people and the man who controls them, this new edition is packed with rare photographs of Kim and his regime, giving readers unprecedented access to the well-known but little-understood despot.", "related": [], "rank": 1839988, "title": "Kim Jong-Il, Revised and Updated", "author": "Michael Breen", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If so, why?I've enjoyed writing in every genre, and I'd hate to pick a favorite.  I've been most successful in the mystery and crime field, but a lot of the popular fiction writers I admire most have written in several fields.  There's a lot of crossover between mysteries and westerns, for example, with writers like Elmore Leonard, Harry Whittington, Bill Pronzini, Bob Randisi, James Reasoner, and on and on.  So I'm just following their lead.Is there a common thread to your writing?Most of my writing is set in small towns in Texas and, though I've ventured far afield on more than one occasion, you could say that Texas and Texans figure in most of my work. I like to write about the changes in life and society I see going on around me and how the changes affect the characters in my books, so that's another thread that runs through them.You're considered an expert on pulp fiction and the old Gold Medal paperbacks. Lee Goldberg & William Rabkin say they were influenced by their love of those books when they created The Dead Man series. Where do you think The Dead Man fits in with, and deviates from, books of that era?The Gold Medal paperbacks were short, punchy novels full of action and color. They moved fast, and they featured ordinary people in extraordinary situations. I see The Dead Man as being solidly in that tradition, with some elements of the fantastic added for color. There's also a connection to the kind of adventure books that I wrote with Steve Mertz more than 20 years ago in series likeThe M.I.A. HunterandThe Tunnel Rats. And of course Nick Carter.How did you approach your Dead Man book,Carnival of Death? What were the challenges? What did you enjoy most?The challenges included writing an action-oriented story that also developed the character and history of Matthew Cahill a bit without violating the rules of his world and what had happened in other installments of the series. An even bigger challenge was to write a book that was up to the high standards of the ones that preceded it, all of which were topnotch stories by writers whose work I admire. The most enjoyment came from getting back to writing the kind of series action story like the Gold Medal paperbacks. It's always great fun to do that kind of thing.What's next for you?I'm working on a book in the Rancho Diablo series that I write with Mel Odom and James Reasoner. It's a western with horror elements calledGabby Darbins and the Slide-Rock Bolter.

But it's a three part story, so let us start from the beginning, so turn down the lights set back and enjoy \"Devil Wolf Trilogy of Horror.\" Yours truly Garry E. LewisIt's the witching hour as a young college student steps up to a crossroads in an isolated area outside of the city. Off in the distance a dark figure approaches cane in hand, a heavy fog hugs the ground, as a full moon emerges through dark clouds over head. The smell of rain hangs heavy in the night air.A figure soon comes into focus, as a young college student watches, as a tall slim man, dressed in a white suit, with long tails, wearing a wide brimmmed Panama hat on his head approaches.His eye's a glow like candle flames, as he stands before the young man,  an evil grin upon his face, the stranger speaks. \"So boy what is it you would you ask of me, on this glorious night?\" Do you smell that boy? The clean crisp smell, of the night air? The stranger says, Oh how I love the night so. The day light is way to over rated don't you agree? The young man responds,I suppose so. The young man then asks, Is it true what I have read about the legend of the devil's wolf belt?The Devil's wicked grin broadens, delighted by what he's been ask, he then responds, you mean my wolf strap? The young man replies, Yes the wolf strap. Is the legend true? Does it offer one powers, and eternal life?The devil responds, \"Oh yes my boy and so much more.\" You must of course be worthy of such a gift. Are you worthy boy? The devil asks with a wicked smile on his face.The young responds, I'd give anything to have such a gift. The devil smiles and responds, you say you'd give anything? Then how about your soul in exchange? The young man responds, you are kidding right?The devil replies, if you say so.

Dorr makes much of the church tradition that the author of the Gospel of Luke was a physician, having him speak of his own \"analytical Greek mind\" and of being \"an educated, sophisticated Greek.\" The fictionalized approach conjectures vibrant details that are not elucidated in the Gospels: the disbelief of Mary's parents at her angelic visitation and subsequent pregnancy; and her fear, upon passing Rachel's tomb en route to Bethlehem, that she too would die in childbirth. Dorr does a fine job of showing how the Gentile Luke slowly learns Jewish customs and law. She uses the biblical texts faithfully while using her imagination to expand their emotional reach.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00AMLJZXK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If the reader chooses to do so, they could further their reading experience by diving into the topics at hand. However, the work is not so overwhelming that it cannot be read as a quick \"on the surface\" story.Therefore, I feel as though I have created a book for everyone. It is a work for those who wish for a fast pace simple read, or those who wish to explore the facts more in depth. In doing so, I have created a book that I do not wish to shelf once reaching page 5. I hope you and future readers will feel the same.Appropriate Audience:Descent of the Jaguar is targeted to an adult audience wanting a fictional thriller that is neither dull nor emotionally superficial. The readers who will identify with the novel are those who long for a thriller that they can track through world maps or cultural events if they so choose, without becoming lost in the needless filling details. It will satisfy those looking for a fast thrill with deeper implications. All details in the novel are true, including the culture, science, and locations. The story was fabricated around these real details to add depth and meaning to the tale.The novel is clean in the fact that it is not overloaded with inappropriate language, sexual content, or grotesque descriptions of violence. While not recommended for children, it could be considered appropriate for mature teens to adults.　　What is different and special about Descent of the Jaguar:Descent of the jaguar not only focuses on the growing relationship between the two lead characters, but also teaches the audience accurate archaeological and scientific details without ever feeling encumbering or dull. The reader experiences a thrill reward with each five minutes of read time and will never have to 'backtrack' in the pages to recall where the story left off when they laid the book down last. The plot is developed for the reader who wants action to develop, peak, and conclude within each chapter, thereby allowing the reader to be satisfied with each session, even if that reading instance happens to be brief.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After this diagnosis, operation and radiation, She would sit on the beach at Blackpool and think about the prospect of dying. As a Christian she knew where she was going but it is still an awesome thought as you contemplate a life cut short and the process of death. She started with blood loss from December 2008. October 2009 the MRI scan said “highly suspicious of endometrial cancer.”  She was very much inspired by a comment in an Edith Schaeffer book when it said “Life is too short not to take such risks which in our saner moments we would never consider.” When nearly 50 she started to take unimaginable risks such as the delight of fostering children.  In her early 50’s she left her Barrister’s Chambers in Manchester. Singlehanded, and on a shoestring, started a Barrister’s Chambers in Preston to be nearer her foster children. When she was called to the Bar there were only just over a 100 lady Barristers in the whole of the country.  As a young Barrister she realized other families didn’t have the loving support she had. Siblings would fall out with each other and take each other to Court. Parents fell out and there were heated battles over who should have the children. One of her joys in life is singing and she not only published her first novel but brought out her first album “Hymns of Heaven and comfort” Album one when in her seventies.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It ran from Georgia to Florida's Atlantic Coast. This was the main entry into Florida from 1774 until 1914 when the railroads and highways began to appear. I began a simple little history called The Search for Old Kings Road. . My present four books are in the \"Old Kings Road Series\" of events along this historic roadway. \"I am Grey Eyes\" is the tale of a most unusual Indian entrepreneur who was a cattleman and was credited by the British Governor in helping to blaze the trail for The Kings Road. \"Osceola His Capture and Seminole Legends\" happens on a recently discovered location upon Old Kings just south of St. Augustine's Moultrie Creek. Here Seminole leader Osceola tells his story in his own words as he awaits the army on Old Kings. \"Bulow Gold\" takes you again on Old Kings to the rich, successful sugar plantation of the Bulow family. The story is again as accurate as I could make it with real people and events that did occur. Here is the story of a great dream, a lost diary that was located by a distant relative of Bulow's black slave housekeeper. As in all my books the characters and events are real. I call these books \"researched historic fiction.\" I was not there in 1821. In all my books I try to connect to dots and present the most logical outcomes. Sometimes I come across a bit of history that no one knows. The Osceola capture site upon Old Kings Road had been rarely visited and was mostly forgotten. Thanks to the Osceola book there is now great public interest in it. History can be fun. I hope you enjoy my Florida history books. For you experts there are plenty of errors for I am not a professor. I enjoy finding new things and telling stories. I am a director of the Flagler County Historical Society. In prior life (before retirement to Palm Coast Florida) I was owner, CEO and operator of several companies in the high technology photographic equipment field. I hold the degree of Photographic Craftsmen in the Professional Photographers of America.

Narrator Victoria Grace Ransom (named for the British queen) owes her 500-pound weight to a case of hypothalmus-damaging measles at age four. Unexposed to radio, TV and newspapers, Victoria has scarcely emerged from the Ransom estate since her birth in 1947. To pass the time, she listens to her black servant, Viola Lewis, tell tales of Ransom family history. A 1908 business partnership and secret adulterous liaisons create a hate-filled bond between the Ransom clan and the Macafees. Victoria's great-aunt Sarah, pregnant with Grant Macafee's child, disappears, and Sarah's brother William sires a baby by Grant's wife, Sophie. \"Dead\" at birth, the baby falls under the ministrations of \"frail and stunted\" great-aunt Mavis, a \"gnomic changling\" and perhaps the most original in a sprawling cast of fascinating characters. As the nearby town of Bernice spreads \"like a gravy stain\" toward the Ransoms' looming white mansion, death and disfigurement ravage succeeding generations. Dawson brilliantly ties up the familial threads at the novel's end. Her labyrinthine plot--a \"potboiler\" in the grandest sense--is transformed by a dark vision and poetic language into a work of the highest literary caliber.

There is cross cultural romance, historical accuracy and a fair and balanced presentation of the conflicts that are presented. A.C. Campbell, the mixed blood protagonist, is a character worthy of respect and compassion. The antagonist, Greg Hackham, is as evil a man as they make 'em. The 1890 map at the front of the book shows the area of the narrative with place names that help you keep up with the action as it moves throughout the Cook Inlet and Turnagain Arm settings.

Meg is a high powered criminal attorney whose wealthy, and sometimes guilty, clients have made her famous.  She has no time for anything else but work, least of all a romantic relationship. Alissa is the socialite whose marriage to a prominent doctor is falling apart.   She spends her time planning parties and galas and watching her beautiful, young daughters live the life she once had.  Zoe was one of the most famous actresses in the world until a tragedy forced her out of the limelight.  Now, faced with financial burdens after her husband's suicide, she's trying to make a comeback.   Meg, Alissa and Zoe meet at the Golden Key Spa, retreat for the discerning woman.  They leave the spa with a common goal, to find their first loves and see how their lives would have been different.  For Meg, that means finding Senator Steve Riley, her college professor and lover.  Alissa's first love was Jay Stockwell, a young rebel who wanted to change the world and now does broadcasts from all over the globe.  Zoe wants to find Eric Matthews, the boy-next-door who made her feel special and loved.      From Atlanta, New York and L.A., these three women search for what they lost.  Of the three, only one will rekindle the passion of first love.  The other two will find love with someone new.  In the end, their lives will be changed forever by their discoveries--and by their unique friendship forged from pain, heartache and determination.First Loves is a testimony to the power of friendship! Jean Stone understands the human heart. The realistic stories of three memorable women interwoven into one unforgettable book! A book that will touch the heart of every woman who remembers her first love!

I have fantastic family and friends. I retired after 54 years as a public school teacher. I loved teaching eighthgraders. I feel that my students have given me more than I gave them. I have spent my years searching and growing and always trying to be a responsible person. I am living a charmed life. In my journey I have dealt with negatives such as alcoholism, divorce, death, codependency, and Alzheimer's. I am a child of an alcoholic; I married and divorced an alcoholic; I was a codependent. Alzheimer's is one of the cruelest diseases there is. The disease erased all that made my mom a unique human being. I hope my story can inspire. Sports have given me much pleasure. I love football, basketball, IRL racing, and NASCAR. My favorites are the Green Bay Packers, the Illini, Dan Wheldon, Danica Patrick, Brett Favre, Jeff Gordon, and Jimmie Johnson. Traveling has been the most invigorating experience for me as I have traveled the US and the world. It was so neat to walk the Great Wall of China. I am living a very passionate, positive, and fulfi lling life. It is not my age that defi nes me; it is what I do with my life.

It used to be a fact that a memoir would be a written account\nof the life of someone with a series of stories to tell. In modern\ntimes, post-1990 I mean, the memoir genre has been hijacked by every\ncelebrity, near-miss pop star and TV personality in town. What has\nhappened to stories of men who struggled against the odds to get to\nwhere they wanted to be?Mike Trahan is what happened.Now, that sounds a little dramatic- I grant you, I am rather dramatic. I got my copy of this bookand I sat down expecting an interesting tale of a guy from Texas who got his wings and coped with life. What I actually found was the history of a time, a place, a family and the struggles and problems a family faced. Mike writes with striking honesty about his life- his father and his mother who raised him on a small farm over in West Orange, Texas. The man who would become Captain Mike Trahan started as just ordinary Mike who spent summers playing with his cousins and living off the land. This boy grew up poor, but never knew about poverty, because his family was so rich with love and devotion. He also left school at the beginning of eighth grade and didn't look back. He just found another school, another route into his desired occupation. This book is not about great achievements, it's not about fame- this book is about life, and most importantly, how you can deal with life.L.

Yes, we took the last page of Book 1 and burst into another volume... the problem was, we had moved away from the original small-town High School background, and had grown into the surrounding Arizona area, running along I from all directions from Flagstaff. But we had the Vampire High School series to consider, so we kept the main title.Book 3: The Rage Wars soon followed, and the series continued under the Vampire High School banner. The characters had grown older, both in years and experience, again taking them past the original High School tag, but we're writers; we have vivid imaginations, we'd written three novels, and put our three/four main characters through the mill.But that wasn't out current problem; we'd also invented a host of minor players in our vampire tapestry. These characters needed some fleshing out, but not in a clinical, hidden, behind-the-scenes way, but in a complete reader-driven back story anthology.So out pops our biggest volume yet, Blood Anthology, just giving background stories. In addition, since we hadn't enough on our plate, we had started a new book, called Vampires Don't Cry; a deeper, darker tale. So dark, reading it out loud, it made my wife cry.At first we'd decided to write in two separate series, but of course, we had mixed characters from each series, it seemed to be getting kinda muddy which series some characters belonged to.Then we wrote Vampire High School Book 4: Blood Red Roses, in which our major characters, Lyman and Mandy go to college, leaving their high school days firmly behind them. They'd also moved on sexually, and Book 4: Blood red Roses had a more serious erotic side that the character growth could not contain.Either way, we'd moved on from the original name.So, we've re-branded the whole series; every book is now under the Vampires Don't Cry banner.Book 1 will now have the subtitle; Vampire High School, as a homage to the old ideals. And the darker book, due out in 2014? We plan on it.We've decided to call that series; Vampires Don't Cry; Origins.It all seems simple, looking back, once you've talked about it for year! All the best from April and Ian, and we hope our 'transformation' won't cause you too much trouble.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This is a highly entertaining read which had me laughing out loud at times.\"--Christine Griffin, Professor of Social Psychology, University of Bath\"A wonderful look at the academic world and the kind of writing it encourages. I especially enjoyed the chapters on mass publication, sociology, and experimental social psychology.\"--Tom Scheff, Professor Emeritus, Department of Sociology, University of California, Santa Barbara\"If you are put off by the highly specialized, closed and boring technical prose that increasingly characterizes a good deal of contemporary social science, then Michael Billig shares your annoyance!

Schell Professor of Organization Studies, MIT Sloan School of Management\"Once again, Michael Billig has succeeded in challenging one of the characteristics of scholars' writing in the social sciences which is usually taken for granted: the use of too much abstract jargon which mystifies and obfuscates the interpretation, reflection and explanation of our findings. In his brilliant, typically humorous but also cynical and accurate analysis of scholars' narcissism, the author points to alternative ways of combining complex research with fundamental and necessary scholarly standards - while simultaneously making our work accessible to a broader public, in the spirit of true critical science.\"--Ruth Wodak, Distinguished Professor and Chair in Discourse Studies, Lancaster University", "related": [], "rank": 276648, "title": "Learn to Write Badly", "author": "Michael Billig", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That has been around thirty years, as I am no longer a spring chicken. When I first started learning, there was no stigma attached with the concept.

The subject is gaining ground in the social consciousness due to numerous books on the subject, movies, and popular survival television shows.What a person does not initially realize is that the concept has possible value even in modern society. An interest is often piqued, yet the discerning reader must be warned of the social stigmas attached. I explain to the reader what they are possibly in for, concerning the reactions of neighbors, friends, and family. Concerning survival, most people only know what they stumble across online, have heard from friends, or have read in the news.I hope that this book enables people to make an informed and unbiased choice, which was my main goal of writing it. Initially in the introduction I explain  the purpose of this book, and then the purpose and expectations for the series that it is a part of, but that is but a small segment of the mini e-book.This book may be controversial as the subject matter has a ton of attached mystique, and I tried to write it without bias either for or against the concept which might ruffle feathers for some people.", "related": [], "rank": 851028, "title": "Is Wilderness Survival 4 Me?

By taking a managerial position with a sophisticated shoe manufacturer, Annie becomes embroiled with her new associates and hooked on the power of big business. Unfortunately, her exhaustion from overwork forces her to ignore old friends. And her lapse places someone she cares about in terrible danger.Tyler, a Social Worker and a woman-hater previously hurt in two relationships, only wants Annie in his life as a good buddy. Oh yeah!

After all, how hard could it be to walk a bunch of mangy mutts?Men are scum and no one can tell Sadie any different. It's why she stays away from them.

(Cold Tears, RC #2, was written as a bridge from Bonne Femme.) For best enjoyment, the series should be read in order, but each of the novels is a stand-alone story. If you happen to read one out of order, you won't be at a loss as to who these people are or what the heck happened to them before this. I found the going easier this time. There was less redacting, but still a lot of editing. During this project I found my \"voice.\" That may be easier for some authors than it was for me. A key that I discovered was something I should not do, rather than something I should do. I have a good eidetic memory. I can hear what I have read--sometimes too well. While in college, a professor joked that when I wrote about Milton my writing read a little like Milton. Also, my training is in history where the unpardonable sin is plagiarism (of ideas as well as words). The upshot is: I do not read fiction while writing fiction.For preparation and for authenticity sake as far as the motivations, actions, and thought process of my bad guy, I kept books written by members of the FBI's behavioral science unit on hand right next to DMS-IV and \"A Primer on Drug Action.\" These are still on the bookshelf above the worn out keyboard upon which I wrote all ten books (so far) in the series.I enjoyed getting to know the new characters in this story, and I enjoyed writing it. Like many of you, I suppose, if I find myself not caring about the characters in a book, I won't finish reading it. The same thing applies to my writing. I'm sure you will enjoy learning more about Jill and Richard as well as a very special young woman, Raven.

Cursó sus estudios escolares en el colegio Cerrado de Calderón de Málaga. El último curso del colegio antes de ir a la Universidad, el C.O.U. lo cursó en inglés en el colegio Duence International School de Holliston, Massachusetts, en Estados Unidos. Tras acabar el colegio ingresó en la universidad Center for International Studies de Madrid, dependiente de Suffolk University en Boston, dónde le aconsejaron por primera vez que se dedicase a la escritura de manera profesional. Al concluir el primer año se marchó de nuevo a Estados Unidos a completar sus estudios, ingresando en el Dean College de Franklin, también en Massachusetts. En el Dean College se graduó en Ciencias Liberales con la especialidad de Informática. Posteriormente, fue aceptado e ingresó en la prestigiosa universidad Northeastern University de Boston, clase de 1998, donde cursó estudios de ingeniería informática. A finales de 1998 vuelve a España y crea la empresa Teledex Ibérica en plena liberalización del mercado de las telecomunicaciones. Simultáneamente a su trabajo en Teledex Ibérica en el Parque Tecnológico de Andalucía, Carlos Abehsera vuelve a impartir clases, en este caso de telecomunicaciones, en el instituto tecnológico del propio parque. En estos años es cuando empieza a resentirse de su estado de salud aquejado de un fuerte sobrepeso y un tremendo estrés. Su vida familiar se resiente del mismo modo y acaba por divorciarse. Toma entonces la decisión de cerrar la empresa y vender sus activos. Tras dejar el tabaco en las navidades de 2010, gana 10 kilos adicionales en sólo dos meses y sitúa el visor de su peso en más de 113 kilos a principios de 2011.  Por aquel entonces, con unos problemas tremendos de salud, tomaba 6 pastillas distintas cada día para mitigar los síntomas de distintas dolencias, desde crisis de ansiedad hasta dolores musculares y articulares, pasando por taquicardias, problemas gastrointestinales y distintos trastornos del sueño. En ese momento, decide que la prioridad en su vida tiene que ser recuperar la salud, adelgazar perdiendo el exceso de grasa que tiene acumulado y poder disfrutar de una vida normal. En sólo 4 meses, había logrado perder 35 kg de peso, aumentando su masa muscular y recuperando totalmente su salud, lo que le permitió abandonar toda la medicación que tomaba.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The air swells with the sound of mankind. From the quiet corners of a small town Sharday Cage was unknowingly sharpening her voice too. Sharday Cage was born in Troy, Missouri on September 30, 1985. She moved to Chicago in 2004 where she attended Saint Xavier University majoring in Mass Communications. A groundbreaking moment occurred as she recited one of her poems called “Forgiveness” for Sister Helen Prejean, who has become a leading American advocate for the abolition of the death penalty. Sharday Cage’s writing only grew stronger from there as her life in Chicago heavily influenced her first collection of poetry called, Death of a Black Star which was published in November 2011. Sharday Cage covers a wide range of topics from violence to love to nature and spirituality but her perspective is always clear and most importantly filled with sincere honesty. Death of a Black Star was highly praised for thought provoking poems like “Zombie”, “Red Line”, and “Black Suit” that reaches a wide range of people defying age, race, or class. Death of a Black Star has since become a best seller on Amazon for African poetry on kindle and paperback. Sharday Cage remains in Chicago as an up and coming writer and poet performing throughout the city proclaiming loudly her voice so that it may be heard and understood and amongst the world; stand out.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Since she loves several genres, you may find your heroes in a contemporary, historical, paranormal or sci-fi setting. One of her passions is bringing people's fantasies to life on the page, because life is too short for even one boring moment. Her stories are volcanic in heat, deep in emotion, and sprinkled with doses of humor. When not indulging in her passion for books, she loves the outdoors, film and music. The Pacific Northwest is the ideal spot to enjoy both hiking and beachcombing. Once upon a time she was the singer in an indie rock band that toured the West Coast and charted on U.S. college radio. She currently resides on the northern coast of Oregon, where the constant rain and fog remind her of visits to her family in England and Scotland when she was a child. She is currently working on a new historical MM series, as well as a steampunk horror and sci-fi ménage.", "related": [], "rank": 1163898, "title": "Hollywood Bound: (A Gay Romance) (Gin & Jazz Book 1)", "author": "Morticia Knight", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Early stories were about dolls and horses and kids who surmounted the odds and came home with a kitten. Gradually I learned about punctuation and point-of-view and my characters grew up. But real life came along, with forays into psychology and teaching and then a biomedical career and children. Writing happened in my head, for my own amusement, but didn't make it to paper. Then several years ago, my husband gave me a computer. And my two girls were getting older and developing their own interests. So I sat down and typed out a story. Or two. Or three. Now I have adult novels published, and my love of Young Adult fiction has given me the chance to share some of my YA stories. I currently write constantly, read obsessively, and share my home with my younger teenager, my amazingly patient husband, and a crazy, omnivorous little white dog. I can be found at my author page on Goodreads, and look forward to sharing many more stories with YA readers in the future.", "related": ["B00IZR0FI2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If any of these things offend you, then this is not the series for you.  I do not write stories that leave you hanging in hopes of you having to buy the next book. My stories are complete and will not leave you feeling as if you were forced into buying a sequel. Though my books come in series, each book is capable of standing alone and can be read without having to go through a numerical sequence. I also go out of my way to keep my pricing fair to the reader, because these books are 'self-published' and they are not as long as a standard published book would be. I chose to self-publish these fiction books in order to build up a fan base. As is the case of any other writer, I am growing and learning daily. I am constantly researching and studying in order to better myself for the people who enjoy my books. As my fan base grows and finances come along with that growth, I can promise my readers the traditional published and edited books. Though I am not a world renowned Author, I do have a very vivid imagination and the capability to tell a very emotive and provoking story. I look forward to growing with you and for you, because in my world it is all about you the reader.
