The duo throw caution—and their bare behinds—to the wind every Thursday afternoon in trysts along deserted, woody banks of the Thames. As it gets colder outside, Ginnie and Will (aka Detective Inspector Hampden) seek privacy in an abandoned river house. One day, \"entangled\" inside with her \"smoke and cinnamon\" scented lover, Ginnie spies a suspicious-looking man by the river. Initially unnerved, she dismisses her reaction as projected guilt—until a woman is found murdered near that very spot. Thus begins the real conflict in this atmospheric love –story–cum–psychological thriller. Should Ginnie remain silent, potentially allowing a murderer to go free? Or should she speak up, and thereby expose her affair and ruin two marriages? As she frets over the decision, all the while juggling a career, an emotionally aloof husband, a difficult 16-year-old daughter and an ailing mother, Ginnie seems less a heroine and more a hapless fly caught in a moral spider web. Leroy manages to make Ginnie sympathetic—even though she isn't always likable—and her dilemma chillingly real.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As Gay shows in this intriguing if uneven history, Germany ironically served as a haven for Eastern European Jewish immigrants immediately after the war, when a quarter-million Jews were housed, under the protection of the Allies, in displaced persons camps. Gay's discussion of this is the strongest part of her book, as she deftly examines the dynamics of the \"surviving remnant\" of European Jewry as it tried to rebuild itself amid the ashes of the Holocaust, creating schools, arts organizations and families. As Gay notes poignantly, \"the last flowering, the last living moment of Polish Jewish culture, played itself out in the D.P. camps in Germany.\" As soon as they could, however, most of the Jews emigrated. Germany's Jewish population then struggled with small numbers and the legacy of Nazism for more than 40 years. As Gay (who won a National Jewish Book Award for Unfinished People: Eastern European Jews Encounter America) tracks the life of Jews in both East and West Germany, the book loses focus. But as she details the influx of tens of thousands of Jews from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s, the narrative picks up again as she shows how this latest set of refugees has the opportunity to create a new, vibrant German Jewry. 30 illus.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book covers everything from chocolate shops to legendary restaurants to instructions on how to make a perfect cassoulet.

Nesbit'sFive Children and Itbrings humor and gender equality to the original story line. The offspring of a newly blended family, Milly, Jason, Michael, and Jess are adjusting to life in small-town Moreways Meet with ill grace. All of them want to return to London, so when Milly discoversThe Genie Handbookand its occupant, Skribble the bookworm, the children are eager to pass quickly through the six challenges involved in becoming a genie. As readers might expect, the wish-granting quickly spills over into chaos, and the children as well as Skribble learn about the true desires of the heart as they settle into their new home. For those who enjoyed Nesbit's charmer, this novel will be a nostalgic walk down familiar paths, and it will direct new readers toward the works of Nesbit and Edward Eager. While the idea of the children training to be genies gives the story a slightly different structure, the outlandish wishes gone wrong share the same flavor of daring adventure. Milly, especially, with her sweet concern for Skribble's feelings and for the genie ethic, is reminiscent of Nesbit's characterizations. Some elements, especially the conclusion, are predictably saccharine, but even the thinly veiled moral lessons can't detract from the sheer joy of imagining oneself in possession of a magic lamp. Most imaginative readers will want to check out this family-driven fantasy adventure.—Caitlin Augusta, Stratford Library Association, CTCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I never stay up that late to read anything! Even the 'book who shall not be named' that is being released in July. , This is without a doubt the best series on the latter days.

Her meditations are sparked by events as diverse as travel through the American West, Wales and South Africa; pastry made by a old friend; or even an Internet story about a race for children with special needs. Wherever we journey, she says, we will discover that God awaits us through every point of the compass. Some of the illustrations she uses are compelling. Some are, frankly, rather dull. This is not her richest or most reflective book.

Born in independent Ghana and raised by his father in Botswana, Kwasi grows up an introspective young man often perceived to be an outsider. His solitude is broken when he meets Celeste, and their adolescent romance blossoms until it runs into a scandal—the death of Celeste's aunt—that sends Kwasi packing. He ends up as an apprentice signwriter and eventually starts a successful business of his own that meets a ruinous end after Celeste briefly reappears. In a surprisingly upbeat treatment of human trafficking and illegal immigration, Kwasi arrives in Paris and joins a community of African immigrants who congregate at a secret club located in a cellar beneath a flower shop. As Kwasi strives to redefine himself through his new life and a new love, aspects of his past remain less than hidden. This wide-ranging and gorgeously written novel has huge heart, and Kwasi's quest for identity is as sad as it is uplifting.(Mar.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He says of Shaw: ‘His work provides a minature course in theology. More than that, it explains, expounds and applies the whole gospel in a way that will explain the message of Scripture, illumine understanding, stimulate worship and strengthen Christian living.' . . . the value of the book is enhanced by the text of The Westminster Confession (together with Scripture proofs) given before each section is expounded . . .

He is presently an English teacher with the Compton Unified School District. He teaches his students about the strong value of being an effective communicator both orally and written and advises them how the power of words can resolve and bring amicable closure to difficult issues.

She is invited to Earth to stay at the House of Star, an Arizona ranch where these animals are bred. The only catch is that someone from the royal family of Caledon has been invited as well. Ymbria and Caledon have been at war for centuries and both worlds could lose access to the faerie roads if the fighting does not stop. Elen fears that the invitation is a trap to make her marry a Caledonian prince, so she runs away. She becomes lost and is saved by a worldrunner named Blanca who takes her to the House of Star where she discovers that the object isn't marriage, but friendship, and that the Caledonian prince is a princess. Elen immediately distrusts Princess Ria and is determined to prove that she is up to something. The two guests bunk with Sara, a girl from Earth who tries to help them get past centuries of hate and prejudice. Can their mutual love of horses save their kingdoms from destruction? Brennan creates a magical world based around a realistic ranch setting. The two main characters are complex and avoid the common clichés about princesses.

This portrayal of Samuel Clemens opens with a forbidden nocturnal ice-skating escapade, a disclaimer, and a justification. Brown frames the foolishness, but lets his subject have the last flippant word. These quoted phrases pepper the text, enhancing the flavor. In covering Clemens's childhood, Brown manages to slip in facts while elaborating on moments and realities that shaped the storyteller-his risking health and safety for adventure, soaking in the tales of his mother and \"Uncle Dan'l\" (a slave), serving as a printer's apprentice, and writing for newspapers. Double-page paintings of the haunted cave, the mighty river, and the night sky heighten the drama as they pit the plucky boy against his world. Brown uses light, color, and clarity of detail to draw focus to his protagonist in subtle, but effective ways. Adults will recognize the characters and settings that inspired Clemens's fiction; some of these connections are spelled out for children. A brief note touches on the acclaim and disdain surrounding the writer's work. Cheryl Harness's Mark Twain and the Queens of the Mississippi (S & S, 1998) ties the man's destiny to the river's. William Anderson's River Boy (HarperCollins, 2003) devotes more space to Clemens's adult life, and the art is more painterly. Brown's engaging text packs more punch and provides an entertaining introduction to an American legend.Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public LibraryCopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 3654418, "title": "American Boy: The Adventures of Mark Twain", "author": "Don Brown", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I could see using this book as a main text in an adolescent literacy course or as a resource for professional development.\"--Thomas W. Bean, PhD, Department of Curriculum and Instruction, University of Nevada, Las Vegas\"Hinchman and Sheridan-Thomas hit on many current issues and topics about which secondary teachers and administrators are clamoring for more information. This book is a great resource for collegial dialogue and professional development. I look forward to sharing it with middle and high school administrators, department chairs, other learning coordinators, and literacy coaches.\"--Ella E.

Recently arrived in Hollywood, where shooting on the movie version of her novel Giant is about to wrap, Ferber is quite taken with one of the stars of the movie, a brooding young actor named James Dean. When Dean becomes the prime suspect in the death of an actress, Ferber teams up with her old friend, actress Mercedes McCambridge, to clear the actor’s name. This is Ifkovic’s first novel, but it reads like it was written by an old pro. The mystery is sharply plotted (with a very clever bit of misdirection), and the setting, 1955 Hollywood, is vividly realized (including cameos by Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor). All the characters, fictional and real, are well drawn, and, even though Dean’s tragic fate is well known, Ifkovic smartly avoids any maudlin foreshadowing, portraying the actor as an enthusiastic, completely original talent with a long career ahead of him—assuming, of course, that Ferber can unmask the real killer. A promising debut in what could be a long-running and highly entertaining series. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Yet, almost perversely, Angela Tischler has taken the word as the title for her pre-revolutionary Cuban memoir. This is just one of the lesser ways in which Los Desengaños (in fact the name of disused sugar mill) sets itself apart from other more honeyed tellings of pre-revolutionary Cuban life. It offers a rare glimpse of pre-Revolutionary times in provincial Cuba: in this case, the almost waspish province of Camaguey - no Havana-centrism here! It is also unflinchingly honest sometimes painfully so. The result is a bittersweet portrait of the Cuba de ayer ; the joys and beauties and simple pleasures that Tischler found in Camaguey s countryside and people (especially her family), but also the province s sadnesses and prejudices traits that are treated in the same way one might describe the foibles of a cherished family member: with a love that forgives but does not exonerate.\" --John Paul Rathbone, Financial Times Latin America Editor.

Josh was uncharacteristically nervous. In his life he'd spoken at conferences in front of several hundred people, parachuted from a plane for charity and bungee jumped into a ravine just for the hell of it, and none of those had terrified him as much as his role as best man.He glanced across at Alex, whose gaze was fixed on the altar in a concerted effort to stop himself throwing up. Josh hid a wry smile. He had insisted on holding the stag night the week before to try and avoid this very problem, but Alex had been so stressed the previous night that only a steady stream of alcohol had been able to stop him getting into the car and heading for Invercargill. Josh hoped Alex didn't heave all over the floor. He was sure cleaning vomit off the altar steps before the bride arrived would be in his job description and the very thought made his own stomach roil, even though he had only been on Coke the night before.He checked his watch. There were only minutes to go before two o'clock. The guests were all seated, talking quietly as the organ music filled the church. It looked nice in the nave, he had to admit. White flowers on stands along the central aisle brought the spring freshness from outside into the building and the sun shone through the stained-glass windows, casting fragments of light like jewels onto the flagstones. The weather he had booked had arrived, he thought with amusement. It looked as if it was going to be the perfect New Zealand day--which was only what Alex and Becca deserved.On cue, one of the ushers at the front of the church waved to him. He nodded and signaled the vicar that the bride had arrived. The music changed to Wagner's Bridal Chorus and at the entrance to the church he saw Becca walk forward then pause in the doorway, one of the bridesmaids titivating with her veil, another with her train.He nudged the groom. \"She's here.\"Alex turned. Josh smiled as his best mate's face lit up. All Alex's nerves seemed to dissipate as he realized his wife-to-be had not abandoned him at the altar but was actually going to go through with it. Josh watched Alex release a big sigh he'd been holding for several weeks. Josh wanted to cuff him round the head. As if Becca was ever going to stand him up on the big day. He'd never seen two people more in love and in his own mind there was no question that the two of them were destined to spend the rest of their lives together.As Becca moved toward the aisle, Josh touched his breast pocket, checking for the gazillionth time the rings were in there.\"Will you stop?\" Alex said with exasperation, fidgeting with his own tie beside him.\"Hey, you'd be the first to complain if they had fallen out.\"Alex grinned at him. \"Don't worry, mate. You'll be able to get your own back when our roles are switched.\"\"Like that's going to happen,\" said Josh wryly.\"You'll meet the right girl one day.\"\"No, I meant there's no way you'd be my best man.\"Alex pushed him, then stuck his tongue out as his mother in the front row of seats glared at him. \"One day you'll find someone who'll tear your heart out,\" he whispered. \"It happens to the best of us and it'll happen to you one day, Mr. Heart of Stone.\"Josh said nothing, watching Becca as she started to walk toward them. He couldn't picture ever being in Alex's position himself. He'd never met a woman with whom he could imagine spending the rest of his life. Well, almost never. Briefly his mind drifted back to his university days. Now there had been a woman worth considering monogamy for. He and Kate had been inseparable that final year. But it hadn't ended well. Actually that was probably an understatement. It had culminated in a nuclear explosion that still rang in his ears on a quiet day. And since then, nobody had come close to replacing her.He wasn't going to think about it now, he told himself, determined nothing was going to sour his mood on his best mate's wedding day. He checked his waistcoat and jacket were straight. Best check the pocket again. Yep, rings still there.Becca was nearly at the altar now, on the arm of her father. She had been looking at Alex all the way down the aisle. Now she glanced across at Josh and he winked at her. She beamed and whispered, \"Thank you.\" He rolled his eyes. She'd made him promise he would get Alex there come hell or tidal wave and he had taken the oath in spite of protesting that Alex didn't need convincing. What was it with these two? Why didn't they just trust each other?His gaze slid to the bridesmaids--four of them, coming up the aisle behind Becca and her father. He had seen some monstrous bridesmaids' dresses in his time but for once these were stylish: sleek red satin, the dresses down to the calf, low cut with shoestring straps. He could see from the closest bridesmaid that the dress had a split up the side that went halfway up her thigh. A slim thigh tapering to a very shapely ankle and a slender foot encased in an extremely sexy, red, high-heeled sandal. Josh's eyebrows rose and his gaze followed the close-fitting dress where it clung to a flat stomach, narrow waist and a heaven-help-me generous bust swelling above the tight bodice line. Long brown hair tumbled around tanned shoulders and he registered the red rose in her hair before his gaze lingered on her face.\nJosh felt like he had been punched in the stomach. He stared at the bridesmaid, only just managing to stop himself swearing in front of all the elderly relatives in the front row. What the hell? He saw Becca glance at him, noticing the astounded look on his face, but he couldn't do anything but stare at the beautiful woman in red.Kate?As he went to say her name, she glanced over at him. She blinked, realization slapping her in the face like a wet fish. Abruptly she stopped walking. Unfortunately the bridesmaid behind her didn't notice and continued straight into her, propelling her forward into one of the stands full of flowers. Josh watched in dismay, seeing the scene unfold before his eyes, projecting the outcome and knowing only a miracle was going to divert disaster. Vaulting over the two empty chairs in the front row where he and Alex had been sitting until about five minutes ago, he landed in the aisle just in time to catch Kate in one arm and the display of flowers in the other.", "related": ["B005FSIQJO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I can't do this another time. This is my goodbye.***Today they messaged me eight times and that was all before noon. The bank really wants their money.\nI woke up this morning from a long journey.***Sitting at the reception desk of my job I often wondered where my life went wrong. Everyone who walked through those doors, through that mob of protestors holding their signs outside, had everything that anyone could ever want.***I graduated on May 15th. It was a Thursday. That Friday I expected to have a job. It's funny to think about that now, since I had invested absolutely 0% of my time up to that point actually looking for work. My résumé still had paint ball referee listed as a previous occupation. That's in no way intended as an insult to paint ball refs; it's just that on May 15th I officially became a liberal rocket arts graduate. Which if the previous nine years of undergraduate schooling and half a million in student loans had taught me anything, it was that this was allegedly a sure fire guaranteed fast path to wealth. The thing they always forget to tell you about general rocket arts is: you learn a little bit of everything, but you're actually learning nothing. Nothing important that is. Sure, I could hypothetically bullshit my way through an interview, if anyone would actually call me in for one. General rocket arts majors aren't taken very seriously in this uptight rocket arts world.The problem with being the last from your peer group to graduate is that at first you're under the impression that you're not in high school anymore. You are now a fully functioning member of the \"real world.\" What nobody ever tells you is: there is no such thing. Every stage of life is like another grade of high school. If high school was about trying to be cool by having the newest trendiest clothes; and college was about trying to be cool by reinventing the loser with new trendy clothes you were in high school with something new like a club membership; than life after college is about trying to be cool by having the highest paying job, newest tech, and not living in your mothers basement anymore. I'll go ahead and assume that life after 35 is about trying to be cool by not dying of old age.***I hated walking outside for lunch. The protestor's signs always showed such a general lack of creativity, it left much to be desired. How many different ways can you call someone a murderer? I wondered if these people knew that I was just a receptionist.***I think I've grown to resent every person I once called a friend. Every \"poke of fun\" in the last six months has been taken as a vicious insult. Kicking a man while he's down, if you will. I've stopped answering attempts to contact me, stopped replying to messages, and even stopped going out socially. See, I'm not very good at finding jobs or being civil; I am however an expert in burning bridges. Unfortunately the job market for arsonist is a bit limited at the moment.Poverty, it's the definitive bridge burner.If I'm not the butt of a joke, than I'm a charity case. I am the dartboard of unwanted and poorly aimed advice. My favorite advice in the past six months has been \"to lie on my résumé.\" My résumé is littered with so many half truths and flat out lies that I wouldn't recognize the person on my résumé if they were standing in front of me in the mirror. The person on my résumé is a sophisticated individual who was a member of clubs, teams, and organizations, and who by the powers of omission has achieved a respectable grade point average. The person on my résumé has held jobs that didn't exist, with references that either don't exist or were family members with pseudonyms. I imagine the person on my résumé writing the résumé while wearing a monocle and typing with a pinky held up high to note the sophistication. This is of course at those moments when I'm not imaging the person on my résumé writing the document with a quill pen on some fancy parchment under the light provided by a wax candle.***Those first few days I didn't actually see anything that happened behind those doors. I don't think I cared. Actually, I know I didn't care. I just answered the occasional call, greeted the incoming travelers, directed them to the waiting area, offered them drinks, and then paged Dr. Custodio. Once the doctor walked the travelers past those white sliding doors, I couldn't force myself to care about them even if I tried.***I know that sounds bad. Not all advice is unwanted. I mean, if I didn't accept any advice I wouldn't have this job right now; this landslide of morality.To be clear, I don't know if it can or can't be done. I don't know, and I don't really care. It's the type of situation that people with money only worry about.Sometimes when you're half a million in debt, and being harassed by collectors, you're forced to take work that others may find morally unacceptable. It's how I ended up a receptionist, and here of all places. The May 15th me would have thought working as a receptionist was below him. I didn't spend nine years reading about lift, thrust, drag, and promising my first born child to rent a textbook so that I could do the job that a simple robot could easily pull off. I didn't lay a mountain of debt on my shoulders to be called a murderer by zealots standing behind barriers. The December 22nd me has come to terms with reality.***I wished I could go back and fix all of my mistakes. To have the chance to get one big do-over. Behind those white doors, Dr. Custodio promised that chance for those who could pay. Who cares why they did it? It's clear they didn't change anything for the better. Those who could pay the price were only looking out for themselves.***Pablo got me this job. He has always been a good friend even if I did have to listen to his crazy theories all the time. Did you know that pirates are the profession most likely to be accused of sexual harassment? You see, a pirate wears an eye patch over one eye thus the average person is never able to tell if a pirate is blinking or winking. It's this common mistake that has led to a record breaking amount of sexual harassment claims. Or at least that's what Pablo likes to say. One day he came over to my house, and I only call it a house because I don't know what else to call this box in the sky that I share with my mother and brother, and told me that his sister's job was hiring.

Now, thirty-plus short stories and three novels later, ideas keep coming, with novel number four well underway.  Do they share anything in common?  Each has its own unique voice and tale to tell, some in the old style and some in the flavors of Chunky Monkey and Marshmallow-Cherry swirl.  Yet, at their heart, my stories tell a tale of the human condition – the good, the bad and the ugly. My literary roots, planted in the American Midwest, thrived when transplanted – over thirty-nine years ago – to the rich, cultural soil of Ontario.  Warmed by a Florida sun, I now divide my winters between Port St. Lucie and Port St. Joe.  Those roots have grown to become the life I’ve always dreamed of having: writer, dreamer and storyteller.

Ursula's parents have approved this trip hoping their daughter will find herself a suitable husband there. But the only thing Ursula desires is a life filled with excitement and adventure; marriage is the last thing on her mind.Seizing a one-time opportunity to travel into the inner depths of India's jungles, Ursula meets the Zemi Nagas. She falls in love with the untamed spirit of the Zemi and the wildness of the countryside. With her heart breaking, she must leave, but she vows to find a way to return. Being strongwilled Ursula found a way to do just that. \"Naga Queen\" is a completely riveting read. Hayton's writing style is impeccable and, even though this is a fictional biography, the reader will be hard pressed to figure out what is truth and what is myth. Hayton has skillfully woven Ursula's amazing life into a rich tapestry that was truly a pleasure to read.Reviewed by Charline Ratcliff for RebeccasReads (8/11)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With accessible examples and abundant statistics to back up his claims, Ryan Avent--the economics correspondent ofThe Economist--shows how high housing rates in these cities have driven people away and reduced not only productivity, but also creativity and opportunity. His solution is simple: let more people in by creating more housing, thus lowering housing rates and making them affordable again.

If you are lucky enough to travel to Boston or any of the surrounding towns during whale watching season, do not miss out!The food in Boston is incredible, and there are infinite options! Charles Street in Beacon Hill begins at the Boston Common, and is one of those charming strolls that stay with you forever. After dining at The Paramount, I discovered that Charles Street was an attraction in itself with its old New England charm and lively atmosphere. The USS Constitution is docked in Charlestown as of 2011. She was moved from the harbor, but can still be seen and toured. Charlestown would be your last stop on the Freedom Trail. \"Old Ironsides,\" as she is often referred to, is the oldest warship still afloat in the world. She was commissioned by George Washington in 1797, and still gets taken out to sail every few years. I strongly recommend renting a car to leave the city and explore other towns in the area. Rockport is where I got engaged and so it will always hold a place in my heart, but Gloucester, New Bedford, Plymouth, and Salem are all worthwhile places to experience. Wherever you decide to stay, eat, and play, Boston has something for everyone.David Hoffmann, Davidsbeenhere.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At Duke and across the country, Coach K is recognized as a titan of basketball, and Cohen, a Duke graduate and former \"Cameron crazy,\" does not shy away from this characterization. Using interviews with Krzyzewski’s wife, his daughter, coaches, former players, and even the man who first hired Coach K at Duke, Cohen paints a portrait of a man who grew up in ethnic Chicago, played and coached at Army (tellingly, under Bobby Knight), and eventually landed on the campus of one of the nation's most elite universities. Despite his unprecedented success and undeniable drive to win, Krzyzewski comes across as a thoughtful and layered man. About his experience bringing the gold back to Team USA, he had this to say: \"The best thing is how much I've learned at a time in my career when, really, where do you learn?\" This is a man who is always learning, always striving. --Chris Schluep", "related": [], "rank": 1199688, "title": "The Art of Winning (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Ben Cohen", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her mother's nose was always in a book while she was growing up, and this piqued her interest in reading.  Soon she became an avid reader like her mother, immersing herself in fictional lands and characters' lives.Then the day came, when she was about 11 or 12, that she wondered what it would be like to create characters of her own. Her junior high school years were filled with as many creative writing classes as the school would allow her to take, joining every short story contest she could and placing one of the Top 3 spots in the class every time.  During her teen years she began writing short horror stories for the mere pleasure of it.The short stories soon made way to her first full-length novel, \"War,\" which she completed when she was just 18 years old.  The novel revolved around a young girl coming of age during the advent of the Civil War.  Her taste for horror and suspense never left however and soon her novels evolved into historical gothic family sagas.Angela's novels and short stories have been compared to the likes of V.C. Andrews, James Patterson and even the great Shirley Jackson. Angela now lives in the Seattle area with her husband, stepdaughter, and Yorkshire Terrier.  She's an avid supporter of The Friends of the Seattle Public Library and is often found at the semi-annual sales with a suitcase and a ton of books in hand.Her favorite authors include Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Thoreau, and Kate Morton.  Her other interests include Opera, theater, history, and genealogy.  Angela's dream hobby is to become an antique book collector.", "related": [], "rank": 1350606, "title": "Dreams of Elysium (The Thorne Family Saga Book 2)", "author": "Angela Darling", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The unlawfulness of private infringement of those rights under color of state law remains the same.We would thus lose sight of the entire purpose of § 1983 if we held that defendants were not acting under color of state law.

The many often reluctant players, only a few of whom stand out, include local distributors like Buddy Kai and Dominic Rosario; established Japanese suppliers Johjima and his ambitious aide, Kitano; and L.A.-based Mexicans, led by Jesus Fernandez, who are trying to gain a foothold.

Sure, he learned a lot about electromagnets, but he learned even more about the pitfalls of being a know-it-all. It all started when his principal announced the school's first-ever science fair. The plot thickened when a local businessman announced that a computer would be the grand prize. A self-described computer nut, Jake refused to work with his best friend because he didn't want to share the prize. Finally, it came to him that his single-mindedness was turning him into a person he didn't like, and his project wasn't fun. Even though he and his partner took second prize, and thus no computer, Jake valued the experience. He sounds like a regular fourth grader as he describes his teachers and classmates. But he also digs deep to reveal the character-building lessons in everyday events. Full-page, black-and-white drawings show the competitive classmates as they work toward winning the great prize. A cut above the usual beginning chapter book because of its depth, this realistic plot and Jake's personality will seal the deal with transitional readers.Pat Leach, Lincoln City Libraries, NECopyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B0024VE1PI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They ignored all efforts to stop so our Coast Guard Cutter had to pull in front of two of the ships. The third ship took off  just as another U.S. Coast Guard Cutter arrived. Smaller boats came from Staten Island and Pier 9 and the men loaded their rifles as they proceeded to board the Russian ships. The Russians shouted back to us that they would resist us. They had big guns at deck level that were hidden under canvas but now the canvas was pulled back. The guns began moving and now they were pointed directly at us. This is the truth of what happened and not what you were told. We  were close to a shooting war.

He was assigned to Moscow from 1942 to 1945, where he was also the correspondent of the BBC's Overseas Service. After the war he turned to full-time writing of detective and adventure novels and produced more than forty-five books. His work was serialized, televised, broadcast, filmed and translated into some twenty languages. He is noted for his varied and unusual backgrounds -- which have included Russia, newspaper offices, the West Indies, ocean sailing, the Australian outback, politics, mountaineering and forestry -- and for never repeating a plot.

In this book, David Bakan, Dan Merkur, and David S. Weiss look at the great medieval Jewish philosopher's prescription for the cure of souls and its psychological significance. In theGuide of the Perplexed,Maimonides, who was also a physician, describes the soul's illness: when sinners rationalize evil as good, they limit their capacities to reason, imagine, and behave well, which also produces physical symptoms. The cure depends on repentance in love and fear of God that is attained through philosophical knowledge, the interpretation of dreams and visions, and mystical contemplation. The authors look at the Aristotelian background of Maimonides' psychology, Maimonidean mysticism, his beliefs about prophecy and sexuality, and what is known of Maimonides' client population. A final chapter discusses Maimonides and Freud, noting that many distinctive features of the cure of souls are shared by Freud's original formulation of psychoanalysis. Indeed, the many points of convergence suggest Freud's direct or indirect contact with Maimonides' legacy.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Horses had become an obsession in his drawings and hopeful experiences as he traveled through his younger years.   It wasn't until later with a shared love of horses with his young wife that horses became a reality. As they learned more of the aspects of horse care and riding, the family s horse desires grew. Steve's observation of his first ever Event hooked him and he went from obsessed to possessed. His first competitive years were infiltrated with mistakes, mishaps and learning experiences. It was a partnership with a gray horse, named Petoskey, which provided him with the experiences that he would cherish forever. During a decade of competitive experiences, Steve placed consistently in the ribbons and was fortunate enough to place four different times in Regional Championships with three of the horses he d trained. His love of the sport led him to start instructing others so that they could experience the sport he had come to feel so strongly about. Steve and his family bought and developed a farm. They all made it event friendly and a good place for training. Today he has an event team that competes throughout the Midwest and his farm holds mini-events for newcomers to test their skills.   To this day Steve believes in the philosophy once stated by Dr. Reimer Klimke (who won six Olympic Gold Medals in Dressage and one as a member of the German Eventing Team), Eventing is the ultimate equestrian sport for the most complete development of both the horse and rider. It is on this belief that Steve trains his horses and students.", "related": [], "rank": 2266217, "title": "An Event to Remember", "author": "Steve Farkos", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That virus never left me again, so from the mid 1970s I started collecting vintage cars myself. Naturally my first such car was a Mercedes, a rather neglected prewar 170V Cabriolet B.

Once back in civilian life, Buchan was elected Member of Parliament for the Combined Scottish Universities, but spent most of his time on his writing career. He wrote The Thirty-Nine Steps and other adventure fiction. He was in 1935 appointed as governor general by George V, king of Canada, on the recommendation of Prime Minister of Canada Richard Bennett, to replace the Earl of Bessborough as viceroy, and occupied that post until his death in 1940. Buchan proved to be enthusiastic about literacy, as well as the evolution of Canadian culture, and he received a state funeral in Canada before his ashes were returned to the UK and interred at Elsfield, Oxfordshire.", "related": ["B009FEONB4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Born in 1921, he qualified as a doctor and went on to work as an anesthetist at the famous St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, before a spell as a ship’s surgeon and then as assistant editor of theBritish Medical Journal. In 1952, he left medical practice to take up writing full time and embarked upon the Doctor series, many of which are based on his experiences in the medical profession and are told with the wry wit and candid humor that have become his hallmark. They have proved enduringly successful and have been adapted to both film and TV. His Great Medical Mysteries and Great Medical Discoveries series concern the stranger aspects of the medical profession, while The Private Life series takes a deeper look at individual figures within their specific medical and historical setting. Gordon will, however, always be best known for his comic tone coupled with remarkable powers of observation.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hana, a one-year-old macaque, can't resist imitating another adolescent macaque, Tampopo, although Tampopo's antics invariably result in trouble. However, when Tampopo ruins the vegetable garden and precious indigo cloth of a boy who is Hana's friend, Hana has second thoughts about following Tampopo's bad examples. Intended to combat peer pressure--and to inform readers of the boy's livelihood, weaving and dyeing hemp fibers--this book seems more an instructive tool than a tale to be read for pleasure. Talley's narrative, which introduces the monkeys and their shenanigans, might be edifying if supported by strong illustrations; yet the likenesses of the monkeys themselves are distractingly awkward. Their maudlin facial expressions, foreshortened bodies and prickly-looking fur clash with Maeno's gracefully rendered foliage and delicate, diluted watercolors. A book focused on monkeys demands an artist who draws them with authority.

Dickey (the number 43 of the title), whose increasingly unhittable knuckleball has taken Major League Baseball circa 2012 by storm, providing--Bottum argues--the long-awaited antidote to a decade-plus doping story that brought baseball all the way to Congress. Nevertheless, Bottum's passionate essay is more than a purist's screed on \"steroids, the sin against which R.A.

I'm afraid I've given the plot away, but it doesn't matter--stories like Pothier's shine in the white space between actions.

A decision to move to Scotland is\njust the ticket to solve their problems.A family tragedy almost\nstops them in their tracks but the matriarch of the family, Grace Tudor, won't\nallow them to give up their plans. Making the move to Scotland turns out to be\njust what the doctor ordered, and Amadeus is able to find his way back to the\nmusic and the wife he loves. The only thing hanging over their heads is whether\nthe coma's cause was health issues, or if it was attempted murder.While the content of this\nbook could be depressing, Ms. Salisbury writes her characters, and situations\nwith emotional strength and feeling.

I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although they follow a definite pattern (as is the case with episode's)\neach episode is written as a stand-alone story in its own right - so don't be\nafraid to 'jump in' anywhere along the line.Aviemore, the small town at the centre of\nthe story, is very much a real place and certainly worth a visit if you are\never in Scotland. Indeed, most of the places mentioned in the stories are in\nfact real places, though the names may have been altered for privacy's sake.\nThe green lochan for instance is a fantastic place for a picnic - and it is\nactually an opaque green colour. Do fairies really wash their clothes there?Although these episodes are categorised as\ncontemporary romance, I have to admit that there is as much action and\nadventure included, especially in the later stories. Contemporary romance it\nseems, is a little more 'gritty' these days than Sally and Robert would be\nhappy with - the Highland idea of morals a little more adverse to 'getting you're\nkit out' perhaps!I have visited and stayed in Aviemore many\ntimes, and continue to do so whenever I get the chance. It is a quiet peaceful\ntown, surrounded by spectacular mountains and beautiful highland scenery. - Ideal\nfor long walks and planning the next Sally book! This Highland town is popular\nboth in summer and winter for the many outdoor pursuits available; with Skiing\nin the Cairngorm Mountains, being the\nmajor draw over the winter period.Through these stories, I invite you to share\nand experience (albeit vicariously) the life of Sally and Robert, along with\ntheir growing family; as they settle into life in the highlands of Scotland. Encountering\nadventure and tribulation as well as love and romance - even murder mystery ! - life's twists and turns ensure that drama\nand intrigue, is never far away from the Lindsey household.", "related": ["B00CH40Z6G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Svenson, a prolific yet somewhat anonymous, writer of books for children. Jerry West was the pen name assigned to Svenson when he started writing The Happy Hollisters for the Stratemeyer Syndicate, a book packager well-known for its development of children's book series including Tom Swift, The Bobbsey Twins, The Hardy Boys, and Nancy Drew. Many of these series were intended to have long publishing lives, and were written by multiple authors using the same pseudonym. The Happy Hollisters, however, were all written by Andrew Svenson, whose identity as Jerry West was kept secret until several years after his death in 1975.  Andrew Svenson was born in Belleville, NJ, in 1910, and his interest in writing started early. He was editor of his high school newspaper and yearbook at Barringer High School in Newark, and then went on to study Creative Writing at the University of Pittsburgh. After his graduation in 1932, he worked as a reporter and editor for the Newark Star Eagle and the Newark Evening News. During this time, Andrew Svenson was encouraged by his friend and co-worker Howard Garis (author of Uncle Wiggily) to try his hand at juvenile fiction. Svenson joined the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1948, where he contributed to established series as Franklin W. Dixon (The Hardy Boys) and as Laura Lee Hope (The Bobbsey Twins).  The first volume in The Happy Hollisters was published in 1953 by Doubleday & Company, and he was made a partner in the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1961. As he wrote and developed 33 titles in The Happy Hollisters, he was also creating additional series for children under other pen names: Bret King by Dan Scott and The Tollivers by Alan Stone, the first series written for and about African-American children.  Andrew Svenson wrote more than 70 adventure and mystery novels for children, which were published in 17 languages and sold millions of copies. The Hollister family was modeled on his own family and he often used Svenson family events and travels as the foundation for The Happy Hollisters books. He also kept copious newspaper clippings for story ideas, and interviewed hundreds of school children and teachers for additional suggestions. These ideas were worked into his storylines, adding an educational element that was appreciated by parents and educators alike. Children loved the books for their elements of danger and excitement geared to their comprehension level.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After a visit to a clairvoyant and a  long deliberation, he finally decided that he will go to Mexico and try  it out. Many things happened to David in Mexico, including losing a  friend to AIDS, meeting a best friend who is also HIV+, and living with a  young man that eventually became infected with AIDS. The Party’s Over  by David J. Cooper tells the real life story of David and the people he  met that were diagnosed with a disease that, until a few years ago, was  fatal. Now with the advances in medicine, people diagnosed with HIV can  have longer lives.David’s life was full of tragedy; I don’t  know how he survived mourning one friend because of a disease that would  take yet another friend. I am happy that David is strong and very  loyal. There were many times that he could have cut Cisco out of his  life, because it was as if he didn’t want to help himself, but David  stood by him all throughout the course of his illness.This book  shows that when The Party’s Over, we will have to face the consequences  of our actions. Some may come out of it unscathed but some, like Cisco,  can get AIDS. What I like about this book is that it spreads awareness  about AIDS. David J. Cooper shows that even if you have this deadly  disease, by taking your medication religiously and having regular  medical checkups, you can still live a normal life. Your life doesn’t  have to revolve around the disease.I thought this was a real heartfelt story of friendship and lost! About how we are the only ones who control our own Destiny!Greater love has no man,that he lays down his life for another. It's tragic in one so young, to have to die and could have lived!Written from the heart, and very moving. I experienced your suffering while reading it.This has the ingredients of a good story - the man leaving his safe job to follow his destiny to Mexico.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Gay & Lesbian", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So, whether you enjoy your series one installment at a time, or you like to read a longer work, we have you covered.The Monday Collection, Volume OnecontainsManic Monday, A Month of Mondays,andThank God it's Monday. All these installments are also available to purchase separately if you wish.The Monday Collection, Volume Twowill be released in the fourth quarter of 2014 and will include the final four parts of the Jake Monday saga:Rainy Days and Mondays(March 2014),Can't Wait for Monday(May 2014),Mad Mad Monday(July 2014), andMonday Bloody Monday(September 2014).I get the question from time-to-time:what inspired you to write this story? With Jake Monday, my inspiration came from a multitude of sources. Authors like Ludlum, LeCarre, Fleming, and Follet come to mind. Also, I enjoy watching series on television: \"Alias,\" \"Heroes,\" \"Lost,\" \"Supernatural,\" \"The X-Files,\" and \"Hannibal.\" All of these have elements that influenced my writing.The\n Jake Monday Chroniclesbegan in 2003 when I wrote a short story about an\nassassin named Jake Monday. I had no plans, really, but I had a sentence\n running through my head. The sentence that launched this series began:\n\"Jake Monday hated Mondays more than any other day of the week.\"The\n idea that a high-profile assassin would be unhappy, unsatisfied, and\nstruggling with his past and future, is not unique. I wanted to explore new\n areas of this theme. I thought of family, of a past hidden, of the\nmoral challenge of an individual that finds himself caught in a massive\nglobal conspiracy while grappling with the choices he has made,\nwillingly or not.So, Jake Monday is my Jason Bourne. Hallie is\nmy Sidney Bristow (from Alias). My villains...well, they are all my own.\n I love to draw villains who are deep, believable, and scary. Not\nbecause they always represent the antithesis of the hero, but just the\nopposite: my villains are not much different than all of us. I do not\nbelieve in \"grey areas,\" but I do believe the line between good and evil\n can be narrow. One wrong move and even someone like Jake Monday can be\nheading in the wrong direction.", "related": ["B00J39NO9S"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 3.6667, "rating_total": 33.0}

Always an avid reader,he decided at an early age that one day he wanted to be a writer himself. Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer influenced the direction his writing would initially take -- hardboiled detective mysteries. Dundee sold his first short story, featuring Rockford, Illinois-based PI Joe Hannibal, in 1982. Since then there have been, to date, over twenty Hannibal short stories, three novellas, and seven Hannibal novels. The Hannibal books and stories have been published in several languages and nominated for an Edgar, an Anthony, and six Shamus Awards. BLADE OF THE TIGER and short-story collection BODY COUNT celebrate Hannibal's first 30 years in print. Dundee has recently also gained acclaim for his work in the Western genre. His 2010 short story \"This Old Star\" received the Peacemaker Award from the Western Fictioneers writers' organization. His debut Western novel, DISMAL RIVER, won the 2011 Peacemaker for Best First Western. RECKONING AT RAINROCK, the sequel to DISMAL RIVER, was released in June of 2012. In 2009, Dundee retired as general manager for a small manufacturing facility and is now devoting full time to writing. Subsequent to the passing of his beloved wife Pam, Dundee shares a home in Ogallala, Nebraska, with his daughter and her family. He is working on further Joe Hannibal adventures as well as more work in the Western genre.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Not the eyes of enviormental ignorance that leads to self destruction. Darrell Louis speaks of his rock bottom experiences both in and out of prison. But by being a believer, stepping out on faith, his setbacks became his set up. All he had to do was to wholeheartedly reach out to God's steady, unchanging hand.

After pastoring a church for 35 years he discovered that what he had been taught did  not correspond with scripture.  His new perspectives brought new understanding to the Bible and Dr. McRay decided that the truth must be spread, even at the  cost of losing his pstorate.   He has developed a unique approach that reveals obscure and overlooked scriptures in an easy to understand way and brings light to many misunderstood  doctrines and prophecies. In his writings, he often uncovers new information, that mysteriously, has been hiding in plain sight, but missed by so many Bible  scholars.  By using scripture to prove scripture, he imparts a straightforward approach to uncovering the truths of the Bible.  Many students of scripture  have discovered his insights to be an accurate application of scriptural principles on many subjects, especially eschatology (the study of last things). In 1990, Dr. Ron began offering books and teaching materials that open the Bible's true meaning to believers around the world thru his company, None Left  Behind.

I began reading when I was four. I wrote my first story at five years old and my first poem at seven. Since then, I've written plays, tutorials, scholarly articles, marketing brochures, software specifications, self-help books, press releases, a five-hundred page dissertation, and of course, lots of erotica and erotic romance. In addition to writing, I also edit erotica and erotic romance. My editing credits include the ground breaking anthology Sacred Exchange, which explores the spiritual aspects of BDSM relationships, the massive collection Cream: The Best of the Erotica Readers and Writers Association, the charity anthology Coming Together: In Vein, a collection of vampire tales that benefits Doctors Without Borders, and six volumes of the Coming Together: Presents series of single author charitable erotica books. You'll also find me writing the newsletter and occasional articles for the Erotica Readers and Writers Association (www.erotica-readers.com) and monthly reviews for Erotica Revealed (www.eroticarevealed.com). My lifelong interests in sex and the written word became serenditipitously entwined more than a decade ago when I read my first Black Lace book by Portia da Costa. Her work inspired me to take my fantasies out of the closet (and the private email files) and expose them to the world. The rest, as they say, is history (although granted, no more than a minor footnote!) I've always loved traveling; my husband seduced me in a Burmese restaurant by telling me tales of his foreign adventures. Since then I have visited every continent except Australia, although I still have a long travel wish list. Currently I live with him and our two exceptional felines in Southeast Asia, where I pursue an alternative career that is completely unrelated to my creative writing.", "related": ["B00F3K093U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Aaron Balick has pulled off something remarkable - his book is one of the best examples of the cultural application of therapy thinking that I have read. But he has also shown how the internet expands and disrupts the cosy assumptions of psychodynamics and psychotherapy. While it will no doubt be read by all sentient therapists, more importantly this should be a break-out book as well, clicking its way into the public conversation.' - Andrew Samuels, Professor of Analytical Psychology, University of Essex 'Social media has changed all of our lives. It's all too easy to pretend that it doesn't impact on our clinical practices and that we and the people we see are sequestered behind our consulting room doors. Not so. Social media has infiltrated our psyches demanding that we rethink issues of recognition, longing, connection, and dissociation. Aaron Balick does this magnificently, anticipating not only what psychotherapists would like to know and theorise, but also anyone else who is interested in the deeper psychological meanings of social networking and our society. Read it and reflect.' - Susie Orbach, psychoanalyst and author of The Impossibility of Sex This is a timely book looking at the enormous impact that social networking has had on our society and how it is profoundly influencing our lives. While there is currently a great deal of thinking about the psychological ramifications of these sorts of changes there has been little work looking at the psychodynamics of individuals who use and depend upon these social networks, and the consequences for themselves and their important relationships. Popular hubs of social networking such as Facebook and Twitter feature centrally in this text, as well as the impact of the ubiquity of access through smartphones; the nature of this impact on interpersonal relationships and the formation of the 'self' will be of particular interest. The approach taken differs from many books already on the market as the author takes a psychodynamic approach: that is, investigating the nature of social networking on the personal and social unconscious and its relationship to how we create, build, and maintain relationships. Insights from relational psychoanalysis inform the text. Relational psychoanalysis being that which concerns itself primarily with relating to others as a primary human motivation, taking in both unconscious object relational perspectives alongside relationships with real others. Social networking is interpreted as a new and relatively under-researched ground in which relational dynamics are played out. Psychotherapists encounter the inside story and personal narratives of individuals living more and more of their lives online, hence the psychothereapeutic perspective gives a particularly unique insight into this matter. The Psychodynamics of Social Networking uses contemporary psychoanalytic theory to investigate the processes involved particularly in the ways in which individuals engage with each other through social networking, ultimately constructing how individuals perceive themselves both within and outside this context. Psychodynamic theory is applied to a variety of existing research and personal narratives is used to illustrate theory.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Insp. Ernest Hardcastle, of the Metropolitan Police (after 2012's Hardcastle's Frustration). On New Year's Eve 1915, the DDI's plans for celebrating are disrupted by the murder of jeweler and pawnbroker Reuben Gosling. A witness reports seeing two men speed off in a motorcar, but when the police locate the vehicle's owner, wealthy Sinclair Villiers, he plausibly denies any involvement. Routine police work leads to the discovery that Sinclair's army captain son, Haydn, who often borrows the car, spent the night of the crime with his colonel's wife. Hardcastle, theorizing that an enemy of Haydn's was trying to frame him, looks into an espionage angle, only to find British intelligence intervening in the case. Ison does little to distinguish Hardcastle from countless other gruff series leads, but he does offer readers a genuinely unusual secret at the heart of the mystery.

The political situation is also a great plot element, you can just feel the dwarven tension, they clearly don't want to face the hoards, and the goblins are going out to essentially make it inevitable that they'll have to. They certainly need to steer a careful path between their principals and the Tajum dinner table.

This series, aimed at many different age groups at once, takes children along the journey to discovering bees and the benefits that they bring to our world. In Honeybee Reads Time, we get a chance to learn about analogue time in hours. This includes the life cycle of honeybees and time. Bees ask eggs when to hatch, when to spin, when to eat, etc. Of course, being eggs and such, they don't know what the time is, so the drone bees and queen bees help them out by showing them what time it is in analogue time. I like Jeanette Vuuren's honeybee series. As an apiary enthusiast, bees are something that should be approached cautiously, but can be great fun, and provide lots of good for a growing environment. If I didn't live in a small two-bedroom condo, I would have a hive for myself. While I'm not really sure what analogue time has to do with bee development, I guess that the book succeeds in attempting to teach both the life cycle and stages of bees and analogue time. The drawings were cute, colorful, and bright, and sure to attract the attention of wandering eyes. This book would be a great fit for the age range of 3-5 and teaches them some of the most rudimentary vocabulary when it comes to bees and honey. Honeybee Reads Time may just pique your little one's interest and, before you know it, you'll have a hive in your own backyard!", "related": ["B00HK4RUHK"], "rank": 3487597, "title": "Honeybee Reads Time Volume 7", "author": "Jeanette Vuuren", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He highlighted the epic battle between\nthe cities of good and evil, the loss of innocence, and the great dark lord. So\nI reread Paradise Lost and fell in love with the angelic civil war. In a moment of\ninspiration, I mashed together the Norse myths with the biblical material in\nDante's Inferno and Paradise Lost. I spent months studying angelic folklore and\nrabbinical demonology. I added a runic magic system and fleshed out the setting\nfor a story. The problem was I\nhad no story. The setting sat\nthere, collecting dust, while I worked on other projects. After I survived a\nbattle with cancer. I wanted to write about it, but the world has enough\ndepressing cancer memoirs. So I tackled the problem with a dark fantasy. Underneath all the\nmonsters, intrigue, and epic battles, the heart of the story is a man\nstruggling with intense pain. The best parts of him are slowly dying, and the\nonce great empire he served is rotting from the inside out. He remembers better\ndays and regrets the way his life has become a twisted and dark thing. He\ndoesn't recognize himself anymore. This is what\ncancer feels like, but I buried the theme deep inside an action story. The\nplot is saving a baby from demons. The story is a warrior refusing to surrender\nagainst impossible odds. The theme adds depth to the fantasy, but, if I've done\nmy job as a storyteller, readers should care more about the monsters stalking a\nlittle girl in a dark forest.", "related": ["B00FXJTV7Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Berry is an independent author from Baltimore, Maryland.  From a very young age, she enjoyed reading.  She would often share what she'd read with her mother and grandmother, making her the official storyteller of the family.  Before long, she enjoyed writing her own stories, and exploring her ever-growing imagination. As an adult, she never stopped writing, but lack of confidence in her abilities slowed her willingness to share her pastime with others.  Many of her stories were considered \"out there\" and consisted of fantasy and mythology. After meeting May Torres, she realized that she now had a kindred spirit in writing and began to share some of her stories with her.   Having always been fascinated by Greek Mythology, R.C. Berry embarked on writing her first novel, Set In Stone: The Life & Death of Medusa.  She always enjoyed writing stories that were \"different\" or showed things from another point of view. After completing her novel, she hated the thought of her work being rejected or altered in order to make it more \"successful\".  She decided to publish her book independently and, along with May Torres,  founded Touche Publishing, to help those who would also like to self-publish. R.C. Berry currently lives in the south with her husband, and continues to write.", "related": ["B004VMU5Y4"], "rank": 1633808, "title": "Set In Stone", "author": "R.C.

Fast forward two years, shortly after having my second child, I was diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer. During my fight against this disease, I began researching possible causes. I soon began to learn just how many harmful ingredients were not identified on product labels. I vowed once I recovered to share my knowledge through my newly established company producing all natural products, that include soaps, balms, bath salts, etc etc. My books are intended to not only educate, but also to share the knowledge and passion that I have gained through my struggles over the last few years.
