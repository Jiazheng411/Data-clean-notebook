After escaping from slavery, he became a leader of the abolitionist movement, gaining note for his dazzling oratory and incisive antislavery writing. He stood as a living counter-example to slaveholders' arguments that slaves did not have the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens. Many Northerners also found it hard to believe that such a great orator had been a slave. Douglass wrote several autobiographies, eloquently describing his life as a slave, and his struggles to be free. His first autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, was published in 1845 and was his best-known work, influential in gaining support for abolition. He wrote two more autobiographies, with his last, Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, published in 1881 and covering events through and after the Civil War. After the Civil War, Douglass remained active in the United States' struggle to reach its potential as a \"land of the free\". Douglass actively supported women's suffrage. Following the war, he worked on behalf of equal rights for freedmen, and held multiple public offices. Douglass was a firm believer in the equality of all people, whether black, female, Native American, or recent immigrant. He was fond of saying, \"I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong.\"", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As she eased her foot onto the brake she turned her attention to Jonas in the front passenger seat, a stranger to her now after his coma and brain injury. She wished she could control the quake of her pulse as she watched his face, his dear, handsome face. His forehead furrowed in thought as he studied the house in front of them—the home they'd fallen in love with together.Oh, Lord, let him remember.It was a lot to ask, she knew. From the moment he'd woken from a deep coma and through a long stay at an intensive rehabilitation clinic in Seattle, he hadn't had a single recollection of their lives together. All the memories they'd made together were lost to him. And without those memories, he looked at her with a stranger's gaze. The doctors had been very sure his memory would not return.She didn't know how it could be that she was a stranger to the man she'd loved so fiercely, who'd been her best friend and husband for over seven years and the father of their two children. She didn't realize how much she had hoped the sight of their house would spark something for him.No recognition flared in his eyes as he turned to her. \"We live here?\"\"Yes.\" The word scratched like sandpaper against the inside of her throat. She tried hard not to let her disappointment show as she hit the remote on the visor. The garage door opened. \"We had the house built and we moved in right before Tyler was born.\"\"Tyler.\" Sad lines crinkled around Jonas's eyes. \"Is he waiting?\"\"He's not home right now.\"\"Yes, that's right.\" He released a heartfelt sigh and rubbed his forehead as if it were hurting him. He looked truly distressed, but maybe the worst pain wasn't physical. \"I wish I could remember my own kids.\"\"Me, too.\" She eased the minivan into the garage. \"My sister Katherine will be bringing them home in a little while. She was thoughtful enough to offer to take them a bit longer, so you could face things one step at a time.\"\"Katherine is the one in college?\"\"No, that's Rebecca. Katherine is my older sister.\"\"Oh. Okay.\" He gave a wobbly half smile, half frown. The left side of his face still troubled him. \"Iwillget it.\"\"You will. Don't worry.\"She pulled the emergency brake and shut off the engine, deliberately concentrating on each task because it was predictable and familiar. Unlike her marriage. She'd been praying for this day to come for so long, it had begun to feel unreal and impossible.Now, after a long hospital stay and a longer period in rehabilitation, they were alone together. The garage door slid shut behind them. She was alone with her husband, the man she no longer knew. The man who could not remember the simplest things about their marriage. When he turned his questioning gaze to hers, she knew that he did not know what to expect. He remembered nothing new.Disappointment sifted through her. She didn't realize she was holding her breath until she felt her lungs burn. She had to remember to breathe. She had faith, and it would lift them both up, right?Right, she told herself, fighting off a world of doubt, despite her strong belief. The journey ahead of her—of them—seemed monumental.\"Let's go inside, and maybe once you're in the house things will seem more familiar to you.\" She grabbed her keys and her purse and forced a smile.His dear face, the same in many ways and changed in others, stared back at her. \"What if it doesn't? I'm—\" He grimaced. \"I don't know the word. I'm—\" Frustrated, he stared down at his gnarled hand.\"It doesn't matter, Jonas. It's okay.\" She wanted to believe that.As she stepped from the seat and closed the door behind her, she realized he was still sitting in the minivan, with tension on his face and sadness in his eyes. What must it be like, she wondered, to come home to a place you could not remember? To feel the weight of a wife's need and expectations?She took another deep breath and opened his car door. Poor Jonas. She helped him out and unfolded his walker. His right hand gripped the walker's handles with white-knuckled force while his left one struggled to do so. All the love in her heart flooded out, filling her with sweet tenderness. This was hard for her, but it was harder for him, and at least he was here. He washere.She was deeply grateful for that.She slipped her purse strap onto her shoulder and her keys into her jacket pocket and took Jonas's frail arm. \"This is going to be tricky. It's a long way to the door for you, so lean on me.\"\"I can get it.\" He looked so determined as he moved his nerve-damaged leg.While the Good Lord had been gracious in bringing Jonas back to her, the bullet had not been kind. Her heart broke as he struggled so hard to cross the garage floor, even with her help. By the quiet steely set to his jaw, she could tell he hated it. Her once-strong, invincible husband, who rarely missed a workout at the gym the entire time she'd known him, was now forced to lean on her and his walker.\"Don't tell me,\" he quipped between struggled steps. \"I used to do this faster.\"\"Yes, you did.\" Danielle unlocked the garage door. \"But I always said our lives were going by too fast, we were always rushing here and there. It's nice to slow down and take in the sights.\"He stopped to smile, and his grin was lopsided and strained. \"I'm taking the, what is it, slow—something?\"\"It's the scenic route.\" She hit the remote on her key ring and the security system stopped beeping. She held the door patiently while he struggled to get his walker and then his feet over the doorstep. She stopped him with a touch of her hand to his. \"Look around. You made it. You're home.\"He was silent for a moment, gazing down the hall as if taking in the details of woodwork and walls, of the living room ahead and, to the right, the archway leading to the kitchen. \"The kids.\"At first she didn't know what he meant, but then she realized he was commenting on the framed photographs marching along the wall. \"Yes. These are the pictures I have taken once a year at a professional photographer.\"\"That's why they're tidy.\"\"Yes.\" She looked at the carefully posed photographs with rich backgrounds. \"The kids are in their best clothes. It was a challenge keeping them that clean and neat for the short drive from here to their appointments.\"\"No ice cream in the car?\" There was that lopsided grin again, but this time with a hint of his old smile, too.Her heart filled at the glimpse of her husband she knew and loved so well. \"No ice cream,\" she agreed. \"They had to wait until after the sitting. I have more pictures throughout the house, but they're snapshots.\"\"Not as tidy.\"\"No. In fact, there are some very messy pictures.\"\"Pictures of you, too?\" His smile faded. Something serious, and maybe a little bit fearful, came onto his face.I wish I knew what he was feeling, she thought wistfully. Once, she'd known him so well, there would have been no question. She would have known what he was thinking even before he did.Determined to stay upbeat, she laid her hand on his broad shoulder. \"Yes, there are pictures of me. And of you.\"\"I want to see them.\"\"Sure, but it's going to take a long time to go through them. There are so many.\"\"I've got time. Lots of time.\"She watched the pain on his face and didn't know what more to say. \"Down the hall is the living room. Let's get you sitting down.\"\"I need to rest.\" He nodded once in agreement and set his chin. After gripping the handles of his walker tightly, he concentrated on stepping forward. The carpet absorbed most of the thunk and shuffling sounds as he painfully made his way down the short hallway. He was out of breath by the time he reached the living room. She supported his elbow as he dropped, exhausted, onto the couch.\"I'll be right back.\" She smiled at him.There wasn't the zing of emotional connection that had always been between them, and as she hurried to the kitchen, she fought deeper frustrations. Why had she thought things would be better once they were home?It wasn't fair to put so much pressure on him, she realized while she filled his favorite mug with water and zapped it in the microwave.She needed to give him all the time he needed, no matter how hard that would be. He'd asked for pictures, and that's where they would start. As the water heated, she grabbed a small book of snapshots from the corner hutch in the dining room. She caught her husband watching her as she came toward him.He looked terribly serious, and she wondered if he was disappointed in her. She was painfully aware of the wash-worn jeans she'd put on this morning—the laundry was woefully behind—and the favorite summery T-shirt was hardly high fashion.She'd been spending so little thought and even less time on her appearance. What if she looked like Frankenstein's bride after standing all night in the rain? Worse, when was the last time she'd glanced in a mirror? Who knew what her hair was doing? And what about the big dark bags under her eyes from long-term sleep deprivation?No wonder he was looking a little panicked. She slid the small book onto the coffee table that separated them. \"These were the pictures we took on our last vacation. Maybe that will be a good place to start.\"\"Vacation.\" He stretched out his hand, straightening his fingers, and snagged the book from the table. \"Where'd we go?\"\"I'm not telling. See if you can figure it out.\"\"Someplace important, then.\" He watched her carefully, and his emotion was unreadable to her. \"I'll see what I can do.\"The bing of the microwave saved her. \"I'll be right back.\"She spun on the heel of her sneakers and retreated to the safety of the kitchen. This was worse than starting out on a first date with someone, she thought as she rescued the steaming mug. Back then, she'd felt comfortable with Jonas right from the start, so their first date had been familiar, as if meant to be.But this, now with him, was painful in too many ways to count...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His father, like his grandfather, was a barrister of good standing and high character; his mother, remarkably beautiful, accomplished, elegant, and amiable, was the object, on his part, of a profound and worshipping affection, maintained unchanged throughout the whole of his life. Educated at the Institution of Pestalozzi, at Yverdun (Canton de Vaud), he acquired at an early age the habit of investigation and the freedom of thought of which his later life was destined to furnish so striking an example. Endowed by nature with a passion for teaching, he devoted himself, from the age of fourteen, to aiding the studies of those of his schoolfellows who were less advanced than himself; while such was his fondness for botany, that he often spent an entire day among the mountains, walking twenty or thirty miles, with a wallet on his back, in search of specimens for his herbarium. Born in a Catholic country, but educated in a Protestant one, he began, while yet a mere boy, to meditate on the means of bringing about a unity of belief among the various Christian sects, a project of religious reform at which he labored in silence for many years, but necessarily without success, the elements of the desired solution not being at that time in his possession.  Having finished his studies at Yverdun, he returned to Lyons in 1824, with the intention of devoting himself to the law; but various acts of religious intolerance to which he unexpectedly found himself subjected led him to renounce the idea of fitting himself for the bar, and to take up his abode in Paris, where he occupied himself for some time in translating Telemachus and other standard French books for youth into German. Having at length determined upon his career, he purchased, in 1828, a large and flourishing educational establishment for boys, and devoted himself to the work of teaching, for which, by his tastes and acquirements, he was peculiarly fitted. In 1830 he hired, at his own expense, a large hall in the Rue de Sevres, and opened therein courses of gratuitous lectures on Chemistry, Physics, Comparative Anatomy, and Astronomy. These lectures, continued by him through a period of ten years, were highly successful, being attended by an auditory of over five hundred persons of every rank of society, many of whom have since attained to eminence in the scientific world.  Always desirous to render instruction attractive as well as profitable, he invented an ingenious method of computation, and constructed a mnemotechnic table of French history, for assisting students to remember the remarkable events and discoveries of each reign.  Of the numerous educational works published by him may be mentioned, A Plan for the Improvement of Public Instruction, submitted by him in 1828 to the French Legislative Chamber, by which body it was highly extolled, though not acted upon; A Course of Practical and Theoretic Arithmetic, on the Pestalozzian System, for the use of Teachers and Mothers (1829); A Classical Grammar of the French Tongue (1831); A Manual for the use of Candidates for Examination in the Public Schools; with Explanatory Solutions of various Problems of Arithmetic and Geometry (1848); Normal Dictations for the Examinations of the Hotel de Ville and the Sorbonne, with Special Dictations on Orthographic Difficulties (1849) These works, highly esteemed at the time of their publication, are still in use in many French schools; and their author was bringing out new editions of some of them at the time of his death.  He was a member of several learned societies; among others, of the Royal Society of Arras, which, in 1831, awarded to him the Prize of Honor for a remarkable essay on the question, \"What is the System of Study most in Harmony with the Needs of the Epoch?\" He was for several years Secretary to the Phrenological Society of Paris, and took an active part in the labors of the Society of Magnetism, giving much time to the practical investigation of somnambulism, trance, clairvoyance, and the various other phenomena connected with the mesmeric action. This brief outline of his labors will suffice to show his mental activity, the variety of his knowledge, the eminently practical turn of his mind, and his constant endeavor to be useful to his fellow men.  When, about 1850, the phenomenon of \"table-turning\" was exciting the attention of Europe and ushering in the other phenomena since known as \"spiritist\", he quickly divined the real nature of those phenomena, as evidence of the existence of an order of relationships hitherto suspected rather than known, namely, those which unite the visible and invisible worlds. Foreseeing the vast importance, to science and to religion, of such an extension of the field of human observation, he entered at once upon a careful investigation of the new phenomena. A friend of his had two daughters who had become what are now called \"mediums.\" They were gay, lively, amiable girls, fond of society, dancing, and amusement, and habitually received, when \"sitting\" by themselves or with their young companions, \"communications\" in harmony with their worldly and somewhat frivolous disposition. But, to the surprise of all concerned, it was found that, whenever he was present, the messages transmitted through these young ladies were of a very grave and serious character; and on his inquiring of the invisible intelligences as to the cause of this change, he was told that \"spirits of a much higher order than those who habitually communicated through the two young mediums came expressly for him, and would continue to do so, in order to enable him to fulfill an important religious mission.\"  Much astonished at so unlooked-for an announcement, he at once proceeded to test its truthfulness by drawing up a series of progressive questions in relation to the various problems of human life and the universe in which we find ourselves, and submitted them to his unseen interlocutors, receiving their answers to the same through the instrumentality of the two young mediums, who willingly consented to devote a couple of evenings every week to this purpose, and who thus obtained, through table-rapping and planchette-writing, the replies which have become the basis of the spiritist theory, and which they were as little capable of appreciating as of inventing.  When these conversations had been going on for nearly two years, he one day remarked to his wife, in reference to the unfolding of these views, which she had followed with intelligent sympathy: \"It is a most curious thing! My conversations with the invisible intelligences have completely revolutionized my ideas and convictions. The instructions thus transmitted constitute an entirely new theory of human life, duty, and destiny, that appears to me to be perfectly rational and coherent, admirably lucid and consoling, and intensely interesting. I have a great mind to publish these conversations in a book; for it seems to me that what interests me so deeply might very likely prove interesting to others.\" His wife warmly approving the idea, he next submitted it to his unseen interlocutors, who replied in the usual way, that it was they who had suggested it to his mind, that their communications had been made to him, not for himself alone, but for the express purpose of being given to the world as he proposed to do, and that the time had now come for putting this plan into execution. \"To the book in which you will embody our instructions,\" continued the communicating intelligences, \"you will give, as being our work rather than yours, the title of Le Livre des Esprits (The Spirits' Book); and you will publish it, not under your own name, but under the pseudonym of Allan Kardec. Keep your own name of Rivail for your own books already published; but take and keep the name we have now given you for the book you are about to publish by our order, and, in general, for all the work that you will have to do in the fulfillment of the mission which, as we have already told you, has been confided to you by Providence, and which will gradually open before you as you proceed in it under our guidance.\"  The book thus produced and published sold with great rapidity, making converts not in France only, but all over the Continent, and rendering the name of Allan Kardec a household word\" with the readers who knew him only in connection with it; so that he was thenceforth called only by that name, excepting by his old personal friends, with whom both he and his wife always retained their family name. Soon after its publication, he founded The Parisian Society of Psychologic Studies, of which he was President until his death, and which met every Friday evening at his house, for the purpose of obtaining from spirits, through writing mediums, instructions in elucidation of truth and duty. He also founded and edited until he died a monthly magazine, entitled La Revue Spirite, Journal of Psychologic Studies, devoted to the advocacy of the views set forth in The Spirit's Book. Similar associations were speedily formed all over the world. Many of these published periodicals of more or less importance in support of the new doctrine; and all of them transmitted to the Parisian Society the most remarkable of the spirit-communications received by them. An enormous mass of spirit-teaching, unique both in quantity and in the variety of the sources from which it was obtained, thus found its way into the hands of Allan Kardec by whom it was studied, collated, coordinated, with unwearied zeal and devotion, during a period of fifteen years. From the materials thus furnished to him from every quarter of the globe he enlarged and completed The Spirits' Book, under the direction of the spirits by whom it was originally dictated; the \"Revised Edition\" of which work, brought out by him in 1857 has become the recognized textbook of the school of Spiritualist Philosophy so intimately associated with his name.

Therefore, my review is based on this book as a stand alone.Plot/Storyline: 4.75 StarsThe plot was interesting and well executed. There was a smidgen of romance imbedded in this average mystery contained in an exceptional fantasy. Even though I am not fond of the Romance genre, I do like a little 'side love' in my reading and this one was extremely well done. Two characters fall in love, but still manage to not make googly eyes at each other during inopportune moments, as happens in many 'romances'. The actual mystery seemed to almost be more of a side plot. It was average in its execution. The reader was not given any clues where they could have figured out who did it prior to being told. The fantasy portion was simply excellent. I truly enjoyed meeting Damian and would love to read another book involving him.Character Development: 4.75 StarsAs I stated, I read this book as a stand alone novel. Therefore, I didn't have the benefit of the previous book. In the beginning, when Rianna is with her 'friends', I truly felt as though I was missing something. These people did not act like 'friends', and I couldn't understand why she thought they were her friends. I never did gain that understanding, which I assume I would have had I read the first book.All other characters were very well developed.Writing Style: 5 StarsThe writing style of this author is excellent. The dialogue is exceedingly well done and descriptions are succinct.Editing/Formatting: 5 StarsI found no significant editing errors in this novel, and the Kindle formatting was perfect.Overall: This book is an excellent read for people who enjoy modern fantasy with a little romance and a light mystery thrown in.Rating: PG-13 for adult concepts", "related": ["B00JERUXHK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Over the six decades of his own highly successful career, he inspired many executives to find success and helped many companies to solve their most complex management problems. In 1929, Mr. Wetherill discovered a natural law controlling people's personal and interpersonal behavior. The law states that a person is required to think, say, and do what is right in order to get a right result. It further states that when he has a personal problem or trouble, it is because something is wrong about his thinking, conversation, and behavior. In addition to stating the law of behavior, Mr. Wetherill explains the penalty that results from attempted violation or disregard for that law. As with all natural laws, the behavioral law is self-enforcing. The person who deviates from what he knows is right installs, in the recesses of his mind, the wrong thinking he uses to justify his behavior.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Weber was born and raised in Indianapolis (Speedway, a suburb), Indiana in March of 1944.  Following graduation from Speedway high school in 1962 I went on to attend Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. I lived on the campus in a dormitory and was enrolled in a 2 year secretarial program.  Upon leaving Ball State I held a job for 32 years in the insurance industry with a big insurance company in Indianapolis, Indiana. After retirement from there I took a job as a cashier with a large grocery store (chain) also located in Indianapolis, Indiana. I greatly enjoyed both of these jobs.   While working at those two jobs I enrolled in several different intermediate and advanced computer night school programs. Taking review classes in beginning and intermediate Spanish interested me. I enrolled in night school to further my study. I plan to keep expanding my knowledge in the Spanish language.  My uncle Norman Edward Robinson became a permanent resident in a nursing home in July of 1977, in Indianapolis, Indiana. In June of 1977 I helped my mother, (his sister) dismantle his small 1 bedroom apartment. We'd learned that he would never be able to return to it due to health problems.   I found his last remaining (typed) diary with notations of many of his W.W.II stories tucked away in a drawer. Over nearly the next 5 years I visited with him in the nursing home. Gradually I coaxed him to verbally try to elaborate on those W.W.II stories. At first he was extremely reluctant to discuss the stories. Each time I visited I' tried to take very careful notes as he spoke.  Early in 2003, I began working on this book. This has been the first book that I have ever written.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Defining a learning problem as any innate or acquired characteristic that consistently interferes with one or more aspects of learning, Healey explains that the way a brain is wired accounts for disorders in language arts and math, social and personal organizational skills, and motor and sensory abilities. Whether a development problem becomes a disability (and if medication is appropriate) depends on its severity and expectations made of a child at a given age. Healey provides a very hands-on guide with anecdotal case studies, the latest brain science research data made comprehensible, and plenty of bulleted checklists covering symptoms, action steps, and advice. The first part focuses on the problems and possibilities for dys-sed kids; the second part presents the scientific how-and-why of juvenile brain function, the role of genetics, and intelligence and learning styles; the third offers proven techniques and remedies for destressing kids and their environments by limiting distracting or disruptive lifestyle factors. Every chapter features plenty of subheads and pullout questions or quotes, which make the pages visually accessible and help sustain interest in what could be an overwhelming topic. This is a ready reference parents will welcome.(Apr.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 2003 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism; \"Hashimoto's thyroiditis\" being the cause. This autoimmune form of thyroid disease that causes destruction of the thyroid gland resulted in my also developing \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\", due to a compromised immune system with severe co-morbid \"Adrenal Fatigue\".  I also suffered severe anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks early into the onset of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Hashitoxicosis). A common, benign heart murmur I was diagnosed with in my teens called \"Mitral Valve Prolapse\", also worsened in severity of symptoms, with the development of these other health disorders.  My eventual receiving of diagnoses was a difficult process with proper diagnostic testing not being ordered by the first doctors I sought treatment from. These types of issues were inspiration for me to become proactive in my own health care and to self-educate myself on these health disorders, which I have done extensively since 2003.

This is a serious engagement with biblical truth and it asks the reader to engage with it seriously, too. When we climb a mountain, we know that however long is the ascent, it is all made worthwhile by the view from the top. So it is here.”—David F. Wells, Andrew Mutch Distinguished Professor of Historical and Systematic Theology, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary“The Westminster Shorter Catechism rightly tells us that the chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever. And yet, ‘glorifying’ God and living for ‘the glory of God’ can often seem mysterious and ultimately disconnected from day-to-day life. In this new installment in the Theology in Community series, Christopher Morgan and Robert Peterson have pulled together a team that not only teach about God’s glory but in their very scholarship display ‘the visible splendor and moral beauty of God’s manifold perfections.’ As I read this book, I wanted to sing, ‘To God be the glory, great things he has done!’”—Sean Michael Lucas, Senior Minister, The First Presbyterian Church, Hattiesburg, Mississippi“There is no theme more central to the message of Scripture than the glory of God. He created the world so that his name would be glorified in and by the things he made, and he has saved us so that we might glorify him in eternity. It is a focus that a self-centered generation badly needs to recover, and the contributors to this volume have given us a wonderful introduction on which to base our reflections and our worship.”—Gerald Bray, Research Professor, Beeson Divinity School; author,Biblical Interpretation: Past and Present", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He chose these because they have known pathogens, can be fatal, and have had long histories. Not merely narrative or descriptive, his study is an attempt to demonstrate how human reactions and attitudes to these diseases have in turn shaped how they affect human communities. Going beyond an exercise in the social construction of disease, Aberth's historical focus on the interaction of disease and human response leads him to be optimistic about human abilities to adjust to and even neutralize biomedical effects. The longest chapter, on the plague, reflects the author's professional specialty. The second longest chapter is on AIDS; remaining chapters are 9-24 pages. Aberth's detailed attention to Islamic understandings of and reactions to plague is especially welcome. He opens each chapter by describing the disease and its effects, then for each disease develops unique reactions and attitudes as well as points introduced earlier, weaving an overall pattern of human progress and intransigence, of connections made and opportunities missed. Summing Up: Highly recommended. (CHOICE)The prospect of a slender volume about plagues in world history would certainly be attractive to all those who teach either disease history or world history. Moreover . . . it is an approach that most students would embrace.(Journal Of Interdisciplinary History)John Aberth offers a social interpretation of disease throughout history using a comparative global framework. He has a lively writing style, and each chapter is framed by lucid summary descriptions of disease symptoms, progression, transmission, treatments, and the respective debates.Plagues in World Historyshould be a profitable and successful textbook for undergraduate students and general readers.(Journal of World History)The author presents an effective case for the diseases he has chosen and provides the reader with current findings that allow for interpretations of disease origins.(The Historian)John Aberth has written a concise book that is both well-informed and clear about contemporary medical understandings of epidemics, and steadily conscious of their broader historical, political, social, and economic contexts. In an age when such epidemics as malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS affect millions, Aberth's arguments have continuing importance. (J. N. Hays, Loyola University, Chicago)Seeking understanding of our societies and selves by reading and writing books that omit all mention of the essential fact of wars would strike us as a glaring oversight. Yet our shelves are crammed with books that never mention epidemics, an equally vital force in human history.Plagues in World Historyis the authoritative and fascinating antidote to that error.

(Alan Roland, PhD)InImmigration and AcculturationSalman Akhtar has once again demonstrated a rare ability to provide an understanding of the life cycle conflicts and stresses of immigrants as they attempt to adapt to a new culture. This timely book is important to all of us as we deal increasingly with growing numbers of immigrant patients, students, and colleagues. Akhtar's compassionate understanding of the immigrant therapist is moving and insightful. His seamless blending of multidisciplinary perspectives will especially interest mental health professionals and be an ideal teaching aid in the classroom.

But this transformation has not come without controversy. Instead of calling in your orders to a broker who then would execute it via a floor exchange, the order now is instantly transmitted to the various market venues. The market has a new player, but it is not a person, it is a machine that can replicate the role of a liquidity provider but at a much higher rate of speed and efficiency. Sometimes controversial and most times misunderstood, the role of the automated trader is one of major importance in today's ever-changing marketplace.The High-Frequency Game Changer offers a forward looking overview of the high-frequency trading trend—including the movement into other asset classes, global domination, and retail traders getting into the game. The book examines who \"high-frequency traders\" are and analyzes the impact of high-frequency trading on the rest of the marketplace—in particular how it affects liquidity and trading strategies. The authors detail the far-reaching effects, both positive and negative, of this trend, looking at its effect on futures markets, global markets, quantitative trading, future regulatory changes, and more.The high-frequency trader story is one of how the shift of power in a profitable business can create a firestorm of misunderstanding. The High-Frequency Game Changer cuts through the confusion and shows how you can make the most of a fundamental change in the markets that is here to stay.", "related": [], "rank": 1754675, "title": "The High Frequency Game Changer", "author": "Paul Zubulake", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He also writes scintillating erotica and science fiction adventure stories. His publishing credits include seven novels, five short story collections and over 300 short story sales. From contemporary to historical, De Noux uses several recurring characters in his New Orleans stories and novels: NOPD Homicide Detective John Raven Beau (21st Century); NOPD Homicide Detective LaStanza (20th Century); Private-eye Lucien Caye (1940s) and NOPD Detective Jacques Dugas (1890s). A primary theme in De Noux’s fiction is the effect of violence on victims and their families as well as the sometimes debilitating effect of violence on law enforcement officers, private-eyes and their loved ones.  As a former private-eye and currently a police investigator, De Noux knows his subject well. De Noux’s stories span from mystery to mainstream, literary, suspense, thriller, science-fiction, fantasy, horror, erotica, humor, westerns, children’s fiction as well as cross-genre stories – erotic-detective, science-fiction mysteries and the like.  His stories have been published in the US, Canada, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Scotland, Sweden and Ukraine. From 1993 to 2006, De Noux taught creative writing and mystery writing at Tulane University, University of New Orleans, Delgado Community College and McNeese State University. He is the founding editor of two fiction magazines, MYSTERY STREET and NEW ORLEANS STORIES. O’Neil De Noux’s “The Heart Has Reasons” (Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine, September 2006) won the Private Eye Writers of America’s prestigious SHAMUS AWARD for BEST SHORT STORY 2007.  The SHAMUS is given annually to recognize outstanding achievement in private eye fiction. In 2009, the Short Mystery Fiction Society awarded the DERRINGER AWARD for BEST NOVELETTE to another Lucien Caye story, “Too Wise” by O’Neil De Noux (which appeared in Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine’s November 2008 Issue).  The Derringer Award is given annually to recognize excellence in the mystery short form. In September 2009, O’Neil De Noux received an Artist Services Career Advancement Award for 2009-2010 from the Louisiana Division of the Arts for work on his historical novel BATTLE KISS, set during The Battle of New Orleans.

The author follows the appeals, victories and defeats involved in Spain's, and then Chile's own, attempts to try Augusto Pinochet for crimes he committed as president of Chile in the 1970s and '80s. The tale begins when Dorfman, about to board a plane for San Francisco, first hears the news of Pinochet's detention by Scotland Yard and of Spain's call for extradition to try him for crimes against humanity. As Dorfman follows the case (listening by radio, watching live Webcasts and even sitting in the audience of the House of Lords) and leads readers through appeal after appeal, he dives deep into the history of Pinochet's ascension in 1973 and provides heartbreaking and horrific accounts of torture and murders committed by Pinochet's men under his command. All the while, with a philosophical scalpel, the author cuts away at the question, How did Pinochet come to be? How did he move from the man who, before the coup, was \"servile and fawning,\" to the man who called for the torture and murder of people who had counted him a good friend? Though the question is never fully answered in the end, and Pinochet is not tried by either Spain or Chile (for reasons of mental incapacity), the book finishes on a positive note, citing the Serbian uprising against Milosevic as influenced by the Pinochet episode. All in all, this is an excellent, quick and powerful read, accessible to everyone.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Henry, whom Sir Geoffrey considers \"devious and dangerous,\" also charges him with discovering the secret held by a Norman knight who died seven years earlier in the Welsh port of Kermerdyn. Before the start of the journey, someone fatally stabs the scribe who wrote the letters. Sir Geoffrey, an honorable man, must put up with disagreeable traveling companions, whose duplicity and self-interest he finds difficult to stomach—and whose machinations leave men wounded, ill, and poisoned. A surprise twist leads to a shocking conclusion. Subtle clues allow the reader to figure out what's going on before Sir Geoffrey does. (Mar.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

In fact, it's more about suffering in general than bereavement in particular. Garrett (The Gospel According to Hollywood) draws on a summer he spent doing clinical pastoral education—a kind of boot camp for hospital chaplains—to discuss the age-old theodicy questions. The book challenges certain myths that American Christians have swallowed about God—e.g., that God is a transactional ATM who is obligated to dispense good things to the faithful, or that it's Satan, not God, who makes rotten things happen. Some of these myths are eloquently debunked, while others—such as Americans' persistent faith in consumerism and their ability to buy health and happiness—deserve more ink. Garrett scores points with the powerful stories of the hospital patients he prayed alongside of as well as his own autobiographical discussions of dealing with severe depression. Christians who are looking for theologically nuanced ways of thinking about suffering can learn much from this brief book.(Sept.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Peter Berkrot's narration helps move the story along, creating unique voices for the characters. However, even spot-on narration doesn't help the story's main problems-lack of a driven plot line and character development.

So, we thought it was time to do another and wanted to focus on a book of our favorite recipes since 2000. We also wanted to put a spotlight on our test kitchen, a rare asset in the world of newspapers. How did you select the recipes to go in the book? You must have had to narrow down the final picks a lot!Actually, the selection was fairly easy because the food staff had already chosen their favorites for a roundup we did each year in December. We would comb through all of the tested recipes from each year and pick the top 8 to 12 recipes to reprint in the paper. So we had a ready list of about 120 \"best\" recipes to pull from for the book. The next step was picking 50 recipes that stood out from the crowd and reflected a good range of appetizers, entrees and desserts. Where do you see the future of food coverage by newspapers going? Although newspaper food sections have seen their space cut in recent years, I think food coverage will continue to be important. You'll see more food stories in other parts of the paper and more coverage of chefs and restaurants, which are so popular with readers. Recipes will continue to be important, especially those that focus on quick and easy weeknight meals, since we all are so busy these days. More recipes and instructional food videos will move to online news sites and mobile applications. At the same time, many cooks will venture into more ethnic cooking after sampling various cuisines in restaurants. The ingredients for many ethnic dishes will become even more available in American markets. What do you think consumers are looking for in recipes these days?In addition to fast and easy recipes, many cooks are looking for recipes for special diets such as no-gluten, low-fat, or for diabetics.

An educated general reading public - with some familiarity with European history - should also find this book of value, as an introduction to a strategically important region with a complex history. As a textbook, it supersedes most others, though its meticulous style and content makes it more suitable for advanced undergraduates and beyond.' - The English Historical Review 'Kasekamp's book is an innovative, comprehensive and balanced treatment of the history of all three Baltic States.

There is no better book to introduce the student to the fascinating story of the Baltic region.' - Professor James White, University of Glasgow, UK 'Required reading for all persons interested in Estonian, Latvian or Lithuanian history.

Sometimes I think we're not. In either way, the thought is staggering.\" It's a thought I fully agree with. I am of the opinion that most novels dealing with the existence of ETI treat the possibility in far too casually a manner. That's why I wroteIndistinguishable from God. I wanted to show one possible scenario of how the discovery of a genuine alien artifact could impact the major institutions of society. I think such a discovery might be the most profound event in all of human history.Have you ever wondered why, with all the claims of UFOs and contact with ETs, no one has ever submitted a real alien artifact? No, not a single one, not even the tiniest sliver. Wait, what's that I hear some of you saying? Such artifacts exist, only scientists refuse to recognize them, or the government hides them.I am aware of several objects people have claimed to be alien artifacts that were submitted for scientific tests. Always, every single one of them, without exception, turned out to be completely mundane objects of ordinary earthly materials. Why hasn't there been something far beyond our ability to explain, or even some exotic alloy, unknown on earth? Surely beings capable of traveling between star systems must have such materials. As a scientist, I say show me something like that, something we couldn't easily manufacture on earth, and I'll take your UFO claim seriously. As Carl Sagan was fond of saying, \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\"I also wrote this book to show how real science gets done. What sort of tests would be used? What sort of proof would be required? Real scientists are skeptics. They are not in the business of proving theories true. There real work is trying find the flaws in a theory, to disprove theories. That is exactly how the main character in this book proceeds.Does this mean the book has to be slow moving? Not at all. Read the comments from other science fiction authors, some of them also scientists. Give the book a chance and I think you'll find it to be well worth the price and your time.If you do buy the book, I ask that you take a few minutes to post a review. Nothing lengthy required. Two or three sentences would be enough. You will be doing your fellow readers a service and you will have my thanks for doing so.", "related": [], "rank": 4197811, "title": "Indistinguishable from God eBook", "author": "G Dedrick Robinson", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Davis Bunnwas recognized internationally as a consultant, lecturer, and speaker in the area of international finance and received invitations to address symposiums, conferences, and management meetings. His professional interests took a decided turn nearly eighteen years ago. Although he continued his career in international finance, he became a \"closet\" novelist. For nine years, he wrote with discipline and drive, never to have anything published. When one of his novels came to the attention of Bethany House Publishers, his status as an unpublished novelist changed. His first book,The Presence,was published in 1990 and quickly became a bestseller.A prolific writer, he now has over twenty books in publication, including three with Janette Oke, a wonderful children's picture book calledPrincess Bella and the Red Velvet Hat, the heartwarming gift bookThe Quilt,and his latest,The Dream Voyagers,originally published under the pen name Thomas Locke.\"The novels I've had published by Bethany House are the direction I hope my future writing will take--captivating stories of intrigue, drama and faith, with compelling characters in an enjoyable contemporary fictional setting,\" says Bunn. \"The emotional bonding that occurs with the reader in good fiction often gives the Christian message more direct meaning in the reader's life.\"Prior to his work in international finance, Davis completed studies in psychology and economics at Wake Forest University. Fluent in three languages, he has traveled extensively in more than forty countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Davis has also avocationally become a serious student of comparative religion, learning from Jewish rabbis, Buddhist monks, Muslim imams, Catholic priests, and Baptist ministers. Drawing on these experiences, Davis fills his books with colorful dialogue and richly textured settings.size : 5.4 x 8.3", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

No exercises or diets in this book? How am I supposed to get fit?Please allow me to rejoinder.Have you considered that maybe, just maybe, those may not be the right approaches?Let's face it. There are myriad books out there with excellent fitness and nutrition information. Some of my works address those topics and you are more than welcome to check them out. Now, if I were venturing a guess, I'd say you have been searching for the ideal exercise and nutrition program without success, otherwise you would not be reading this.I think the question we dare not ask is:Why has not your success been permanent with so many excellent programs available? Why are you not getting the results you deserve for all your efforts?Reasons are abundant. Some are legit, some are bogus. What I can tell you for sure is that my two decades of experience in the fitness field shows me that no matter how meticulous or well designed a program or system may be, it becomes a frustrating empty promise in the hands of those not ready for the task.And that, my dear friend, is what this book is about.It is time to find out whether the system you are following is the problem, or you are the problem, or if it's a combination of both. If you are taking your first steps into fitness, this is what you should know to prevent inflated delusions and wrenching heartbreaks.I hope you are not disappointed I will not reveal the best exercises to flatten your tummy or the magic food combinations to burn belly fat all day.Does that mean they don't exist?Not necessarily. Metaphorically speaking, I believe they are all around us. The problem is that we don't directly see them because we can only find them through an individual journey for which most are ill prepared.Will this message help?I can say with confidence, yes, it will! I love witnessing those who earn their health and fitness freedom by facing the hard truth and claiming their self-sufficiency.Will it offend?Without a doubt! It has created harsh reactions in the past and it will continue doing so. That's fine, only a small number is ready for this message and the responsibility it demands. Then again, it is only very few who enjoy great health and lasting results.Make no mistake! I did not write this with the purpose of depicting purple flowers and fluffy white kittens. My purpose is to separate those who are ready to change their lives and health from those who choose the shield of denial. Going straight to exercise or diet programs without recognizing the factors revealed in this book is a sure recipe for failure. It is also the major weakness and flaw of the current exercise and fitness models. I am not holding back when I present them in their guttural truth. Being fit involves a lot more than exercise and diet.May your health and fitness journey be productive and fulfilling.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

NOPD detective Skip Langdon, Smith's spunky heroine last seen in New Orleans Mourning, gets a ready-made suspect list from the victim's live-in lover, singing star Ti-Belle Thiebaud. Included are Ariel Bruge, Ham's assistant, apparently a woman scorned; his father George, enmeshed with family members in a bitter disagreement over the family's fast food (\"Poor Boy's Po' Boys\") chain; and Patty, the stepmother Ham was cool about. Skip notes the list's omissions: Ti-Belle herself (often heard arguing with Ham at the top of her powerful voice) and Melody, Ham's teenaged half-sister who vanished the same day Ham died. Skip doesn't miss much as she probes the victim's tangled relationships, remaining all the while a consistently convincing character herself, grumbling about her boss and anxious about her long-distance significant other. Smith's Big Easy setting is a lively blend of big city and gossipy small town.

After the First World War, however, he gave up legal work in favor of writing full time. He went on to complete some thirty books ranging from light-hearted farce to adventure thrillers. The Berry series established Yates’ reputation as a writer of witty, upper-crust romances, and he was also very successful with the thriller genre though the character Richard Chandos. As a consequence of his education and experience, Yates’ books encompass the genteel life—a nostalgic glimpse at Edwardian decadence and a number of swindling solicitors, and he regularly featured in bestseller lists and was greatly admired by both readers and fellow authors.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After just one week there, she was already hooked: she was intrigued by Shanghai’s mix of the contemporary and the historic—from the neon and steel of the modern skyline to the tree-arched lanes of the Old French Concession—and she fell in love with the contrast between the austerity of Communist architecture and the romantic, painted eaves of the Forbidden City in Beijing.After her vacation in China, Susie was so enamored of Shanghai that she decided to move there permanently. She has worked as a freelance journalist for a wide range of publications since then, includingCity Weekendmagazine,Shanghai Business Review, That’s Shanghai,and ChinaTravel.com.

Marc is a seasoned fundraiser and a smart teacher. He writes just like he talks -- down to earth, sympathethic and knowledgeable about the everyday challenges facing people in nonprofit organizations, and kind to beginners. And he knows Google+ inside and out because he uses it daily.I downloaded the book to my Kindle App on my iPad, set that by my computer, and then worked on my Google+ profile as I made my way through the book. I made a cool cover photo for my profile, polished my profile information, and tamed my Circles within a couple of hours. I don't have a business page on Google+, but I fully understood Marc's explanation of how to set one up. If you've set up a FB business page, you'll be pretty much at home with the Google+ set up.One thing I haven't tried but that Marc is enthusiastic about is the video conferencing feature that is called Google+ Hangouts. Marc makes a great case for using that Skype-like feature to collaborate with peers, steward donors, and just enjoy meeting folks.Since Marc is such an experienced fundraiser with a ton of teaching experience, while you're learning about Google+, you'll also pick up more than a few tips about how to do that well, from making the ask to thanking donors.Frankly, Marc's enthusiasm for Google+ is contagious. Just listen to him:\n\n\"I think Google+ is the most exciting social media innovation. The biggest search engine in the world is giving nonprofits a powerful, free way to significantly impact search results. And it has a robust, quickly growing community of users. That means that Google+ has more far-reaching implications than any social media platform yet....\"After reading Marc's book, I'll bet that you'll try Google+ if you haven't already. And if you're already there, you'll learn ways to make it even more valuable.http://nonprofit.about.com/od/socialmedia/fr/Google-For-Nonprofits-A-Quick-Start-Guide-To-Unleashing-The-Power-Of-Google.htm", "related": [], "rank": 2580398, "title": "Google+ for Nonprofits", "author": "Marc Pitman", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story relates the boundless love and support of\nHarper's parents and family, and the crucial role of the doctors and nurses at\nBethesda and elsewhere who contributed to his recovery.

One comes away from the reading with\nan understanding of what a close-knit and supportive organization the Navy is. The\nsupport of Academy superintendents Bill Mack and \"Ken\" Kinnard McKee, who\nallowed Harper to stay at the Academy, intelligently disregarding Navy\nRegulations, was indispensable to Harper's\nrecovery...There will be some people who question the treatment of Tomas a plebe\nupon his return...I am sure most people will share my negative reaction to Midshipman Twelpin*. However, these episodes clearly illustrate that Harper wanted no special\ntreatment in his fight to graduate from\nthe Academy, and be commissioned as a naval officer. The description of Harper's\ngraduation in June 1978, with all the attendant emotions that are involved, is\nexcellent.

When I was young and started working, we didn’t have much.  When I started making money (As I was the one of my brothers and sisters fortunate enough to have a job!) I would was to give money to my mother. On my payday I would give her the biggest portion of what I’d earned, and she’d look at me and say, “What do I do with this money?” I would reply, “I don’t know. It’s your money.” She’d never seen such a thing. Why did I do it? I just knew it was the right thing to do. No one had done this before, and neither had her husband.  Every Payday this would happen. I’d give her money, and she’d ask what she should do. All of a sudden bills were getting paid, and she had a few dollars in her purse. She could now buy her favorite bread, and give to the Church. In her eyes, she was now a millionaire! For me, I would turn and go on my way, with a grin on my face. This was better than any vacation!

TheLCA Handbookoffers a look at the role that life cycle information, in the hands of companies, governments, and consumers, may have in improving the environmental performance of products and technologies. It concisely and clearly presents the various aspects of LCA in order to help the reader better understand the subject.The content of the book was designed with a certain flow in mind. After a high-level overview to describe current views and state-of-the-practice of LCA, it presents chapters that address specific LCA methodological issues including creating life cycle inventory, life cycle impact assessment, and capturing eco-systems services. These are followed by example applications of LCA in the agri-food industry; sustainable supply chain management; solid waste management; mining and mineral extraction; forest products; buildings; product innovation; and sustainable chemistry and engineering.The international success of the sustainability paradigm needs the participation of many stakeholders, including citizens, corporations, academia, and NGOs. The handbook links LCA and responsible decision making and how the life cycle concept is a critical element in environmental sustainability. It covers issues such as building capacity in developing countries and emerging economies so that they are more capable of harnessing the potential in LCA for sustainable development. Governments play a very important role with the leverage they have through procurement, regulation, international treaties, tax incentives, public outreach, and other policy tools. This compilation points to the clear trend for incorporating life cycle information into the design and development processes for products and policies, just as quality and safety concerns are now addressed throughout product design and development.In this outstanding new handbook:A team of international experts leads you step by step through the entire LCA processYou will learn how to improve the environmental profile of your company's products and processes with life cycle, cradle-to-grave thinkingReal-world examples and case studies illustrate how you can use LCA to make sound decisions that lead to more environmentally sustainable choicesYou will hear the experts discuss how holistic thinking can lead to better policymaking, product and process innovation, supplier selection, eco-labeling, and moreAudience:Engineers, managers, economists, government policymakers, and scientists throughout industry and economists and engineers working in sustainability, whether in industry or research.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Then it hit me like a vacuum on the head. My house was a mess. And that made me feel like a mess. I felt horrible about myself and guilty that I was not teaching my children how to be organized.No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get organized. I read organization books and magazines. I took classes. I spent hundreds of dollars on plastic bins and organization paraphernalia. I even went so far as hiring a professional organizer.But guess what?None of it worked.It took me about ten years of searching until I discovered the secret to organization.This might shock you, but it's true.The truth is, no one can teach you how to be organized.Before you get outraged and send me an email in all CAPS, let me explain.Only you know how to get yourself organized. I can't do it for you. Not even the best organizer in the world can do it for you. That's because you hold the secret to your own organizational style.What can you expect from this book?I'll start by telling you what not to expect. You won't get a truckload of checklists or suggestions to buy plastic bins. You won't get a \"fool-proof\" methodology or system. I have found that just because a system works for one person, that does not mean it will work for you.I agree, my methods may be a little unorthodox.That's because I'm assuming if those methods didn't work for me, they probably won't work for you.I hate to ask you this question, but have you ever wondered why you are disorganized?These are some of the questions I wrestled with and discovered some really surprising things about myself.If you are ready to do some introspection--and even laugh at yourself (or at me), then this may be just the book for you.So let's get started. It's time to Get Organized NOW! or at Least Sometime Before You Die. . .Sincerely,Isabella McBride", "related": ["B00E3ERICC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 3.5455, "rating_total": 39.0}

Emmy-winning TV scriptwriter Paul Brock writes a novel that he deserving recognition and is convinced he must promote himself, as a celebrity, in order to make it a bestseller. Financed by his old Borscht Belt pal, brash show-biz entrepreneur Mel Steiner, he becomes a musical star by singing comic songs about middle-class life, such as \"Children's Shoes Blues\" and \"Me and My Car.\" Brock makes a movie and wows fans at New York's Radio City Music Hall. His marriage suffers as he is swallowed up in glitz. Corman ( Kramer vs. Kramer ) stingingly parodies the Hollywoodization of publishing, its bloated star system, its puffery and the news media's opinion-shaping apparatus. But his points are obvious, the story's premise is strained and the joke wears thin. Walk-ons by a throng of real-life figures--including Saul Bellow, Stephen King, James Michener, Erma Bombeck and Bruce Springsteen--are exploitative and predictable.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Philippa Carr was Burford’s last pseudonym, created in 1972.The Miracle at St. Bruno’s, the first novel in Carr’s acclaimed Daughters of England series, was followed by nineteen additional books. Burford died at sea on January 18, 1993. At the time of her death, there were over one hundred million copies of her books in print, and her popularity continues today.", "related": [], "rank": 534396, "title": "Zipporah's Daughter (The Daughters of England Book 10)", "author": "Philippa Carr", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In a moment of lucidity, Grandpa hands Cosmo a key to his boyhood home, Blackbrick Abbey, urging him to go there. The boy arrives (slipping back in time in the process) to find his grandfather as a 16-year-old house servant. Cosmo enjoys spending time with Kevin, but wonders if he can tweak the past in order to prevent some current problems. Fitzgerald’s debut is narrated in a breezy twenty-first-century style that keeps the story from becoming maudlin (“The first time Granddad peed in the dishwasher was when me and my gran realized we were going to have to make a few changes”). The plot depends heavily on coincidence, but Cosmo gleans much from the young Kevin and his time-slip experience, enabling him to return home able to accept Grandpa’s impending death.

But Carolines greatest passion from earliest childhood was dance. And throughout her childhood In Idaho Falls, Seattle, Washington, and Billings, Montana, her parents arranged for her to study ballet whenever circumstances and family funds permitted.  Caroline began her serious training in contemporary dance at Brigham Young University where she graduated with a BA in 1972, and later continued honing choreographic skills at the University of California at Los Angeles where she graduated with a MA in contemporary dance choreography in 1980. Caroline taught at Ricks College, now Brigham Young University, Idaho before joining the faculty at Brigham Young University in 1986. While teaching at BYU, her choreography was honored four times by the American College Dance Festival Association. She directed BYUs Contemporary Dance Theatre for a period of fourteen years during which time the company performed nationally, and also internationally in countries such as Turkey, Israel, the Philippines, Korea, South Africa, Australia, and India. Most recently, Caroline has devoted her creative energy to combining dance and film which brought her to this project, Onward, Alone. Wanting to tell some of the most treasured stories of certain women who shaped the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, she chose dance on film as an art form with genuine expressiveness that can tell profound stories of the human heart.  But with the constraints of creating the film, there were many more stories than could be included on the DVD, and hence, the book has been written to share narratives that otherwise would be overlooked. In the process of augmenting the stories in the film, the book has taken on its own character and has become its own entity. This book has been, for first-time author Caroline, a most unexpected and gratifying experience. Caroline is a convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and has served in the Cordova, Argentina mission.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Clanchy's trenchant, often very funny prose also shimmers with sensual pleasures ... Meeting the English is a richly conceived, original and very entertaining novel.' Guardian 'A comedy of manners with a sharp edge ... With its cast of artsy, highly strung, badly behaved north Londoners, Meeting the English feels like an updated Iris Murdoch novel, with sharper haircuts and more Laura Ashley furnishings.' Independent on Sunday 'A charming comic novel with an appealing lightness of touch' Literary Review 'Meeting the English is a comedy of manners and a comedy of morals ... [it] has a frothy charm. Moreover, in the rather appalling Myfanwy, Clanchy presents us with a character whom it is a pleasure to meet in a novel, though one would fly from her in real life.' Scotsman 'Lacerating social observation mixed with Shakespearean comedy powers Kate Clanchy's first novel ... her agility with language makes the sentences shimmer.' Sunday Telegraph 'An exceptional first novel ... Clanchy switches multi-viewpoints adroitly ... she has a wincingly accurate eye for social comedy, a vivid descriptive sense, and profound understanding of her characters. This is a delectable read -- it should certainly be on one or more of this year's awards lists.' Daily Mail 'What unfolds is a long, hot summer with more than a little Midsummer Night's Dream about it. The gloriously heady heat, high-running tempers and emotions are offset by the cool lightness of Clanchy's prose, shot through with a wonderfully refreshing comedic breeze. Meeting the English is an utter delight.' Observer 'Felicity Wood finds Kate Clanchy's literary debut, Meeting the English, to be a charming and comedic coming-of-age novel ... very funny indeed; a literary novel that manages to pack an irreverent punch and take a wry look at the fashion and sensibilities of the late 1980s.'

The teaching responsibilities and consultancies in worthy and prestigious establishments are too numerous to list here. He still finds time to sit on a large number of editorial boards and is a reviewer of countless psychiatric, behavioural research, mental health, obesity, depression and anxiety (to name but a few) journals and academic papers. He has had his works published in letters, papers, in journals and scholarly books, often making scientific presentations, and has written for media such as Time and The Huffington Post. He directs research and conducts clinical trials on chronic combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder mostly with prisoners and combat veterans, working to improve their mental health and separate science from quackery. He has had an interest in American history since hearing a first-hand account of the Battle of San Juan Hill from his great-grandfather as a child, and then learning later of his father’s military service in Vietnam. He is also fascinated with the history of jazz, gangsters, bank robbers and baseball, all of which seems to converge in the 1920s, ’30s and ’40s. Writing noir crime and thriller novels set in the period just after prohibition affords him an enjoyably different aspect from his work and allows him to delve into research of one of his favourite periods.

Anka had five hits in a single year, 1958, and he was among the top acts of the late 1950s and early ’60s, but then something happened that could have ended his career: the Beatles. Anka wisely changed course, focusing on songwriting, but for an older audience, turning out the theme for Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show, Sinatra’s monster hit “My Way,” and Tom Jones’ “She’s a Lady,” while still performing in Vegas and occasionally coming up with a hit of his own (“(You’re) Having My Baby”).

His works of fantasy have been extensively reviewed. * * * *  * * * *  * * * * A REVIEW of one of the fantasy books of Jerome Brooke have said: ... elements of a sci-fi, historical war drama, psychological thriller, even romance. Another reviewer here described it as a \"mythopoetic thriller supernatural fantastic romantic medieval science-fiction melange\", which sounds much better than my description, I'll admit. In short, it has a bit of everything and should entertain most anyone. Given that I no longer read much genre it took a few minutes for me to settle into a reading enjoyment as I didn't know where, exactly, we were in time or space until I remembered that didn't matter at all; what mattered was the story, which was engrossing. There are a few fine turns in the story and many places where it does indeed reach the merit of ancient poetical mythos; the detailed descriptions of this multiverse tale are confident, bold, and often quite lovely. I'm quite glad to be able to recommended this work to others. It inspired me to research...causing me to be glued to the screen for nearly a day; it's a sign of good writing when you want more. Brooke has done his homework and it shows.

She’s always had her nose in a book, has traveled the world over, and even tested the time-space continuum, thanks to the awesome power of the written word. One of her writing quirks is that she loves to include bits and pieces of her ancestors and ancestry in all of her books. Her family centers her and keeps her sane, which is why she enjoys adding elements of family, hearth, and home in all of her romances. C.H.’s second series with Sourcebooks began with A WEDDING IN APPLE GROVE, available in large print in April, ONE DAY IN APPLE GROVE released in June, and WELCOME BACK TO APPLE GROVE in December . Also available are the first four books in her Irish Western Historical Series, THE MARSHAL’S DESTINY, THE RANCHER’S HEART, PEARL’S REDEMPTION, and A GIFT FROM HOME, plus her latest short story: FOR LOVE OF FLYNN, her Irish Westerns are  Amazon Bestsellers. With 8 short stories and 15 novels to her credit, this award-winning, multi-published author’s books are available in paperback, hardcover, trade paperback, magazine, and e-book.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 3.8333, "rating_total": 46.0}

Andrea, a goody-two-shoes, is grounded and no longer able to attend the big bash after her mom discovers wine coolers in the bottom of her closet. Across the street, Paul's panic attacks are back, and he's too afraid to let his self-involved, popular girlfriend, Lannie, know about them. Thankfully, his understanding mom gets him off the hook by telling Lannie that Paul has diarrhea, which is somehow less embarrassing. Meanwhile, hilarious, flashy Roemi has rented a tuxedo and is ready to make school history by going to the prom with another guy, with whom he has been chatting online and is finally going to meet in the flesh. Unfortunately, he gets stood up. Finally, there's Candace, who goes to school in the city and is just hanging out in the suburbs, doing graffiti, and avoiding the police. These teens end up together in a SUV and have a memorable night, getting one another out of trouble and, through their new friendship, gaining the confidence they need to stand up for themselves. Each character ultimately finds happiness and a solution to his or her problems. Despite the cheesy aspects, readers will enjoy this feel-good story.—Lindsay Klemas, JM Rapport School for Career Development, Bronx, NY", "related": [], "rank": 4710569, "title": "Tag Along eBook", "author": "Tom Ryan", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Write on Edge (formerly The Red Dress Club) was created as a place for writers to gather, exchange ideas and learn something about the art of storytelling. We welcome any and all writers, regardless of level – anyone interested in writing has a place here. We are also open to writers of all genres: Fiction or non-fiction. Fantasy, young adult, chick lit, memoir – there are no limits. You don’t have to join to participate in the club. We have two weekly prompts. Tuesday we have a fiction/non-fiction prompt, called Red Writing Hood. You write your piece on your personal blog and link up on our site Friday. Our memoir prompt, RemembeRED, comes out Friday, and you link up on our site Tuesday. Feel free to comment on any of our other posts on the site. We bring you guest posts from published authors and others in the writing industry, a weekly featured blogger and posts from The Red Dress Club hosts on writing. Even though we have changed our name, we still are inspired by a blog post by Jenny of The Bloggess about a red dress – thus the name of this blog. Jenny wrote: “I want, just once, to wear a bright red, strapless ball gown with no apologies. I want to be shocking, and vivid and wear a dress as intensely amazing as the person I so want to be. And the more I thought about it the more I realized how often we deny ourselves that red dress and all the other capricious, ridiculous, overindulgent and silly things that we desperately want but never let ourselves have because they are simply “not sensible”. Things like flying lessons, and ballet shoes, and breaking into spontaneous song, and building a train set, and crawling onto the roof just to see the stars better. Things like cartwheels and learning how to box and painting encouraging words on your body to remind yourself that you’re worth it.” For many of us, our Red Dress is our dream to become a published writer. Maybe we just need a little extra motivation. Maybe we just have to try to Write on Edge.", "related": ["B00FOGXQQU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her love of romantic comedy has helped her laugh and cry her way through her own relationship roller coaster rides. After an unfortunate starter marriage to a lawyer and musician, Cathie decided to skip the idea of wedded bliss all together. Rather, she turned into a serial monogamist – there was the Executive / Sailor, The Skiier and the Software Guru with the Sad Demise. In the eloquent words of Mae West “She used to be Snow White, but she drifted.”That’s when Cathie’s quest started. Cathie Glenn Jennings is now a champion for comedy and relationship movies – she’s more than an ordinary movie fan. After Northwestern University, she focused her career on product launches and strategic marketing. Yet, her passion for movies was always in her life – leading her to  teach seminars on using movies for team building and career coaching at corporations, colleges and career centers. A believer in lifelong learning and education, she also holds a certificate in Positive Psychology and the Movies. Cathie’s entire focus and background has been in using movies to help her audience through life transitions – changes big and small.For more than 20 years, Cathie has shown others how to use movies to benefit their lives. Blending together her lifelong love affair of movies, along with practical corporate experience for some of the world’s most well-recognized brands, Cathie dreamed up a company that would do just that – help others to laugh and cry their way through their own rollercoaster rides. Cathie reaches audiences everyday via social media, YouTube, and her book as she recommends movies to make her readers laugh, cry, dance or sing in the rain. An obsessive list maker, Cathie especially loves Top 10 Lists. When she’s not recommending movies or writing reviews, she is working with corporations, colleges and organizations to provide an extraordinary touch on the ordinary training experience.From the launch of her book, Movie Guide to Romantic Comedies: 100 Chick Flicks That Make You Laugh and Feel Happy Ever After, Cathie has actively sought to bring her love of movies to the masses.If you’re interested in exploring new movies or checking out a new twist on your old fan favorites, be sure to take a look around the site.   http://www.MovieGuideChickFlicks.com/", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story is dripping with life, raw emotion and stories, not only is it written interestingly, but it can be read on several levels.

I'm Sam Knight. This book came about from dinner table discussions with my own kids and is largely based on their fascination with saying \"Pupu\". I aimed this title at the younger, still learning to read kids. It has a sense of humor aimed at the 3 to 7 year old age range (you know- \"Pupu\" humor), while being written at a level that kids can quickly learn to read it on their own. It is by far my kids' favorite of the books I've written (they don't go much for the suspense novels...) and I have to admit, even though I wrote it, I enjoy reading it to kids every chance I get. The preview is a bit rough here, cutting off before you get to see what the book looks like, and I am not allowed to link or promote in this space, so I will describe it as best I can. Each right hand side page has a simple illustration similar to that on the cover, while the left hand page has the text in big bold purple letters, creating an easy to understand and follow layout for the young reader. There are actually two 'stories' included, each being a simple, short read that is easily followed and understood and ends with a 'punchline' aimed for the young age range. I hope you will give it a try, and I hope it brings you and your children many future smiles.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The trail leads Jack to Monterey Park, a nearby city sometimes known as “the Chinese Beverly Hills” due to its large Chinese American population. When Jack learns that the missing girl was a member of a radical antiracist group, he begins to suspect this is no ordinary runaway situation. A fire in the mountains near Los Angeles plays a key role in the story, as does Jack’s personal life, which is being stressed by his relationships with his cop girlfriend, Gloria (who’s recovering from some devastating physical injuries), and his daughter, Maeve (who may have become mixed up in something very dangerous). Jack continues to be one of the private-eye genre’s more interesting specimens, a good man who’s chosen a way of life that brings him constantly into contact with bad people. He’s the kind of guy you’d have a hard time imagining as a PI, if Shannon didn’t do such an excellent job of drawing the character. The series’ consistent use of hot-button issues, such as racial tension and the disparity between the classes, doesn’t quite elevate it out of the private-eye genre but certainly gives the books more substance than much of the competition. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jones was born in the North West of England and lived there all of her adult life until retirement. Once retired, she and her husband moved to the south of France to live in the holiday home they'd bought some years earlier. Her working life was varied to say the least. In fact, she describes herself as a “Jack of all trades and master of none”. Hache has worked, in chronological order, as a secretary, data input clerk, computer programmer / systems analyst, systems specialist, theatrical agent, psychiatric nurse, and finally, a research analyst for an organisation that researches the hazards associated with having a blood transfusion. For some, retirement is supposed to be a time to relax and enjoy the simple pleasures, something she never had time to do during her busy working life; reading, handicrafts and so on. This wasn't for Hache and the realisation soon hit her that she was, in effect, passing time until death. This revelation resulted in her taking a long hard look at herself, and asking herself what had given her the most pleasure in her life. Answer: All things related to theatre and film. So now, she uses the knowledge that she gained of the industry while she represented actors, in order to promote the work of independent film makers, their cast and crew. As a direct result of this work, she met the larger than life horror director character Kensington Gore, and his creator Graeme Parker, who invited her to submit a short story for an anthology he was putting together for charity. Hache was delighted to be given the chance, and was curious to know whether she had any talent in that area. She had written, or co-written, countless academic journal articles, but never creative writing. She is unutterably grateful to all concerned. especially to Kensington Gore, for that opportunity. Although she recognises that her contribution was \"not the finest piece of writing ever, it was a first attempt after all\", seeing it in print gave her the ambition to write something longer. The result is “A Fractured Understanding”. A tense, psychological story about a missing child that has a bit of a twist in the tale that will leave you reeling.", "related": ["B00EA73A38"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We all hurt equally and so do our children!!  This book is simply beautiful!!  A promise and explanation of unconditional love that will continue beyond the boundaries of a home being split.  As a child who experienced divorce anything close to this to read would have made the situation just a bit less scary.  With Purest Love, Thank you Holly Tibbetts!!!Ruby's Voice is so visually lovely that it could stand alone as a picture book. The artwork is vibrant, and the drawings will surely intrigue even non-readers to ask that the story be read to them over and over again. The brevity of the text and the impact of the art will engage both the child and parent into an opportunity to explore this teachable moment and spark meaningful conversation. And what fun to spend a little extra time on each page and hunt for the whimsical clues i.e. \"St. Augustine\" embroidered on a beach blanket and  peacock feathers as a background to the banner \"Free as a Bird\". Ruby's Voice addresses what could be a sad and scary topic for any family, LGBT or not, and transforms it into any opportunity to love.  Well done, Holly.A thoughtful and poignant reflection from a creative, dynamic, and insightful individual.  Well done, Holly Tibbetts!  This will be a treasure for many....Separation and divorce is hard on everyone. Children are living through this right along with the parents.What a wonderful story to express the feelings of what it's like from a child's perspective.", "related": [], "rank": 2808651, "title": "Ruby's Voice", "author": "Holly Tibbetts", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His urge to help other people was one that he couldn't ignore. For years, he watched his mother suffer with hypertension and other illnesses and it wasn't until he was in college, that he realized the connection with stress.A General Practitioner in a busy hospital, his patients were ones who returned for follow-ups. The prevalent issue among them was that they would come for their follow-up feeling worse than they did when they were discharged. Confused and sympathetic towards them, he consulted with other doctors on what could be the cause.One of the most common illnesses he noticed was hypertension. From experience, Robert knew its connection to stress. Unsatisfied with their arguments, he continued his research. Their argument was that the patients were not taking their medications and changing their lifestyles, etc. knowing that that was just a stigma, he disregarded their advice.Stress is a significant complaint among his patients and he knew that it contributed to their illnesses. He discussed with them their lifestyle changes since discharge. They all complained of medical bills and having to work more. That extra work and worry increased their stress levels, and slowly, their conditions worsened. In an effort to help his patients in a more practical way, Robert decided to write a couple of books. In his books, he discussed ways to reduce stress, and thus, reduce the various forms of illness that resulted from its high levels. Dr. Gallagher's patients benefited immensely from his books and his work was greatly rewarded when he received great adulation from his colleagues and patients. His book titled'Stress Management' quickly became his first best-seller.", "related": ["B00IKYYCVG"], "rank": 537337, "title": "Self Confidence", "author": "Robert Gallagher", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The ultimate goal of mine is to generate enough buzz/sales around this eBook that I can then prepare a business presentation to make financial sense to the people who invest in films, so that they can see how they'll get a return on their investment, and then some, should they put forth their capital to make this happen. A series like \"Harry Potter\" for a mature audience is the target goal. I wrote this because I'm fed up of the majority of art in this world being created by the lowest common denominators of society. I want renaissance. I want beauty. I want to live in a world where people empathize with each other and respect each other's views and beliefs, so long as they don't infringe upon the freedom of others. I am fully aware that the way I want the world to be is a perfect stranger to the way the world really is, but I am also aware that real change comes from within, and we must each be the change we wish to see.", "related": ["B00LEVJ79Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 4.8889, "rating_total": 44.0}

She has published two novels in The Riduna Series, historical fiction set in the Victorian era through to the early 20th century. She was originally moved to write 'Riduna' by her love of the island of Alderney and its fascinating history and then she developed an unusual interest in the history of early flying boats when working on her second novel 'Ancasta Guide me Swiftly Home'. Whilst researching for the third in her series, to take us to the 1930's, Diana has worked on several very different projects. Her most recent novel, venturing into the genre of crime, is 'Murder, Now and Then,' which was inspired by an unsolved murder back in 1919 in the heart of Mid Bedfordshire. This murder mystery weaves the intriguing events of 1919 with a murder set in 2019. Murder revisited!  She has also compiled a delightful memoir of a 103 year old character called Norman Campbell. His chosen title, 'The Life and Demise of Norman Campbell' is available on Amazon too. Diana has two blogs, www.dianamj.wordpress.com, where you can read about the background to Diana's writing and from May 2014 you can also follow her personal adventures, a year of discovery and other true stories, on www.selectionsofreflections.wordpress.com/ She is @Riduna on Twitter and would love to hear from you", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Raynesha grew up as one of Los Angeles's many troubled youth which led her into serving four years around L.A. juvenile corrections centers, placements, and camps. She first recognized her love for writing while incarcerated. She was an honors student since kindergarten, certified gifted in the third grade, and was sent to Woodland hills, CA for a more challenging education, yet she had to be placed in advance placement classes there too. She graduated high school a month after turning 16 years old and received acceptance letters to five out-of-state universities which she later declined offers to due to still being on probation until 18 years of age and not being able to leave the state. California State University at Los Angeles and Northridge accepted her last minute application with open arms. After attending school for a little over a semester she discovered she was pregnant and decided to put her role as a mother first. She moved to TN for a new start with her boys and received her PTCB national certification in July 2010 after 3 1/2 years of being a licensed Pharmacy technician. While juggling a full time job and raising her six children she wrote and published her debut novel Kismet, which went on to draw rave reviews and solidified her place as an up and coming writer to look out for. She ultimately signed with Write 2 Eat Concepts, with her first offering from the camp being the coming of age tale of a church boy gone bad titled Dog Food,which will be released in July 2014. Raynesha's titles also include: Kismet 1-2 (Beyond the Bedroom series), and Scratch a Liar Find a Thief: A short story in the anthology Traces of my Lipstick. Raynesha currently resides in Nashville, T.N. with her Husband and six children.", "related": ["B00JZ6G37O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 4.75, "rating_total": 57.0}
