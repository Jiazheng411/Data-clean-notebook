A cabin on his property provides me with respectable living quarters. If only it were as easy to separate my heart from this family! It will be difficult to leave when the time comes, for I am falling in love with these little ones—and, truth be told, with Jakob.Your loving daughter, Karola BreitIn Idaho, the land is good but life is hard for a German émigré whose dreams have turned to dust.

Nearly two years ago, Elizabeth ended her marriage when she discovered that her husband was already married. Now all Elizabeth wants to do is concentrate on her new business, but when her friend Senator Garth Holbrook offers to set Elizabeth up with his new political aide, Carter Hudson, Elizabeth reluctantly agrees. It only takes a few minutes with the bluntly and annoyingly honest Carter for Elizabeth to decide the two of them would never work out. Elizabeth then finds herself revising her opinion of Carter when he agrees to help with the renovations to her chocolate shop, but a mystery woman in Carter's past threatens to ruin any chance of romance. Novak continues her loosely connected series set in Dundee, Idaho, with this emotionally intense story of one woman starting over again. Complex, realistically flawed characters and a love story with a dash of danger are beautifully blended in this excellent contemporary romance.John CharlesCopyright © American Library Association.

He holds advanced degrees in political science, finance, and economics. He currently writes on economic policy and politics on the blog, Casino Capitalism and Crapshoot Politics. Harrington has harbored a life-long fascination with the art, culture, and politics of the Italian Renaissance, and has lived and studied in Italy, near Florence. His enduring interest in the social movements and artistic creativity of this period led him to study the life stories of Girolamo Savonarola, Niccolo Machiavelli, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci. As a visiting scholar to the Bridwell Library at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, he conducted research with primary Renaissance materials for his dramatized history-fiction trilogy on Savonarola and Machiavelli, titled The City of Man: Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradiso.  He recently published two more works. Saving Mona Lisa is a novel about the world's most famous painting told through the eyes of Leonardo da Vinci's young assistant and eventual archivist, Francesco Melzi. The story is inspired by two real mysteries: Why did Leonardo insist the painting was never finished, refusing to surrender it to its rightful owner? And, who painted the copies, several of which depict Mona Lisa bare-breasted? The story delves into the conflicts inherent to artistic creativity and love by examining one of the most creative and complex personalities in history. Political Economy Simplified: A Citizen's Survival Guide is a condensed public policy primer that integrates analyses of economics, financial markets, and American politics into a broad overview of national policy for citizen-voters. This primer derives from and supplements the author's weblog, Casino Capitalism and Crapshoot Politics. His latest book, published November 1, 2013, is a political novel that modernizes the Renaissance conflict between religion and politics to the current era of religious fundamentalism and secular politics. This work, titled In God We Trust, develops a Machiavellian plot that dramatizes Washington politics during the period from the Millennial through 9/11 and the build-up to the Iraq War.", "related": ["B00DQ3BM5A"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her other passion is science-fiction and she likes nothing more than to immerse herself in a whole new universe and the amazing species therein. She used to while away days at school and college dreaming of vampires, werewolves and witches, or being lost in space, and used to while away evenings watching movies about them or reading gothic horror stories, science-fiction and romances.Having tried her hand at various romance genres, it was only natural for her to turn her focus back to the paranormal, fantasy and science-fiction worlds she enjoys so much. She loves to write seductive, sexy and strong vampires, werewolves, witches, angels and alien species. The worlds she often dreams up for them are vicious, dark and dangerous, reflecting aspects of the heroines and heroes, but her characters also love deeply, laugh, cry and feel every emotion as keenly as anyone does.

Faithe has no choice but to accept her new husband or lose Hauekleah.  She bravely awaits her new husband, hoping that perhaps he will tire of farm life quickly and return to being a soldier.  But once she gets to know the man behind the reputation, Faithe feels quite differently.  She cannot stop thinking about her handsome husband and how he refuses to consummate their marriage until she can trust him.  He is a man of honor and honesty--  and Faithe falls in love with her husband.  Luke de Perigueux is happy at Hauekleah.  He has a beautiful wife who wants to make the best of their marriage and Luke has no intention of leaving her.  As the Black Dragon he was expected to be a warrior, but as Luke of Hauekleah he can be the man his wife sees in him.  When the truth about Faithe's first husband comes out, Luke will have to face his violent past.  Treachery and deception threaten to tear apart the lovers and Luke will risk losing Faithe forever if he tells her the truth.  Patricia Ryan is a masterful author of medieval romances.  Without question, Secret Thunder is her best work to date.  Set in England during the time of the Norman Conquest, the tale is rich in history and romance.  Luke is a tortured hero, maintaining his bloodlust during battle only because of the herbs he chews.  He is not the beast he thinks he is but it takes the love of Faithe to heal his soul.  As is typical of Ms. Ryan's heroines, Faithe is a strong woman devoted to her home--  and to the husband she comes to love.  Secret Thunder is a magnificent love story and Patricia Ryan has surpassed this reviewer's highest expectations!This is as good as it gets!  Once again Patricia Ryan dazzles us with her amazing story telling abilities! Secret Thunder will steal the hearts of readers everywhere!  A marvelous love story from the queen of  medieval romance!

N. Darby.John Nelson Darby (1800-1882) went in 1853 to Germany, where he established congregations in Dusseldorf, Elberfeld, and in other towns. He was dissatisfied with the existing Bible versions in French and German, and so he collaborated with German and French followers in the creation of new versions in those languages. With some German associates he produced the \"Elberfelder Bible,\" and with French-speaking followers he produced the \"Pau Bible.\"Darby did not feel such a need for a new translation in English, because he considered the King James Version to be adequate for most purposes, and he encouraged his followers to continue to use it. But, he decided to produce a highly literal English version of the New Testament for study purposes. This New Testament was completed in 1867. The version is exceedingly literal, based upon modern critical editions of the Greek text.After Darby's death in 1882, certain of his followers in England produced an English version of the Old Testament based upon Darby's French and German translations. In 1890 this was published as the Old Testament portion of The Holy Scriptures. A New Translation from the Original Languages by J. N. Darby (G. Morrish, 1890). The complete Darby Bible is still reprinted and used now a days.", "related": ["B004X71HCQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Such is the setting for Bevill's undistinguished first novel, which mixes the occult with a possible double murder, decades old. World-renowned painter Mignon Thibeaux returns to La Valle, where she was born and lived a poor, but happy, childhood until she was seven years old and her world fell apart. Character development takes a back seat in a story full of \"discernments,\" \"s‚ances\" and \"spiritual cleansings.\" Despite warnings, Mignon succeeds in insinuating herself into the bosom of the St. Michel family. Her goal: to find out what happened to her mother, Garlande Thibeaux, and Luc St. Michel, her mother's lover. Gossip has always had it that Luc and Garlande ran off to some isolated place far away; or that Luc's wife, Eleanor, killed the couple and hid the bodies well. The local sheriff evicted Mignon's father, Ruff, and his young daughter from their tiny cabin the evening Luc and Garlande disappeared. An angst-filled ending with some hold-your-breath moments brings us, finally, to an understanding of the mystery's central issues.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was educated at English private schools and Cambridge but left without a degree. European travel was cut short by the loss of most of Thackeray's inheritance in 1833 in Indian bank failures, upon which he decided to make his living as a painter. Returning to London in 1837, he found himself with two young daughters and an insane wife by 1840 and forced to write for a living. Most of his early output was reviews, sketches, comic items or short serials for magazines, often under pseudonyms. His first novel, Barry Lyndon, was serialised in 1844, and Thackeray also published three travel books in the 1840s. His satiric vein and discontent with contemporary fictional norms led to his first major novel, Vanity Fair, in 1847, followed by a handful of other major novels over the next dozen years which turned from satiric to historical. Published lectures on the new field of English literature led to tours of the United States from 1852 and The Virginians, a novel set partly in America. Thackeray was a founding editor of the literary journal The Cornhill Magazine in 1859, but resigned due to ill-health in 1862, though his last works were published in the journal. He died in 1863.", "related": ["B009XT7V24"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tragically, Angus’s life, and her one indulgence in true love, were cut short in a World War II plane crash. The loss for Dobbs’s mother echoed sorrow for decades as she moved on with ersatz lovers and spouses and only in the end decided to own, or at least expose, her wounds and misgivings. The story, which touches multiple families, offers an explanation for how “everyone ended up married to somebody they wished was somebody else.” In uncovering and unraveling his family’s secrets, Dobbs draws out a heartrending narrative arc without sentimentality.

Her stories take a while getting up to speed, but because there is so interesting a stylist behind them, we give them the time. Still, the problem, as with her first collection, is that the voice sometimes seems all that there is of substance. Two political stories, both about Central America--the title piece and ``Holy Week''--are finally thinned by the predictability of their old-hat premises: that an innocent abroad apprehends rottenness soon enough. Two stories, ``A Cautionary Tale'' and ``In The Station,'' are a bit too portentous about Manhattan flakiness (in the first) or about the vicious irresponsibility of the young bored rich (in the second). Eisenberg's social intelligence is more subtly flexed in ``The Robbery''--a dinner party at which prejudices and presumptions are imperceptibly dismantled; and the world of rich actors and coke- dealers gets an improbable and satisfying burnish in ``Presents.'' The book's most remarkable story, though, is the already anthologized ``The Custodian''--again innocence lost, but in a tale that suggests how cruelly manipulative of reality innocence itself may be. Eisenberg here gives up most of her gorgeous yet finally merely verbal mannerisms (``His voice was a graphitelike emollient, a granular medium in which the words spread out soothingly'') in favor of sustained mood-building that results in a story of finely shifting, nearly dreamlike amorality. In this story (though in no others here to this degree), Eisenberg exhibits her potential mastery. --Copyright ©1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Set in thirteenth-century Britain, the story gives a good sense of the political and social issues of the time but also offers a readable mystery. Josse d'Aquin's longtime love, Helewise, has left her post as abbess of Hawkenlye Abbey and come to live with Josse. Although Josse fears Helewise will never give up her nunnish ways, he is content to have her in his house, especially since it takes her out of danger from King John's campaign to plunder and destroy the church. Even this deadly threat pales to insignificance when Helewise's 11-year-old granddaughter, Rosamund, disappears. Fearing the worst, Josse, his adopted son Ninian, and Rosamund's father, Sheriff Gervase de Gifford, set off to find the missing child. Although there is an at least partly happy ending, Josse's life may be changed forever. Appealing characters, an unusual plot, authentic period detail, and plenty of unexpected twists make this Hawkenlye novel a sure thing for fans of medieval mysteries. -- booklist, July 1, 2011", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She was gazing down at him, her lips parted\nslightly, her breath quickening as his hands flexed around her ankles. The\ntension was palatable, and Amir could practically feel it crackling between\nthem. He knew what she was feeling, because he was feeling the exact same\nthing. He knew what was about to happen before it happened, yet could do\nnothing to stop it. He could only brace himself when Shayla practically\nlaunched herself into his arms, sending them rolling across the carpet in a\ntangle of limbs until he landed on top of her.His head came\ndown and hers came up, and the two met in the middle and lips touched. It was\nas if lightning had struck him, and just like his dream, he knew he couldn't\nstop now. It was too late. He was ruined. He had tasted the sweetness of her\nlips and there was no going back now. She parted her lips on a sigh and met his\ntongue with hers. Her hands came up to thread through his dark locks, and his\ncupped her face as he tilted his head to a better angle and kissed her again.\nHe wrapped his arms around her, trapping her between his body and the carpet,\nmolding her against him. Her breasts burned his skin through the fabric of\ntheir clothes, and her heart hammered wildly against his.\"Amir,\" she\nwhispered, her lips coming to rest just behind his ear. He jerked and stifled a\ngroan by burying his face in her shoulder. Just as it had happened in his\ndream, he was burning, only this time he was burning from within, going up in\nflames with the heat of his own desire for the woman in his arms. In his mind\nhe could see the flames, hot and menacing consuming him just before he was\nhurtled from grace and into the depths.With every ounce\nof his will, he pulled himself away from Shayla, untangling himself from her\narms. He fell back against the couch, one hand clutched over his racing heart,\ngulping hungrily for air. Her eyes a bit glazed over and her lips swollen from\nhis kiss, she pulled herself into a seated position, her eyebrows pulled\ntogether in bewilderment.\"Amir?\" She\nreached out to touch his arm. The light touch of her hand was enough to snap\nhim out of the trance he'd been in. He jerked away from the searing heat of her\ntouch and jumped to his feet.\"I have to go,\"\nhe said, almost running for the door.Her voice jerked\nhim back with invisible fingers. \"What? Why?\"He turned to\nface her, his heart wrenching at the sight of her face, confused and stricken.\n\"I'm sorry Shayla,\" he said lamely.\"What's wrong?\nDid I come on too strong?\" Shayla's eyes widened and Amir was gripped by the\nembarrassment she was feeling. \"Oh God, you must think I'm some kind of slut\nafter the way I just threw myself at you!\" She turned her back and buried her\nface in her hands.Unwilling to let\nher take the blame on herself, Amir strode forward and placed his hands on her\nshoulders. \"No, Shayla. It's not you. You're perfect. You're beautiful and\nsmart and funny. You're wonderful.\"She turned in\nhis arms and looked up at him. \"And you want me don't you? I wasn't reading you\nwrong?\"Amir sighed. \"No,\nyou weren't but-\"\"Then what is\nit?\"\"I can't do\nthis, Shayla. I shouldn't have let things go this far and I'm sorry if it hurts\nyou to hear that. I should go.\"\"Let me make\nsure I'm understanding what you're saying,\" she said slowly, backing away from\nhim and avoiding his gaze. \"You don't want to be with me.\"\"No, that's not it.\"\"You want to,\nbut you can't.\"\"Yes.\"\"And whatever\nthe reason, you can't tell me why?\"\"Yes.\"The anger that\nrose up in her was so swift and sudden, Amir barely had a chance to register it\nbefore she exploded. \"Why, Amir? Why can't you tell me anything? Why can't you\ntell me about your job or where you come from? Why can't you tell me about your\nfamily? For crying out loud I don't even know where you live!\"\"It's\ncomplicated, Shayla. It would be hard for you to understand.\"\"No, what I\ndon't understand is why you're keeping so much of yourself from me. You know\nalmost everything about me, Amir. Most of it without me even having to tell\nyou. And as deep as my feelings are for you, I can't say I know much about you\nbeyond how you like your coffee and that you like classical music.\"\"There are\nthings I can't-\"\"Things you\ncan't tell me?\" she interrupted with a sarcastic laugh. \"As if I haven't heardthatbefore! What is it with you, Amir?\nDo you think that acting coy will make me want you more? Is this some game\nyou're playing, acting mysterious so I'll pursue you? Because if it is I've got\nnews for you; I'm not the kind of girl to follow a man around like some\nlovesick puppy. If you can't meet me on equal terms and give as much as you get\nthen this is over.\"Silence\nstretched out between them as they stood, each avoiding each other's eyes. Amir\nlooked down at his shoes. He had wanted to end things with Shayla but he hadn't\nintended for it to be like this. Still, this was just the opening he needed to\nwalk away. As much as he knew he needed to, his heart still rebelled at the\nthought.\"I really am\nsorry Shayla,\" he said again, knowing that it wasn't what she wanted to hear\nbut unable to say anything else.\"Get out,\" she\nsaid, so quietly at first that Amir wasn't sure he had heard her right. She\nlooked up at him finally, tears glistening in her dark eyes. The knife in his\nheart twisted cruelly when lone tear trailed down her cheek. He fought down his\nown tears. \"Get out!\" she repeated, this time practically screaming at him. \"Go!\"Fighting the\nurge to pull her into his arms and comfort her, he turned and reached for his\njacket. He turned in the doorway for one last glimpse of her, but she had\nturned away and all he saw was her stiff, unyielding back before he closed the\ndoor.", "related": ["B00JQS5FIO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 41, "rating_average": 4.3902, "rating_total": 180.0}

This book has no filler - just good ideas\nto get me out there to find a little fun for me.-Cheryl EatonI'm actually a dad and I bought this because my wife is running ragged\nwith the kids. I am too but it seems mom takes the brunt of this... there are a\nlot of great ideas in this book but the real message I take (and will\npass along to the Mrs) is that it's OK to feel burnt out being a mom and\n it's OK to take care of yourself! I know she'll feel guilty when I tell\n her to go do something without us - but I hope she will see, after\nreading this, it's not only OK but necessary from time to time!

The true historybehind this novel is stranger than anything a novelist might reasonably\ninvent. Hung, a young Chinese man, broken in spirit and mind by his failure in\nthe civil service examinations, went slowly mad. After exposure to evangelical Christianity, he became convinced\nthat he was the younger brother of Jesus Christ.In fact, Hung founded a quasi-religious revolutionary\nmovement that spread rapidly across Southern China. It took hold with such\nrapidity because he began to promise landless peasants what they wanted most -\nland. Within a few years he had gathered an army of a million men around him,\nand he took the southern capital of Nanking and even threatened to unseat the\nruling Ch'ing dynasty.The second bloodiest war in all history ensued, killing\nthree times as many people as World War One. I was interested in the setting of\n\"Barbarians\" partly because no one in the English-speaking world\nseemed to be aware that this momentous human event had ever happened. This was\nmainly due to timing: the attention of the British press was taken up by the\nwar in the Crimea , and the United States of America had its collective mind on matters rather\ncloser to home - the civil war.", "related": [], "rank": 1742775, "title": "Barbarians", "author": "Robert Carter", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Back in the U.S., Cassidy investigates the mysterious deaths of wolves in Yellowstone Park, while Jake, posing as a biologist, acts as her bodyguard. The stricken wolves turn out to be infected with a genetic mutation of a virus, CPV-19, created by scientist Edward Fiske, who's horrified to learn his sponsor wants to sell it without an antidote. As the deadly virus jumps from wolf to man, Cassidy and Jake find comfort in their growing mutual attraction.

Thirty-two years at ad agencies Leo Burnett, J. Walter Thompson and Saatchi & Saatchi kept that creative flame burning.  Since retiring, I learned writing a dozen short stories merely scratched the itch.  So, I developed a book series featuring ex Navy SEAL Lieutenant Zack Finn, Boston Homicide Detective.

I have a love of the written word and have always admired those who can skillfully express feelings and events in writing. My novel 'Forever Young The Beginning' is my first attempt at fiction.

For some ten years, I had a deep love affair with flying. Hopelessly hooked after my very first flight on a hang glider, I began a journey of flying gliders and ultralights, even becoming a dealer for three different brands and an observer for the southeastern region of the then U S H G Assn. To this day, I have to say that I loved that more than any past time, hobby, or sport in which I ever participated. Next to being a husband and father, it was the high point of my life. I love to write and I thoroughly enjoy creating characters and developing them to where my readers can get a feel for not only how they look, but how they tick. Developing a plot and filling it with shocks, surprises, humorous events, and tenderness is what I strive for; and I alway try to fill my stories with the full range of human emotions from true love to extreme hatred, from warm companionship to extreme rage, and from laughter to tears. Surprises should be liberally sprinkled throughout the length of a story as well in my view. My goal is to transport the reader to a place where he cannot otherwise go, simply by the power of my words.

Writers and readers agree that they\nunderstand the messages, the ethos, and the sheer entertainment value inherent\nin romances, and the two essays I wrote for DANGEROUS MEN AND ADVENTUROUS WOMAN\nare my attempt to explain the nature and the appeal of these books to the\nfemale reader. I can testify that these stories have an enduring allure because\nI am currently selling many of my earliest titles, some of them thirty years\nold, on the internet. They are as popular now as when I first wrote them\n(during my childhood, of course). Today they are reaching a new generation of\nreaders electronically without the benefit of bookstores (and reminding some of\nmy long time, faithful readers that I am still kicking and still writing after\na long hiatus). Early in my career, Jayne\nAnn Krentz (aka Amanda Quick) and I shared an editor at Harlequin, Patricia\nSmith. Pat asked me, along with eighteen other prominent romance authors\nincluding Sandra Brown, Diana Palmer, Elizabeth Lowell, Laura Kinsale and Mary\nJo Putney, to help her create an anthology of essays on the subject of\nromances. The collection was designed to give readers, critics and academics\nsome insights on the subject of why romance novels are so popular. This\ncollaborative effort produced DANGEROUS MEN AND ADVENTUROUS WOMEN, edited by\nSmith and published by the University of Pennsylvania Press in1992, brought out\nin paperback by HarperMonogram in 1996. This collection of essays extols the\nbenefits of reading and writing romances and explores why romance novels are so\npopular yet misunderstood by critics (and often the general public). I wrote\ntwo of the essays included in the collection, now available on Amazon, and they\nare described below. In \"Loved I Not Honor More:\nThe Virginal Heroine in Romance,\" I explore the undeniable appeal of the\nheroine who has her first sexual experience with the hero of the story. I\ndescribe this appeal as undeniable because I receive the letters from and talk\nwith the fans who read these stories, and they all share an enthusiasm for the\ntale which describes the inexperienced young lady who is initiated by the tough\nyet tender hero who simply can't resist her. Lots of other stories have their\nplace in popular fiction too, but this one seems to endure endless variations\nand remain viable as long as certain basic criteria are met: she must be a\nnewbie and he must love her as well as desire her. That said, everything else\nis up for grabs (so to speak). My essay explores why these elements are so\nnecessary and so enduringly popular. In \"Mad, Bad, and Dangerous\nto Know,\" I look into the basic fantasy which sustains all romances, the idea\nthat the supposedly weaker woman actually wins the battle of the sexes within\nthe confines of a romance book because at its end she brings the macho,\ndominant hero to heel. As I say in the essay, \"the hero may...give the heroine a\nterrible time...but in the end he capitulates because he simply must have her.\" I\nnever tire of reading this scenario, and my fans don't either. The role\nreversal is delightful and seeing the toughest hero melt in the warmth of his\nlady's regard is emotionally satisfying and socially uplifting. We liked it\nthen, we like it now, and we will always like it.      Publishers Weekly said\nabout DANGEROUS MEN AND ADVENTUROUS WOMEN on its publication in 1992: \"In 22\nessays, romance novelists address why romances are popular. These authors are\nconvincing when they simply write what they think, as when Sandra Brown flatly\nasserts that romances 'are fun--fun to write, fun to read, fun to dissect and\ndiscuss.'\"  This assertion is still true. The stories remain fun first of\nall, but the explanations provided by the authors in the collection might\nclarify for the reader exactly why these books are so enjoyable, and why they\nendure. I recommend this collection and hope you like it. Doreen Owens MalekDecember, 2012", "related": ["B007MGCPW6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 14, "rating_average": 4.0714, "rating_total": 57.0}

Markets are filled with natural edible produce that come in all colors, shapes, and sizes. There's a bounty of fruit that's available year round throughout the entire country.However, being a vegetarian in Thailand has a different meaning than being a vegetarian using the English sense of the word. In Thailand, being a vegetarian just means not indulging in visible chunks of meat. Eggs, fish sauce, pork soup broth and other similar meat based ingredients are all common and fine even if you eat a \"vegetarian diet.\" There's another word, a term known as \"jay\" in Thai, which more translates to being a vegan except in some ways it's even more strict (as there are some religious restrictions). So even though there's so many vegetables and fruits in Thailand, it can sometimes be a challenge to eat only vegetarian. And that's exactly why I decided to write this guide: to be a resource for vegetarians that visit Thailand.In order to explore the options of vegetarian Thai cuisine, and to prove to myself and to you that it's possible to take advantage of Thailand's marvelous food while being a vegetarian, I decided to spend an entire month eating a strict vegetarian Thai food diet while living in Bangkok. The food discoveries I uncovered, the delicious pure vegetarian restaurants I was able to eat at, and the extremely valuable Thai phrases and words I learned, are all neatly organized into the Vegetarian Thai Food Guide.No matter if you're planning a trip to Thailand, are a resident in Thailand, or if you just want to learn more about extremely tasty Thai dishes that are healthy, fresh, and vegetarian, you'll surely find lots of useful information within this guide.Vegetarian Thai food can be tough to order (with the language barrier and lack of knowing what's available), but you can do it, and you'll surely be able to uncover some delicious dishes!Mark Wiens, EatingThaiFood.com and Migrationology.com", "related": ["B00A7HW52W"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She was raised in a Gardener’s Cottage on the moors.  Elizabeth talks about her mother quite often, how she was raised, loved and cared for.  About her mother’s cooking of such things as Bubble and Squeak, Steak and Kidney Pudding, Scotch Eggs, Mutton and Rabbit, typical British home country cooking. Elizabeth learned early in life all about cooking from her parents.  In 1950 at the age of 8, her mother was up north visiting her sister for a week.  Elizabeth’s father thought this would be a good time to teach his daughter about cooking.  She remembers that first meal like it was yesterday, roast beef with mashed potatoes, gravy, and fresh picked pea’s from her father’s garden; and especially the homemade butter. Raymond first started cooking in 1968, while in the navy.  Ray was assigned to mess duty for three month’s, in the first class petty officer’s chow hall.  Ray had the option of eating in the main chow hall, or fixing his own meals in the first class chow hall.  Well you have heard about navy food, so he decided he would fix his own meals. The first class petty officer’s would pick up their meals, in the main chow hall, and bring the meal to their chow hall to eat.  They watched Ray for a few days, saw what he was cooking, and asked if he would prepare their meals for them; they even offered to pay him. We have all heard about British cooking and how boring their meal’s are.  Well do not believe it for a minute.  Liz is one of the best cook’s that I have ever known. I met Liz in April of 1987, when I moved in next door to her.  A few days later, I had just returned from the supermarket, and was going to fix myself some hamburgers on the BBQ.  I noticed that Liz was home, and I decided to ask her over for some hamburgers. I told Liz that I had some hamburger which I needed to cook up before it went bad, and asked her if she would like to join me for some hamburgers and chips.  We had a great time together.  Later, Liz told me that she had cooked herself a filet mignon for dinner that night.  The next day she told me that her little dog Kela, had found the filet mignon, while she was at my place; and that Kela really enjoyed it. On December 24, 1987 Elizabeth and I got married, and to this day we still enjoy cooking together. You may also enjoy our other books available at Amazon.com: Cakes & Cookies from Our Small Kitchen.

I joined the Royal Navy straight from school, did four years at engineering college and then went to sea for three years in destroyers. I took a commission after that and joined the Fleet Air Arm as a helicopter pilot. I was married, had two kids and now have four grandchildren and one great grandson. I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Three more novels: Rhythm, Chick Magnet and in 2010, Decadent were all picked up and published by Extasy Books. Her next five novels: A Gentlemen's Wager, Skank, Dominion, A Cougar's Tale and His Secrets are scheduled for release Spring/Summer 2014. Where after, they will be combined into a special edition anthology called: Open--Tales of Sensual Awakening.She is single and holds a Bachelor's degree in Communications and Script Writing from Northern Illinois University and a Master's of Education from American InterContinental University.

At the time of his death in March of 1970, in Ventura, California, Gardner was \"the most widely read of all American writers\" and \"the most widely translated author in the world,\" according to social historian Russell Nye. The first Perry Mason novel, The Case of The Velvet Claws, published in 1933, had sold twenty-eight million copies in its first fifteen years. In the mid-1950s, the Perry Mason novels were selling at the rate of twenty thousand copies a day. There have been six motion pictures based on his work and the hugely popular Perry Mason television series starring Raymond Burr, which aired for nine years and 271 episodes.As author William F. Nolan notes, \"Gardner, more than any other writer, popularized the law profession for a mass-market audience, melding fact and fiction to achieve a unique blend; no one ever handled courtroom drama better than he did.\"Richard Senate further sums up the significance of Gardner?s contribution: \"Although the character of Perry Mason is not unique as a 'lawyer-sleuth,' he is the first to come to anyone's mind when it comes to sheer brilliance in solving courtroom-detective cases by rather unconventional means. Besides 'Tarzan,' 'Sherlock Holmes,' 'Superman' ? 'Perry Mason' qualifies as an American icon of popular culture in the twentieth century.\"Gardner's writing has touched a lot of people including a number of high profile figures. Brian Kelleher and Diana Merrill say in their 1987 book, The Perry Mason TV Show Book that Harry S. Truman was a fan and that it is rumored that when Einstein died, a Perry Mason book was at his bedside. They further describe that when Raymond Burr met Pope John XXIII, the actor reported that the pontiff \"seemed to know all about Perry Mason.\" Federal judge Sonya Sotomayor frequently mentions how Perry Mason was one of her earliest influences.Starting with his first book, Gardner had a very definite vision of the shape the Perry Mason character would take:\"I want to make my hero a fighter,\" he wrote to his publisher, \"not by having him be ruthless to women and underlings, but by creating a character who, with infinite patience jockeys his enemies into a position where he can deliver one good knockout punch.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A very well written, hard hitting story. If you still have your head in the sand about what is going on in this world, and just how bad things can get, you should read this story.Texas Bill Survivalcache ForumsI finished Disaster last night and felt like I took a kick\n in the gut.  Please don't be offended, I liked the book a lot, but\nwell...that was some brutal stuff.  Also goes to show why keeping a low\nprofile is important as well as maintaining vigilance at all times is\njust about impossible without sufficient numbers.I grew up in the country and you were dead on with how some of those\nbucolic country folk can be just as vicious as any gang member these\ndays.

In7 Easy Ways to Say NO to\nDifficult People, I explained how to set boundaries with manipulative people ... or\nanyone else, for that matter. This book takes you back a step. It helps you to\nmake that often difficult decision: when to go along and when to stand up for\nyourself.There are many reasons to choose approval-seeking over setting\nboundaries in relationships. Going along with others means you can avoid feeling\nguilty - and get the instant approval that comes with putting others first. But\nfailing to set appropriate boundaries leaves us feeling resentful towards\nothers and disappointed (or angry) with ourselves. Our approval addiction has\nits price.And that's what this book is really about. The people-pleaser\nin all of us wants to feel special, needed and loved. Maybe you need to believe\nthat you're a good person - kind, generous and caring. If you're a bit too\ngenerous ... well, that's better than the opposite, isn't it?7 Keys to Better Boundariesis about finding the balance that\nworks for you. It's about understanding the real price that we pay for seeking\napproval outside of ourselves ... a price that is often higher than we realize. We\nexplore the pitfalls of \"going with the flow\" and the many ways that a\nseemingly small commitment can turn out to be much larger than you originally\nthought. We look at the elements that are often missing from a conversation,\nthe elements you need to be aware of if you're going to make decisions that\nwork for you. And most importantly, we look at the many lies that keep us in\nbondage, doing things that we don't want to do because we feel we must.If you're clear about where to draw the line but simply don't\nknow how, then you don't need this book.7 Easy Ways to Say NO to Difficult\nPeoplewill give you the understanding - and the words - you need. But if you're\nnot sure where to draw the line - or if you find yourself agreeing to things\nand regretting it later (\"Why didn't I see that coming?\"), then this book is\nfor you. It will help you to sort through the manipulation, false beliefs and\ndifficult emotions that often prevent us from doing what's in our best\ninterests. Once you can see through the fog, you'll know what's right for you.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

James Snyder, Time, reviewing a previous edition or volume\"Sragow is immensely attentive to Fleming's films, and he traces in detail the fortunes of all the people connected to them, but his book is held together by what can only be called the romance of movie-making in the studio era -- the large, free, hard-drinking life that the men (but rarely the women) enjoyed when movies were still made quickly and relatively cheaply, craft was spoken of with respect, and art was barely mentioned.\" -- David Denby, New Yorker, reviewing a previous edition or volume\"Michael Sragow's Victor Fleming is certainly among the best film director biographies ever published.

She began writing the first book in the Highest Royal Coven of Europe series, entitled The Silver Eyed Prince, immediately followed by two books belonging to the series called Heirs of Cornwall, entitled The Promise and Heaven Sent (The Wrong One). When asked why she likes to write, she replied, “Don’t you want to escape sometimes? Once in a while, to that magical land where no problems exist, no bosses and teachers breathing at your neck and no hours to keep? I do—so I can live in that world and see it, feel it, touch it—in moments when real life gets too exhausting.” These days, VJ Dunraven spends her time designing for private clients and pursuing her writing.

Reading has been part of my life as far back as I can remember. It seems I always had books around and read anything I could get my hands on. I would go to the library two or three times a week. My library card was one of my most cherished possessions. My dad introduced me to the classics Call of the Wild and White Fang by Jack London when I was nine years old. I can’t remember a time where I wasn’t reading some sort of a book.  In 1986, I left the city life behind and moved to the Northern woods of Wisconsin. I think it was the best move I ever made! I raised my two children in a small rural community where everyone knew everyone—literally! It was at that time my love of nature grew and I formed a new found respect for the great outdoors. Now, while still doing in-home day care, I also work for an incredible publishing company. Even with all that on my plate, I find time to write, and consider myself very blessed in being able to throw my hat in the ring with the other very talented authors.  When time allows, you’ll find me reading or doing one of my hobbies such as scrapbooking. I also enjoy spending time with friends and family… especially my new grandson. I think I will always have a book that needs reading. Whether it’s a romance with a bit of history in it, a mystery that I want to solve before the final chapter or a horror story that leaves me sleeping with the lights on, books will always be a huge part of me and my life. And then there are the stories that need to be written and told…", "related": ["B00I25I2WS"], "rank": 2670865, "title": "Words of an Angel", "author": "Savannah Rayne", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The question lingers with a tauntingly real possibility in\nThe Thin Place by Lori Herter. When Glenna Molloy takes a trip to Ireland to\nexplore sacred places which were special to the love of her life,\n she is on a spiritual journey. However, Coyle Foxworth, her intrusive and manipulative co-author, can't seem\nto leave her alone and follows her. In the tiny Caldragh Graveyard, there is an\nancient pagan stone and a fairy tree which is reputed to be a \"thin place\" or a\nplace where the veil between our world and the Otherworld is very thin. They\nbump into a enigmatic seductress who calls herself Maeve and claims to be half\nhuman and half fairy. Having insulted those of the Otherworld, Coyle is\nsuddenly drawn into Maeve's clutches and tortured as only a Leananshee can\ntorture a man. Fate turns in the opposite direction for Glenna\n and she discovers magical things beginning to happen\nin her life. The intrigue, suspense, and overall draw of The Thin Place make it a page\nturner that you just can't put down. The author plunges the reader deep into\nIrish and Celtic mythology and legends in a way that would cause even the most\nskeptical among us to wonder for a moment. The characters and the descriptions\nplace the reader in Ireland to the point where one might actually smell the wet\ngrass and feel the misty rain while reading. Suspenseful, intriguing and captivating,\nThe Thin Place will take you on a journey to a part of Ireland that only lives\nin myth and legend and cause you to wonder if there actually is an Otherworld\non the other side of the veil.", "related": [], "rank": 1000366, "title": "The Thin Place eBook", "author": "Lori Herter", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He moved to the seclusion of the mountains where he built a small log cabin; all by himself with old pioneer tools, and here he waited for a direction to arrive from deep within. Eventually, and on a whim, he was urged to try sculpting. Having no formal training in this art and amazed at a natural talent lying dormant within him; a new career was birthed that carried him for twenty years. A crippling stroke at 63 ended this career as abruptly as it had started. Being unable to just vegetate, Joseph decided to start sculpting with words, another area where he was untrained. Upon serious study of words and the real meaning of words a whole new world opened up and he began to sculpt with words and his poetic writings began to immerge almost effortlessly! Eventually he was introduced to the world of Acrostic expression which led to his first small publication entitled: \"Acrostic Poetry and Observations\" Available on Amazon.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That is absolutely the wrong way to achieve a lasting, healthy weight loss. That is nothing more than a \"yo yo diets\" where the pounds bounce back just as rapidly as they were lost - often with extra pounds added!!!Lise Gottlieb does not consider these types of diets useful, healthy or successful. Many people who dream of losing weight and having the figure they always dreamed of are  frustrated over and over again. They follow a restrictive unpleasant diet with not permanent result.Lise says, \"after I discovered the secret that helped me lose weight it become an obsession for me to spread the message and help other men and women to reach their weight loss goals, using a fast and easy way they never dared dream about. A way that is completely natural, without surgery, and without suplements.To your successLise", "related": ["B00ES057Y2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.6667, "rating_total": 28.0}

He worked as a solicitor for a while before embarking on an interesting life overseas.  He has spent most of his time in recent years in South East Asia, more recently in Hong Kong.  Before that, Arthur lived and worked in the Philippine Islands (particularly Luzon and Mindanao) for a number of years.   During these years, the experiences of political life and the realities of doing business and living in the Philippines became all too apparent.  These experiences are vividly portrayed during the course of his first book  'Deadly Election' and provide the reader with an accurate, if troubling insight of what to expect if ever they choose to visit this exciting archipelago. He loves to fish, and play the piano – but spends most of his time writing, eating, drinking and sleeping – usually, but not always, in that order.   Deadly Election, draws on his strange imagination and his experiences, together with those of others, in a land that, beneath a veneer of civilisation, operates like the Wild West and is very dangerous to innocent and gullible foreigners. It is the first in his series ‘Asian Intrigue’,  a fast-paced thriller novel depicting crime and corruption throughout Asia. His second book ‘Ninety Percent’ will be published in 2014. It is about international terrorism and smuggling in the Philippines, Hong Kong and China.

I cried and\nlaughed alternately through the show as I watched Poppy's tale of woe unfold\nand then turn to joy. Despite the horrific injuries to her snout, and the pain\nand discomfort she must have felt many times during her long road to recovery,\nthat tail never stopped wagging and her wonderful doggy smile never left her\nface. Poppy showed love and joyfulness at all times. She was just ecstatic to\nbe with people. I was moved by the number of people who formed a chain of love\nstretching from Fiji to Australia and, indeed, the rest of the world in an\neffort to give one dog a chance at life.Poppy grabbed that chance between her\nteeth and ran with it. Poppy's miracle began the day someone spotted her\nforaging for food, malnourished and clearly suffering. Without significant and\ndrastic help, Poppy would never have survived. That help came. Poppy's miracle\nis now complete. Please share her\nmessage of happiness and, by doing so, in some small way you will be helping\nother animals--the ones left behind.", "related": ["B00GM9WE6Q"], "rank": 2225162, "title": "The Poppy Project: How Fiji's Most Famous Dog Got Saved!", "author": "Fiona Ingram", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ralston falls in love with Louisa Thorn, a wealthydebutante, and together, they dream of transforming San Francisco into the most beautiful city in the world. However, Louisa dies suddenly before they can marry...McGranahan's character development is superb; readers will truly care about what happens to Ralston and other main figures in the story. However, sometimes the plot loses forward momentum, and at other times, the story advances far too quickly...Still, McGranahan's writing is often evocative, displaying all the hallmarks of fine literature: \"Shivering, he nodded to a boy leaning innocently against a lamppost, collar turned up and cap pulled down. The lamplighternodded back, a little grin creasing his lips.\" An often captivating story about Nevada's first silver rush, with veins of well-crafted prose, good character development and some solid storytelling.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
