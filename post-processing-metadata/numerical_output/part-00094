O'Neil's study of winning stocks stretches back to the 1960s, and he shares his insights here, describing what characterizes a growth stock, when to cut your losses (at 7 or 8 percent, no more), and how to spot a market top.The techniques inHow to Make Money in Stocksare hardly revolutionary, but therein lies their strength, as O'Neil claims his is \"a winning system in good times or bad.\" Investors interested in Net stocks might be disappointed--the author's first rule is that a company must show a pattern of growing profits, which disqualifies many dot coms. (TryRule Breakers, Rule Makersfor a different take.) O'Neil's approach to stocks is, above all, rational, and he pays little heed to market hype.Those new to investing would do well to read this book before embarking, and even more seasoned traders may findHow to Make Money in Stocksa refreshing return to basics. Markets may swing bull and bear, but O'Neil promises to stand firm.--Demian McLean", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book focuses on the increasingly requested esthetic procedures such as crown lengthening and root coverage, but it also deals with other mucogingival operations, such as hard and soft pre-prosthetic and pre-implant ridge augmentation. Uniquely, there is also a focus on the burgeoning field of periodontal microsurgery, and the techniques and methods learned from other branches of microsurgery are applied to realities of dentistry, for enhanced soft tissue results.Practical Periodontal Plastic Surgerybegins by outlining the place and development of periodontal plastic surgery, and the factors, chiefly periodontal health, that affect surgical outcomes. Periodontal microsurgery is then introduced before the step-by-step description of the surgical procedures with their expected outcome. Each operation is taken in turn, explaining the techniques used and the instrumentation required, and illustrating every step with an abundance of clinical photographs. Finally, the book concludes with a discussion of patient selection criteria.This book will benefit periodontists, dentists, residents and students alike by strengthening understanding of mucogingival surgery through a thorough appreciation of each part of the procedures involved.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Their purpose is to find their brother and recover the valuable cargo from the sunken holds of the Amy Foster. But when Nathan discovers a mysterious box floating in the dark water, little does he know the role it will play in the dark events surrounding his current voyage. In addition, he can't help noticing some disturbing similarities between Ahab in Herman Melville's Moby Dick, a birthday gift from Caleb, and actions Caleb is taking that might well lead to mutiny. Danny Gerard's narration of the half-mad Caleb is by far the most dynamic realization of O'Dell's characters (Houghton Mifflin, 1968).

Althea, a beautiful and daring painter, and Jeanne, a sweet, timid accountant, are childhood friends who come to work in New York at the same time. Each is vaguely dissatisfied and lonely when the dashing bisexual Paul, recently abandoned by his boyfriend, Bryce, meets each of them and, by a string of coincidences, ends up romancing them both. When desire brings all three together on a visit to Block Island, the resulting sexual and social tension follows them back to New York. Jeanne may love Althea, Althea regrets what happened, Paul is apathetic, Althea is in love with Paul, Paul sleeps with Jeanne. Such permutations continue as the novel follows them through the next few months, the situation complicated by Bryce's return and an accident that threatens Paul's dancing career. Whitehouse is adept at capturing New York in the '80s, including descriptions of perfect city days, the specter of AIDS, bits and pieces of bisexuality, and lots of Greenwich Village color. But despite its bohemian edge, the novel is heavily sentimental: even ne'er-do-well Paul has good intentions at heart, and the rest of the cast are perpetually sweet though tortured. They may not do the right thing, but they mean to, and they ponder their choices for pages fore and aft. Althea and Jeanne do manage to stop thinking long enough to find their intended mates, but most readers will lose interest in Whitehouse's inflated prose long before the happy ending.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00IZR0FI2"], "rank": 33712, "title": "FALL LOVE", "author": "Anne Whitehouse", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a result, tensions between the haves and have-nots explode with cosmic consequences in Indian Why Stories.Elders of the Blackfeet, Cree, and Chippewa (Ojibwa) people shared these wonderful tales with Frank B. Linderman in the late nineteenth century and early years of the twentieth century. War Eagle (the fictional name of Linderman’s friend and Chippewa medicine man Pah-nah-to, or Full-of-dew), tells these stories to attentive youngsters after the first frost in the fall. He speaks of animal people, including a deer and an antelope in a footrace, a dancing fox who convulses a buffalo with laughter, a white beaver and ghost people, a huge snake in love with the moon, a sparrow hawk of conscience, and many others. These sparkling tales reveal a reverence for life, honesty, and the unity of creation.This expanded edition features thirteen previously unpublished verse stories along with an introduction to those stories by Sarah Waller Hatfield, granddaughter of Linderman.Frank B. Linderman (1869–1938) spent his adult life in Montana, first as a trapper and then as an author, politician, and businessman.

Readers will be touched by Langford's experiences in Indonesia (the setting of Koch's 1979 novel, The Year of Living Dangerously), Vietnam, and Cambodia.

Tom Waring is a dedicated Christian married to an agnostic. Stricken suddenly with terminal pancreatic cancer, he promises Ann that he will return after death to tell her that heaven exists. The fly in that ointment is that Tom finds Heaven to be most unwilling to allow him to complete this mission. The story then alternates between his attempts to fulfill his promise and the grief suffered by Ann and their son. Worried about not spending eternity with his beloved wife, Tom breaks all the rules in his attempts to communicate belief in God to her. Although mostly predictable, the ending does have some surprises.

Here he tells the story of two writers--one real, one fictitious--who succumb to the forces of fascism but whose works transcend their time and place to speak eternal truths. A chance meeting with the Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca transforms the destiny of Joaquin Wolf, a half-Spanish, half-German novelist. Lorca's murder by the Guardia Civil and Joaquin's own experiences in the bombing of Guernica are the first in a chain of events in which both writers' livesstet lives per sss take on a mesmerizing similarity. The narrator, Joaquin's lover, Ursula Krieger, recognizes that Lorca's poem Romance Son ambulo has an uncanny relevance to the tragic experiences she recounts. In the novel's denouement, the poem also supplies a union of insight and faith. Thornton's prose is illuminated by sharply visual, surrealistic metaphors. His interwoven plot lines are ingeniously conceived and developed, but the portentously monotonous voice of the narrator, while appropriate to her haunted personality, in some respects distances the reader from the characters' emotions. Still, this book should be read for the searing intensity of Thornton's imagination.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The annual Taviscombe Festival, once a simple affair with local performers, is appropriated and aggrandized beyond recognition by new resident Adrian Palgrave. A poet and biographer of little renown, Palgrave has been named literary executor for writer and man-of-the-world Lawrence Meredith, a leading literary figure of the 1920s and 30s. When Palgrave is found battered to death during the first performance of the festival, suspects are not scarce. The unpleasant poet was wont to proclaim any peccadillos he came across, including those he discovered in Meredith's letters. TV documentary-maker Oliver Stevens fears disclosure of an affair, and young Robin Turner, treasurer for the festival, had been tongue-lashed frequently by the dead man. Two other deaths and an attempt to destroy Meredith's papers lead Taviscombe resident Sheila to search for long-held secrets that bred fatal consequences.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He brought the Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism to the 1893 World Parliament of Religions and prepared the way for the flowering of yoga in the West. Vivekananda's accessible teachings have been edited and compiled in countless ways, and this edition by DeLuca, a student of Vedanta, is intended to offer students of yoga something to think about, since Indian yoga is more than a series of physical postures. The guru gently introduces what may be unfamiliar ideas from Hinduism, such asmaya, or illusion. The book's organization into broad themes, including the four yoga paths, is logical in concept yet fuzzy in execution, because the writing doesn't always lend itself to clear differentiation. \"Oneness\" is a pervasive teaching for Vivekananda, and ruminations on it end up scattered throughout the book. The result is somewhat repetitive and disorganized. Nor are there citations showing where the writing is drawn from, except in the appendix. End material, including a reading list, glossary and biographical material, is helpful. This is not the best introduction to Vivekananda, but the swami is so clear himself that he needs little help.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Addressing the  issue of whether sexual coercion means the same today as it has  throughout the 300 years represented, the essays, which focus  heavily on race and social class, indicate that not much has  changed over the years. Nowhere is this more apparent than in  passages that place several of the incidents from earlier  centuries in modern times. Medical knowledge, however, has made  one difference back in Puritan days, a woman who conceived as a  consequence of rape would be punished, for presumably she had  enjoyed the sex. Thorough documentation for each essay provides  a pathway to further research. This is an excellent addition to  both academic and public libraries.

It was written in 1999-2000 and I've left it pretty much the way it was at that time. In it, I explain metadata and goths, things that have long since become mainstream culture. The attitudes here date to the primitive days of the Web and that's all to the good.The book is also very personal in the way it reflects the fears I went through during my divorce. Turning that trial (in every sense of the word) into a piece of wish-fulfillment was catharsis and a way of dealing with my fears about my ex and my son, about freedom, its benefits and terrors, about loneliness and being victimized or eaten up by it. Happily almost all of those fears ended up overblown but they made for a decent story.What's striking now is the portrait of an early version of celebrity culture - someone determined to become famous for being famous. Except this early version now seems entirely quaint and charmingly simple.I started writing this book living at home with my wife and son. It's a long time ago. I knew I was going to leave and I sat down to write a novel - I think it was part of my coming to grips with the idea. I wasn't sure what to write about and I thought, 'What have I never been comfortable writing about before?' and the answer was 'sex.' So, as I said, a piece of wish-fulfillment for the middle-aged divorcee - the beautiful 23-year-old exhibitionist. Happily, as a storyteller, I'm not satisfied with wish-fulfillment. I insist on everyone getting what they deserve, particularly my own character. This book still carries one of my most inventive and fiendish examples of hoisting myself with my own petard.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She is promised a nicely furnished apartment inside the Unit, where  she will make new friends, enjoy the state of the art recreation facilities, and live the  few remaining days of her life in comfort with people who are just like her. Here, women  over the age of fifty and men over sixty–single, childless, and without jobs in  progressive industries–are sequestered for their final few years; they are considered  outsiders. In the Unit they are expected to contribute themselves for drug and  psychological testing, and ultimately donate their organs, little by little, until the  final donation. Despite the ruthless nature of this practice, the ethos of this  near-future society and the Unit is to take care of others, and Dorrit finds herself  living under very pleasant conditions: well-housed, well-fed, and well-attended. She is  resigned to her fate and discovers her days there to be rather consoling and peaceful.  But when she meets a man inside the Unit and falls in love, the extraordinary becomes a  reality and life suddenly turns unbearable. Dorrit is faced with compliance or escape,  and…well, then what?The Unitis a gripping exploration of a society in the throes of an experiment,  in which the “dispensable” ones are convinced under gentle coercion of the importance of  sacrificing for the “necessary” ones. Ninni Holmqvist has created a debut novel of humor,  sorrow, and rage about love, the close bonds of friendship, and about a cynical,  utilitarian way of thinking disguised as care.A Q&A with Ninni HolmqvistQuestion:The Unitis not set in the present, but its echoes of present-day  issues are clear and ominous.  Describe the world ofThe Unit.Ninni Holmqvist:The Unitis a dystopia set in a near future. It is  about people who don’t have any children or anyone else who loves them and need them, and  who aren’t useful to the society in any other way either. These people are called  “dispensable,” and they are picked up at their homes at a certain age (women at 50, men  at 60) and taken to special units (“reservbanksenhet” in Swedish) for biological  material, where they are supposed to serve the society through participating in various  tests (like animal testing but made on people), but also, eventually, by donating organs  to those of the society’s  needed citizens—the ones who produce and raise children,  the loved ones, the ones who contribute to the economic growth—who are afflicted  with severe illnesses and need organs from healthy bodies to survive. Dorrit Weger, who  just turned 50, is one of those dispensable. She is a writer, childless, quite poor, and  lives alone with her dog. The story begins with her arrival at the unit, an  establishment/institution she immediately finds a lot more comfortable and human and  loving and beautiful than she ever could have expected.Question:The Unitraises a number of complex—and sometimes  disturbing—ethical questions.  Do you see the novel as having a central moral  theme?Ninni Holmqvist:The book is above all written as a critique of society and the  way political leaders today see everything in figures and numbers. But my aim was also to  raise questions like: What is freedom? What is human dignity? How do we humans value our  selves and each other?  ButThe Unitis also very much a story about love (Dorrit  meets the love of her life at the unit, a man called Johannes, and she also,  miraculously, gets pregnant) and friendship and loyalty.Question:Who did you writeThe Unitfor?  Did you have  someone—personally, or in society—that you intended the story for?Ninni Holmqvist:My intention was that it is for everyone. But I guess it might  especially appeal to middle-aged single people, childless ones. But also people who are  in or are close to other categories of “dispensable” people: disabled people for  instance, long time unemployed persons, culture workers. And people who are critical of  capitalism and economism. Perhaps also people who don’t mind being provoked.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At Christmastime in an alternate present-day Nevada desert, Dr. Nicholas Anthony, a hunky pixy-human half-breed, is heading home for the holidays. A sudden ice storm detours him to a dilapidated cabin, where he's taken in by beautiful Zee Finvarra, a human-goblin on the run with her two siblings from their truly awful goblin stepfather. Meanwhile, back in town at the mall, Qasim, that nasty-tempered hobgoblin from previous books, is up to no good again. He's hatched an idea to generate a holy war between the \"lutins\" (French for goblins) and humans by dressing in a Santa suit and luring children to their death via a sacrificial ceremony that will free his brethren from bondage.

However, Freud's attention to pathology focused on psychopathology, with little interest in somatic disorders. Others — particularly Alexander — have attempted to develop theories of psychosomatics, but it was particularly the Paris school, and Pierre Marty, who developed a truly psychoanalytic theory of psychosomatics. This volume provides an important introduction, summary and critique of that work, and also offers perspectives on it from around the world. Beginning with a paper by André Green that was originally written as his contribution to a debate with Pierre Marty that never occurred due to the latter's death, it continues with five papers from Paris and five from England, Latin America and North America. They provide theory, clinical reports and contrasting approaches. I know of no finer introduction to contemporary psychosomatics.”“Psychoanalysts work more and more with patients presenting psychosomatic disorders. Present day descriptive and classificatory psychiatry tends to see only one clinical frame under the confusing term of somatisation. But since Freud, psychoanalysis has helped us to understand the complexity and the diversity of psychopathological organizations which may have somatising consequences (conversion hysteria, essential depression, functional disorders, hypochondria, etc). The book which Marilia Aisenstein and Elsa Rappoport de Aisemberg present here, gives us a modern view in direct line with all the previous researches, showing us how we can rethink this plurality. Authors who have found their main source, either in the Paris Psychosomatic School, or in the long tradition of South American studies, mainly in Argentina, all bring in their own manner an original theoretical reflection on this subject. The reader will also profit from their very interesting clinical cases. This book throws a new light, of great interest, on a field where there have been few recent publications.”", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I used to beta read manuscripts for a\ndear friend who was a very successful romantic suspense writer. All those\ntwists and turns and double crosses. I loved reading it but never dreamed I'd\nwrite it myself. Then Loose Id put out a call for manuscripts for their Men of\nMystery series. What fun. Give us your secret agents and super heroes, your\nundercover cops and assassins, they said. I don't usually write those guys. Not yet\nanyway. But i had just started a story I was inspired to write with a ballet\ndancer hero. Not exactly Navy SEAL material. But I had woven a story around my\nballet dancer that involved an investigative reporter and a billionaire technologist\nwho may or may not also be an art thief. Hmm. Art theft? What if that theft had bigger\nimplications? What if there was an outside villain who was a seriously nasty\nguy and what if he had a henchman that would make Ian Fleming proud? What if\none hero is pitted against the other in a web of lies and mistrust and what if\nthey both want the same thing? Hey, whaddya know? I had the makings of a\nromantic suspense. I pitched. I WON! They accepted my proposal. And then I had\nto WRITE it. Yikes! LOL.The resulting book,Golden\nDanceris a M/M/M ménage. Here are a few things I learned:·         Even with no suspense elements, a ménage is\nchallenging. You need to get far into the heads and hearts of all three men and\nshow their motivations, loves, concerns. When you layer on top of that the need\nto create a suspenseful plot, you have a lot on your hands.·        The beginning of the book, always a big hurdle\nin any book for any writer, is a huge challenge in romantic suspense.\nEspecially erotic romantic suspense. You need to introduce the elements of the\nmystery or conflict right away, but the reader also wants to know who the\nromantic heroes are going to be. It's a lot to get on stage at once. Especially\nwhen you have three heroes!·         If you want to create a great hero, write a\nreally good villain. As my husband always says, \"Nazis make the best villains.\"\nI took his advice.·        Find the right balance between the sex and\nromance and the mystery and suspense. The reader will get antsy if the romance\nis ignored in favor of the suspense or vice versa.·        Keep up the pace. Romantic suspense is not\nleisurely!I had enormous fun writingGolden\nDancer. I notice that all my books are getting a little more\nsuspenseful as a result. I hope you enjoy it -- the suspense, and, above all, the\nromance! : ) Tara", "related": ["B00LCA8612"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 72.0}

Psychoanalysis began with the treatment of individuals and in its early days attended to the conflict between the individual’s wishes and society. It was not for some time that it fully addressed the fact that the ostensible individual was a social animal, who was never outside his group even when ostensibly alone. In this book what has been learnt from the study in depth of individual psychopathology is brought to bear on what can be learnt from studying people in groups and vice versa. This integration is a challenge to both, and is perhaps the most relevant in contemporary psychoanalysis.”“This excellent book provides impressive depth, and refreshing clarity of expression and thinking about psychoanalytic group psychotherapy, as well as insights about group life more broadly. The editor’s profound conviction in the value of psychological work done by groups, her masterful use of psychoanalytic theory to understand group life, and the liveliness of the clinical examples (often of patients with severe difficulties) make it very pleasurable to read. A splendid section of the Manual on the group therapist’s tasks outlines the principles of technique and will inspire future generations of group therapists. An outstanding volume, which I am delighted to recommend.\"“This book is unique in that it contains the first usable, lively and informative Treatment Manual for psychoanalytic group psychotherapy, bringing together a wealth of anecdotes and experience in an eminently user-friendly way. Anybody practising psychoanalytic group therapy would do well to immerse themselves in the volume as a whole. It creates a whole new opportunity for rejuvenating this field of work, containing chapters by an impressive body of experts, with many clear examples of Tavistock technique at its best.”", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Charming, arrogant, and handsome, he quickly locates easy prey in Prague, stealing and conning his way to a luxurious free ride.

Harvey brings much needed rigor to a particularly bitterly divisive what-if debate:  that over the 2003 Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq.\"- Philip E. Tetlock, Annenberg University Professor, University of Pennsylvania\"A sophisticated use of counterfactuals to go beyond ideologically motivated explanations for the Iraq War.  Harvey's method and its application will impress even those who are not persuaded by his argument that a Gore administration would also have gone to war.\"- Richard Ned Lebow, James O. Freedman Presidential Professor, Dartmouth College\"In a provocative study of the 2003 Iraq War, Harvey challenges standard interpretations that trace the origins of the war to the beliefs and personality of George W. Bush and to the influence of his neoconservative advisors. Not all readers will be convinced by Harvey's innovative use of counterfactual analysis to argue that international and domestic pressures would have also led Al Gore to a decision for war. But all subsequent analyses of the Iraq War must take this argument seriously.\"- Jack S. Levy, Board of Governors' Professor, Rutgers University\"Harvey serves up an interesting cocktail. He combines a provocative thesis about the relatively minor role of George Bush in the explanation of the 2003 Gulf War with one of the most methodologically sophisticated counterfactual analyses I have seen.\"- Gary Goertz, Professor of Political Science, University of Arizona\"Frank P. Harvey has written a lucid, penetrating, and provocative account of the origins of the Iraq War.  Regardless of where one stands on this controversial set of decisions, it is a must read.\"- Janice Gross Stein, Director, Munk School of Global Affairs\"Harvey's book is an outstanding addition to the literature on international relations, the presidency, and foreign policy analysis. For methodological, theoretical, and empirical perspectives, it serves as a superb model for research design in counterfactual analysis. Summing Up: Recommended.\" -W.W. Newmann, Virginia Commonwealth University, CHOICE Magazine\"Frank Harvey is to be congratulated for producing an exemplary book. It makes sophisticated use of counterfactual argumentation to challenge the conventional wisdom about the causes of the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq.  For methodological and substantive reasons it should be read by everyone with an interest in foreign policy.\" -Richard Ned Lebow, King's College London, H-net\"Explaining the Iraq War  will become one of the most important books on the topic. Political scientists have sometimes been criticized for being little different from journalists, but this book is a model in what political science can bring to a topic largely dominated by journalists in its analytical rigor, theoretical sophistication, attention to evidence, and boldness in argument. Even the most rigid neoconists should be challenged to reconsider their views in light of this book.\" -Robert S. Snyder, Southwestern University, The Review of Politics\"Using sophisticated counterfactual arguments, Frank Harvey presents an imaginative, bold, and provocative reinterpretation of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Basing his analysis on a wide variety of documentary sources and other empirical evidence, he carefully and methodically challenges, and dismantles, the standard explanations for the war that overwhelmingly locate causality within the administration of George W. Bush. This book not only makes an important contribution to our understanding of the 2003 war, a conflict whose effects continue to impact global politics; more importantly, it demonstrates how path dependence and counterfactual theorizing, rigorously and imaginatively applied, can enhance our understanding of international relations.\" Canadian Political Science Association International Relations Book Prize 2013 Jury Report\"For this reviewer at least, the tightness of Harvey's argument, the extent of the evidence that he supplies, and the care and fastidiousness with which he presents his conclusions combine to produce a book that mercilessly assaults the notion that the responsibility for the 2003 war in Iraq falls squarely on the shoulders of Bush and the neocons, and on their misguided priorities and intentional deceptions (p. 1). In doing so, Harvey vigorously challenges an intellectual position that has become so enduring that it had achieved the status of a truth. And if this book does not, at a minimum, sow doubts in the minds of believers, then nothing will. \" -Adeed Dawisha, Miami University of Ohio, Perspectives on Politics\"Harvey's work is both commendable and welcome, and should lead to much soul-searching among the academy, policymakers, and interested citizens, not to mention this country's two million or so Iraq War veterans who are often told that they fought because of a war-mongering president. By eliminating \"Bush and the neocons\" from the explanation of the Iraq War, Harvey re-centers attention on the factors that international relations theorists should have been focused on all along: U.S. unipolarity and the effects of the 9/11 attacks: \"The two dominant forces that pushed the country down the path to war had nothing to do with individuals or ideology - 9/11 and the reality of US power were largely responsible.\"....Airport bookshops may thrive on contingent accounts of history-how Irish monks saved Western civilization or how Chinese sailors ignited the European Renaissance. But like them, the theory that George W. Bush caused the Iraq War represents an astonishing failure to show that changing one variable would make all other variables irrelevant. Harvey reminds us to take history, and politics that makes it, more seriously.\" -Bruce Gilley, Portland State University, Perspectives on Politics\"Frank Harvey has written a provocative and interesting book that admirably questions the conventional wisdom that Al Gore would not have initiated the Iraq War. His arguments raise often unacknowledged and untested assumptions about the counterfactual alternative of a Gore foreign policy after 9/11.\" --Elizabeth Saunders, George Washington University, Perspectives on Politics\"Earlier this summer, Canada's political scientists chose as their top prize winner a book that provocatively refutes the dominant theory around one of the worst public policy disasters of the 21st century, the Iraq War... Counter-factual theory is a widely used tool for analyzing public accounts of historical events, or testing social science theories of causation. Here it is deployed with a rigour seldom seen before. Harvey uses counter-factual argument to advance that the answer is no, Al Gore in the White House would not have been enough to avoid war.\" - Andrew Steele, The Globe and Mail", "related": [], "rank": 1606330, "title": "Explaining The Iraq War", "author": "Frank P.

In analysis since 1985 with 4 Jungian analysts, she left college teaching and ran a research business while she trained in spiritual science with the Baltimore Spiritual Science Center, the School for Enlightenment and Healing, the Barbara Brennan School of Healing, and Atlantic University, from which she received a Master’s degree in 1997. In 2005, she founded the Jungian Center for the Spiritual Sciences to fulfill Jung’s vision of a form of adult education that would foster individuation. She is the author, co-author or editor of numerous books, including The Fourth Wave, Intuitive Imagery, Revisioning Science, How to Survive and Thrive in the Coming Earth Changes, and Jung and Our Collective Future.

Dunnett established a prominent career as a portrait painter, being exhibited at both the Royal Scottish Academy and the Royal Academy. She was also an accomplished sculptress. Her interest in writing developed during the 1950s. Her own tastes took her to historical novels and it was her husband who eventually suggested she write one of her own. A writer who has been described as one of great wit, charm, and humanity, yet whose work displayed toughness, precision, and humor, she was appointed to an OBE in 1992 for services to literature and became Lady Dunnett in 1995 when her husband was knighted.", "related": [], "rank": 1091073, "title": "Ibiza Surprise (Johnson Johnson Book 2)", "author": "Dorothy Dunnett", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is an important contribution to a growing literature on a central dogmatic theme—and a welcome reminder of the abiding importance of the practice of theological commentary on the formative texts of the tradition. In the contested world of contemporary Barth scholarship, we can never be recalled too often to close reading of the sources themselves; it is the great merit of this exemplary study of Church Dogmatics II/1 to do just that.” -- Donald Wood, University of Aberdeen, UK.“Price has given us a great gift: a careful and charitable guided tour through one of the most complex sections of Barth's Church Dogmatics. His close exposition of Barth's text unveils the inner logic of Barth's argument by highlighting important connections and insights that often go unnoticed. Chapter by chapter, he opens up new vistas from which we can view the contours of Barth's entire theology more clearly, and the result is a better grasp of Barth's ongoing relevance for contemporary thought. This book stands in the best tradition of theological commentary, and it will be valuable to any theologian engaged in a serious study of Barth's theology or the doctrine of God.” -- Keith L.

Ed Graves, a Catholic priest, shares his experiences of God, a passionate God desperate for our love; a God who took him for his intimate, who has guided him from his teenage years on a journey to mystical bethrothal, then impelled him to share his discoveries through art and poetry. A trained painter, Fr. Graves strives to convey the spiritual vision that, to the lover of God, the world, in every aspect, in every person, gleams with mystery - for every one is a precious brushstroke of God, the master painter. God reveals his love by creating us and the dazzling world for us - and, ultimately, in one majestic display, by divesting himself of his majesty to clothe himself in our mortality, and, on a storm-rent hill of shame and rejection, attempt to rip our hearts free from the grip of pride and remake them like his own. To Fr. Graves, the world is steeped in mystery, charged with beauty, eternal in purpose. Only poetry and art - the language of spirit, often complex, often obscure - can convey this perception, for it eludes reason and the casual observer it and unveils its grace only to the quiet contemplative.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is still a source of his desire to wander.  Various summer jobs included sitting on a horse while cattle grazed on grass alongside the road, working as a grunt in an oil refinery, being a stock boy, and he even sold Christmas trees for a few weeks one winter.   Most of his energy went into college degrees in physics, computer science and electrical engineering, which landed him a job at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.  He’s been a computer programmer, a manager in computer science, information science, and cyber security, and a cynic of project management.  A lot of his technical writing involved the management of people and projects. That gave him the money and vacation time to learn how to build houses, to backpack in the Rocky Mountain high country, to climb mountains, to snowshoe and cross-country ski, to raft the rivers of the Southwest, to support Christian wilderness programs, and to see the excitement in his sons’ eyes as they enjoyed the adventures with him.  He is still given to wandering. He wishes he was a magician, but he’ll settle for writing mysteries that feature good kids, good families, great places, rich history, and clever plots.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The military ethics article was published but the idea of mercs as ethicists intrigued me. Studying the historian of mercenaries took me to the original Wild Geese and a number of ideas sprang up and demanded to be written about. So I did,Mercenary's Heartwas finished, and that, I thought, was it. Other ideas about the 29th Century Wild Geese came up and, as most writers will tell you, there was little choice - those stories had to be written. Other Wild Geese novels followed (as well as other work) and subjects encountered by the people ofMercenary's Hearthave included ethics, loyalty, love and relationships, violence and its aftermath, freedom and its cost, and, ultimately, what it means to be human. Eleven Wild Geese novels are done, the twelfth might be stirring, and I'm delighted to be here.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book started out as a project for Taylor Sykes-Green, a 2011 Intern for Improve Consulting and Training Group, in Cleveland, OH. Taylor is a high school student with an enormous amount of talent and even greater potential. Taylor loves to write, so I asked her to create a motivational tip for each day of the year, for the Improve team. After hearing Taylor's voice through these inspirational writings of wisdom, I knew that others would be blessed to be exposed to such truths. I decided to have them published and will use a portion of the profit to support Taylor's educational pursuits. Taylor is a wonderful example, of Improve Consulting and Training Group's theme, of someone \"exceeding their potential\". She exemplifies strong moral character, compassion for others and the drive required to sustain long term success. In the four years I have worked with Taylor and watched her grow, she has evolved into the epitome of what true leadership transformation is all about. By the way, did I mention she is a high school student? The wisdom, truth and substance in her writings reach far beyond the academic walls of a high school and provide guidance for even the most polished adults.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Smith says,\"My mom was an angel on earth to so many people throughout her life.\"  The priceless smile and undeniable strength and will she had made her an unavoidable presence.  Smith and her sister (Linda Messer) cared for their mother for much of their adult lives.  Smith became the daily caregiver during the last seven years of her mom's life as she battled with Alzheimer's disease. Born in Texas, BJ graduated from University of Houston with a Bachelor's degree in accounting.  She worked in the corporate world before she decided to stay at home and take care of her two boys.  Smith wore many different hats during those years, including preschool teacher, substitute teacher for elementary level schools, volunteer for homebound members of her church, fitness gym owner and licensed fitness trainer with certification in training the older population and most importantly a caregiver for her mother.  Smith currently resides in Deer Park, Texas with her husband, sons, four dogs, and a cat.

Following the acquittal of two gay bashers in criminal court, attractive Wisconsin attorney Ann Monroe agrees to represent the young victim, Bill Robinson, in a civil suit. Ann suspects that there was an egregious breach of conduct on the part of the D.A. and possibly even the jurors, which caused Robinson's assailants to be set free, but when she probes further, she finds that all the major players are unusually tight-lipped about the case. Meanwhile, a fundamentalist group known as the Lambs of God, which doesn't take kindly to her firm's liberal bent, has labeled Ann the Antichrist and begun sending her threatening letters for her interference in its Planned Parenthood protests. As the threats and attempts on Ann's life escalate, she begins to realize that there may be a connection between the two cases. The novel's frenzied pace and constant action help keep the tension high, but Kopp's dialogue is flat, focusing largely on the mundane, and her protagonists are only marginally developed. A minor romance between Ann and a co-worker also adds little to this largely plot-driven tale.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 1911 he spent a year in Paris studying occultism under Dr. Gerard Encausse, aka Papus, the Spanish-born French chemist, and it was here he began to develop his own psychic abilities.  He devoted his life to spiritual pursuit until his death in July 1934.  According to Antoinette Pauchard, it was five months after his death when he first communicated. He made contact via a small and private circle in Holland where he was able to manifest and relay messages to his family and friends who were still in the physical.  He communicated again in February 1935 remarking; \"As I can easily get in touch with you, I shall be happy to communicate to Antoinette and yourselves, my first impressions here. Will you help me to do so from time to time?\"  The communications began on 4 March 1935 and resulted in the book The Other World.  Pauchard closed that first session by saying; may these messages bring enlightenment, help and comfort to all who suffer and try to understand what becomes of us after death.", "related": [], "rank": 2452157, "title": "The Other World", "author": "Albert Pauchard", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

These short tales offer a brief glimpse into Calvert’s career as an entertainer, including how he got started in show business, some of the people he’s met along the way and the different places both in the U.S. and abroad where he’s performed. Anecdotal tales about his life as a performer are blended together with clean jokes, many of which will be familiar to most readers. Calvert even tosses in a little word-game riddle, the solution to which he buries in the text at a much later point. As a proud family man, he includes short sections on each of his children. Black-and-white photos that accompany the text feature the author performing, family and friends, locales mentioned in the book, some funny signs and even a couple of Internet memes. Despite this strange mixture of information and a somewhat disjointed style, the book is quite readable, with the first and second chapters consisting of almost nothing but jokes before switching to a memoir style accented by jokes in Chapter 3. The author’s breezy, informal style makes it feel like he’s an old friend casually relating these tales. It doesn’t hurt that he focuses on the humorous stories from throughout his life, such as his early days flying: “I believe I am the only student pilot who has ever landed a plane backward.” His tales of performing tend to focus on entertaining events along the way, such as the day a waiter was enlisted to press the play button on the cassette player at the start of a dance number, though he hit fast forward instead and chaos ensued. The humor runs the gamut from clever to corny, but the lighthearted, upbeat tone makes for a charming read.", "related": [], "rank": 3290764, "title": "A Funny Thing Happened To Me On The Way To My Funeral eBook", "author": "Mel Calvert", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although I was definitely aware of that, I\ndecided to try. But when I started, and as I progressed very slowly, I\ndiscovered what a daring decision I might have taken. In fact, after I\ncompleted the first draft of the first volume (out of 37) and part of the\nsecond volume, I had to stop because practically I realized much more\ndifficulties than that I had been initially warned.For example one honest scholar told me: \"I know from decades of\nexperience--and I know that my considered judgment is shared by those mature\nscholars whose knowledge of this text is more extensive than mine--that the\nthought of this project would be sheer folly, leading to a result that would be\npainfully embarrassing (for sure) and potentially incredibly damaging (if\npeople actually took a bad job seriously).\" This is certainly true, at\nleast because this text presupposes such vast knowledge of underlying systems\nof thought and reference like Koran, Hadith, theology, jurisprudence and philosophy,\nso every single line or phrase of the Arabic typically requires many pages of\nexplanation and commentary in English. Moreover, there are many bolted\nsentences in almost every chapter that remain opaque and unclear to the most\nspecialized scholars who have studied them for years.Therefore, after working on the first two volumes I experienced all these\ndifficulties and much more, so I had to stop and give up this seemingly impossible\njob. Yet I am totally convinced that: \"that which cannot be accomplished\nfully should not be left out fully!\"My principal motivation behind this work was the fact that after I did\nthe research on Ibn Arabi's time and cosmology, based on a total of a very tiny\nportion of the Futuhat, both in terms of passages size and in terms of the vast\nextent of subjects tackled in this magnum opus, I discovered how much the world\nis missing not having access to this historical work, especially that most of\nthe serious scholarship nowadays is performed in English, by students or\nscholars who may not have full access to the Arabic text, not to mention the fact\nthat this extensive Arabic text itself need to be properly indexed and\ncharacterized to allow easier access benefiting from existing computer\naccessibilities. For this reason, and with the\npossibility now to publish in electronic formats which can be rectified and\nedited easily, I decided to publish the first volume as it is in its first\ndraft after I stopped working on it for more than two years. The result was\noverwhelming! This certainly reinforced my initial impression about the urgency\nfor a complete translation of this book.Therefore,\nthe work will be revived, despite all the difficulties and constrains. I am\nfully aware that there will be many errors and deficiencies; for example in\nsetting out the correct equivalent English terms, the presence of numerous poor\nexpressions due to the complexity of the original text or the lack of\nexplanatory comments in some places, but I will keep looking at the bright side\nuntil a mature and satisfactory version is developed, which I think will take\nsome years before this may be achieved.", "related": ["B00C0TZS4W"], "rank": 361858, "title": "The Meccan Revelations (volume 1 of 37) (al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya)", "author": "Muhyiddin Ibn Arabi", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The sick schmuck who dared attack her partner is now her prime target,\nand nothing or no one will stand in her way--except maybe her new partner who\narrives in town seeking vengeance on the same culprit. Kai Lawson, a Bruce Willis lookalike,\nannoys her. From the very beginning, nothing seems to go right between the two\nof them, leaving Aurora to question if they should even be working\ntogether--especially after he shoots her--and not accidentally!

I have really enjoyed reading Bloodline and cant wait to start book 2!!! Shannon K Brown is truly an AUTHOR!!!! 5 Stars\"-Steve Westerguard N.DReviewed by Martina Svyantek for Readers' Favorite\" \"Bloodline\" by Shannon K Brown is the story of Luna Lanchester, a woman who lives her life carrying around a lot of demons. Literally. Luna is an independent young woman who has seen what abuse was done to her mother. She has also got an alter-ego, her demon side named My Lady Moon. And My Lady Moon is drawn to the other demons in Luna's life. Luna's search for a demon slayer complicates the matter when she is pulled between Sean, the High Priest of her waking hours, and Bane, the demon of her dreams. And then there is her neighbor from across the street, Dammon, the People Reader.Luna's troubles go a bit deeper than your typical \"girl meets boy, girl falls for boy, girl meets new boy, rinse and repeat\" formula. Through her warrior blood, she is linked to the four sons of Lucifer; she is their last chance for the freedom to walk the earth. Will they take it, or will they choose instead to be bound to her for eternity? Poor Luna's life is as topsy-turvy as they come, with covens of witches trying to use her blood in their rituals, demons trying to make her their girlfriend, and a mother who just does not understand. And of course, there is her new best friend Izzy who just keeps trying to save everyone by getting them to make friends with Jesus. I found this book to be an exciting read, with a whole new take on choosing the \"bad boy\" as your soul mate. If I were Luna, I would be taking my time choosing between this set of suitors; guess that's what we will find out in book two!\" 4 stars", "related": ["B00I2E5EQG"], "rank": 15673, "title": "Bloodline (Paranormal Romance, Dark &Twisted)", "author": "Shannon K.

This author's work is always dark and complex, the\nmain characters are flawed and quirky. The story is full of contrasts. Pain and\npleasure, truth and lies, trust and deceit, past and present, real and unreal.Dreu is a 900-year-old\nVampyr with a dark secret. When he's 'rescued' by a band of werewolves, the\nweres see Dreu as a weapon to use against their mortal enemies - the Vampyrs.\nThis little story is set firmly in the here and now, which gives it depth. We\nall know about Somali pirates and the sale of ex-Soviet weapons. Now add\nVampyrs and Werewolves. Throw in some seriously erotic MM sex as the ancient\nmonk begins an unlikely relationship with a young werewolf, and then let's\ndelve into who Dreu is, why he's a monk. One of Dreu's endearing qualities is\nhis wicked sense of humor. You'll encounter that on page one. From there, the\nstory becomes darker, with an amazing variety of twists and turns for such a\nshort read. You'll need to keep your wits about you, but you'll be thinking\nabout this little book for the next few days.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Thankfully, I have wonderful editors who help me a lot. WC: Still, your books seem to\nhave more positive reviews than negative.IDB: Touch wood! :)But to be honest,\nnegative reviews have been very helpful. I took them seriously, went back, rewrote\nand re-edited the books, and now they are better.WC: Do you like receiving\nfeedback?IDB: Absolutely! Feedback for an\nauthor is the same as applause for the performer. Tickets and book sales feed\nus, but feedback and applause make us happy and satisfied.WC: How many books will be in the\nWitch Hollow series?IDB: 5. WC: What if we want more than 5?IDB: I am planning a spin-off\nseries about the Witchcraft Academy. WC: Shall we meet any of the\ncharacters from Witch Hollow?IDB: Grandfather Grindewald will\nbe there:) WC: What inspires you?IDB: Celtic music, Irish\nlandscapes, medieval history, and Magic. WC: What do you read?IDB: Classics. I read very little\ncontemporary literature. Dickens, Gaskell, Twain, Austen, Bronte sisters are my\nbest friends and teachers. I think that's why my prose and dialogues are so\nold-fashioned. WC: When is the 4th\npart of the Witch Hollow series coming out?IDB: I'll do my best to finish it\nat the end of the year. But I'll publish the book in the beginning of 2014.\nEditing takes a lot of time, especially for someone like me, who has to think\nover every word and phrase. WC: Looking forward.

And what is this knowledge? Could you break it down into 'smart' tips - what would they be, and where do you find them? Why does it take years (even decades) of searching to find the practical, sensible things to do that work - both to lose weight and get glowingly healthier, as our friend Lily had done? Wouldn't any of us want to enjoy such a transformation sooner, if we could just work out how to do it?It just shouldn't be that hard (or time-consuming) to find those things you can do - what's firmly in your control that works, without resorting to anything drastic like cosmetic surgery, for women as well as for men.As a health and wellness reporter, I knew a many of these tips, went in search for more based on the most recent research, talked to women - and this book is the result. And as my wise friend said, these eating and lifestyle tips to look and feel better may seem minor, in and of themselves, but put them all together, and the result can be \"amazing and wonderful.\"Who wouldn't want friends noticing that about them?

He grew up in the city of Wellington, renown for its high winds and the almost magical ability of rain and sleet to be lifted off the street and blasted into one's face.  After eighteen years of suffering the cold and wet, he was finally blown away in a particularly bad storm to settle far away as a student, for more years then most would ever admit to. Later when the universities had pronounced him done, he became an overqualified and underpaid worker in the health sector, (aren't we all). He has lived in the city of Rotorua, one of the very few places in the world where people have actually chosen to reside beside active geysers and breath air that reeks of sulphur, for the past fifteen years. He works by day for his daily bread, and toils away by night on his books.  When not engaged in his great passions of reading and writing science fiction and fantasy, drinking strong black coffee (some call it tar), and consuming copious amounts of chocolate (dark naturally), he lives a quiet life of contemplation as the high priest to his two cats. He worships them with regular gifts of food, occasional grooming and by providing them with a warm dry place to sleep. They in turn look down upon him with typical feline disdain, but occasionally deign to bring him gifts of headless vermin, - as a warning. In a desperate bid to understand the meaning of his life, he has recently started studying philosophy, particularly metaphysics, and finally concluded that God must be a cat!

Extraordinary historical romance at its very best.5-STAR Top Pick All-Time Keeper Shelf: SWurman forNight Owl ReviewsThe richness of the prose and the attention to all that drives the story make this a wonderful read. Tension mounts as Lady Diana proceeds with her plot to unseat Jane. The story is multi-layered and threads from the past are seamlessly woven into current events.

In 1936, Nathan Ebanholz, a Jewish immigrant, is trying to bring his wife and baby daughter from Europe to New York to escape the Nazi threat. He has paid Marvin Zweikel, who makes a good living at this human trade, to arrange their safe passage, but his loved ones are not on the ship they're supposed to be on, as Zweikel discovers. When Ebanholz, who's having an affair with Zweikel's wife Stella, learns that the couple have hidden the true fate of his wife and daughter from him, he kills Stella in a rage. In a further impulsive act, Nathan kidnaps a sick three-year-old girl from the hospital where Stella worked as a nurse and takes the youngster to the suburban New Jersey home of his childless sister, Anna, and her gentile husband, a doctor. The rest of the book focuses on the girl Rosie, who grows up ignorant of her origins to become an artist in Greenwich Village, though she is increasingly haunted by fearful visions. Inevitably, the new generation repeats the mistakes of the old in a well-crafted novel that manages to entertain as it seriously explores issues of good and evil.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sometimes with a touch of humor, sometimes with a little sorrow, always with passion and emotion. My latest books are a two-book contemporary romance series, Wolves in Business.  Wolf in Jester’s Clothing and Wolf on Thin Ice tell the story of two brothers who find their true loves where they least expect them.  Warning: These are NOT shapeshifters, but alpha businessmen.  Like the Magic Series, it’s best to read them in order. My award-winning Magic Series is about a group of people who can cast spells to help them with their everyday jobs. Wouldn't you like to have an ability that would help you type faster, make accurate change, fix the plumbing, or grow flowers and vegetables? Or whatever it is that you do? And these people, who call themselves practitioners, are guaranteed to find their soul mates. Ready or not, and whether or not they want one at that particular moment. As the series progresses, the magic gets more complicated and so do the relationships. Included in the series now are the last two stories, never before published. Windswept won the Romantic Times Reviewers' Choice Award for Best Romance, Small Press, 2008, and several other awards. Writing this standalone contemporary with a historical twist took me back to my first love, the study of history, and it definitely shows off my Texas roots. There's a terrible secret in the papers of the Windswept Plantation . . . I'm a native Gulf Coast Texan, now living in The Frozen North of Chicagoland. I started life reading mysteries, then sci-fi and fantasy. When I discovered romances, I saw a way to combine all the aspects of books that I liked into my own stories. And what a welcome difference from writing computer manuals--my old job and which has no magic about it at all. Let me know what you think of my stories. Contact me either at ann@AnnMacela.com or AnnMacela@msn.com P.S.

Reading those novels I thought I could do better, and so my quest to write entertaining stories began.\nBeing an introvert, it took me a long time to feel comfortable enough to let others read my work. How long? Well, the first person to read a story I wrote was my husband. Since then, I’ve been writing professionally for almost nine years now. But it was my daughter who encouraged me to write a book for teens—just one of the reasons I love her so dearly.\nI live in Maryland with my husband and three children.

As we know from the opening story, Blue wears a magic collar now and that addition to his `wardrobe' enhances the spirit of his adventures.Summertime in Wibbleton and Blue is out for a walk in the fields. While chewing a stick he finds by the river, he notices a farm on the other side of the river, floats to the other side, and discovers animals with whom he can talk because of his magic collar. He meets Rambo the lamb who takes him on a tour of the farm. By a watering hole the two encounter a wild boar with a fun attitude, Donkey, field mice, ducks and a chicken - and then suddenly George the huge intimidating dog whom they manage to sneak by because of Blue's magic collar's ability to make them invisible! They all become visible when safe and Blue takes his leave to return home.Daniel G. Lebryk TOP 50 REVIEWERBlue has a magic collar that allows him to do fun things. On his most recent walk, he decides to visit a farm. This is a cute simple story. I enjoyed the humor; the animals are self-aware and question why they can talk with a dog.Dre TOP 500 REVIEWERThe Adventures of Blue series is a fun series about a happy dog that goes on fantastical adventures with the help of his magic collar. This book continues the adventures of Blue with his magic collar. This time, he travels to a farm and spends his day meeting all the different farm animals. He even has to hide from the mean old farm dog with the help of his magic collar.

When he arrives in the middle of a blizzard, he finds a woman asleep on the couch. She's suffering from amnesia, a concussion, and a bullet graze to her arm. The only clue to her identity is a personal digital assistant that identifies her as Amelia E. Hart. As Luke and Amelia leave the cabin and his disabled SUV, they fear that a passel of bad guys is on their trail. Meanwhile an eco-terrorist is at work, while right-wingers are stealing SHIELD, a bio-tech body armor that could have immense significance for crime and terrorism. Dr. Knight, the creator of SHIELD, has been murdered, and his bland but eidetic daughter (known as his file cabinet) has disappeared. Fans of Tami Hoag, Iris Johansen, and Catherine Coulter's Sherlock and Savich series will find Jones' fast-paced and suspenseful romance satisfying, even though it's kinder and gentler.Diana Tixier HeraldCopyright © American Library Association.

One of the over-riding impressions we have of budding entrepreneurs is their lack of fundamental business knowledge and skills. Often their ideas are terrific however they are not capable of presenting these ideas in a logical and thorough fashion. This was abundantly clear in our E-Star contest-- good ideas, poor presentations. This presents a tremendous opportunity to someone with a great idea: figure out how to present it and you will be ahead of the crowd (your competition)! --Stuart Engs, EntrepreneurEntrepreneurship is the driving force behind innovation, employment and wealth creation. Despite its critical importance, there is very little information about the specific steps that must be taken to successfully fund early stage companies that may some day become great economic drivers. Phil has provided a invaluable and specific guidelines about the capital raising process from someone who has been in those meetings, faced those questions and been successful. Shark Talk will help entrepreneurs better prepare themselves for meetings with capital providers and should be studied by anyone wading into those shark infested waters. --Ken Wiles, CEO AlertID --Ken Wiles, CEO AlertID", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She becomes intimate with Luca Romano, owner of the company she wants to purchase. Unfortunately for Kataryna, handsome Roberto is also attracted to her. She realizes she is the desirous target of a Desperate Pursuit in Venice, as both men compete for her attention. Luca and Roberto are friends, and Kataryna is the woman of their dreams. To add to her confusion, Kataryna's father confesses that she and her sister have a brother, who was given up for adoption. She hires a lawyer to search for her sibling, and does her best to juggle her hectic workload while sorting out her romantic life. The book is written by Karynne Summars.This was not the predictable romance story one reads, so I was very impressed with the author, Karynne Summars. She wrote with feeling and this is clearly evident from the strong plot which is filled with drama. I felt that I had also travelled to Europe, and was a part of the unfolding story. The author also created a cast of characters whose personalities seemed so real, as well as the emotional problems they had. The passionate sexual encounters were very tastefully done, and made Desperate Pursuit in Venice more exciting to read. My attention was also caught by the attractively designed book cover. Karynne Summars wrote an original and exciting book with a unique, creative writing style which I admire very much.", "related": ["B007Z4D9MA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He grew up in the city of Wellington, renown for its high winds and the almost magical ability of rain and sleet to be lifted off the street and blasted into one's face. After eighteen years of suffering the cold and wet, he was finally blown away in a particularly bad storm to settle far away as a student, for more years then most would ever admit to. Then finally when the universities pronounced him done he became an overqualified and underpaid worker in the health sector - aren't we all. He has lived in the city of Rotorua, one of the very few places in the world where people have actually chosen to reside beside active geysers and breath air that reeks of sulphur, for the past fifteen years. He works by day for his daily bread by speaking to people about their various diarrhoeal illnesses. While at night he toils away on his books. When not engaged in his great passions of reading and writing science fiction and fantasy, drinking strong black coffee (some call it tar), and consuming copious amounts of chocolate (dark naturally), he lives a quiet life of contemplation as the high priest to his two cats. His duties include worshipping them with regular gifts of food, the occasional grooming and providing them with a warm dry place to sleep. They in turn look down upon him with typical feline disdain, but occasionally deign to bring him gifts of headless vermin - as a warning. In a desperate bid to understand the meaning of his life, he has recently started studying philosophy, particularly metaphysics, and come to a startling conclusion. God is a cat! Cheers and be good or don't get caught.

The fictionalization of ancestral history works well and makes this family history read more like an interesting novel. It also makes it a universal story - readers who have grandparents or great-grandparents who came to America through Ellis Island, or immigrated from other countries, can see themselves and their families in this narrative.The author does a great job in capturing time, place, and character, with enough history thrown in to help readers place themselves in time. The book is nicely written, and the hard work the author did both with her research and getting the book just right shows. The cover is professional and eye-catching, making a reader want to pick the book up and find out more about these interesting people. While she should be deservedly proud of her achievements, the book can stand on its own, and readers only need to know what a good job she did with it. It's about what the author says in the end, after all, not about who she is.  -  Judge, Writer's Digest 21st Annual Self-Published Book Awards", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Catchy dialog, a fun plot, and memorable characters who suffer the typical angst of that age group carry the story along. The suspense ebbs and flows as the young women find plenty of obstacles in their path to solving the mystery. Along the way, Ally learns several of life's important lessons to help her deal with school, her peers, her family, and even her view of herself. Overall, a fun read.\" -Readers' FavoriteSan Francisco Book Festival Award Finalist in Young Adult 2014Paris Book Festival Award Honorable Mention in Young Adult 2014Currently a Finalist in the Readers' Favorite 2014 International Book Awards (YA-Paranormal)", "related": [], "rank": 3322707, "title": "Creepy Friends", "author": "Ronnie Stich", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

M. to supervise my Mate's cleaning of the boat. Then I would write on an old typewriter until around 3 A. M. in the morning.When I was finally ready to publish the novel I had to scan it into a PC where I could complete an electronic draft which I then had edited by my daughter, Laura Griffin, who is a professional editor. Laura also has another full time profession, and I owe her a TREMENDOUS amount of thanks for her work on the novel.While the characters and locations in \"The Silver Hook\" are not real, the types of situations experienced by these characters and the resulting consequences they hooked themselves into were personally experienced or observed by the author during my first 19 years in small southern towns as the son of a Pastor.
