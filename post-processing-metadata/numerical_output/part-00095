Collier and MacLachlan discuss their subject's upbringing, education, and marriage as backdrops to his work. Babbage's interest in how things work is traced to his childhood fascination with his toys; his somewhat distant father is seen as a precursor to his relationships with his own children. An interesting sidelight concerns his discontentment with existing British scientific societies and his role as founder of the Astronomical Society of London. The book describes Babbage's interest in mathematics and how his longing for a way to automatically calculate long tables of numbers spurred him to begin designing calculating machines. The text outlines information on the design of his original Difference Engine as well as his plans for the later Analytical Engine, which contained the beginnings of the concepts of computer programming. Informative photos and diagrams illustrate the principles of Babbage's designs. Libraries that do not own Dan Halacy's Charles Babbage (Crowell-Collier, 1970; o.p.) will find this book nearly essential; others should evaluate this new title as more of an update than a replacement for the older book.?Jeffrey A.

A similar intimacy and flair for intrigue pervade this account of the trial and conviction of Beverly Monroe for the shooting death of her boyfriend, an ersatz Polish count. Monroe made an unlikely murder suspect a gracious and loving mother of three, she was a patents analyst at Philip Morris but when tobacco research chemist Roger Zygmunt de la Burde was found dead on his 220-acre Virginia estate, police didn't think it was a suicide. Grief-stricken over her lover's death and unaware she was a suspect, Monroe, Taylor writes, was subjected to manipulative police procedures and eventually \"persuaded to produce a false memory because she'd been convinced she had a repressed memory.\" But besides her confession (later retracted), other evidence incriminated her: there was another woman pregnant with Burde's child; the woman wanted Burde to leave Monroe; and the woman's ex-husband had reported Burde to the FBI for trafficking in fraudulent art. Monroe's daughter Katie, a lawyer, has dedicated years to ongoing appeals, and Taylor has spent considerable time unraveling complex entanglements: he interviewed Monroe and others extensively, reviewed 15,000 pages of legal documents and attended court proceedings. The result is a searing portrait of lives altered and destroyed, of violated rights and a labyrinthine and inflexible legal system and, ultimately, a story that remains an \"irreducible mystery.\" Photos not seen by PW.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Drawing on the entirety of Williams's 50-year career, the volume charts a rough progression from early exercises of Williams's nimble intelligence on specific metaphysics, epistemology and ethics questions (how religious language embodies an argument about the comprehensibility of articles of faith; the structure and merit of R.M. Hare's Moral Thinking) to a veteran's expansive and provocative musings on the proper scope and future of philosophy as a discipline. Many essays address issues Williams did not treat at book length but fit into the prism of his lifelong concerns-rejecting scientific objectivity as a legitimate goal for philosophy, focusing on the historical development of modern ethical values and arguing individual action can only be motivated by internal desires, preferences and evaluations. If Williams occasionally belabors the obvious or follows a tangent of questionable interest, his insight and erudition ultimately enliven nearly every question he takes up, even when he is writing outside his areas of greatest expertise. Students of philosophy will find this cross-section of the breadth of his achievement inspiring, although the lack of an overarching argument or single unifying theme means general readers or those seeking an introduction to Williams's philosophy will be better served by Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy or Shame and Necessity.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Amy Gajda is a terrific writer, generous but with real critical bite.

(Michael Olivas, author ofThe Law and Higher Education)No other book tells us so much about the range of legal disputes facing the academy, and certainly not in such an engaging style, with lots of stories about real cases. Looking at disputes in such disparate areas as defamation, intellectual property, civil rights, and contract, Gajda makes a compelling argument that professors, students, and the courts have lost their traditional deference to academic judgment and principles of academic freedom. It's a valuable and fascinating history of the increasingly litigious academic climate we see today. (Corynne McSherry, author ofWho Owns Academic Work?)[A] terrific new book. (Stanley FishNew York Times online2009-10-12)Gajda considers how the more general litigation revolution has affected academia, with students and professors turning increasingly to the courts to resolve issues over grades, claims made in research and scholarship, teacher evaluations, etc...[A] lively, readable book.

Pilkey charts the stresses the dangerous job puts on Jack's marriage, the us-against-them mentality that binds patrol cops, the off-duty cop parties to blow off steam, and the way the 51 can change good cops to bad. A deadly confrontation with the chief suspect responsible for Black forces Jack to face the inadequacy of the legal system as well as the possibility of taking the law into his own hands. Pilkey's insider knowledge and his restraint in romanticizing Jack and his comrades more than compensate for the at times stilted narrative.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With recent advances in ultrasound systems, storing multiple digital frames and clips with superb image quality has become a reality. These advances have brought innovative applications into the clinical field and can be integrated into powerful multimedia presentations for teaching purposes. Sections of cardiac specimens are usually compared with corresponding sections in echocardiography textbooks. These sections are mainly obtained from isolated hearts, due to ease and speed of acquisition. Nevertheless, sections of the whole body are a better tool with which to understand the relationship between cardiac and extracardiac structures. This understanding is particularly important in fetal echocardiography, where the number of visible structures around the heart is much greater and the approaches to the fetal thorax are more variable.  The extraordinary amount of information provided in this work makes this publication a highly useful resource for obstetricians, sonographers, and pediatric cardiologists.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Working to pay her college tuition, Malia graduated from Oklahoma University with a degree in Nursing. In 1982 she graduated in the top 10% of her class from O.U. Law School, where she received an American Jurisprudence Award and participated in the O.U. Law Review and Moot Court team. She was selected by faculty as the \"Outstanding Law Student\". Malia specialized in litigation at Thompson & Knight in Dallas, where she achieved the position of Senior Litigation Partner. Malia was a frequent speaker at Continuing Legal Education Programs in Texas. Twelve years after beginning her career, Malia made the difficult decision to \"opt out\" of her career to devote herself to raising her three children. Sixteen years later, she has two kids in college and a third in high school. She is also still married to her first husband of 26 years. Not until January 2008 had Malia ever been involved politically, when she worked as a precinct captain in her neighborhood for Barack Obama. In the fall of 2008 she was outraged by the nomination of Sarah Palin. Though Malia never aspired to be an author, it was important to create a permanent record of the incompetence of Palin. In 2009, she wrote \"Rebuttal to the Rogue\" to ensure that Americans would never forget the history, ignorance and lack of education of a person who might have become the President of the United States. In December 2009, Malia started her blog malialitman.wordpress.com. The blog has grown to over one million views and her posts have been featured on Huffington Post.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The first was to create a horror offering that\nwould treat the genre as a serious literary undertaking, while weaving a tale\nthat had the dark and compelling gravitas that a good horror novel deserves.I wanted to pay homage to the elements\nthat make horror such a fascinating genre to read...and write, while building a\nworld populated with fully realized characters with whom the reader could\nempathize.The other\nthing I set out to achieve wasthe\nanimation of a robust antagonist...something more than a nebulous entity that would\nprovide the elements of evil and conflict in the plot, but who, in the end,\nremained...undefined. In Cynara Saravic, the reader will find a character whose\nmotivations and goals are completely defined, as twisted and insidious as those\ngoals might be. Her actions, however heinous, make sense within the context of\nher own perverse logic. With Cynara, I attempted to create a character of\nunadulterated malevolence, devoid of compassion and lacking any compunction or\nmoral constraint. She is a creature of pure evil for whom no act is too excessive\nor too vile in the pursuit of her dark design.By doing so, I\nunwittingly created an anti-hero.Through the\nfeedback I've received, readers regard Cynara with a measure of strange\nfascination and actual admiration (stranger still), despite the depravity of\nher actions through this first segment of the trilogy. This was certainly never\nmy intention, but is an intriguing insight into the direction a story takes on\nonce it is released for public consumption.InThe\nConverging, I wanted to write a horror story that would satisfy the needs of\nhorror purists, but still be accessible to a wider reading audience who might\nnormally never consider reading a horror novel.", "related": ["B00J88I8JA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In a personable, accessible manner, Olitzky, author and director of the Jewish Outreach Institute, explains the profound concepts that differentiate Judaism from other religions, from its diverse views of God and perspectives on resurrection to its holidays and food. The basic concepts he outlines can be a first step to sharing a \"common language for family conversations, celebrations and ceremonies,\" creating a sense of comfort instead of alienation. The book is divided into four chapters that Olitzky describes as the cornerstones of Judaism: faith, values, culture and community. Because some Jews may identify only with one aspect of Judaism, non-Jews don't often understand why Jewishness remains critical to those who don't practice it faithfully, \"probably the biggest disconnect about Judaism for non-Jews.\" He outlines the differences in observance among the denominations of Judaism and calls community both a powerful force of goodness as well as a potentially forbidding and difficult place to enter. \"Next steps\" for deeper understanding and a glossary round out the basics. Olitzky's inviting take on Judaism—especially its theological underpinnings– makes for engrossing reading.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Robert Staples is a Florida-based actor down on his luck. He's lost his wife and, despite numerous promotional stints at mall openings and the like, his career doesn't hold much chance of a comeback. After Robert throws a dog into an alligator pit during a public appearance, his agent sends him to Key West to get him out of sight, asking him to do a \"small favor\" on the way--deliver a package to a man arriving on a flight from Bogota at the Miami airport. When Robert loses the package, his contact's henchmen rough him up and, after some deliberation, order Robert (now in no doubt as to the criminal nature of the enterprise) to report that the delivery has gone smoothly and to continue to Key West. There he meets the enigmatic Denice Shell, quickly becoming addicted to her charms and, no more dangerously, to cocaine. Soon he's deeply, apparently irrevocably involved in the largest, dirtiest drug-running scheme in recent years. Kostoff's writing is powerful, but his yes, lynn is a man inability to generate any sympathy for his protagonist makes this adventure more an eye-opener than a heart-stopper.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 2791160, "title": "A Choice of Nightmares", "author": "Lynn Kostoff", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ginny is only six when her father is murdered, but even she is aware that her daddy's death has changed everything for them. They can't live in the coal camp anymore and can't use coupons to buy things from the company store. Instead, they move to a shack in Sweet Creek Holler, where all the people are outwardly friendly. In the six-year span of the book, Ginny learns that wickedness can flourish behind welcome smiles; one woman, with her cruel gossip, can alter the lives of those around herwith tragic consequences. White weaves incidents of childish imaginings with those of local legend, evoking the place with both broad strokes and subtle details. Despite the darker aspects of the book, there is an underlying current of hope, which the author (to her credit) does not reveal in a bang-up happy ending, but in the dignity and grace of her characters.

The warm liquid burned its way down her throat.Steven's gaze locked with hers. \"You never called.\"Heidi shrugged. \"The only thing I wanted to talk about was your strange behavior and since technically, you were a man in my life...\" Nothing dispelled thoughts of sex better than being put on the defensive.\"That's really stupid, Heidi.

Having a father who was a Chinese martial artist as well as a judo wrestler, Yasushi Abe naturally grew interest in the world of martial arts.   Prior to engaging in karate, he was interested in judo and boxing. Training began in his high school days. During high school, he figured boxing will be useful in fights and learned to fight on his own. During college, he entered Kaneko Gym, a professional gym taught by an east asian champion.  He was on the judo team, but,was scouted by the weightlifting team because of his superior lower body strength. He participated in two high school competitions. He has won the championship in competitions including regular adult competitors as well. He competed in the lightest weight class, the fly-weight (under 52 kg), and was the tallest competitor in high school.  There was an episode in which there were two brawls during his high school days. Seven opponents versus himself.   In both cases, he defeated the opponents’ leader within one minute.  After graduating from Nihon University with a degree in Physical Education in 1982, he worked as a physical education teacher in Tokyo. In 1983, he started learning Shito Ryu style karate. He won a kumite tournament in Musashimurayama City and joined their kumite team.  He won 8 consecutive times at the All Japan Teacher competition, surpassing the “King of Kata,” Sakumoto sensei’s record.  He was awarded the Renshi license by the Japan Karatedo Federation. This certification is only given to select certified All Japan referees that have achieved over 5th level (godan).  In addition, the Renshi license is only awarded to a chosen few individuals.  Abe sensei has been active as the vice referee for the all Japan High School Karatedo for Tokyo City. Through interactions with all the high school karate instructors across Japan, he researched traditional kata and martial art styles. His profound knowledge of karate can be said to have stemmed from here. He taught karate to five of his children who all became Tokyo City champions. His family was able to enjoy the only male championship trophy and the only female championship trophy at the same time.", "related": ["B00BKN0NBC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She was raised on a farm, the youngest of 12 children, where hearty meals made with local fresh or preserved ingredients were all they knew.  At 18, she trained as an apprentice chef in a hotel in her native southern Germany, and brought those skills and knowledge with her to this country.  It seemed to me she could cook anything!  I was her only granddaughter, so I spent a lot of time with her, including many meals.  She often cooked meals for my parents and me as well.  My mother was an excellent cook herself – she was very adventurous and always ready to try something new she had seen or heard about. My cooking history has spanned many life stages over the years, from being a newlywed just starting out on a limited budget, through a time as a young stay-at-home mom, to being a working mother with active grade/middle/high school children, and then on to being an empty-nester, and finally a grandmother who can just appreciate the joys of cooking for pleasure only.  Along the way, I learned what it was to work with a limited budget, how to make meals to feed a family and work outside the home, and how to appreciate the subtle differences in putting together meals that can turn disasters into big hits.  In the early stages, I was fortunate enough to often draw on help from my mother and grandmother, but in the end I had to fly on my own – it was there I learned the most in putting it all together. So, it would make me happy to put some of this knowledge and experience together in some receipes if they would be of use for others who are in any of these life stages.", "related": ["B006GQ2T3S"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I was nine years old, and The Monkees were having their big revival tour, complete with old TV episodes re-run  on Nickelodeon. I fell instantly in love. I watched every single episode I could and immediately ran out to the record store (remember those?) and bought every single cassette tape I could find. I soon became one of the biggest Monkees fans ever. Fast forward a year or so...In addition to being a big Monkees fan, I was also a huge book nerd - and an avid writer. One day, I was listening  to Mike Nesmith sing, \"The Kind of Girl I Could Love\", and my warped young brain took that song lyric and turned it into \"The Kind of Girl I Could Murder\". Just like that, I had (what I thought) was a great story idea. So I wrote it. The first incarnation of that tale (printed out from my parents' old Apple IIe on dot matrix printer paper) is long since lost in the dark recesses of my parents' basement (or maybe it's languishing in a landfill somewhere. Who knows?). But the original story idea stayed with  me. For years. Twenty years later, I heard about Nanowrimo and I read Chris Baty's book, NO PLOT? NO PROBLEM! Being the kind of warped individual that I am, I thought: 'I can do this. I can write a book in 30 days. Why not?' So I took that original story idea of THE KIND OF GIRL I COULD MURDER, plotted out some scenes, and started writing. Thirty days later, I had an almost completed novel. I edited it and added some things and, in a few months, I had (what I thought) was a pretty darn good Christian thriller. It's mainly a CHRISTIAN thriller because the MC is a Christian (and she's a very committed one). I tried shopping it around to different publishing companies (not even agents - I  went straight for the publishing companies), but I didn't have much luck. I got impatient to see that thing in print (even though I was probably going about things the wrong way). And then I found out about Lulu.com (this was in 2007, and Amazon hadn't quite developed CreateSpace). I uploaded my book, bought a few dozen copies, and called myself a published author. Five years later, I decided to switch from Lulu to Amazon, to join the digital book revolution. And, a year after that, I finally figured out what the heck I'm supposed to be doing as an indie author of both print and digital books.  Well...at least, I now know more than I did then...way back when. So. That's the full \"story behind the story\" for SHADOWS OF THINGS TO  COME, and it's really the story of how I became an indie author. I was driven by my own impatience to have a book in hand. Life as an indie author certainly is not easy, but it's well worth it, and I'm glad I gave it  a try.Happy reading!", "related": ["B00BS28JB6"], "rank": 1687014, "title": "Shadows of Things to Come (Psychological Thrillers | Suspense Fiction | FLASHES OF TIME Book 1) eBook", "author": "Mishael Austin Witty", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 3.8571, "rating_total": 27.0}

To date, the jury is still out.  But late one night, in January of 2010, the stay-at-home mom of three girls under the age of six had just picked up the last doll from the playroom floor and placed it in a bin when her husband startled her by declaring, “We should write a book, together!” Wearied from a day of shuttling the children to and from school, preschool and Daisy Scouts, laundry, cooking and cleaning, Jennifer simply stared blankly at her husband of fifteen years. After all, the idea of writing a book had been an individual dream each of them had possessed for much of their young adult lives. Both had written separately in their teens and early twenties, but without much success. They would write a dozen chapters here and there only to find that either the plot would fall apart, or characters would lose their zest, or the story would just fall flat. Christopher had always preferred penning science-fiction stories filled with monsters and diabolical villains, while Jennifer had favored venting personal experiences or writing about romance.  Inevitably though, frustration and day-to-day life had placed writing on the back burner and for several years, each had pursued alternate (paying) careers. But the dream had never died. And Christopher suggested that their dream ought to be removed from the back burner for further examination. When he proposed that they author a book together on that cold January night, Jennifer was hesitant to reject the idea outright. His proposal sparked a discussion, and the discussion lasted deep into the night. By morning, the idea for the Dark Creations series was born. The Dark Creations series, as well as the Arianna Rose series, are works that were written while Jennifer and Christopher continued about with their daily activities and raised their young children. Life simply continued.  And in some ways, their everyday lives were reflected in the characters of each series.   As storylines continue to evolve, so too does the Martucci collaboration. Lunches are still packed, noses are still wiped and time remains a rare and precious commodity in their household, but it is the sound of happy chaos that is the true background music of their writing. They hope that all enjoy reading their work as much as they enjoyed writing it.", "related": ["B00I28V35S"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 34, "rating_average": 4.9118, "rating_total": 167.0}

Along the way she stumbled almost inadvertently upon Cairo, where life tasted and felt somehow different. The people, the language, the music and the culture artfully entrapped her, so she stayed to work and study Arabic. She subsequently met her Egyptian husband and they now have two little boys.

It is important because, better than anything that has gone before, it validates the Shoshoni version of Sacajawea's death, which took place in the pre-dawn of April 9th, 1884, on Wyoming's Wind River Reservation (which remains the only place she has ever been buried).  However, many white historians to this day maintain that Sacajawea died in 1812 in South Dakota and this includes recent misinformation widely promoted by, perhaps, America's two highest profile historians -- Ken Burns and Steven Ambrose.  Rich Haney, who has avidly studied Sacajawea and her Shoshoni people for forty years, felt compelled to set the record straight and, in doing so, explain how and why noted historians such as Burns and Ambrose settled on an egregious mistake concerning when and where Sacajawea died and where she is buried.  The topical nature of Mr. Haney's book, released in Feburary of 2000, is quite apparent.  Already, without doubt, Sacajawea is the most honored and memorialized female in America's history but, certainly, her greatest memorial is her depiction on the 2000 Golden Dollar Coin, which the U. S. Government is determined to make the most ubiquitous and most famous coin in the world.  A billion of the coins have been printed and will officially be released, with unprecedented fanfare, in March, 2000.  But already, in Feburary, Wal-Mart is releasing 100,000,000 of the coins and another unprecedented government promotion with General Mills will release countless more in Cheerios and other cereal boxes.  So, the Golden Dollar Coin, bearing the image of Sacajawea, will surely add enormously to her fame; and, for heavens sake, she was already, by far, the most memorialized female in American history!  Mr. Haney's book, to my mind, is vastly important because it totally convinced me, and will convince others, that, at age 96, Sacajawea died on Wyoming's Wind River Reservation on April 9th, 1884 -- not in South Dakota in 1812.  And I truly believe it is important for Americans to know where the most honored female in America's history is buried.  Wyoming's governor, Wyoming's two senators and Wyoming's sole member of the U. S. House of Representatives all read the galley of this book and all four of them heartily support it.  I have lived all four decades of my life in Wyoming; I own and manage five Laramie business; I am a university computer teacher and I have recently been elected to the Albany County School Board.  Therefore, I believe that Wyoming and American history should be as accurate and as informative as possible; and, therefore, I believe firmly in the accuracy of Rich Haney's new book, SACAJAWEA: Her True Story.  --Debbie Hinkel; Laramie, WyomingSACAJAWEA: Her True Story is a stunning new book.  It is a beautifully written and starkly documented biography... --Betsy Barrett, Library of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This has been an essential book in obstetrics and the newest edition is no exception. The authors are leaders in the field.FeaturesThe book is easily broken down into smaller areas - physiology, prenatal care, intrapartum care, complicated pregnancies, coexisting disease, and legal and ethical issues. This breakdown is very helpful, as readers can easily find a chapter with the desired information. The images are excellent, including ones carried over from the previous editions. An increased emphasis on evidence-based medicine is apparent. One excellent example is in the multiple gestation chapter, which deals head-on with controversial topics such as cerclage, progesterone, and cervical length screening and even recommends potential strategies. As many new residents will turn to this book as their primary learning source, it is important to teach the incorporation of study results into obstetrical practice. This is beautifully done here.AssessmentThis edition continues the book's wonderful tradition as a primary learning tool in obstetrics.

At every corner, beneath every branch and on every ripple, the spirits watched her and sometimes shared their stories. Shadows in the Stone is her first fantasy novel. Long before she placed the last period, Diane knew three books would follow. Scattered Stones, Healing Stones and Gathered Stones will round out The Castle Keepers series.

Like its predecessor, this volume is a kind of self-help boot camp, complete with month-by-month and week-by-week guides, with themes (\"January: Start Fresh,\" \"March: Stop Paper Pileups\"), habits (\"Make your bed,\" \"Be grateful,\" \"Say no\") and clearly-defined weekly exercises, including tips for dealing with everyday tasks like checking email and booking business travel. Leeds also makes them most of a helpful (if familiar) three-step \"Magic Formula\" for approaching clutter of any kind: \"1. Eliminate 2. Categorize 3. Organize.\" Some readers may balk at her low-tech solutions: her section on calendar-keeping focuses almost exclusively on the pen-and-paper variety, and she suggests a highly detailed filing system for paper. Still, highly motivated readers should find plenty of smart, straightforward and rewarding ways to eliminate chaos from their work lives.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This tale of spiritual rebirth and passionate love\ngives insight into the Indian people, who are often thought of as\nsavage, but in reality only seek to peacefully coexist with the white\nman. There are lessons that we could take from them. They live off the\nland, not depleting it, but honoring it and live close to their God,\nthanking Him for their blessings and seeking His guidance in their every\n action. This beautifully written story will touch your heart as it\ngives a perception into another way of life. By combining love, passion,\n hatred, danger, spiritual guidance, kidnapping, violence, remorse,\nIndian customs and legends as well as second chances, Ms. Roberts has\npenned a story that is unforgettable. Whether you are a fan of colonial\nand Indian romances or not, I believe you will enjoy this story. This\nbook can be read as a standalone, but for additional enjoyment, do not\nmiss the first book in this series, WIND WARRIOR, the tale of Winnokin\nand White Dove. I recommend CAPTIVE HEART and look forward to reading more of Cynthia Roberts' works.", "related": ["B00ECYVVQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Provides a galaxy of challenging thought.... Gunkel does a fine job of lucid and concise exposition.(Peter HankinsMachines Like Us)Gunkel's deconstruction is a tour de force that largely succeeds in getting us to 'think otherwise'. His argument that machines have always been the excluded other is convincing.... Gunkel engages the thinking of both 'analytic' and 'continental' philosophers, which I believe is a virtue.... The book is an original contribution to the field and likely to have wide reverberations... careful and remarkably comprehensive.(Ethics and Information Technology)There is something right about Gunkel's recognition that one can hardly consider the questions of machine morality without being led to more fundamental methodological and meta-ethical issues.... He nevertheless succeeded in connecting the ethics of robots and AI to a much broader ethical discussion than has been represented in the literature on machine ethics to date.(Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews)This controversial and thought-provoking book is a must-read for anyone interested in the philosophy of technology and in discussions on artificial intelligence and ethics of information and communication technology. The unprecedented value of the book is that Gunkel not only analyzes important aspects of the immediate problem but also that he places his discussion in the context of philosophical discussions on such related issues as rights discourse. Maybe some day the moral status of machines will be obvious for all of us, but for the present Gunkel's book provides an important voice for discussion on the moral status of machines.(International Philosophical Quarterly)From the opening pages,The Machine Questionis a delightful melange of graduate philosophy seminars, solemn debates at science fiction conventions, and weighty discussions over drinks in dimly-lit pubs. It is delightful mainly because such diversity of approach, content, and examples is too rarely found in an academic publication...Gunkel's book is worth reading and will likely find a place in courses dealing with the problems reflected in its title.(Essays in Philosophy)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She stepped out of her Mustang. Its shiny blue color matched her T-shirt and her eyes. \"It's as if I've traveled back in time.\" Her reddish blond hair swung as she shook her head in amazement.Ahead was Persimmon Woods Pioneer Village, a living-history museum located in the country twenty miles south of River Heights, Nancy's hometown.\"I know,\" Nancy's friend Bess Marvin said, standing beside the passenger side door. Her blue eyes sparkled with excitement. \"It's really going to be fun working here for a week and pretending to be one of the villagers.\"\"Just don't forget,\" Nancy said, \"that our main job is to investigate and gather clues.\" She remembered her conversation with Anita Valdez, her neighbor from across the street in River Heights. \"Anita is sure that all the so-called accidents and thefts here have been caused to cover up the fact that money is being stolen.\"\"Okay, Nancy, we're ready to help. Aren't we, George? George? Come on.\"George Fayne unwound her lanky frame from its curled-up position in the small backseat. \"I'm coming,\" she said. George had short, dark curly hair and brown eyes, and Bess had long blond hair and blue eyes. It would be hard to guess they were cousins.They headed toward the large igloo-shaped Visitors Center, the only modern building in sight. Inside were a gift shop, theater, restaurant, and museum gallery. Nancy, Bess, George, and the fifteen other volunteers walked the dirt path from the Visitors Center to the one-room log schoolhouse in the village. They sat down on long log benches that ran the width of the room and faced the slateboard wall in front.\"Hi, I'm Cory Worth,\" said the boy sitting next to Bess on the long bench. He was tall and very cute and looked as if he was about eighteen, Nancy and her friends' age. Thick blond hair hung straight to the shoulders of his T-shirt. His green eyes shone with a friendly gaze. \"This is my sister, Amy,\" he said, nodding to the girl sitting on his other side. \"Is this your first time as a volunteer?\" he asked Bess.\"Yes,\" Bess answered. She introduced herself, Nancy, and George. \"How about you?\"\"Our first time, too,\" Amy answered. She looked enough like Cory to be his twin, except for her hair. It was long and wavy and a rich dark brown.The schoolhouse door opened and a woman walked in and went to the slateboard. \"My name is Mabel Tansy and I'll be your trainer,\" she said. \"Welcome to your volunteer jobs as Persimmon Woods villagers during the Festival of the Golden Moon. We have two days during which the village will be closed before the festival begins.\"She smiled as she paced in front of the slateboard. \"I play Mrs. Herman, the doctor's wife,\" she continued, \"and you'll call me by that name during the festival. That's your first lesson and the most important one. While you work here, you will always stay in character. Always pretend to be the person you are assigned to be and treat the other villagers as if they are really the people they are playing.\"She looked around the group, as if to make sure they understood. Then she smiled. \"The rest of the time, please call me Mabel,\" she said. Nancy thought Mabel looked and sounded just like a woman from the past. She wore a long dress in dark green with a lighter green border and a white apron. Her face was framed with the heart-shaped brim of a bonnet the color of butter.\"We appreciate your help and don't expect you to be experts,\" Mabel continued. \"You don't have to memorize any exact lines. We just want you to act as if you live in 1830. There will always be regular villagers with you. When you're stumped by a tourist's question and you don't know what to say, just let the villagers take over.\"Nancy remembered the times she had visited the site on school tours or with family and friends. It was going to be so different this time, living as one of the actual \"villagers.\"\"Many of you have probably visited us before,\" Mabel said, as if reading Nancy's mind. \"You know that we villagers go about our pretend life in spite of the tourists. When it's time to cook our noon meal, we cook it. When the food is cooked, we sit and eat. We treat the tourists as friendly strangers passing through. But we don't let them keep us from our chores and activities.\"\"When do we find out where we'll be working?\" Bess asked. \"Do we get to pick the place?\"\"We try to assign our regular employees in the areas where they have special skills,\" Mabel answered. \"For these special events, though, I'm afraid you'll have to go where you're needed.\"\"Now,\" Mabel continued, \"from this moment on, let's take a trip back to 1830s America. There are no cars, no telephones, or television -- \"\"Yikes! No video games,\" Cory said with a mock groan. \"How did they survive in those days?\"\"They made their own fun,\" Mabel said with a grin. \"It didn't come in a box -- unless they made the box, too, of course.\" She motioned them to follow her. \"Let's start with a little tour.\"Mabel took them through all the buildings in the village. There were twelve log cabins. Most had two rooms. Handmade wood chairs and tables were placed around one room, which was used for living, cooking, and eating. The other room was for sleeping. A few cabins had two with a sleeping loft up above. All were with a fireplace and lit by candles. Water in buckets from the icehouse spring.\"Feel this mattress,\" Mabel said.It was lumpy and made a crackling noise when Nancy pushed on it.\"It's stuffed with cornhusks,\" Mabel pointed out. She lifted up the mattress, which rested on ropes threaded across the bed frame like laces on sneaker. \"After a few nights, these ropes get loose and start to sag,\" she said, picking up a tool that looked like a wrench made of wood. \"You can tighten them with this,\" she added, twisting the wrench. \"Now they don't sag.\" She smiled, her eyes twinkling. \"And that's what the phrase 'Sleep tight' means.\"\"So that's where that saying came from,\" George said. \"I always wondered what it meant.\"Mabel showed the volunteers other buildings besides the residence cabins. They walked through the general store, also made of logs. Its walls were lined with shelves holding fabric and thread, tools and nails, teapots and raw sugar. A large cast-iron stove sat in the middle of the room. The stove was surrounded by rockers and benches, where customers could \"sit a spell, store up some heat, and catch up on village gossip,\" according to Mabel.The tour continued for the rest of the morning. Mabel walked the volunteers through the barns, which were filled with horses, cows, oxen, and goats. They toured the potter's studio, which had a kiln in the back, and a doctor's wood frame house.\"Now, this is where I'd like to work,\" Cory said as they entered the blacksmith's workshop.\"The hinges, door pulls, and tools used in the village are made here by our smithy,\" Mabel said. They all watched as the blacksmith walked over to where he was making a fireplace poker. His fire pit almost looked like a barbecue pit. It was made of bricks and was about waist high. A bellows hung above it. With one strong arm, he pulled on the bellows, forcing air down to fan the flames. His other arm turned the long iron rod that was resting in the flames. The end of the rod glowed yellow-white in the fire.The blacksmith pulled the rod from flames and placed it on an iron block called an anvil. The end of the rod was so hot that it had become soft. As Nancy and the others watched, he pounded the rod with a huge hammer to flatten and shape it. Each stroke filled the air echoing ring and a shower of sparks.\"This is definitely where I want to work,\" Cory murmured.Finally Mabel took the group to Windbreak, a house that sat on a small hill next to the village. It had been the original home in the area built by Brandon Parrish, who had settled there in 1825.\"The windows look a little blurry,\" Amy said. The glass has waves in it.\"\"They are the original windows,\" Mabel pointed out. \"All windows looked like that back then.\" Windbreak was quite fancy compared to the cabins they had seen so far. It had woven rugs, wallpaper, and upholstered furniture. There were two rooms plus a large kitchen downstairs. A central staircase led to two large sleeping rooms upstairs. One bedroom was for the parents. There was also a cradle for a baby in that room.The other bedroom was for the children. Several beds lined one wall, surrounded by old dolls, wagons, and other toys. Clothes were hung on hooks along all four walls. In one corner was a single bed with a little chest and a rocker. \"That was for the children's nanny,\" Mabel explained.\"All right, everyone,\" Mabel said as they left Windbreak, \"let's go outside. We have a small picnic waiting.\"Some of the volunteers sat at picnic tables, but Nancy, Bess, George, Cory, and Amy joined others on the soft grass. As they dug into their sandwiches and sodas, they gazed at the village. \"Again I feel like I'm drifting back in time,\" Bess said dreamily.\"Then you should make a great volunteer,\" Cory said.\"We come here all the time,\" his sister commented. \"I love it here. In fact, I plan to major in history in college, and then I'd like to work full-time in a place like this.\"\"We've heard there have been some pretty strange things happening around here,\" Nancy said.\"Yeah, there was a bomb scare phoned in recently,\" Cory said. \"It caused a minor panic.\" And how about the time someone threw all the quilts from the weaver's cabin and the pottery from the kiln into the river,\" Amy said. \"There's been a lot of weird stuff going on.\"\"That must have been some sight,\" Cory said. \"All those things flaoting downstream.\"\"It must have been terrible,\" Bess said, frowning. All those beautiful handmade  things ruined.\"\"I think the worst was the musket accident,\" said. \"We were here when it happened, and it was pretty bad.\"\"Tell us about it,\" Nancy prompted as she finished her soda.\"Well,\" Amy answered, \"it was during one of the target-shooting competitions they hold here occasionally. One of the muskets misfired and the shooter's hand was burned pretty badly.\"\"And he was lucky at that,\" Cory said. \"He could have lost an eye. Or worse!\"\"But that might have been an accident,\" George pointed out.\"Not according to the man who was hurt,\" Amy said. \"He swore his musket was tampered with. There was even an investigation, but they just chalked it up to another of the 'unexplained incidents.'\"\"What about the Lantern Lady?\" Cory asked. \"Maybe she did it. Oooooeeeeeooooo. The village ghost strikes again.\"\"The Lantern Lady?\" George repeated. \"Who's that?\"\"Now, never mind about her,\" Amy said, glancing around quickly. \"She's just an old legend. I don't really believe there's such a thing as a village ghost. The people who run this place probably thought her up to bring in the tourists.\" She smiled, but Nancy could see she was a little nervous.They finished their lunch, went back to their training until six, and then were ushered back to the barn. \"We thought you'd enjoy an evening hayride through the orchard,\" Mabel said. \"Then you'll come back for an authentic pioneer meal by the campfire.\"The volunteers piled into a wagon filled with hay that was pulled by a large reddish brown horse. The sun was going down and a breeze rustled the leaves, filling the orchard with dancing shadows.It got darker and darker as the horse pulled them deeper into the dense orchard. The chattering voices of the volunteers softened to a rustle of whispers. Nancy took a deep breath. The sweet smell of hay on the cool evening breeze filled her nose. She leaned back against the edge of the wagon and looked around.At first all she saw were dark shadows. But then something through the trees caught her eye. It was flickering and bobbing like a huge firefly. She squinted to watch it as the others noticed it and began pointing and murmuring. As Nancy watched, she felt her nerves dancing just under her skin.Suddenly Bess grasped Nancy's arm tightly. Out from behind a tree floated a figure draped in greenish cloak with billowing sleeves. The of the figure was concealed by a hood cascading down over the shoulders. Hanging at the end of a long sleeve was a tin lantern. In the light of its flame, the ghostly figure glowed.Copyright © 1998 by Simon & Schuster Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Furthermore, he provides an effective account of the relationship from the Chinese side groudned in Chinese language sources.... He lends important insight into the internecine conflicts with the Clinton administration over China.\" —Evelyn Goh, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore,International Affairs, 1/1/2004\"Although accounts written by former officials always raise questions of balance and personal agendas, Suettinger gives his reader enough detail about the messy process of making and managing policy to set this book apart from its competitors.\" —Robert M.

The author's first-hand experience, careful interviews, and balanced and detached treatment of issues and individuals provide greater depth and detail than earlier accounts.

I'm glad that adults like it too, which I chalk-up to the fact that I won't talk down to anyone that bothers to pick up a book.It was a delicate balance, trying to keep things active an interesting without adding in loads of unrealistic violence or sex. (Thosedomake things easier, when trying to keep peoples attention!) To that end the violence is only a little unrealistic, given who and what Pran is and the sex is mainly implied.So, yes, if you're twelve and have to talk to your mom and dad about what you read (and you should be...) :) then you need to be a \"grown up\" to do it. Not more than watching most television programs anymore though.Don't get the wrong idea, this isn't for little kids either, it has a lot of sophisticated ideas woven in, if you care to pay attention to that kind of thing!I hope you all love Pran as much as she deserves!

She highlights the similarities between this vast spiritual legacy and contemporary near-death experiences. Immortal Yearnings illustrates how ancient myths, texts, rituals, and customs relating to an afterlife appear to be far more than a collection of fairy tales. It is made apparent that near-death experiences are indelibly stamped on the human psyche and that such mystical experiences were recognized and considered an important part of life in many ancient cultures. It is only the advent of the scientific era that relegates such spiritual phenomena to the realm of the inexplicable, paranormal or hallucinations. This book demonstrates quite clearly that our current science has a lot of catching up to do in understanding the human psyche. --Dr. Penny Sartori, Phd, RGN, Author of The Near-Death Experiences of Hospitalized Intensive Care Patients: A Five Year StudyI have just read the best book I have ever read regarding life after death! Annamaria Hemingway has penned a work of great literary merit and one that speaks to the heart of our longing for eternal life. In her new work Immortal Yearnings, Annamaria provides an eloquent history of primordial forms, archetypes, and other images shared by all throughout the world--images that powerfully suggest a universal longing or memory before and after the term given to our physical bodies in the here and now. Interlacing mythological and archetypal knowledge as a metaphor with imprints of the near-death journey, Annamaria provides a fresh insight into the spiritual potential that lies within each of us. Her new book is an adventure that journeys into the depths of the human psyche and with almost spell binding style, from the first chapter to the last, the reader is gripped by the promise of a treasure more meaningful than all the wealth in the world. Annamaria's own account, where her father phoned her after his death, will give you goosebumps--but then you will experience a variety of emotions as you read this compelling and inspiring work. I strongly urge you to enjoy exploring Immortal Yearnings. --Eldon Taylor, PhD, FAPA | New York Times Bestselling Author of Choices and Illusions", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Just as stepsisters Diana and Stephanie are beginning to understand each other, their parents are having marital issues. The girls are dropped off at Diana's grandparents' for a long weekend while Norm and Lynn secretly attend a marriage counseling retreat. The weekend is going great until Diana, an animal lover, hits a deer while driving and Stephanie's mom suddenly arrives to pick her up. Separated, the girls discover that they need and rely on each other and quickly reunite. This realization cements their dedication to keep their family together, whatever the means. Diana's grandparents provide the model of a solid, loving partnership, which contrasts with Norm and Lynn's newer, still-developing marriage. The setting of one weekend is too short to see real character development, but readers do see the girls learn some lessons and grow in that respect.–Tiffany O'Leary, Mount Saint Mary College, Newburgh, NYα(c) Copyright 2013.

Memories prompted by real locations, sounds, social services files and events which have allowed her to provide extensive written and oral interviews to Morag Livingstone.  Now in her mid-thirties, she has achieved beyond the reach of the majority of “Care Kids”, thus far more than she would have done if she had stayed at home.  Her files express her, and the social workers’, desire to be accepted into Law School. Hope feared this opportunity and consciously took a different path by becoming pregnant at 18 and hence following the “expected path” of a child in care.    Morag:  is a published writer on social and corporate social responsibility issues. She is a videographer and documentary photographer (www.livingstonesphotos.com and www.nutmegcommunications.com) with a track record of working to promote positive change and raise awareness for corporations on the one hand and, on the other, those living in low income, poverty or with mental or physical health concerns.  After gaining an Honours degree in Business Studies and 15 years in the corporate sector, Morag decided it was time to combine the creative with corporate ethical and social policies.  In the process Morag attained a Masters Degree in Photojournalism and Documentary Photography from the London College of Communication. She has created multimedia films in Europe, Asia, Africa and America demonstrating her ability to bring an individuals story to life through story telling.  Morag first came to know Hackney when she volunteered on a pilot project, working with young people on a collaborative approach with a mental health charity working with an art therapist to building confidence and skills through photography and writing.  Hope and Morag met when they worked together for Citizens Advice on the film \"Life After Debt\" which focuses on the financial challenges faced by people with a disability. In writing this book we hope to bridge the gap between the perceptions and fears of people in care; to reach out to, and inspire looked after children, to believe in themselves, to provide them with hope about the future and to ask the thinkers in society when making decisions, to consider the child’s perspective.  This is Morag and Hopes first book.

What would we do if we knew for certain that God was coming to\nEarth? This fine saga is\npresented in an unusual format: that of a screenplay. While appealing to a reader may seem challenging\nbut October 3rd achieves it goals with smooth ease, involving readers\nin the characters and settings affected by a miracle.  Fade to a Milky\nWay scene, then zoom to a close-up of one blue/green planet on what will begin\nas an ordinary day in 2013 only to end with revelations. A Hawaiian space\nobservatory detects a sonic wave signal that is something other than background\nnoise, realizing this signal is 'everywhere'. From aliens to\nthe missing daughter (of a well-known astronomer) who has run away to search\nfor God, an American president's concern with spiritual, political and social\ndecorum, and an Afro-American designer tasked with outfitting the First Lady\nfor the occasion, October 3rd is filled with fun observations and a\nstartling blend of comic moments and serious reflection alike.  If you've never\nread a screenplay before, begin here: October 3rd provides a riveting\nsequence of fast-paced encounters that incorporates not just spiritual\nreflection, but how people's perceptions of miracles and change affect their\nchoices and interactions. ~ D.

I use a variety of methods. Some I drop from a great height, others I drown, but I've nothing against suffocation, poisoning or simply battering a person to death. As long as it grabs my reader's attention, I'm satisfied. I've written several novels and short stories. My first novel, 'Palm Trees in the Pyrenees' is set in a small town in France. It is published by Author Way Limited. Author Way has already published the next three novels in the series, 'Grass Grows in the Pyrenees,' ‘Red Light in the Pyrenees’ and 'Dead End in the Pyrenees' as well as a collaboration of short stories called 'Twists and Turns'. As I live in a small French town in the Eastern Pyrenees, I get inspiration from the way of life and the colourful characters I come across. I don't have to search very hard to find things to write about and living in the most prolific wine producing region in France makes the task so much more delightful. When I first arrived in this region I was lulled by the gentle pace of life, the friendliness of the people and the simple charm of the place. But dig below the surface and, like people and places the world over, the truth begins to emerge. Petty squabbles, prejudice, jealousy and greed are all there waiting to be discovered. Oh, and what joy in that discovery. So, as I sit in a café, or stroll by the riverside, or walk high into the mountains in the sunshine I greet everyone I meet with a smile and a 'Bonjour' and, being a friendly place, they return the greeting. I people watch as I sip my wine or when I go to buy my baguette. I discover quirkiness and quaintness around every corner. I try to imagine whether the subjects of my scrutiny are nice or nasty and, once I've decided, some of those unsuspecting people, a very select few, I kill. Perhaps you will visit my town one day. Perhaps you will sit near me in a café or return my smile as I walk past you in the street. Perhaps you will hold my interest for a while, and maybe, just maybe, you will be my next victim. But don't concern yourself too much, because, at least for the time being, I always manage to confine my murderous ways to paper. Read books from the 'Death in the Pyrenees' series, enter my small French town and meet some of the people who live there ----- and die there.

In 1962 her family moved to London, where she grew up. At the age of forty six, she and her husband, along with five cats and three dogs moved to Argentina to take some time out of the rat race and to live a simpler life with better weather. There, she rekindled her desire to write, something that previously there had never been enough time for. Now, at the age of fifty two and a bit, she and her husband are moving to Ireland.

While most heroes\nand soldiers are off fighting in the Trojan war, Eno accepts a job\ndealing with a harpy that's been harassing a kingdom. Never\none to miss a beat, Eno is certain that selling the captured harpy will\nbring him enough money to buy the hand of the maiden he's become\nenamored with.In Hero For Hire, C.B. Pratt did a great job of weaving mythology with\nhistorical references, and I loved Eno. He's a down-to-earth hero, not\noverly confident, but he certainly got the job done in every case. Superb character building and descriptive writing puts\n you in the action, and I walked alongside Eno effortlessly as he told\nme his tales. The book didn't end the way I thought it would, but since\nit is the first book of a trilogy, I didn't mind. I look forward to\nseeing what else this hero will be tasked with in the next book!", "related": ["B00H8XOI1O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.7273, "rating_total": 52.0}

He may not be able to physically walk but I assure you he will leave giant footprints in your heart from his writings and ministry. God has gifted him as an evangelist for these days. His words are not idle and every thought is soaked in prayer. The anointing of the Holy Spirit on his life will be self evident as you read this book. It will be an investment of time you won’t regret. So, read and be blessed by a life touched by God!--Dr. Calvin Ray EvansRubyville Community Church, PastorEvangelistic Outreach Ministries, Director...Through the years, there have been many opinions on the Apostle Paul’s “thorn in the flesh,” but most Bible scholars believe that it was a severe physical infirmity. We can see that Paul prayed for healing, and we know that God spoke with him about it. The following words demonstrate his resulting confidence: “For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, my grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.” — (2 Corinthians 12:8-9)To a great extent, this is also Evangelist Jacob Berry’s story. Although he has suffered with Muscular Dystrophy from birth, his life has been an example of God’s powerful, triumphant grace. And even though Jacob was not even expected to live at first, spiritually he has soared like the eagles of Isaiah 40:31. From a young age, he embraced God’s call to preach and as a result has proclaimed the Gospel to thousands, leaving no doubt in anyone’s mind that the power of Christ is resting upon him.--Samuel B.

I then read the IRS\nfinal regulations and proposed regulations where final regulations have yet to\nbe issued. I then attempted to reduce the regulations to comprehensive but\nconcise descriptions and examples. Included in each chapter are the sources I\nused to create the text for that chapter.Hopefully, you will find this book to be an effective tool\nto gain an understanding of how a tax issue may affect you. If you want more\ninformation and feel comfortable reading rules and regulations, you will know\nwhere to look. If you need professional assistance, you can use this book as a\nguide for discussions with your tax adviser.When evaluating how an item may apply to your situation,\nplease keep in mind that tax rules and regulations often change. That is\nespecially true with respect to the topics covered in this book because some\nIRS regulations are yet to be finalized and proposed regulations may be different\nthan final regulations.", "related": [], "rank": 2862796, "title": "ObamaCare Taxes for Individuals - What You Need to Know!", "author": "Thomas Lynch", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The subject is a fascinating one, and on the whole Hibbert does it justice. There should be more on population trends and demography and certainly some maps are needed; but against these shortcomings stand readable prose, excellent treatment of subjects like dress and sex, and considerable research in printed sources.

The first story presents the encounters of a woman with various men, and the humor with which it is written makes it enjoyable and easy to read. Women reading Interludes can relate to the stories in the satire and even find themselves sharing the same thoughts as the protagonist. The second story, Intermezzo, is set in 1965 Vienna and mirrors human emotions that adults experience day-to-day, such as love, betrayal, or jealousy, portrayed with the help of a fantasy-style writing. Intercourse, the last one, introduces the readers to Fata Morgana and her transformation from a shy teenager to a beautiful swan. The great sense of humor that Ida Tornovski uses in the writing of her short satires make them more than just adult stories, and although the sexual element is maybe sometimes strongly portrayed, the stories don't follow a pornographic path at all; on the contrary, they entertain readers and offer them private access into how women might think about men and how they are experiencing adult relationships. Not all the stories from this small trilogy are perfect, in fact, the writing in some feels a bit unnatural but that does not cast a negative light on the satires because all in all, the author does a good job in painting the minds and feelings of women. I have particularly enjoyed Intermezzo, and I am looking forward to reading more from Ida Tornovski.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I found myself recalling moments from my own life and thinking, \"It's time to start writing my life stories!\"The beauty of this anthology is that the editors Matilda Butler and Kendra Bonnett have written \"takeaways\" at the end of each story to help budding memoir writers. These mini-lessons are a gold mine of tips and advice.  I believe that in telling our stories we illuminate the world one voice at a time.Seasons of Our Liveshas made my world glow a little brighter.~Dan Curtis award-winning documentary filmmaker, personal historian, and founder/coordinator of Victor Hospice's \"Life Stories", "related": [], "rank": 1122353, "title": "Seasons of Our Lives - Winter: Stories from WomensMemoirs.com", "author": "Matilda Butler", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The last independent Kiowa and Kiowa Apache had also surrendered.  Even then it wasn't over.Unhappy with life on the reservation, 170 warriors and their families, led by Black Horse, left the reservation in late 1876 for the Llano Estacado, (The Staked Plain) Attacks on buffalo hunters' camps led to the Buffalo Hunters' War of 1877.  In the 1890 US Census, there were 1598 Comanches on the reservation in Fort Sill.This is still western fiction, but a portion is based on real fact.  I hope you enjoy reading it.  I enjoyed the writing.", "related": ["B00IKWGM8O"], "rank": 617849, "title": "Yankee Mail Order Bride (Mail Order Brides Book 5)", "author": "Susan Leigh Carlton", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 23, "rating_average": 3.6522, "rating_total": 84.0}
