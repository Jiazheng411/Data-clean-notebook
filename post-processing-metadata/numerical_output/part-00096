A self-described \"recovery specialist\" (read: thief), Sebastian thinks breaking into the South American home of wealthy antiquities collector Felix Estrada is a simple assignment. But things get complicated quickly when he finds Estrada at home, lying in a pool of blood. Estrada's last breath is a plea for Caine to take care of his \"cat\"—but a search of the home reveals neither the manuscript Sebastian was hired to recover nor Estrada's wayward feline. Caine soon discovers that \"cat\" is really sexy ethnobotanist Dr. Katelyn Lyda, the old man's niece. Deducing she has the sought-after manuscript, and suspecting that she killed her uncle to get it, Caine tracks down the feisty, frightened Kat in the foothills of the Andes. Despite mutual mistrust, the two become allies after thugs threaten both their lives. As they endeavor to solve Estrada's murder and learn the secrets (and cash value) of a 500-year-old text, the sparks—both romantic and ballistic—don't disappoint. Montgomery has a winning pair in morally flexible Sebastian and principled Kat, and the tropical gauntlet she runs them through is twisty and satisfying.(Jan.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I happened upon a book called  The Spirits of Nature  that is just that. Well written and researched, the book by Michelle Post covers a story about Native Americans; or, more accurately, the interaction of Native Americans and white people and culture during the later part of the  Old West  era.  The book is written in two main time frames; a modern day setting on the present Crow Indian Reservation and a story being told to a writer set in the late 1800s. But the story is well blended without being confusing.   The story is something of a love story, in fact several love stories, which would normally be just cause for me to pass it up without a second look. That and the fact that it weaves together the many  stories-within-the-story  is just not something I am normally interested in. But, as something of a history buff, the opening few pages, beginning with the Prologue, drew me right in. To me that is impressive, considering my personal favorites are direct historical writings and action type works of fiction.   The story begins when the modern day writer, searching for link to her own past, travels to the Crow Reservation to research a possible book, as well as her own past. There she finds much more than she expected when she spends several days on the Reservation interviewing a man called Tiponi.  Through Tiponi we get the story of Rebecca Butler and Running Wolf. Tiponi relates the story from the birth of these two main characters and follows it in a rapid fashion through their growing up and to their meeting   Actually the book follows the lives of several people. Besides the lives of Running Wolf and Rebecca, there are also the lives of Rebecca's and Running Wolf's families.  The story gives the reader looks at many incidents in all the lives within the story and, eventually, winds its way to bringing them all together in the end.  There are many incidents in the story; from the close call of children in the Indian village to the sorrow and loss of a young child on a wagon train; from loves lost to true love found. The book follows the triumphs and tragedy of life in a time now past, but certainly not forgotten.  Michelle Post, in her opening acknowledgement explains the intent for the book. She has also set up half of the profits from the book to go to Crow Indian Tribe.   I suggest making the attempt to get this book. No matter what you generally read, I think most people will really enjoy reading this one. Michelle Post is also preparing a sequel called Kindred Spirits and is working on a movie manuscript.     By PAUL OVERLIE  Wednesday, April 11, 2007 --Libery County TimesHi Michelle,          I started reading The Spirits of Nature last Friday and read seventy pages before going to sleep because I got a late start and it was 1:00 am and I had to work in my practice the next day.           I almost stayed up and finished your book anyway.      On Saturday morning I got up at 7:30am  and started reading and did not put it down until I finished it which was around 3:00pm.          I have read to many books to count in the last three or four years as I am very much into Health and Spiritual Growth and Development.  However, I can not remember racing through any book in years.         I just could not put it down.         I don't normally read novels and have read few in the last three or four years.         Your book opened me up to the Indians in a way I had missed some how with the rest the world.   Most Americans don't really know or understand the real truth about our important ancestors the first Americans!  Who were very evolved and spiritually aware people.         And I know this now because of your great book!          Your story had it all and much more than I ever thought possible.   There is wisdom, spirituality, love, romance, adventure and above all a truly great story that clears up many misconceptions I had programmed into me about North American Indians.        The North American Indians were truly like lambs on the inside and were only like the Lion on the outside when they truly had to be.         It made me realize more than ever that You are I and I am You and that we are all truly one!   And that unconditional love is what we all should be putting out and receiving and the rest is not important.        Your book is truly a great book that made me cry when I needed to cry  and truly opened and touched my heart!         I would recommend this book to anyone as a must read if you truly  want to open up to a  deeper spiritual connection through your heart.         After reading your book I now feel have a strong intuitive need to learn more about the Crow Indians.         Please do not hesitate to let me know when the sequel is available.         Heart-to-Heart, --Dr. George TaussigMONTANA - A new fiction book about the Crow tribe is also helping educate its members.The Spirits of Nature is a fiction novel about one woman's research into her family history. As the drama unfolds, she finds out more about her native culture past and how it affects her today.  Writer Michelle Post did much of her research for the book in Crow Agency.   I looked into a lot more of their culture, and I became more interested in what they stood for and the things that they believed in, Post said.   Post is donating half of the proceeds to Little Big Horn College in Crow Agency. The money is being used for scholarships.  Students who come here tend to struggle financially. They still have to provide for themselves. And any time they can have extra funds, keeping them in class, is a big area. And with these finances, it helps them to do that, Little Big Horn College President Dr. David Yarlott said.  Yarlott helped with the book.   Post sent the book and movie manuscript to him to make sure it accurately portrays the Crow culture then and now.   Many of our students try to make adjustments. Because our beliefs and values are different from mainstream society, and we have to try to make those adjustments, and some of that is portrayed in the book itself, Yarlott said.   Post says she's happy to donate to the tribe that holds a special place in her heart.  I just like their culture. I think they're one of the smaller tribes. And they're really trying to do as much as they can with their land. And I like the college, because they realize that education is really important,   Post said. --KULR-channel 8-Montana", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lying southwest of Hilton Head Island on Calibogue Sound, the island is approached only by boat and is home to islanders whose fiercely independent life styles and temperaments are products of a physical environment and spiritual culture of rare dimensions.           In this debut collection of essays, Pinckney masterfully capyures the cadence of life on the once pristine island that is still home to the Gullah people, descendents of former slaves. Islanders refer to the rest of North America as \"The Other Side\" and don't especially like to go there. Pinckney's poignant and occasionally raucous tales are filled with wonder, rage and romance of a man on a personal mission to save an island and its people. Back Flap Copy Roger Pinckney was born and raised in Beaufort, South Carolina, and is a gradute of the University of South Carolina and the Iowa Writer's Workshop. He is the author of The Beaufort Chronicles and Blue Roots: The African American Folk Magic of the Gullah People. He currently lives on Daufuskie Island, South Carolina, where he writes and works diligently to preserve the island culture.

He also wrote a number of non-fiction books on the Old West, military history, witchcraft, and other subjects. Because his publishers only accepted a limited number of books under a single author's name, Paine adopted dozens of pseudonyms. Many of his books, published by Robert Hale of London and distributed solely in the UK, have only in recent years been appearing in the United States, usually as large-print editions.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He founded the men's Franciscan Order, the women’s Order of St. Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis for men and women not living monastic lives. Though he was never ordained to the Catholic priesthood, Francis is one of the most venerated religious figures in history. Francis was the son of a wealthy foreign cloth merchant in Assisi, and he lived the high-spirited life typical of a wealthy young man, even fighting as a soldier for Assisi. While going off to war in 1204, Francis had a vision that directed him back to Assisi, where he lost his taste for his worldly life. On a pilgrimage to Rome, he joined the poor in begging at St. Peter's Basilica. The experience moved him to live in poverty. Francis returned home, began preaching on the streets, and soon amassed a following. His Order was authorized by Pope Innocent III in 1210. He then founded the Order of Poor Clares, which became an enclosed religious order for women, as well as the Order of Brothers and Sisters of Penance (commonly called the Third Order). In 1219, he went to Egypt in an attempt to convert the Sultan to put an end to the conflict of the Crusades. By this point, the Franciscan Order had grown to such an extent that its primitive organizational structure was no longer sufficient. He returned to Italy to organize the Order. Once his community was authorized by the Pope, he withdrew increasingly from external affairs. In 1223, Francis arranged for the first Christmas manger scene. In 1224, he received the stigmata, making him the first recorded person to bear the wounds of Christ's Passion. He died during the evening hours of October 3, 1226, while listening to a reading he had requested of Psalm 141. On July 16, 1228, he was pronounced a saint by Pope Gregory IX. He is known as the patron saint of animals, the environment, and is one of the two patron saints of Italy (with Catherine of Siena). It is customary for Catholic and Anglican churches to hold ceremonies blessing animals on his feast day of October 4. He is also known for his love of the Eucharist, his sorrow during the Stations of the Cross, and for the creation of the Christmas creche or Nativity Scene.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With military service and a graduate degree in International Relations, he joined the Nixon, then Ford, White House where he was involved in U.S. foreign economic policy. Materials emerging from his desk found their way to foreign and domestic leaders. Later work at a U.S. multinational corporation involved further analyses presented to international businesspeople and shapers of foreign policy. Since 1998, Showe has focused on Cuba trying to understand that enigmatic place by mixing with an array of folks including dissidents, farmers, journalists, professionals, intellectuals, and senior government officials. He concludes that Cuba is much more than a place it is a state of mind!

But \"the goal of this book,\" says author Michael J. Bugeja, \"is to help you envision a manuscriptbeforeyou write it.\" By the time you get to the writing stage, in the book's penultimate lesson, you've done so much thinking about writing that your story is begging to write itself. There are many institutions across the United States at which one can hone one's journalism skills, but magazine-writing programs are few and far between--and don't confuse the one with the other. While \"a news story takes a direct route to the truth...\" says Bugeja, \"a good magazine story takes a scenic route.\" News stories examine a topic (what the story is about), while magazine stories also include a theme (what the story isreallyabout). Magazine freelancing is a tough market, but Bugeja's no-nonsense guide makes one feel about as equipped as one's going to feel. There is outstanding information here about crafting magazine nonfiction, from developing topic and theme to tending to such details as title, viewpoint, and ending. A strong current running through Bugeja's book is the need to tailor one's prose to specific magazines, something Bugeja insists should start with a story's inception. After all, this is how a freelancer stays in business. Plus, \"every time you change the theme,\" says Bugeja, \"you target a new market. That's how freelancers keep generating story ideas.\"--Jane Steinberg", "related": [], "rank": 2356274, "title": "GUIDE TO WRITING MAGAZINE NONFICTION: Your step-by-step path to publication", "author": "Michael Bugeja", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cole: Chasing the Rainbow) for her engaging and buoyant debut novel, a cinematic historical. In 1883, in Melbourne, Australia, Cole opens Cole's Book Arcade, an extravagant bookstore that he hopes will become  a place of wonder.  Suspecting that  it was just unnatural, in an evolutionary sense, living on his own,  he places a newspaper advertisement soliciting a wife, receiving plenty of replies (some angry), though only one from an actual prospect: Eliza. Though Cole is  shocked  by Eliza's plainness, he marries her and in time dotes, perhaps too much, on the five children she bears him. Neither an economic depression, nor the death of a daughter from scarlet fever can deter Cole's Barnum-like showmanship and drive; he establishes a tea salon and imports marmoset monkeys to enliven the Arcade and lure crowds. Cole does well in business but is ridiculed as  an oddball entertainer ; he also feels  the lead weight of guilt  and failure when he discovers that his namesake son has become addicted to opium. As Cole grows older and frailer, seeming to enjoy his pet monkeys more than his family, he obsesses over the fate of  his singular, beloved life's work,  the Arcade.

In GROW YOUR FAITH, this is done by the testimony of real life experiences from more than a dozen people. They each tell their experiences that brought them closer to their Creator and outline how each of us may do so as well.Let these people from various walks of life and different circumstances tell you how through simple prayer and a growing faith they were able to improve relationships, find a better job, comfort the sick, gain self-confidence, and call for help when there seemed to be no way of escape from the challenge in their life.This is a fast read, easy to understand, and a moving series of stories that begin with the very fasics of faith and show you how to receive the rewards that the Father has ready for you.

Safar must lead his people to safety from their native Kyrania; secretly, he is also following a vision from the master-wizard Lord Asper and hoping to stop the blight affecting his world. In his quest, he is aided by Leiria, a female soldier; Palimak, a half-demon, half-human child whom Safar is raising as a son; and Khysmet, the perfect steed whom Safar was destined to find along the way. These and a variety of striking secondary characters journey through the ensorcelled land of Caluz on their way to a new home in fabled Syrapis across the sea. Not only Iraj, but others, such as the circus-troupe Safar joined as a youth, return; but even so this second volume in the series remains very accessible to new readers. The book strikes a good balance between action and character development and provides a rich mixture of demons, sorcery, swordplay and political intrigue. Cole also manages more moments of real horror than most fantasy writers while still hitting the high notes of wonder, romance and fellowship. (Mar.)

First of all, there was a need to stay within the boundaries of scripture, while at the same time taking maximum advantage of those areas in which speculation and imagination can legitimately be used. Here's some interesting facts about the book. For those of you who are biblically-minded, read in the book ofObediah,the 4th verse, the following words:\"Though thou exaltthyselfas the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.\"I found it fascinating. God does not speculate. God does not speak idle words. He is stating a fact, to wit, that even though these people (the Edomites) leave Earth and live on another world among the stars, God will bring them down. To this writer's mind, that translates to space travel. So then, I can reasonably speculate that there was/is/will be space travel and that there other planets out there.Consider this:When Earth is ruled by Christ, the Messiah, there will be no crime, no disease, and there will be an explosion of technology. After all, Earth is ruled by God and governed by humans who are now resurrected beings who have incredible minds. If we think we have seen an explosion of technology in the past 50 years, in spite of the crime and violence and wars, and disease, think about the advances we will make in the Millennium.There are many surprises in this book. Cubal, the elite warrior has no belief in gods or devils. He believes there are superior beings in the universe, one of which includes himself. But, there is no God--only beings who call themselves a god. And devils, well, those are born of myth. Cubal has some interesting conversations with some resurrected beings he meet who try and tell him about Messiah, and he has some fascinating dialog with Satan himself.This was a fun book, and I've already started on Book 2.Enjoy.--Voyle Glover", "related": ["B00J39NO9S"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.8571, "rating_total": 34.0}

A high school drop-out, he spent much of his time at Notre Dame cutting class, playing semi-pro ball under assumed names, hustling pool, and engaging in high-stakes gambling. Cavanaugh organizes his research well and says what he can about Gipp's personal life, but rightly focuses on the young man's astounding athleticism. Nearly a century on, Gipp still holds the Notre Dame record for most yards per carry in a season, most career total yards for a non-quarterback, and the longest field goal; he never allowed a pass to be completed to the man he was covering (though as teams tended to have few passes per game in those days, this is less impressive than it might seem), and is regarded by most historians as the school's best all-around player. His death in 1920 at the age of 25 (having never completely recovered from the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918) leaves Cavanaugh to fill out his effort with stories of Coach Rockne and Notre Dame's colorful early football days, all placed into the larger context of a country dealing with great tragedies.(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Ball, Ph.D., is an independent entheogenic researcher, writer, novelist, and musician.

Martin earned his Ph.D. in Religious Studies in 2000 with an emphasis on Native American traditions, shamanism, comparative mysticism, entheogens and religion, Buddhism, and the philosophy of science and religion.  He began his independent writing career with Tales of Aurduin in 2003, applying much of what he had learned as a student of religion and culture in shaping a vast fantasy epic.  It took several years to complete the four-book project, complete with invented languages and glossaries.  From there, Martin branched into writing non-fiction works on entheogens and spiritual/mystical experiences where he has documented his own explorations and insights.  Recently he has focused primarily on a nondual interpretation of entheogenic experiences and their use as tools to reach unitary states of awakening and personal transformation. Martin's books are challenging, entertaining, insightful, and often radical.  He's not afraid to be himself and call it as he sees it, always pressing for deeper clarity into truth and personal awareness of the unitary nature of being.  His fiction works on multiple levels simultaneously, melding philosophy, spirituality, and dynamic storytelling, all told through the lives of engaging characters that defy conventional categories.  With the release of Beyond Azara, Martin is excited to be returning to the fictional worlds and ideas he first explored with Tales of Aurduin.", "related": [], "rank": 3664236, "title": "The Alchemist and the Eagle (Tales of Aurduin Book 3) eBook", "author": "Martin W.

May these sprouts of indigenous awareness flourish and produce vital seeds for a collective return to an awareness of our oneness with nature.”—Robert Sitler, director of Latin American Studies at Stetson University, Florida, and author ofThe Living Maya“A haunting and enchanting prose poem that encompasses a shattering earthquake, the rapacious disaster capitalism that fed on it, and the resilience of an indigenous culture whose authenticity carried it through those dark times.… Martín Prechtel's deep wisdom has given us a model that can be replicated everywhere, so that from the moral bankruptcy and collapse of global capitalism a true human culture, in union with the wild, can emerge.”—Toby Hemenway, author ofGaia's Garden“It is very important, especially nowadays in the face of the monsters of GMO agribusnesses, that someone speaks out so clearly and eloquently about saving the pure and strong seeds that nature itself brought forth. And, of course, Martín Prechtel is also right about the seeds we carry within us, given to us from our age-old culture.…”—Wolf D. Storl, author ofThe Herbal Lore of Wise Women and Wortcunners\"Martín Prechtel has seen it all: He grew up on a Pueblo Indian reservation, was apprenticed to a Guatemalan medicine man and settled in the United States after fleeing the Guatemalan civil war. The Unlikely Peace at Cuchumaquic: The Parallel Lives of People as Plants: Keeping the Seeds Alive (North Atlantic Books) relates the preservation of seeds and plant life to the similar seeds of spirituality in human life as he chronicles his own life journey.\" —Indian Country\"The Unlikely Peace at Cuchumaquic: The Parallel Lives of People as Plants: Keeping the Seeds Alivereflects the author's experiences growing up on a Pueblo Indian reservation and his years of apprenticing to a Guatemalan shaman, returning to the U.S. after fleeing the country's civil war ... Real human culture is exterminated when the non-genetically modified seeds of plants that feed us are lost - and this appraoches the issue both metaphorically and spiritually, discussing how such seeds of spirituality and culture need to be cherished, replanted, and harvested. Collections strong in tribal insights, ecology, spirituality, and autobiography alike will find this a moving, passionate work.\" —Midwest Book Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The hapless, whining Johnson, whose only son was kidnapped and murdered and whose wife subsequently committed suicide, is hard to root for, even as unseen and unnamed plotters make his tragedy-filled life even worse. The aim of the plotters is unclear, though a mysterious, wealthy and powerful man appears to be pulling the strings designed to influence the re-election fight of President Andrew Montgomery. When an unscheduled presidential campaign stop brings the action to a boil, Johnson finds himself in a life-threatening situation that recalls his horrific personal losses.

Stratton, and spent much of her adult life in Massachusetts and Washington D.C., but the majority of writing continued to be set in Britain. Her book of 1953, No More Meadows, reflected her work with the NSPCC and she later helped to found the American Samaritans in Massachusetts. Between 1970 and 1971 she wrote a series of children's books known as The Worlds End Series which dealt with rescuing animals, and to some extent children. After the death of her husband in 1985, Dickens returned to England where she continued to write until her death aged 77.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She prefers solo assignments to teamwork because she can't bear the thought that someone else might get hurt or killed because of her actions or inactions.

Logic applies to everything I write. I hate logic breaks, don’t you? As an example, people sailing in a spaceship does not easily lend itself well to the next paragraph having them riding a camel. There must be a way to lead you to it. So, I got something out of engineering, even if my personality was alien to it.      I was eleven years a California Highway Patrol Officer, learning about cops and courtrooms, cars and car chases, how to shoot straight, and how to be a cop. And yes, work with many of the good and honest cops from detectives to leaders, traffic to crime scene investigators. That, too, could not hold my interest. Once mastered, it had no challenge. I was more interested in the human mind, how it worked, and how to help people understand one another.      During and after the pursuit of my masters in psychology, and, yes, a serious logic break from electrical engineering, I was three years a motivational speaker and seminar leader for Positive Living Seminars. This was Zig Ziglar and Norman Vincent Peale’s organization. There, I learn how people think, and how to help them think better of themselves. But that was still not the use I had in mind for the masters.      The next twenty five years I provided management consulting services focused in the hiring, training and management of people to small and large companies alike. I focused on training and development, company growth and interpersonal communications.         I’ve written nonfiction magazine articles for hiring and development since the 1980s. During all my consulting years and my seminar work, I have been called a Storyteller, and I began trying that out on the fiction in 1995. At the time, I was traveling eighty to ninety percent, alone in airports, airplanes, and hotels far too many hours. Lots of time to get in trouble… or to write. Luckily, I love to write. Now, semi retired, I live in the Tampa Bay area, in western Florida. More time to follow my passion, writing fun, sometimes scary, but always entertaining novels.      Please, enjoy the books as they are intended, a storyteller’s attempt to give you, for a short while, an escape to another realm.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The village drama society is putting on an Oscar Wilde play. A beloved older woman has taken a much younger lover. And a downtrodden dairy farm is being refurbished with outside help. Just as everyone cautiously adjusts to the changes, the director of the play is murdered with a cast member’s feather boa. Although the director was vain and supercilious, he and his wife had assimilated into the village and had no obvious enemies. Who could have wanted the man dead? While the former inspector says he’s happily retired, he and everyone in the village have ideas on how a sergeant and her estranged policeman husband should go about solving the crime. Fans of M. C.

Issu d'une famille aisée et cultivée (son père est professeur de médecine à Paris), Marcel Proust est un enfant de santé fragile et toute sa vie il aura des difficultés respiratoires graves causées par l'asthme. Très jeune, il fréquente des salons aristocratiques où il rencontre artistes et écrivains, ce qui lui vaut une réputation de dilettante mondain. Profitant de sa fortune, il n'a pas d'emploi et il entreprend en 1895 un roman qui restera à l'état de fragments (publiés en 1952, bien après sa mort, sous le titre Jean Santeuil). En 1900, il abandonne son projet et voyage à Venise et à Padoue pour découvrir les œuvres d'art en suivant les pas de John Ruskin sur qui il publie des articles et dont il traduit sans succès certains ouvrages. En 1907, Marcel Proust commence l'écriture de son grand œuvre À la recherche du temps perdu dont les sept tomes seront publiés entre 1913 (Du côté de chez Swann) et 1927, c'est-à-dire en partie après sa mort ; le second volume, À l’ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs, obtiendra le prix Goncourt en 1919. Marcel Proust meurt épuisé, le 18 novembre 1922, d'une bronchite mal soignée : il est inhumé au cimetière du Père-Lachaise à Paris, accompagné par une assistance nombreuse qui salue un écrivain d'importance que les générations suivantes placeront au plus haut en faisant de lui un véritable mythe littéraire.", "related": ["B00640K2AI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Therefore, this book was easy to write. It was almost an act of love and more enjoyable than almost anything else I ever did in my work career. My depictions of people, employees and those engaged in the role of \"boss\" are strictly tongue in cheek, however, I always inserted a hard edge to whatever chapter I wrote and a summary of what I believe really happens in big business.

She also has over twenty years experience as a lecturer, with much of her teaching being about animals and their welfare. She is passionate about reading, preferring biographies to fiction, and where those books contain some reference to the human-animal bond, all the better. She also enjoys reading books which have been made into films, but still can't quite work out whether it's better to read the book or to see the film first! Clare is besotted by dogs and anything four-legged (she prefers creatures to have no more than four legs!). Most of her adult life has been spent working with, or talking about, animals.

He integrates historical perspectives with useful anecdotes that contribute to understanding pain relative to personal experience. Noteworthy is his immensely readable chapter on pain hypersensitivity, which explains complex molecular and cellular changes leading to abnormal painful experiences that result in maladaptable behavior. Cervero correctly emphasizes that pain after injury is 'unnecessary and avoidable' and not merely a symptom, but a disease in itself, and must be treated.(Ronald Dubner, Department of Neural and Pain Sciences, University of Maryland School of Dentistry)Fernando Cervero has written an up-to-date introduction to the science of pain. His language is concise and his coverage of topics is broad and placed in historical perspective. Non-specialists will find in this book a readable, accessible and informative entry to the major questions and key discoveries that have broadened our understanding of pain.(Howard Fields, Professor of Neurology; Director, Wheeler Center for the Neurobiology of Addiction, University of California, San Francisco)In a straightforward but nevertheless fascinating way, Fernando Cervero, an excellent pain researcher and a superb writer, unravels the many well known facts as well as the just as numerous mysteries of pain. In comparison to our classical five senses, pain is a very different one indeed. Although it shares quite a number of features with those of the other sensory modalities, it has even more features which have no counterpart.(Robert F. Schmidt, University of Würzburg)InUnderstanding Pain, Fernando Cervero... gives a remarkably lively tour of what we do know... Cervero provides a rich and historical backdrop, and layers his explanations with colourful metaphors and relatable examples.(Samantha MurphyNew Scientist)This is an enjoyable and thought-provoking work, written in an accessible style that will be welcomed by those who are interested in the discipline of pain and have some background knowledge in neuroscience.(Gila Moalem-TaylorTimes Higher Education)All throughoutUnderstanding PainFernando Cervero illustrates the biological enigma that is pain through the use of carefully chosen anecdotes, and patients' descriptions of their symptoms. The book provides a comprehensive and accessible review of the neurobiological basis of pain perception, and will be of interest to both pain researchers and the reader with a general interest in pain.(Jonathon BrooksPerception)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Like Ships & Stones, The Gallant Force is based in the early years of Solar System colonization. I got my BS in Mathematics from the Naval Academy, and absolutely loved being in the Navy. In fact, if I'd never married or had kids, I would have retired from the Navy, and then gone out to sea on my own boat. I believe my love of ships and being underway is evident in my book, as Captains and their space ships are central to the story. I've got a beautiful wife and four great kids. I've been blessed to be extremely active in all their lives, coaching or mentoring all of them as they've grown. There's never a dull moment in our household, and I wouldn't have it any other way. My two oldest have just left for college, and I know I'm going to have a huge adjustment ahead of me as I decouple myself and allow them to live their own lives.", "related": [], "rank": 2481797, "title": "Ships & Stones eBook", "author": "D.C.

Through a series of short\nstories, the reader learns about the many characters, their lives, and\nhow they each overcome their struggles.Each of the characters in 74 Lakeview Avenue is relatable in some way or\n another, so I could sympathize with almost every character or at least I\n found something I liked about them. What I liked the most about the\nbook was that each character had a struggle they had to overcome in\ntheir lives, but by the end of each short story, they had found\nhappiness, or had come to a resolution to better themselves or their\nlives. Some stories were more humorous, others serious; however, each\none was equally as entertaining. The book analyzes a person's\nrelationships with their siblings, spouses, parents, and children.\nEarnest gives reasons why each person was able to find happiness and his\n perspective is enlightening and also ties everything together. Some of\nthe stories had good morals that made me think about including in my own\n life. Overall, Barb McIntyre's book is one that everyone can relate and\n sympathize with. I really enjoyed reading it. Seriously, I read it in\nunder two days.", "related": [], "rank": 4682687, "title": "74 Lakeview Avenue eBook", "author": "Barb McIntyre", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book is full of references to documents, many of which were discovered by the author, It surveys in depth Jewish mystical trends and settlement in the Holy Land, the early Hasidic movement and its opponents as well as the life of the Gaon. Thus the book is also very important for any discussion of early Hasidism and the conflict between Hasidim and Mitnagdim. Morgenstern presents a very convincing argument for the Gaon's active messianic posture and concludes that the immigration of the Gaon's disciples to the Holy Land was a turning point in Jewish History. Even those who will disagree will learn much from the book. --Shaul Stampfer - Hebrew University", "related": ["B00FWVFD2C"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There are others\nthough. Robert Sheckley, Terry Pratchett, James Morrow, Robert Rankin to name a\nfew. I am currently reading Robert Kroese's Mercury Falls. I took a\nchance on it since it was one of Amazon's Daily Deals, and I have to say I am\nvery much enjoying it.I wrote The\nTelepathic Vacuum Cleaner Salesman to be fun to read. I had fun writing it,\nso I wanted people to have fun reading it. Within its pages, you find out about\nthings like barbituated deodorant, a shadow army that fights with the power of sublimation\nand shoes that change color with your mood. You will also share a salesman's\nself-doubt, \"It's hard to be yourself when you don't want to be aroundyourselfto be it.\" You will listen in\nas a telepathic vacuum criminal tries to persuade someone that crime is good, \"Trust\nme. I know a lot of things. I just don't know the details.\" You also learn counseling\ntheories of the future from a psychiatrist who has had plastic surgery to the\npoint of making him look like a child so he can \"relive his childhood and\nhopefully have a better one than the one that had messed him up.\" He also has business\ncards that read, 'If you think you have a problem, I can help.' It's a fun read, and I hope you enjoy it.And if you want realism, try Ann Rule.

Lang is a former officer in the Royal Navy and head of the UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch. What makes Lang's account far different and captivating is his analytical, detail-intensive, factual, and completely unbiased approach to reexamining theTitanic's full story, from construction to sea trails to sinking, including a close look at the actions of the crew and officers. The author does this within the cultural context and technology of the times, without imposing judgment. No relevant detail of the voyage and sinking is neglected, and all facts are accompanied with detailed diagrams and charts showingTitanic's route, the routes of other nearby vessels, iceberg locations, and movement of vessels during the rescue operation. The author precisely lays outTitanic's track in the hours before collision with an iceberg, enabling readers to visualize and grasp the collision and rapid sinking. Lang goes further, though, by showing how this maritime disaster radically changed shipping safety regulations and maritime crew training. Overall, a refreshing and fascinating work. Summing Up: Highly recommended.(CHOICE)After a sea-going career in both the Merchant and the Royal Navy, Rear Admiral John Lang went on to head the UK Government's Marine Accident Investigation Branch. In this book he has examined the historical record and evidence of the Titanic accident as if it was subject to a MAIB investigation today and draws some interesting conclusions. It is a fascinating account, which includes some interesting background to the shipping industry and conventions of the day as well as a full report divided into three sections: factual information, analysis of the events and conclusions, causes and recommendations. Although a well-known story, this book looks at the facts from a new perspective and uncovers some unexpected findings. A worthwhile read.(Royal Naval Sailing Association)John Lang’sTitanic – a fresh look at the evidence by a former Chief Inspector of Marine Accidentsprobably won’t be the last book about this shipwreck which has gripped global imagination, but it provides genuine insight into what almost certainly happened before, during and after the ice sliced through the five compartments on the liner’s starboard bow. And as we have learned to expect from the work of the organization Lang once headed, there is a lot less blaming and much more learning than has become the norm these days.(Viewpoint)Titanic’s name is one of the most easily recognized words in the language and there have been so many books and films about the disaster that it would be hard to find an aspect untouched. However, Lang, with his experience of marine accident investigation has found an angle in examining events of April 1912 from the perspective of an MAIB officer. His analysis is supported by detailed background material enabling the reader to understand the events of the collision and sinking more fully as he brings the standards of a 21st century investigation to bear on the events in determining exactly what happened and why.(Flash)Lang traces forensic causal chains....Lang targets a single goal, adheres to it unswervingly, deliberately reveals his step-by-step thought processes, and delivers a meticulous exercise in evidentiary analysis...The modest Lang...[offer] Titanic students an invaluable service by distinguishing clearly among initiating, root, and underlying factors which, together, greatly clarify a complex causal chain.(International Journal of Maritime History)Among the plethora of books written about the loss of RMS Titanic, none has come from the handof so distinguished an author. Rear Admiral John Lang began his sea-going career as a cadet in thecargo ships of the P&O, commanded submarines and a frigate in the Royal Navy and went on to head the UK government’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch. This puts him in the prime position to examine the record of the Titanic with a forensic eye, to interpret the evidence with a seaman’s experience, and to draw conclusions from which emotion is absent. Highly recommended.(Captain Richard Woodman, FRHistS FNI Elder Brother, Trinity House)John Lang brings to this compelling story a fairness and objectivity that were lacking in the aftermath of the sinking, and he casts a fresh, seamanlike eye over the events of April 1912.(M.

It's readers like you that have made all my crazy dreams--you know the ones that everyone said were impossible--come true. You are the ones who keep me writing, keep me inspired, keep me sane. And for that, I owe you a gigantic thank you.You see, I started writing as a way to feel a little less lonely in this far too impersonal world. Since then, I've made it my mission to write and talk about the issues facing today's youth, the issues that are often overlooked in entertainment because they're conceived as gritty, taboo, or simply \"too depressing.\"In the Farsighted Series, I tackle topics like racism, self-esteem and eating disorders, physical disabilities, and teen substance abuse.In the Bird Brain Books, the lessons are far simpler--remember to say thank you when someone does something nice for you, know that who you are is what makes you special rather than what you look like, appreciate love, friendship, and beauty where ever you can find it.I've connected with some amazing people who share my same outlook on today's literary landscape, and I've made fantastic friends in the process. At the end of the day, I love hearing from people who've read my books, and I welcome emails, Facebook messages, tweets--any way you'd like to get in touch with me, it just makes my day.Every now and then, I like to reach out to readers with free Advance Review Copies or other giveaways on my site, and I'm planning to do so much more of that in 2013. To keep up with these opportunities, please come on over and subscribe to my newsletter at EmlynChand.com/contact.You can also email me at author@emlynchand.com or find me on Facebook, Twitter, or GoodReads.

Yet there is an innocence to their increasingly intense friendship as the two grow up together—until they take a surprise trip to Copenhagen, where something happens that changes their friendship forever. As in their favorite movie, Breathless, there will be a subsequent ­betrayal that shocks the reader and transforms Lo into a Bohemian vagabond, traveling from empty tryst to empty tryst and carrying with her an unread letter from Lukas that, if only she had read it, might have changed things. But, as she thinks, childhood is not a place to which you can return. Swärd’s novel is a closely observed study in character and the sometimes capricious, sometimes careless, but life-changing choices that people make. Unfortunately, many of these choices seem to be unmotivated or driven, perhaps, by fate in a novel that often seems emotionally arid. Though its ending is dramatically unsatisfying, this Swedish import will nevertheless satisfy fans of character-driven international fiction. --Michael Cart", "related": [], "rank": 3118537, "title": "Breathless", "author": "Anne Swärd", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It should be essential reading for marketers and general managers, and carefully hidden away from anyone whose livelihood depends on market research.\" - Alan Giles, Fellow of The Marketing Society and Associate Fellow, Said Business School, University of OxfordThe problem with consumers is that they are incapable of understanding their purchasing behavior. Why? Because it is actually driven by the unconscious. Consumer.ology author Philip Graves is a lecturer on consumer behavior and a consultant for associated studies for companies including Whirlpool, Virgin Media, and Pepsi. He has come to the bold conclusion that market studies and focus groups are useless. He asserts that the most accurate information about consumer needs comes from analysis of data gathered in real situations, where people are not aware that they are being observed. Fortunately, the Internet offers a vast territory for observation, because people leave countless traces of their behavior and telling comments. Keeping quiet and listening to consumers is actually just as important as communicating with them, and people often speak more honestly when no questions have been asked.

From lobstering in Maine to cruising the beaches of Baja and from ice-climbing in the Swiss Alps to hang-gliding in Brazil and scuba diving Honduras, Shawn has truly experienced thethrill and wonder that can only be found in nature.Shawn's quest to experience as many of the Earth's wonders as possible has led him on a 3-day camel trip in the Sahara Desert, a 4-month camping trip in Alaska and even a drive through Canada to the Arctic Circle. In addition to hiking the highest peak in North Africa, he spent a summer in his home state, Colorado, hiking 20 of the Rocky Mountains' 12-14,000 foot peaks. Not being limited to physical conquests, Shawn also studied Spanish in Costa Rica and Guatemala. Currently,Shawn's greatest outdoor passion is kiteboarding, which he considers to be the pinnacle of outdoor sports. Though his search for the perfect activity is over, he continues to search for the best spots and the friendliest people on the planet to pursue and share his passion for kiting with. His boundless enthusiasm for the sport drove Shawn to get involved in efforts to make the sport as safe as it can be and accessible to as many people as possible by becoming a kiting instructor. Since he couldn't find a book that fully covered the sport and gave new kiters all the information they need to get a safe and successful start in the sport, he decided to write one.In writing this book, it is his hope that you will find the sport of kiting just as exciting and rewarding as he does, and that you share his commitment to safety.", "related": ["B00C25LRNU"], "rank": 844226, "title": "HOW TO KITESURF ON LAND, SAND, WATER AND SNOW", "author": "Shawn Tieskotter", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With nine daughters, two sons, a vast estate, priceless jewels, and a historic castle bedecked with valuable furniture and paintings, Lord Rothbury seems to have everything. But on the day his daughter Laura’s engagement is announced, Lord Rothbury receives a shocking visit from a man with a dark secret and a deep hatred of the Fairbairns. The man vows to place a curse on the family, and while Lord Rothbury believes curses are for the lower classes, he can’t help but be fearful. Shortly after the mysterious stranger departs, terrible things begin happening to the Fairbairns—robberies, losses of land and property, fires, broken marriages, disappearances, and deaths. With an unusual plot full of unexpected twists and a graceful writing style, Parker’s latest is not only a spellbinding read but also an eye-opening look at the role of the aristocracy and women in Scotland at the turn of the nineteenth-to-twentieth century. --Emily Melton", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cunningham was raised keeping the seventh-day Sabbath. His great grandfather started the family down the path of Sabbath keeping by not only introducing them to a Sabbath-keeping church but also by becoming one of its more prominent ministers. Following that same path, Kevin's grandfather also became a minister in the Sabbath-keeping church. Kevin spent each Sabbath day learning from his grandfather's preaching and his mother's teaching in Sabbath school. It was when he went away to school in Lawrence, Kansas that seeds of doubt were planted. An acquaintance at the time who was door knocking in the school's dormitory sat down and showed him a few scriptures that appeared to contradict the very teaching he received from his Sabbath-keeping church. Rejecting those scriptures with the determination that they were \"taken out of context\" he continued to believe in keeping the Sabbath. The message those scriptures seemed to have presented continued to fester but did not take root until shortly after he graduated from the University of Kansas with a degree in Electrical Engineering. At that time, during a bible study where he was attempting to teach a friend about the Sabbath, the very scriptures he had rejected years ago once again were shown to him. This study ended a few weeks later with him being baptized into the church of Christ, no longer keeping the seventh-day Sabbath as he was raised. He and his wife Karla have three children living and worshiping in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area of Texas. In November of 2012, he began serving as one of the elders at the Simmons Street church of Christ in Denton, Texas. www.sschurchofchrist.us kevinlcunninghamsscoc@gmail.com Visit \"The Sabbath, the Law, and the New Covenant\" on Facebook.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She was not a traditional submissive, making the story so much better to read. Her match is a character from the previous books--Bryan. Lord Bryan Sutherland is a sadistic Dom and an English lord wrapped in\n one--a very sexy and complex character whose past still haunts him.~Risque Reviews-Melissa5 StarsThe interaction between Dom and sub was electric in My Wicked Devil making\n me wish I too could be part of this special club. I loved how Bryan\ndidn't just want Kira for her masochistic needs but wanted to discover\nher hidden depths. I felt he was the perfect match for Kira, a woman who\n has such a joy for living.Ann Mayburn has\n a real gift of presenting flawed characters searching for their special\n someone within the BDSM community, making her characters leap off the\npages, daring you to become part of their world.~Two Lips Reviews-Victoria5 StarsBe prepared to wince, fan, curse, and shake your head in disbelief. I\nmean that in a loving way of course. Ms. Mayburn's books are incredibly\nhot and very addictive. There isn't once sex scene I haven't read from\nher that doesn't have you either melting into a puddle of goo, or you're\n walking away hot and bothered.~Hawt Reads and Dirty TalkMy Wicked Devil is filled with tremendously sexy and naughty scenes. Once again, Ms. Mayburn pushes boundaries and explores kink in the arena of pleasure and romance. Sex is not used to shock or punish, but is one aspect of a healthy relationship.~That's What I'm Talking About-Twimom227", "related": ["B00ITAIBUY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 4.5625, "rating_total": 73.0}

She has always wanted to be a writer so she also took several classes in creative writing. Hadena primarily writes thrillers and mysteries, but dabbles in other genres.  Currently, she writes a romantic comedy series (The Dysfunctional Chronicles) and a fantasy series (The Brenna Strachan series).   When she isn’t busy writing or running her business, Hadena enjoys playing in a steel-tip dart league.  She also loves to travel throughout North America and Europe. Her favorite cities are Chicago, Illinois and Berlin, Germany.  She is an avid reader, reading everything from the classics like Jane Austen to modern writers like Terry Pratchett.

And according to Michael Patrick Hearn's superb introduction to this annotated edition of Dickens's beloved classic, that was precisely the author's intention. Dickens feared that encroaching industrialism undermined the traditional values of family, faith and simplicity, and that killjoy Puritans had done away with many of the pleasures of Christmas, so he set out to revive old-fashioned English customs. Hearn's introduction grandly describes the story's enduring popularity around the world (including Dickens's irate but mostly ineffectual attempts to stem the tide of its plagiarism). The annotated edition is enriched by numerous wood etchings, including some from the original 1843 art by Punch cartoonist John Leech.

His father was Director of Education and as was fitting the young Stewart attended Edinburgh Academy before going up to Oriel College, Oxford where he obtained a first class degree in English. Amongst his undergraduate contemporaries were Christopher Isherwood and W.H. Auden. Stewart observed the latter during their final examinations, where Auden emerged with a third, and later stated how the \"tears were coursing down his pale and ample cheeks.\" Stewart won the Matthew Arnold Memorial Prize and was named a Bishop Frazer's scholar.  After a short interlude travelling with AJP Taylor in Austria, including studying Freudian psychoanalysis for a year, he embarked on an edition of Florio's translation of Montaigne's Essays, which secured him a post teaching English at Leeds University.  In 1932, he married Margaret Hardwick, who practised medicine, and they subsequently had three sons and two daughters, one of whom is also a writer. By 1935, he had been awarded the Jury Chair at the University of Adelaide in Australia as Professor of English and had also completed his first detective novel, 'Death at the President?s Lodging', published under the pseudonym 'Michael Innes'. This was an immediate success and part of a long running series centred on 'Inspector Appleby', his primary character when writing as 'Innes'. There were almost fifty titles under the Innes banner completed during his career. Very early in his writing career, Stewart managed to establish himself as a late Golden Age Detective Story writer and as a highly cultivated and entertaining writer. In 1946, Stewart returned to the UK and spent two years at Queen's University in Belfast, before being appointed Student (Fellow and Tutor) at Christ Church, Oxford. He was later to hold the post of Reader in English Literature of Oxford University and upon his retirement was made an Emeritus Professor. Whilst never wanting to leave his beloved Oxford permanently, he did manage to fit into his busy schedule a visiting Professorship at the University of Washington and was also honoured by other Universities in the UK.  Stewart wrote many works under his own name, including twenty-one fiction titles (which contained a highly acclaimed quintet entitled 'A Staircase in Surrey', centred primarily in Oxford, but with considerable forays elsewhere, especially Italy), several short story collections, and over nine learned works on the likes of Shakespeare, Kipling and Hardy. He was also a contributor to many academic publications, including a major section on modern writers for the Oxford History of English Literature.  He died in 1994, the last published work being an autobiography: 'Myself and Michael Innes'. His works are greatly admired for both their wit, plots and literary quality, with the non-fiction acknowledged as being definitive.", "related": [], "rank": 2020615, "title": "A Palace of Art", "author": "J.I.M.

A second after he entered the building,\nhe heard the back window unlock. He appeared in the room in time to see a\nspirit step back as the newly unlocked window opened. Tristan stayed hidden in\nthe shadows and watched. As soon as the small male squeezed\nthrough the window and jumped to the floor, he said, \"Thanks, Ghost. I knew I\ncould count on you.\" \"We can't keep this up. You know\nthat, right?\" \"You have to keep helping me, Ghost.\nMy brother needs us. Do you want him to die?\" the slender man asked. His voice\nheld a note of desperation. \"You know I don't...but there has to\nbe another way. I don't like this,\" the spirit answered, gruffly. Tristan was intrigued by the\nsituation. His theory seemed to be true. The thief wasn't doing this to be mean\nor for fun. The air conditioner kicked on and within seconds the human's scent\nfilled Tristan's nostrils. The succulent aroma was like nothing he'd ever\nexperienced before. His heartbeat accelerated and his dick hardened. Tristan\nhad just found his mate! Mate. At that thought, his fangs\nextended. He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself, but it only imprinted\nhis mate's delicious scent into every cell of his body and made his cock\nlengthen even more. The beast within him roared. It needed to claim its mate\nright now. \"I understand that you don't like\nthis. I don't either, but until we can come up with another plan we have to do\nthis,\" the little human stated, then looked around. \"Let's get this over with.\nI'm starting to feel strange.\" \"It's most likely your guilty\nconscience. I'm glad to see it's still alive and well,\" the spirit said wryly. \"I know you don't like doing this\nanymore than I do. For the record, I want you to know your help means the world\nto me.\" Tristan's fangs were aching and his\nballs had started throbbing. He shifted and ran his hand soothingly over the\ndesperate flesh between his legs. \"Uh-oh.\" \"What's wrong?\" the desirable human\nasked. In a squeaky voice, the spirit\nanswered, \"Someone's here.\" \"What the hell? You said the\nbuilding was empty.\" \"It was, but now it's not. Run!\" Oh hell. Tristan knew he was busted.\nIt wasn't a bad thing, though. His need to claim his mate was growing by the\nsecond. He stepped from the dark shadows and\nsucked in a breath of his mate's scent. Scrumptious. Tristan couldn't wait to\ntaste the man's blood as he plunged his cock deeply into his long-awaited\nmate's hot body. The glorious man held up his hands\nin surrender. Tristan liked that, a lot.", "related": ["B00FZZQEK0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Filled with excitement and the need to explore, the boy begins to snoop around and finds a few of his dad's belongings. As he handles and examines each item, the boy imagines how each item serves its place in the study. The father explains to his son that each item did not serve the purpose the boy had imagined, but the boy loves his father anyway, and still thinks his dad is a great man.Zehavit Tzarfati and Mindy Liang have created a wonderful, heartfelt and loving story, with very colorful, vibrant pictures. This story will hold a place in any reader's heart who knows a young boy who thinks the world of their father. I loved the extreme visions the boy had thought each item he found was once used for. A young boy that admires his father would think he did great things such as dig for dinosaur bones because he has a hat that resembles the one an archaeologist would wear. It is a very sweet story that every father and son should read together. I was very excited when I found at the end of the book a link to an activity kit for parents to do with their children. A very cute read, and awesome activity link\" -Reviewed by Michelle Robertson for Readers' Favorite", "related": ["B00J13R550"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 4.75, "rating_total": 76.0}

Pratt. A splendid tale of epic proportions, Pratt has\nenvisioned a hero to rival the greats. A seeker of quests who is\nwonderfully flawed yet instantly affable, his tale is timeless as action\n prevails, whilst her plot is sure to beguile. It's lavish in its\nsettings, the gods are ever fickle and a maelstrom of villainy is ever\npresent, yet what ultimately makes Dark Mountain most memorable is\nflair. The genre is littered with lack lustre imaginings, but Pratt has a\n way of writing that is wholly immersive. She has a deft ear for\ndialogue with wit ever prevalent, which creates a contemporary undertone\n whilst her characters are imbued with an undeniable presence that would\n readily transition to wider mediums. Truly original fantasy fiction is sadly rare, but Dark\nMountain must surely sate the most desirous of appetites, whilst\ngarnering many more enthralled fans for author C.B. Pratt. It is highly\nrecommended!From: bookviral.com/dark-mountain/4583494043", "related": [], "rank": 845295, "title": "Dark Mountain", "author": "C.B.

He's the perfect kind of male lead--strong, possessive, and broody. He's strong enough to know when he loves and to fight for it rather than against it. He treats his woman with care and respect. He's patient without being a pushover. He's charming and sweet, but you don't want to mess with him or his. And he's hot, hot, hot. A human in a world of shifters, he's tough enough to hold his own, and that's pretty impressive. In The Only Witness, Houdini and his friends--his family--lose their home in a rival's grab for power. In The Way Home, they have to fight hard to get that home back. Houdini has to fight even harder to reclaim the woman he loves from the clutches of a horrible evil, and Susan has to fight to survive it, to come home whole, and to realize that she's worth a love like his. In the end, the power of their love is the only thing strong enough to get them through. This is a tense, emotional story that had me crying and cheering and swooning.

The great books enable you to think clearly about how you can do it. This book is the latter. To really maximize the potential of your database, thinking about data as a set is required and the authors’ accessible writing really brings out the practical applications of SQL and the set-based thinking behind it.-- Ben Clothier, Lead Developer at IT Impact, Inc., co-author ofProfessional Access 2013 Programming, and Microsoft Access MVP Unless you are working at a very advanced level, this is the only SQL book you will ever need. The authors have taken the mystery out of complex queries and explained principles and techniques with such clarity that a “Mere Mortal” will indeed be empowered to perform the superhuman. Do not walk past this book!--Graham Mandeno, Database Consultant It’s beyond brilliant! I have been working with SQL for a really long time and the techniques presented in this book exposed some of the bad habits I picked up over the years in my learning process. I wish I had learned these techniques a long time ago and saved myself all the headaches of learning SQL the hard way. Who said you can’t teach old dogs new tricks?--Leo (theDBguy), Utter Access Moderator and Microsoft Access MVP I learned SQL primarily from the first and second editions of this book, and I am pleased to see a third edition of this book so that others can continue to benefit from its organized presentation of the language. Starting from how to design your tables so that SQL can be effective (a common problem for database beginners), and then continuing through the various aspects of SQL construction and capabilities, the reader can become a moderate expert upon completing the book and its samples. Learning how to convert a question in English into a meaningful SQL statement will greatly facilitate your mastery of the language. Numerous examples from real life will help you visualize how to use SQL to answer the questions about the data in your database. Just one of the “watch out for this trap” items will save you more than the cost of the book when you avoid that problem when writing your queries. I highly recommend this book if you want to tap the full potential of your database.--Kenneth D. Snell, Ph.D., Database Designer/Programmer I don’t think they do this in public schools any more, and it is a shame, but do you remember in the seventh and eighth grades when you learned to diagram a sentence? Those of you who do may no longer remember how you did it, but all of you do write better sentences because of it. John Viescas and Mike Hernandez must have remembered because they take everyday English queries and literally translate them into SQL. This is an important book for all database designers. It takes the complexity of mathematical Set Theory and of First Order Predicate Logic, as outlined in E. F. Codd’s original treatise on relational database design, and makes it easy for anyone to understand. If you want an elementary- through intermediate-level course on SQL, this is the one book that is a requirement, no matter how many others you buy.--Arvin Meyer, MCP, MVP SQL Queries for Mere Mortals, Third Edition,provides a step-by-step, easy-to-read introduction to writing SQL queries. It includes hundreds of examples with detailed explanations. This book provides the tools you need to understand, modify, and create SQL queries.--Keith W. Hare, Convenor, ISO/IEC JTC1 SC32 WG3International SQL Standards Committee Even in this day of wizards and code generators, successful database developers still require a sound knowledge of Structured Query Language (SQL, the standard language for communicating with most database systems). In this book, John and Mike do a marvelous job of making what’s usually a dry and difficult subject come alive, presenting the material with humor in a logical manner, with plenty of relevant examples. I would say that this book should feature prominently in the collection on the bookshelf of all serious developers, except that I’m sure it’ll get so much use that it won’t spend much time on the shelf!--Doug Steele, Microsoft Access Developer and author I highly recommendSQL Queries for Mere Mortalsto anyone working with data. John makes it easy to learn one of the most critical aspects of working with data: creating queries. Queries are the primary tool for selecting, sorting, and reporting data. They can compensate for table structure, new reporting requirements, and incorporate new data sources.SQL Queries for Mere Mortalsuses clear, easy to understand discussions and examples to take readers through the basics and into complex problems. From novice to expert, you will find this book to be an invaluable reference as you can apply the concepts to a myriad of scenarios, regardless of the program.--Teresa Hennig, Microsoft MVP-Access, and lead author of several Access books, includingProfessional Access 2013 Programming(Wrox)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
