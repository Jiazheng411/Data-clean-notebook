In part one of her book, Fowler reminds readers that ADHD is a result of neurobiological events that affect a teen's actions, \"rather than deliberate choice or stupidity,\" and provides an overview of the disorder and the available medical treatments. In part two, she skillfully guides parents through various ADHD-related issues how to decide which medical treatment to pursue and what to do if the teen is uncooperative; sexuality; money management; schoolwork; college searches; jobs; legal issues stressing that while there is still no cure, parents can help their teenage sons and daughters measurably improve the quality of their lives. A former secondary-school teacher and tireless advocate for children with ADHD, their parents and their teachers, Fowler is not the smoothest writer, but her personal voice offers a welcome respite from the parade of experts quoted. Providing a wealth of realistic, compassionate strategies and tactics for caring for an adolescent with ADHD, Fowler has created an all-encompassing yet easy-to-use guide. Parents would be wise to read this book from cover to cover first and then refer to the \"information links\" or special highlighted sections that lead to more in-depth information as necessary.

She also didn't need to fully hear their whispers to catch enough to make her ulcer go into overdrive.It's her, Anna Wilder.The traitor.James and Alice must be rolling in their graves.She did her best to ignore them—and the hurt that settled like greasy black bile in her stomach. Still, to her great shame, she wasn't quite able to control the slight tremble of her hand as she pushed the elevator button to go up.One of the two cars appeared to be permanently stuck on the second floor but the other one at last began creeping downward in what felt like excruciatingly painful slow motion.She prayed the blasted thing would hurry up and arrive— not only to allow her to slip inside and escape the stares and whispers but, more importantly, because she was late.She really hated being late.The elevator stopped on the second floor and paused there for a few moments before continuing its descent. Suddenly a new apprehension fluttered her ulcer.Why hadn't she been smart enough to take the stairs? The only thing worse than being late for her meeting would be the social discomfort of encountering one of her siblings in the elevator during her first few minutes at the hospital.She didn't know which one would be harder to face right now. Ella? Peter? David? It probably didn't matter. They were all furious with her and would no doubt love a chance to let her know.Just before the elevator arrived, one of the two volunteers at the information desk raised her voice in what had to be deliberate malice so Anna couldn't miss her words.\"She might have the Wilder name,\" she said in a carrying voice, \"but she's not a true Wilder. How can she be, since she's in bed with those who are trying to sell out this hospital and this town?\"Anna inhaled sharply. Apparently the doctors weren't the only ones at Walnut River General who could wield a scalpel. The words effectively sliced straight to where she was most vulnerable.Her hand tightened on the briefcase as she ruthlessly tried to ignore the hot tears burning behind her eyelids.It didn't matter what a couple of dried-up old prunes had to say about her. Why should it? They had nothing better to do with their time than sit around gossiping and watching all the human suffering march through their lobby.She knew she was doing the right thing—thebestthing—for Walnut River and its citizens. She just had to convince everybody else in town.No problem.At long, long last, the elevator car arrived and the doors whooshed open. She considered it nothing short of a miracle that it was blessedly empty. Not a Wilder in sight.Only after the doors slid shut did she close her eyes and slump against the wall of the elevator, pressing a hand to her stomach before she dug in the pocket of her suit jacket for an antacid.She did not want to be here. In Walnut River, at the hospital her family had all but founded, in this blasted elevator.It helped nothing that she had expected the reaction she had received from those two volunteers and she expected much more vitriol in the days ahead.She had read the reports and knew the merger she had been sent here to expedite wasn't popular among the staff at WRG. Not that she had needed reports. Her family's unreasonable opposition was all the evidence she needed. They had all made no secret that they were furious at her.Traitor.Not a Wilder.She screwed her eyes shut. Focus on the job, she chanted to herself. That was all that mattered. Move in fast and hard and wrap things up so she could return to New York.She had no choice, not if she wanted to keep her job. And she certainly did.She loved working for Northeastern HealthCare, one of the fastest growing health care conglomerates in the region. She was on the fast track there and had great hopes of making vice president within the next five years. That goal would be even closer if she could pull this deal off.Mercifully, though the elevator stopped on the second floor to pick up a couple of nurses, she didn't recognize them and they didn't seem to know her. One of them even gave her a friendly smile.So maybe David hadn't yet gotten around to plastering up wanted posters throughout the hospital of her wearing devil horns.Beware of the evil HMO-mongerer.She wouldn't put anything past her second-oldest brother, a gifted plastic surgeon who had recently returned to Walnut River as well. Unlike her, he had come back to a warm welcome, embraced by one and all—the prodigal son giving up a lucrative career in L.A. as plastic surgeon to the stars to share his brilliance with patients in his own hometown.On the fourth floor, the nurses exited with her. Anna stood for a moment, trying to catch her bearings.This part of the hospital had been renovated in the past few years and she was slightly disoriented at the changes.She remembered it as slightly old-fashioned, with wood-grained paneling and dark carpeting. Now everything was light and airy, with new windows and a far more modern feel.\"Do you need help finding something?\" one of the nurses asked, noticing her confusion.\"Yes. Thanks. I'm looking for the administrator's office.\"\"Down the hall. Second door on the right,\" she said.\"Thank you.\" Anna gave a polite smile, grateful for any help she could find here in this hostile environment, then headed in the direction the woman indicated.The receptionist's nameplate read Tina Tremaine. She greeted Anna with a friendly smile, her features warm and open.\"Hello. I'm Anna Wilder. I'm here for a three-o'clock meeting with the hospital attorney and the administrator.\"The instant she heard Anna's name, the woman's smile slid away as if a cold breeze had just blown through the room.\"I'm here for a three o'clock meeting with the hospital attorney and the administrator.\"\"Phil Crandall, the hospital attorney, is not here yet, Ms. Wilder. But Mr. Sumner and your attorney are in the boardroom. They're waiting for you.\"Though she spoke politely enough, Anna thought she saw a tiny sliver of disdain in the woman's eyes.She fished around in her mind for something she might say to alter the woman's negative impression, then checked the impulse.She was working hard to break the habits of a lifetime, that hunger for approval she couldn't quite shake. Did it really matter what J.D.'s receptionist thought of her? It certainly wouldn't change anything about her mission here in Walnut River.\"Thank you,\" she answered, mustering a smile she hoped was at least polite if not completely genuine. She headed for the door the receptionist indicated, tilting her chin up and hoping she projected confidence and competence.This was it. Her chance to cinch the promotion at NHC and cement her growing reputation as a rainmaker there.Or she could blow the merger, lose her job, and end up begging on the street somewhere.Think positive,she ordered herself.You can do this. You've done it before.As she pushed open the door, she visualized herself handing over the signed deal to her bosses, both her direct supervisor, Wallace Jeffers—vice president for mergers and acquisitions—and the NHC chief executive officer who had given her this assignment, Alfred Daly.It was a heady, enticing image, one she clung to as she faced the two men at the boardroom table, papers spread out in front of them.Two men sat at a boardroom table talking, papers spread out in front of them. She knew both of them and smiled at J. D. Sumner and Walter Posey, the NHC attorney.\"I'm sorry if I've kept you waiting. I didn't realize there would be so much construction surrounding the hospital.\"J.D. nodded. \"Walnut River is growing. You just have to walk outside to see it.\"\"Which is one factor that makes this hospital an attractive opportunity for NHC, as you well know.\"J.D. had first come to Walnut River as an employee of NHC. He had ended up falling—literally—for her sister, Ella, resigning from NHC and taking the job as hospital administrator.She didn't know all the details but she knew Ella had treated J.D. after he was injured in a bad tumble on some icy steps when leaving the hospital. Something significant must have happened between them to compel a man like J.D. to fall for his orthopedic surgeon and leave a promising career at Northeastern HealthCare to take the reins of Walnut River General Hospital.She couldn't imagine giving up everything she had worked so hard to attain for something as ephemeral as love, but she had to admit part of her envied her sister.J.D. must love Ella very much.She could only hope his relationship with Ella had turned him soft. Judging by his track record at NHC, Anna feared he would be a formidable foe in her efforts to make the merger happen.\"Our attorney was caught up in the traffic snarl, as well,\" J.D. answered. \"He just called and was still parking his car but he should be here any moment.\"Though he spoke cordially enough, there was a reserve in his voice she couldn't miss.She had only known him casually when he worked for NHC, but their interactions as coworkers had always been marked by friendly respect. Now, though, they were on opposite sides of what was shaping up to be an ugly fight over the future of the hospital.He didn't seem antagonistic, as she had feared, only distant. She had to admit she was relieved. He and Ella were engaged, from what she understood. This was bound to be awkward enough between them without outright antipathy.\"I'm going for some coffee before we get started,\" the NHC attorney announced. \"Can I get either of you anything?\"Anna shook her head at...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The Last Stand of Mr. America cuts into our heart of darkness with no bullshit bedside manner and no anesthesia.  --David Gates, author of Preston Falls and JerniganStory has it that when young San Francisco author Jason Flores-Williams heard that the U.K. publisher that discovered Irvine Welsh and a slew of similarly gritty \"outsider\" writers was interested in his novel, The Last Stand of Mr. America, Flores-Williams moved to Scotland to stoke the imprint's interest personally. The brash tactic worked; Canongate/Rebel Inc. will rerelease his once self-published novel in November. In the meantime, the \"Caligula of American letters\" is returning to the scene of the crime to share his nihilistic views of sex, gender politics, American apathy, and the abyss in the very city that nourished his sadistic little work of (de)moralizing erotica. While Flores-Williams' grim, graphic, and heavy-handed style may appeal most to those purposefully bankrupt readers who thought Welsh's Filth was a frolicking good time, there is no denying Flores-Williams' gift for prodding shadows with a cold, unwavering Maglite. In his San Francisco, sex club sadists are reduced to overgrown Dungeons & Dragons fanatics; kind, unpretentious transvestites slip in the cracks between natural-born femaleness and tranny affectation; women chase their fear by chasing casual sex; men chase their fear with lists, fists, liquor, Nietzsche, and the perfect balance of muscle tone and beer gut; and none but the dead are redeemed. In the eyes of Mr. America, everyone is corrupt or corruptible. Even for the innocents heard whimpering behind the walls, it's only a matter of time before they too are besmirched.  --Silke Tudor, SF Weekly, August 14, 2001The Last Stand of Mr. America has moments of dark, raw, sex-stained poetry, as well as ejaculations of sneering adolescent hatred.  --Michele Goldberg, MetroActive.com, 1998", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dixon present thirty-nine full-text addresses by women who spoke out while the struggle was at its most intense.Beginning with theBrowndecision in 1954 and extending through the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the editors chronicle the unique and important rhetorical contributions made by such well-known activists as Ella Baker, Fannie Lou Hamer, Daisy Bates, Lillian Smith, Mamie Till-Mobley, Lorraine Hansberry, Dorothy Height, and Rosa Parks. They also include speeches from lesser-known but influential leaders such as Della Sullins, Marie Foster, Johnnie Carr, Jane Schutt, and Barbara Posey.Nearly every speech was discovered in local, regional, or national archives, and many are published or transcribed from audiotape here for the first time. Houck and Dixon introduce each speaker and occasion with a headnote highlighting key biographical and background details. The editors also provide a general introduction that places these public addresses in context.Women and the Civil Rights Movement, 1954-1965gives voice to stalwarts whose passionate orations were vital to every phase of a movement that changed America.", "related": [], "rank": 576644, "title": "Women and the Civil Rights Movement, 1954-1965", "author": "Davis W.

Soon after a randy teenage boy is fatally impaled by an ancient Cheyenne arrow during an outdoor tryst, the town of Buffalo Springs is plagued by a series of bombings that may be the work of al Qaeda. The top local lawman, Sheriff English, finds himself pulled in multiple directions as evidence suggests that his flaky mystic half-brother, known as Mad Dog, was the intended victim instead of the teenager. There's no shortage of people who would benefit from Mad Dog's death, ranging from town supervisors who want to use his land for a lucrative wind-power venture to the psychotic son he never knew existed. English races from crime scene to crime scene, mindful of his wife's deadline to show up at the Wichita airport for a trip to Paris that could save their marriage. While Hayes displays some satirical gifts (as shown in a TV reality show calledThis Old Tepee), the story is longer on action than suspense or deduction, and the trivializing of the very real threat of al Qaeda can be offputting, especially since it's unnecessary to the plot.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Somewhat surprisingly, however, modern public choice and public finance research programs were never fully integrated. This book admirably meets this objective. It offers a sophisticated and comprehensive treatment of questions involving when and why politics arises, how politics can be predicted to work in practice, and how limits can be placed on political excesses. A well-informed, well-written treatise useful for several levels of readership.\" - James M. Buchanan, Nobel Laureate, George Mason University\"This book sets a new standard for undergraduate texts on public finance. It is distinguished from other textbooks in the successful integration of traditional public finance with public choice, political economy, and behavioral economics. It provides an exciting, balanced, and up-to-date introduction to traditional topics, such as public goods, the theory of taxation, and externalities, as well as posing deeper questions about social justice, rent seeking, and political competition. The returns from reading this book are high, not only for the novice who is studying the subject for the first time, but also for the seasoned researcher who is looking for a comprehensive and coherent discussion of the literature.\" - Toke S. Aidt, University of Cambridge\"This text provides a strikingly rich, thoughtful, thought-provoking, and unusually comprehensive overview of academic thinking about the role of government in the economy, emphasizing the role of political institutions in shaping how governments behave, and the resulting trade-offs between private and public provision. The book presents ideas in a way that is eminently accessible to undergraduate students. It is a delight to read.\" - Roger Gordon, University of California, San Diego\"This book provides a comprehensive and accessible account of the core issues in public finance and public policy. While designed as a textbook, the book is also an organizing guide for practitioners and policymakers, who will find particularly useful the application of concepts to issues in income support and work incentives, education, health care, and the choice between tax financing and user prices.\" - Sanjeev Gupta, Fiscal Affairs Department, International Monetary Fund, Washington, DC\"This fascinating book provides a clear account of the role of government through public finance and public policy. It gives a balanced and insightful analysis of the scope and limits of what government can and should do. Students will like the clear exposition and researchers will benefit from the book as a reference volume.\" - Kai Konrad, Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property, Competition and Tax Law, Munich\"This book is a gem. It brings alive the topics of public finance. The book is an extraordinary piece of work that enables students to achieve a balanced overview of market failures and government failures and thereby gain mature insight into desirable interactions between the market and the state. Teachers and students will benefit from this major achievement for years to come, making this book a classic.\" - Dennis Snower, Kiel Institute for the World Economy and Christian-Albrechts University, Kiel", "related": [], "rank": 1245160, "title": "Public Finance and Public Policy", "author": "Arye L.

My daughter asked me what was on the other side.I had had no idea, but impulsively, I answered, \"The Kingdom of the Bears, of course. Everyone knows that.\"\"Can we go across and see the king?\"\"I'd love to, but it's not a safe time to visit,\" I said. \"The kingdom is under attack by the weasel lord Garmley.\"It was a tiny seed, planted in the garden of my mind. Over the next year, that seed grew into a book. I have read it several times to my children, who still listen with rapt attention, laughing in all the right places.

Richard Carlson grew up in Piedmont, CA. He received his undergraduate degree from Pepperdine University and his Ph.D. in psychology from Sierra University. He was in private practice as a psychotherapist when he started to publish books about psychological and spiritual health. As his books started to attract a large audience, he began writing full time so he could teach more people how to live with presence and ease by cultivating gratitude and generosity. Dr. Carlson was a large supporter of and participant in the National Center for Family Literacy and at the time of his death he was working on a project with them called for \"A Penny a Book\" from publishers, authors and literary agents to promote literacy. Dr. Carlson is survived by his wife and life partner of 25 years, Kris Carlson, his co-author on Don't Sweat the Small Stuff in Love and the author of Don't Sweat the Small Stuff for Women, his loving daughters Jasmine and Kenna, sisters, Kathleen Carlson Mowris of Olympic Village, CA and Anna L. Carlson of La Selva Beach, CA, and his parents, Barbara and Don Carlson of Orinda, CA. A private memorial service will be held next week.

In this riveting work of historical fiction, Hamilton centers the activity that led to the Battle of Lewes on a Jewess named Judith, who, assuming the disguise of a young man, serves as a spy for the king. There is no man Judith despises more than de Montfort, who, 10 years before, had incited an angry mob of Christians to wreak havoc on a Jewish settlement, killing Judith's father, younger sisters and baby brother in the process. Hamilton's story, with convincing dialogue and finely paced intrigue, captivates the reader from beginning to end. With an emphasis on fast-moving plot, the author never fully develops any of her primary characters, but this is only a minor quibble. More importantly, this is a novel not only about a pivotal period in Henry's reign, but also about the life-and-death friendships between a handful of Jews and Christians and those who would conspire against them. On the very last page, Hamilton teases the reader with the suggestion that she has delivered only the first chapter of a larger tale. If readers are lucky, Hamilton will provide more about Judith and this period of British civil war. -Publishers Weekly, April 9, 2001\"There is some lovely writing here by Hamilton...with a pace that is medieval and stately.\" -Library Journal", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

May confirms his reputation as James Michener’s most pertinent, sensitive, and accessible biographer withMichener’s South Pacific. In the wake of the acclaimed 2008 Broadway revival ofSouth Pacific, it may seem absurd that, once upon a time--six decades ago--adapting such a serious, unflinching work as Michener’s for the musical stage was a risky challenge.\"--Laurence Maslon, author ofThe South Pacific CompanionWhen the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, James A. Michener was an obscure textbook editor working in New York. Within three years, he was a naval officer stationed in the South Pacific. By the end of the decade, he was an accomplished author, well on the way to worldwide fame.Michener’s first novel,Tales of the South Pacific,won the Pulitzer Prize. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein used it as the basis for the Broadway musicalSouth Pacific, which also won the Pulitzer. How this all came to be is the subject of Stephen May’sMichener’s South Pacific.An award-winning biographer of Michener, May was a featured interviewee on the fiftieth-anniversary DVD release of the film version of the musical. During taping, he realized there was much he didn’t know about how Michener’s experiences in the South Pacific shaped the man and led to his early work.May delves deeply into this formative and turbulent period in Michener’s life and career, using letters, journal entries, and naval records to examine how a reserved, middle-aged lieutenant known as \"Prof\" to his fellow officers became one of the most successful writers of the twentieth century. Stephen J. Mayis the author ofMichener: A Writer’s Journey, which served as the basis for the PBS documentaryJames Michener: An Epic Life. He has also written a two-volume biography of Zane Grey and served as technical advisor for the most recent Broadway revival ofSouth Pacific.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Well, I live in Northern Ireland but I’m of mixed descent Scots/English.  You could say I’ve had a chequered employment history, working in the ceramics industry, small firm accountancy and also hospitality.  But for the last few years I’ve concentrated on raising my family here in Northern Ireland. From an early age I loved books and writing, cutting my teeth on the ever popular “Famous Five” series and such like.   Very quickly my preferences changed and soon I was reading books like “The Pearl” and “Of Mice and Men” by John Steinbeck, “The Mayor of Casterbridge” by Thomas Hardy, “Tristan and Isolde” and a whole range of Science Fiction. But how did I make the jump to writing you might ask?  Well, since becoming a mother I’ve have a lot less time and any book I’m going to read must grab my attention on the first page (it’s called a hook in the trade).  For a while I felt that a large number of the books I bought just didn’t deliver, so one day I thought about the kind of book I would like to read and wrote down a few ideas. In no time at all I had what would turn out to be the basic outline for my first book and the rest you could say is history, which brings me to another subject; genealogy.

What we see is, he\nreminds us in delightfully numerous ways, is a photograph. Without\ncontext, he insists, what we can learn from a photograph is likely to\nbe less than what we can understand if the image is accompanied with\ntext of some kind. Especially with digital images, he says, we need\nto know something about who made the photograph, where and when it\nwas made, and perhaps we are justified in our desire to know why this\nimage moment is in our daily newspaper. If we are not given this\ninformation, we need at least to develop a habit of asking ourselves\nthese questions. Durrer's essays advance the long conversation\nabout the nature of photography, what it can and cannot tell us, and\nhow we might reflect on these images.Emelle\nSonh, photo-artist, San Francisco", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Watkins was born April 1st in Chicago, Illinois. She obtained a Bachelors of Arts with Focus in Psychology from DePaul University and Masters of Applied Professional Studies with focus in Business Administration from the like institution. Working in Hospital Administration for the majority of her career, Watkins has also been an author of fiction literature since the young age of nine. Eventually she used writing as an outlet during her freshmen year of high school as a single parent: \"In the third grade I entered a short story contest with a fiction tale of an apple tree that refused to grow despite the efforts of the darling main character. My writing evolved from apple trees to my seventh and eighth grade classmates paying me to read novels I wrote about kids our age living the lives our parents wouldn't dare let us\". At the age of twenty-eight, Watkins' chronicles have matured into steamy, humorous, and realistic tales of women's fiction. She hopes that the Epitome of Femistry series will successfully emulate ideal femininity while tackling stereotypes, familiar heartache, and relatable distress in a humorous and sophisticated fashion.

This book may be fiction, but it has a sincerity and ring of truth throughout. Through the characters eyes and personal experiences, one learns (again) just how badly we, as a society, treat our youngest and weakest members.

With both of his parents' homelands at war, 14-year-old Alem is persecuted because of the family's mixed nationality; his Ethiopian father and Eritrean mother decide that their son will be safest abroad. As the novel opens, Alem's father brings him to London \"on holiday\" and then abandons him, leaving only a letter to explain his reasoning. While Alem's parents fight for the unification of Ethiopia and Eritrea thousands of miles away, Alem must mount a battle for political asylum. After being moved from an institution to a more welcoming foster home, Alem musters an army of friends and compassionate social workers who help him combat a cold and impersonal system. Rather than delving deeply into his protagonist's emotions, the author adopts a relatively objective stance. Readers see Alem's reactions from the outside, not as an internal process, as the government initially refuses to grant him asylum and later, when both of his parents are killed (his mother in Africa, his father in London). While audience members may feel distanced from the young hero, they will be outraged by the injustice he confronts and moved by the tragedies he endures.

Blackard, created the Language of Listening parenting approach and founded the Language of Listening company for parenting and personal growth. Her handbook, SAY WHAT YOU SEE for Parents and Teachers, is a 2012 NAPPA Gold Winner (National Parenting Publications Awards). She is also co-author with Drs. Landreth, Bratton and Kellam of Child Parent Relationship Therapy (CPRT) Treatment Manual (Routledge 2006). Sandy’s down-to-earth perspective helps adults see the world through the child’s eyes, making sense of what children say and do. Her writing makes complicated psychological concepts seem virtually self-evident. After receiving a master’s degree in art conservation, Sandy worked at the Kimbell Art Museum in Ft. Worth, Texas, restoring paintings. The hours spent pouring over a microscope determining what was original and what was not honed her skills of scientific observation, which became the cornerstone of her future work in parenting and personal growth.  Later, she became an independent collection preservation consultant, so she could work from home and raise her daughters, Colleen and Betsy. Faced with the challenge of parenting two children 18 months apart, she sought the assistance of a world renowned play therapist who became her mentor, Dr. Garry Landreth, founder of the Center for Play Therapy at the University of North Texas, Denton. His approach so radically transformed her understanding of children, that her overriding thought was, \"Why doesn't every parent know this?!!\" She spent the next 20 years dedicated to that mission. Through relentlessly sharing and refining what she learned - like how to help previously clinging Colleen skip off to Kindergarten without looking back, and help 3-year old Betsy go brush her teeth without crossed arms or a defiant, “No!”— the Language of Listening approach was born. It’s a unique blend of proven parenting skills, play therapy principles, and scientific observation presented in a simple three-part model that always starts with saying what you see and ends with finding strengths regardless of the behavior. Sandy and her family now call Austin their home. She frequently leads parenting classes at Austin Montessori School and is available for private coaching and speaking engagements.

Feeling the need to find the truth, Mo assists and shares information with Detective Lashandra Cooper, who is perhaps a bit too willing to include Mo in the investigation. Was Father O'Bannon murdered for his religious beliefs, or his resistance to the idea of a proposed highway expansion? Or was the reason more personal? Grounding her story in the daily life of a small town near Madison, the author weaves the running of a community newspaper through the plot as well as the animosity between residents who want progress and those who lobby for the status quo. Mo makes an appealing heroine. A devout Catholic who obviously cares about her fellow citizens, she must cope both with her nonbelieving husband and with the ongoing lifestyle adjustment brought about by her move from Chicago to Wisconsin.

Her spirituality, called the Little Way, was based on complete trust and childlike confidence in God. She spent nine years as a religious and died at 24 of tuberculosis. During the last two years of her life, she suffered overwhelming doubts against the faith, but persevered in her belief and in the performance of her duties as a nun.  After her death, she was quickly canonized and was named patron of the missions in 1927 and, in 1944, was made the patron of France. Pope St Pius X declared St Therese the greatest saint of modern times, and Pope John Paul II made her the 33rd Doctor of the Church in 1997.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The foursome sets off to their new life on the plantation-managed by the dashing Mike Devlin-where reality, alternately harsh and pleasant, sets in. Meanwhile, counterpoint passages tell of the indentured South Sea islanders who labor on the region's plantations, particularly of one Talua, aka Joseph, son of a chief and considered by his fellow islanders to be a god. Back at the plantation, manipulative Sylvia has a mad affair with Corby during Jessie's advanced pregnancy, while further complications-criminal, financial and romantic-ensue. Heaping on the melodrama, and weaving in Talua/Joseph's troubles as the thread that binds the historico-political background to the plot, Shaw keeps the reader's interest high.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B007KTLSY6"], "rank": 1096050, "title": "Cry of the Rain Bird: A mesmerising Australian saga of love, intrigue and betrayal", "author": "Patricia Shaw", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Christian Ashley truly has a gift for the visual, and it was a joy working with her on the Dignity book trailer.

Ai Weiwei is both very famous and very hard to pin down, a modern Chinese artist of international renown whose art you cannot find on display in China. A blackjack guru, photographer, dissident, architect, cultural critic, and high-volume tweeter. He is also a man who, on April 3, 2011, was whisked away by Chinese authorities and disappeared for 81 days. Wyatt Mason, a contributing writer for theNew York Times Magazineand a contributing editor atHarper's, goes to China to track down Ai, but finds himself struggling, though a stifling, smog-laden Beijing summer, to find someone who will even mention him. Mason's ultimate goal is a meeting with the artist, but speaking to Ai, who is under house arrest and forbidden to talk with foreign journalists, is not easy. In fact, just finding his world-famous art studio is not easy. On his journey, Mason uncovers some of the simmering societal tensions in modern day, urban China. --Benjamin Moebius", "related": [], "rank": 1614442, "title": "The Danger Artist (Kindle Single) (GQ Books) eBook", "author": "Wyatt Mason", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Generally, they had strong beliefs against the validity of any phenomena that did not fit their scientific paradigms. So, I set out to create a scientific explanation of ESP phenomena. The product of all this thinking is the book, \"Science, Remote Viewing and ESP: Beyond Einstein's Horizon.\" I decided that we live in an eight-dimensional space time. We can do mind-to-mind communications over great distances and perceive events through shortcuts in that space time.

For such a short collection, it weighs mightily. These are stories of the hopeless, of the down and out, of all the outcasts and forgotten men that ghost through every city across America. More than that, these are men who are haunted, often by the extreme violence of war. Within these stories, mercy is death, rather than forgiveness or salvation. For these men, escape into nonexistence appears to be the goal, even as they hold on, almost lazily, reluctantly, confused as to why their hands shake though their mind's been made or how they somehow forgot to load the gun.It brought Thom Jones to mind, as I think they write about similar people, though, if possible, Cox gets darker and somehow never feels forced, almost as if he casually sits amongst the demons, mocks them even as they prod at him viciously, endlessly. These stories carry [shattered] souls within them, so far from sunlight that they're unaware how the darkness grows and consumes them. Too, along with Jones, I'm reminded, at times, of Camus'The Strangerand Meursault. I would say, though, that Cox writes, really, like neither. His prose is simple and bare with touches of the poetic. At times it may stumble or feel a bit clumsy in the mouth, against the eyes, but that, somehow, never manages to diminish the power of the stories or distract the reader from what's important: the characters. A review by Edward J.

Just for a laugh Bakir thought he would attend one of the meetings in Brisbane of the main local Sci-Fi fan club. As he was a new member he was asked to stand up and introduce himself to the 200 odd existing members who were well into the wine and beer and weren't too sober anyway.His talk went like this:........ \"Hi, I'm Bakir Breezlebob and I come from a planet on the other side of the Milky Way.\"(The whole audience clapped because it was nice to have one of their own among them.).......... \"I came in a starship and the journey should have taken 3 of your weeks but we had engine problems so it took us 50 years.\"At this point one of the audience inquired if it was the negatron plasma flux generator that had played up.......... \"No, it was a faulty spark plug and we didn't have any spares.\"Of course the whole audience immediately felt an empathy here and shook their heads knowingly as it was obviously stupid to start an intergalactic journey without spares........ \"But we eventually made it and my wife and I are very happy to be here among fellow aliens.\"This quite naturally drew spontaneous applause which made Bakir feel quite good........... \"We've been sent by the intergalactic federation to give you earthlings a seriously profound message.\"The entire audience went suddenly silent and leaned forward in their chairs to hear the most important message ever delivered to the human race. This was obviously going to be a traumatic event and the excitement level became so high that two members immediately dropped dead from heart attacks........... \"The message from the intergalactic federation is..... 'GET STUFFED'...... which I don't personally understand but you earthlings might.\"The audience looked alternately confused, insulted and enlightened. In the finish their faces lit up in awe. I mean how many humans were privileged to receive such a profound personalized message? This Bakir fellow was obviously sent down to sort things out, more or less the same way that Moses came down from the mountain with the Ten Commandments.It was a dramatic occasion and the audience immediately doubled their alcohol intake in a frenzy of wild celebration. The two corpses were quietly removed and dumped outside in analleyway alongside the brothel next door where people expect this sort of reaction from older over-excited males.Bakir of course was delighted with this response and decided to rave on further........ \"The federation says that you must sort your affairs out, rationalize your behaviour and eat less pizza\".This naturally sent the audience into wild spasms of orgasmic delight as a lot of them found pizza too greasy anyway........ \"We have been sent to give you these vital messages partly because they are of critical importance to the human race but mainly because we had a lot of spare time anywaywith nothing else to do.\"......................................", "related": ["B009MQDIV6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

During those lonely days he somehow found a way to turn things around, boot-strapping himself up out of the social gutter.  Step-by step he made small but significant breakthroughs… asking a girl out, going on a first date, trying for a kiss, awkwardly fumbling around for love and affection. Fighting his way through the endless recriminations that followed every rejection, Mike finally made it beyond his toxic shame to ultimately defeat an incredible case of rejection phobia.  His books share the insights, solutions and work-arounds that he managed to develop for himself to eliminate the types of typical problems that shy and introverted men everywhere find themselves dealing with. Mr. Pilinski's careful comprehension and treatment of these deeply troubling issues are what makes his work stand out among the sea of boring, repetitious, copy-cat writing in the dating field.  You'll also enjoy Mike's humorous and irreverent writing style.  You'll laugh, cry, pound the wall... but most of all thrill to a journey of self-discovery that you will never soon forget.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A singular event during one of her journeys in 2003 triggered a powerful vision of a previous incarnation as Veronica, cousin to Jesus of Nazareth. Initial disbelief dissipated as she began to chronicle her memories, and the details of that time came alive for her. The \"Veronica\" series places the life and teachings of Jesus within the cauldron of social and political ferment under Roman rule. The books reveal that his success came with the assistance of guides and teachers not just in Judea, but from many different lands and traditions, and highlights the vital role played by the women in his life. It is Jacelyn's hope that the readers of this series will find a deeper, richer and more satisfying account of the life and teachings of the man Jesus ... and in this revelation discover tools for living a happier and more powerful and fulfilling life themselves.  A former diplomat, Jacelyn served in U.S. Embassies in Brazil, Japan and Portugal. She left the Foreign Service to focus on her passion for writing and teaching. Along with Tai Chi and Chi Gong, she has taught a wide range of esoteric subjects, voiced audio books for other authors, and led retreats and group tours to sacred spots around the world. She looks forward to sharing her vivid recall of this seminal lifetime as a pathway for others to recognize their own magnificent histories, and their highest potential in the world today.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ranging across seven decades of struggle and resistance, courage and cowardice, success and failure, Jeffrey L. Littlejohn and Charles H. Ford manage to capture the complexities and ambiguities of the local scene without losing sight of the larger racial, urban, economic, and political issues that complicated and often hindered the pursuit of educational equality and social justice in modern America.(Raymond Arsenault,University of South Florida St. Petersburg)In this book, Littlejohn and Ford offer a well-reasoned account of a vitally important component of Virginia’s experience of Massive Resistance. In tracing the long debate about busing, white flight, and educational equality, they also raise some original questions about resource allocation and the significance of interracial interaction in the face of impersonal trends such as suburbanization and deindustrialization.

In 2001 my family and I moved to Tucson, AZ where we now reside.  Once my youngest child entered Kindergarten; I went back to school and obtained my Bachelors in Psychology because I had a passion to help others.  I have always loved to write and won my first writers contest when I was in the 5th grade. That same year I received a typewriter for Christmas and have been writing ever since. Over the years I continued to write in my spare time but in 2009, I was laid off from my job and also lost a dear family member. I knew it was time to follow my heart and I began to write again, but instead of just for fun, I wanted to do it as a career. I took a couple writing classes at my local community college and then went on to self-publish my first novel EPIPHANY IS MINE in April of 2011. EPIPHANY IS MINE was my starter book since I had written many stories but never a book.  I received great reviews and was motivated to continue writing and follow my dream of being a full-time author. EX-BABY MOMMA’S CLUB let my creative mind take me on a journey that wouldn’t allow me to put my laptop down. I was excited about writing EX-BABY MOMMA'S CLUB because I felt I now had a direction that I could write on a more accomplished level and had achieved what I set out to do. In EX-BABY MOMMA'S CLUB you will see how my passion for writing translated into characters you won't soon forget.  I love reading, writing, and taking mini vacations with my family.  My favorite male author was E. Lynn Harris, may he rest in piece and my favorite female author is Mary Monroe but I love reading so there are so many more on my favorite authors list. I am inspired by anyone who has the mind to sit down and put a story into words. I thank God for my gift to write and my family, friends and avid readers for their support of my dream.

My tutor who was also trying to get a children's book published said I'd get there before him. He was a great tutor.Now , having spent time working in children's homes and with disenfranchised and special needs children I love telling the stories which will inspire children to read. First with and adult's encouragement and eventually by themselves. I think children love dialogue, playful and expressive characters and vibrant colours. They also have an acute eye for details and when I worked in schools were the first to spot if I lost an earing despite my long hair. I have tried to incorporate all these factors in my books plus a positive caring attitude towards other people which most children share automatically but a few need reminding of now and then.Children are my worst critics but also my most devoted ones and I will continue to write books for their enjoyment, since their delight is the greatest motivation any writer can have.Yours Viv", "related": ["B004CRTE36"], "rank": 4120940, "title": "Fairy Stories (book 1) - The Christmas Fairy eBook", "author": "Viv Rosser", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But her life still consists of waiting (for her boyfriend, for customers) and hiding (from the cops). Her agency, cramped by life both in and out of prison, is forced to reside in her impetuousness, her salutary arrogance, and, most significantly, in the way she frames her own experience—that is, in the prose we're reading, which is hard-boiled, funny, sometimes gross, oscillating between indolence and intensity, riddled with ellipses and exclamation points. It is wayward, hard to pin down; it can't be forced to behave. —Elizabeth Schambelan", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book takes us through the\nnext step of the writing process - publishing. Once our book has been edited to\nperfection, it's time to ship it off to the publisher. The first thing Kelley\ntells us to do is type up the final version of the book and add illustrations.\nDepending on what type of book you write and for what grade level, you may or\nmay not have to do illustrations. In this book, for instance, Kelley adds\nillustrations to each page by Milena Radeva. Radeva's colorful images brighten\nup each page and add more to each poem. Radeva has illustrated Kelley's\nprevious books so it's a pleasure to see her drawings here once again.Next, Kelley goes into selecting font type, size, and\nplacement. She does this wonderfully, playing with the pages to show different\nideas to the reader. She emphasizes the importance of these tools to make the\nstory come alive. After the font and illustrations are done, Kelley talks to us\nabout the book cover. This is the big one. The cover needs to catch the\nreader's eye and the title needs to draw the reader in. As Kelley says, it\nshould be something short and sweet. The reader is like a fish and the cover\nshould hook and reel you in.After all this, the final step is presenting but... that's\nanother book. I look forward to finishing the series!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Involved from the earliest days of the Galaxy's Greatest Comic, he co-created Judge Dredd, as well as a whole cast of other memorable characters. His Paradox Press graphic novel A History of Violence was made into a major film by director David Cronenberg, and Judge Dredd adapted into a film twice, most recently in DREDD by Alex Garland and Pete Travis. br With over 300 2000 AD stories to his name - not to mention over 250 Daily Star Judge Dredd strips - Alan Grant's prolific creative record speaks for itself. Outside the Galaxy's Greatest Comic, Grant is well-known to Batman fans following a lengthy run on various incarnations of the title, as well as his work on Lobo, Tank Girl and The Terminator. He has also adapted Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novels Kidnapped and Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde in Graphic Novel format with artist Cam Kennedy. His television work includes scripts for the BBC series Ace Lightning and the Carnival of Doom.Perhaps the most popular 2000 AD artist of all time, Brian Bolland's clean-line style and meticulous attention to detail ensure that his artwork on strips including Dan Dare, Future Shocks, Judge Dredd and Walter the Wobot looks as fresh today as it did when first published. Co-creator of both Judge Anderson and The Kleggs, Bolland's highly detailed style unfortunately precluded him from doing many sequential strips -- although he found the time to pencil both Camelot 3000 and Batman: The Killing Joke for DC Comics.Ron Smith drew many 2000 AD stories including some of the epic Judge Dredd tale The Day The Law Died. His other work for 2000 AD includes Chronos Carnival and Tales of The Doghouse. br Since his Future Shock debut in Prog 37, Brett Ewins has been one of the Galaxy's Greatest Comic's most beloved artists. Co-creator of the classic Bad Company, Ewins has also contributed to A.B.C. Warriors, Judge Anderson, Judge Dredd, Rogue Trooper, Ro-Jaws, Robo-Tales and Universal Soldier. Beyond 2000 AD, Ewins was a co-founding editor of Deadline magazine, and co-pencilled and inked the hugely acclaimed Skreemer series, which he co-created with writer Peter Milligan. He also created Johnny Nemo, which was released by Cyberosia Publishing in the US.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This complex story follows the titular character on his journey to find the fairy spirit which caused him to be so overcome with physical longing in the first place. His adventure takes him through the country of Ireland which is described in a thoughtful and beautiful way, ranging through both place and time as the story meanders on across the lush green landscape. The tale is full of quite a number of characters and interesting happenings, amusingly filtered through the lenses of romance, comedy and magic.Donoghue has worked a great deal of material into this book, filling its pages with humor and adventure, whiling also slipping in scenes of eroticism and violence. Although the main character is a tiny little leprechaun, it is not a book for young readers; rather the narrative is a somewhat complex one that should be tackled by adults who enjoy a comical tale told in the scope of a magical place. The story does jump around a lot, but the characters and storyline that Donoghue has crafted are creative and imaginative enough to keep the reader entertained. By reading this work, it is easy to tell his great love for Ireland, which is so lovingly defined throughout the book.

I have always prayed and dreamed of being a published author.

I wrote and directed an independent feature film for Vestron Pictures, Going Back, starring Bruce Campbell. The film did well in the market. I followed up with a children’s book, Two Stones and recently completed a commercial adult novel, An Attraction Beyond Vows. I have taught at the high school and university level, and I currently write for ArtHopper.org a web site where I write reviews of art exhibitions in the Midwest. For published work: Art Reviews: http://arthopper.org under the name Ron Scott  Film: http://www.goingbackthemovie.com Book: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/two-stones/id430675735?mt=8 I graduated from Wayne State University with an MA in Painting. I attended London Film School and then started writing for film and educational television. I have been producing art in the Detroit area since 1968, and this includes producing fiction and visual art using a variety of different media. I was born in Detroit, and I have resided, gone to school, and published extensively in Detroit. I have always considered myself part of the Detroit Art Community. I wrote a short story and then expanded it into an original screenplay in 1982. Going Back was produced in 1984 as an independent feature film and was immediately pick up by Vestron Pictures in 1985. At the time, I was writing and producing television for public schools and Michigan State University. This became the foundation for the development of my writing skill. In the mid 1990's I wrote a short story, Two Stones, that went on to be published in 2004. I have published a short story collection: Beyond’s Young Adult short stories cross cultures and take place in settings from North America to Europe. A metaphysical / religious motif binds the collection, and stories are set in times dating back to 1932—when swing dancing was the rage—to a recent state science competition in New Mexico. “Play” deals with a girl’s attempt to mitigate her feelings about violence in the home; in “Callanish Stones”, a young boy is found on a remote beach in Scotland, barely alive; “Finding Edith Allen” centers on a young woman in search of her birth mother; and “Mont. St. Michel” tells the story of a child raised by a Bishop in France. The stories mix male and female protagonists with families and friends, often in school or religious settings. Beyond is a collection of 11 stories with a word count around 70,000.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although they follow a definite pattern (as is the case with episode's)\neach episode is written as a stand-alone story in its own right - so don't be\nafraid to 'jump in' anywhere along the line.Aviemore, the small town at the centre of\nthe story, is very much a real place and certainly worth a visit if you are\never in Scotland. Indeed, most of the places mentioned in the stories are in\nfact real places, though the names may have been altered for privacy's sake.\nThe green lochan for instance is a fantastic place for a picnic - and it is\nactually an opaque green colour. Do fairies really wash their clothes there?Although these episodes are categorised as\ncontemporary romance, I have to admit that there is as much action and\nadventure included, especially in the later stories. Contemporary romance it\nseems, is a little more 'gritty' these days than Sally and Robert would be\nhappy with - the Highland idea of morals a little more adverse to 'getting you're\nkit out' perhaps! Subsequently 'adult' content is only included where it actually\nplays a part in the overall story - if you're looking for gratuitous hot and\nsteamy sex scenes - these stories are perhaps not for you!I have visited and stayed in Aviemore many\ntimes, and continue to do so whenever I get the chance. It is a quiet peaceful\ntown, surrounded by spectacular mountains and beautiful highland scenery. - Ideal\nfor long walks and planning the next Sally book! This Highland town is popular\nboth in summer and winter for the many outdoor pursuits available; with Skiing\nin the Cairngorm Mountains, being the\nmajor draw over the winter period.Through these stories, I invite you to share\nand experience (albeit vicariously) the life of Sally and Robert, along with\ntheir growing family; as they settle into life in the highlands of Scotland. Encountering\nadventure and tribulation as well as love and romance - even murder mystery ! - life's twists and turns ensure that drama\nand intrigue, are never far away from the Lindsey household.", "related": ["B00B8RJNU2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is what so much science fiction tries to be but fails. The plot is intricate and ambitious, but woven with such skill that it never even begins to unravel. Stefan Vucak wields words as effectively as the characters in the book wield their weapons, and that is with painstaking attention to detail and considerable suspense.SERIAL SCIENCE FICTION REVIEWS: ****In the Shadow of Deathis a great book with marvelous descriptions, characters and plot structure. I found it to be very fast paced, so pay attention. If you don't, you may endup lost, for the cast of characters is very large. With that said, I look forward to reading more from Stefan Vucak.SHARPWRITER REVIEW:If you enjoy the wheeling and dealing of intergalactic politics, spiced heavily with betrayal and intrigue, you will enjoy this story. Stefan Vucak has written an excellent tale that leaves you wanting more, and be assured, more is on the way.

InThe Phoenix Reich, college studentMax Meyersis the central character, with a \"voice\" that should resonate across theYAspectrum, including middle grade readers who are up for a longer read. Parents looking to entice boys into reading more books should check it out as bad language is kept to a minimum and Max--while remarkably fearless and ready to rise to any occasion--has some moments of worthwhile reflection.The Phoenix Reichis aHardy-Boys-Meets-Indiana-Jonesnovel that will likely have a long run as a YA favorite.Lisecdoes a great job of defining characters; each of the trio is consistent and interesting. The Australian soldier of fortune sports a steel boomerang and frock coat; I voted him most likely to transfer well to any future comic version of the book.Good characterizationsinclude the secondary characters. The Nazi bad guys, and their unexpected cohorts, are delightfully deluded.Strong atmosphericshelp, as well. Without giving away any spoilers, let's just say that there is a scene in an old church where Max makes an unpleasant discovery, but in the process puts his foot through a wooden panel depicting Hitler as a religious figure. Great imagery for a great plot line. Lisec did his history homework for the book, working inWWIIdetails, plus offering the reader a sprinkling ofGermanwords and phrases that help define speakers and give a good sense of location when the action moves to Germany.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 13, "rating_average": 4.4615, "rating_total": 58.0}

His book on the controversial Eugene Terre’Blanche was also translated into English, while Facing Surgery with Christ is aimed at cancer patients. His collection of short stories, Imagine: Africa!, received most favourable reviews.  His short stories appear regularly in two prominent South African magazines and he maintains a story-a-day blog on Wordpress. Living alone in a nature conservation area, he still dreams of producing the Ultimate Novel.  65 Shades of Guilt was instigated by e-Books for Africa’s Marinda Ehlers, who also edited the book. The story is based on conversations with older men during the author’s years as a urologist. These consultations contributed to his understanding of the surprising sexuality of older men, who rarely admit to the many fantasies they enjoy when a young lady walks by. These flights of fancy, fortunately, remain just that (well, almost always, anyway). As an introverted romantic fatalist, Amos still believes a story must leave the reader with a tear, a smile and a far-off look; preferably all at the same time. Readers are invited to follow Amos on Twitter.

I was a complete loser with women in high school. And college. And for all of my 20's. I was a decent looking guy, ran my own business, but couldn't for the life of me attract women. Even if I got a first date on occasion, I never, ever got a second date. I got lots of safe hugs, but I simply could not get any results with women and it drove me crazy. One day several years ago, I was at a business event, listening to short, fat, dumpy, 50 some-odd year old guy give a talk about advertising, and it was fascinating. But what was even more fascinating was the reaction of all the women in the audience to this man who, quite frankly, looked like a basset hound. They all rushed the stage, vying for his attention, and I watched him take 3 phone numbers of the hottest, smartest, most desirable women there. What did this fluffy hound of a human being have that I didn't? So, I cornered him and convinced him to have dinner with me that night. After some prodding, he finally shared his secrets, secrets he'd been wanting to reveal for a long time. What he told me was amazing. He'd spent years in advertising, convincing people how to buy stuff, when one day a light went off in his head--he could use what he learned in advertising to attract women, and it worked like a charm. In fact, it worked too well because he met too many women too fast who wanted to \"get with him,\" that he ran into a whole host of other problems. I listened intently, and took note after note, vowing to apply what \"The Hound\" taught me in the real world, and wow, did it ever work. I went from zero to hero with sexy women in no time flat, and never looked back. In fact, I got so good, I decided to carry on the work of \"The Hound\" and started a business teaching men how to attract women. I started in May of 2004, and it's been a smashing success, with lots of men duplicating what he taught me. It's, finally, time for me to tell my story and share my secrets. I have created a book series that reveal step by step how any man can attract the women you really want, no matter your looks, age or income in a way that makes women incredibly happy. Each volume covers a specific strategy of attraction, plus tells part of my story, so I highly advise you take action and invest in each one.", "related": ["B00ESJ3N7G"], "rank": 919800, "title": "The Forbidden Attraction Secrets of the Infamous Don Juan (Bad Boys of History Book 1) eBook", "author": "John Alanis", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was taught a lot during those years, through his mentor, Pastor Earl Anderson, who fed John's unquenchable thirst for knowledge that burned in his spirit as he read God's Word. In time, John ministered to inmates in the Limestone County jail, had a television ministry, as well as ministering online. He decided to write a book explaining everything that he learned while in the ministry, in an effort to help people who are searching for information about Spiritual Warfare. When John first began in the ministry, he found very little information here and there on Spiritual Warfare. He believes that this book will present a wealth of information, not only from what he was taught studied, and read, but also from his own personal experiences, for those who are seeking information as he did, when first getting started as well as help for those who are already in the ministry. John presently lives in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area, is married to Joann, with four sons between them. He is not presently in active ministry, although he had a website, Mark 1617.com for about 10 years, which had over one million page views every year during that time. He grew up in Louisiana and Texas, was raised as a Southern Baptist and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Education from the University of Southwestern Louisiana in 1976.

We must get our heads around the jargon and understand how the financial markets operate. Most important is that we have a feel for the history of markets in case we learn by repeating the mistakes of those who have gone before us.Next, we must learn how to analyse the economy and financial markets. There are cycles in economic activity that come around at varying time intervals. Unless we understand this, we are likely to find our investments badly damaged and struggle for years to recover to where we were before the last downturn.Then, we should learn how to analyse companies so that we choose good stocks to invest in when their prices are below their value. Above all, we must seek to buy stocks that afford a margin of safety, which will protect our portfolio if things do not go well for a while. An integral part of this is to have strong disciplines around risk management through diversification and position sizing.Most investors think this is enough to be successful, but one thing is missing. All investing requires making decisions in selecting and managing our holdings. It is never just set-and-forget, because markets are always changing. Much of our decision-making skill will be developed through experience, but if it was that simple, we would all be great investors after maybe 10 years or so of active investing. There are very few great investors in the world. They make better decisions than the average investors because they think differently.Think Like the Great Investorsexplains the cognitive biases that the most successful investors seem to avoid. It gives you a range of strategies to manage them and make superior investment decisions. This book will be one of the best investments you ever make.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He saw the need for informative picture books for children from the age of 5 to 10.  Married to Mary Ellen, they are the busy parents to four boys, Simon, Will, and the twins Jack and Thomas. Books are typically the first exposure to learning and art that children get which urges one to make the very best books possible. He understands just how important books were to his childhood. With them, he feels as if transported to some parallel universe, a world of grace, hope and wonder. Lionel said, “The boys want more than just picture books they also want to learn things they can tell their friends about.  Jack in particular loves learning new things.  He was sick of story books and wanted something a bit more challenging”. As the author of a few heavy historical novels he started writing children’s books for the boys not long after Will was born.  Being boys they wanted adventure and scary dragons. But after Jack and Thomas arrived Jack wanted to read ‘real’ books about ‘real’ things, not pretend stuff.  Not being able to find suitable books written to the capacity of a 4 or 5 year old, he started making little flip books on his computer and using pictures from magazines and photographs in his collection. He sent one of these books to his publisher who thought this a great idea and has since commissioned a series of books for this age group.  With the help of the boys he is currently working on several picture books about our land and sea animals. Lionel lives with his family, Billy the bitser, cats Ghost and Patch and assorted lizards and insects in Ho-Ho-Kus, a suburb of New York (Northern New Jersey-Long Island).", "related": ["B00FQQC6T6"], "rank": 2294450, "title": "Dolphins and Porpoises Children Picture Book: New Revised Edition.

As they ride through snow-covered woods, forest animals exclaim, “I want to play” until they are all riding in a “one-pony, one-mouse, one-bear, one-deer, one-lynx, one-owl, one-squirrel, one-dog sleigh” and get stuck in a snowdrift. A small mouse steps up to navigate as the others push the sleigh to the top of a hill, where they speed down, hit a bump, and crash. Cartoon illustrations in pen and ink convey the weight of the sleigh and depth of the snow. This tale has plenty of repetition, action verbs, and onomatopoeia and is well suited for reading aloud.

What followed was years of writing workshops as well as correspondence courses in writing for children through the Institute of Children’s Literature in Connecticut. She credits the award winning author, Troon Harrison, as the instructor who helped her find her literary voice. Marta’s first work of juvenile fiction, BEING SAM, NO MATTER WHAT was published in 2005, followed by EVERY WHICH WAY BUT KUKU! in 2006. With her more recent endeavors, Marta has shifted her writing focus to “women’s suspense”, a genre she fondly describes as having “strong female protagonists with closets full of nasty skeletons and the odd murder or two to complicate their already complicated lives”.

The poems cover a lot of emotions; forgiveness, hatred, betrayal, hurt, loss, growth, love, and hope and it helps readers who are looking for personal growth and optimism in their personal lives. All the poems lean more towards spirituality and devotion. The poems are honest and they make a good read during times of despair. Many of them can motivate readers undergoing personal crises and low phases in their lives.The first thing that is obvious in the poems is the poet's personal struggles and anguish and how it has influenced his perspective. 'The Next Beatitude' is beautiful, not only in terms of the content but also the formatting which adds to the visual appeal of the poem. The poem titled the same as the book is again another beautifully penned poem that is a depiction of the poet's wonderful imagery and is the highlight of this book. I want to share a beautiful verse from the book here for the readers to fathom the depth of the poet's soul:Sometimes God loves me.He reins melike a banner rainbow bright and beaming.Sometimes I weepand my heart breaksin a meteor invasion,shining light in tears,ﬁre streaked.The whole collection has poems that strike a chord within readers. The writer's feelings of personal pain and anguish are palpable in these poems. It is the very dignified and graceful work of a talented poet.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After having dinner with her neighbors, Liz finds out that there are ghosts, her ancestors, in her home and there's a curse that's been plaguing her family for centuries that has led to rape, murder and incest. With the help of her neighbors and relatives (both living and dead), Liz must end the curse and stop her restless ancestors, while revealing a few secrets of her own, and protect her nieces and future generations.The Genealogist's Guests pretty much jumps into the action right away. There's no excruciating background information to page through - the hauntings start pretty much right away. Not once did I feel bored while reading the book. As secrets unfold from both the living and the dead, the more suspenseful the book becomes. I found myself hurrying through the pages to find out what would happen next. Ann Simpson takes a unique perspective on the paranormal, with a family tree portal and each dead person having their own personal hell. I thought it was a creative, well written and entertaining story. I definitely recommend The Genealogist's Guests for a quick, thrilling read.", "related": ["B006XXJWFC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Gary Oldman’s turn as Dracula fostered a lifelong passion for Victoriana and the world of steampunk, but despite the fact that she specialised in history and literature, her one great love is for science. Nothing entrances her quite as much as theorising on all the mysteries our world has yet to reveal. Her interests in writing range from horror to erotica, taking in historical romance, steampunk and tales of the paranormal on the way; whatever she dreamed about the night before is liable to find its way onto the page in some form or another. Kate has had short stories published in anthologies by Angelic Knight Press, Sirens Call Publications, Pink Pepper Press, Cruentus Libri Press, Rainstorm Press, Scarlett River Press and Smart Rhino Publications.

Bella, his mother, was such a women. When her husband moved the family to Anaheim Bella hated it but went along with her husband.  Bella was lonely. She spoke up and the family moved back to Los Angeles. The move provided Michael with the opportunity to become better acquainted with his eccentric aunts and uncles. Every Sunday, the family got together to play cards, eat lox and bagels, and tell stories about growing up in Boyle Heights. Once a month, Bella took Michael to the “old folks’ home” in Boyle Heights to visit Grandpa Frank. In his nineties and deaf as a doormat, Frank would gruffly bark at Bella. Frank and Bella’s relationship was based upon a foundation of love and disgust. As a child, Michael clung to his mother’s apron strings but soon learned to love writing and public speaking. The confidence he gained eliminated his tendency to stutter. He had also discovered a wonderful means of self-expression. Michael attended college near his home. He loved learning, he didn’t care much for tests. His passion was making things happen.  He created an experimental college, leveraging the university’s resources to serve thousands from the surrounding community. After graduation, Michael traveled alone throughout Europe, then returned home to a job in publishing. He was unsure how he wanted to direct his future, and after a long illness, he returned to school to pursue his master’s degree. Even then, he knew he had yet to discover what he wanted to do in life. Eventually, he moved to San Diego, where he met Janice, the woman who was to become his beautiful wife. She and Michael raised their two children, Brandon and Erin, while building a successful business together. A woman of the twenty-first century, Janice was confident, aggressive, and determined. Michael couldn’t help but notice the contrast between his wife, who was able to make an exciting career for herself, and his mother, who suffered because the needs of those around her always outweighed her own. This observation compelled Michael to write Bella Will Rally, his first novel. In it, he imbues his fictional Bella with both his mother’s spirit and her struggles. His central character’s relatives are marvelously similar to his own mother’s family. The events and story are entirely a product of Michael’s imagination.", "related": ["B00KJK7DXI"], "rank": 3079631, "title": "Bella Will Rally", "author": "Michael Sedloff", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His passion for understanding human motivation, behavior and emotion led him to enter the field of psychiatry. Upon completion of his residency at Hillside-Long Island Jewish Medical Center, he stayed on for an additional year of a psychiatric research fellowship, focusing on a study of individuals experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia. Realizing he preferred to battle mental illness in the trenches, where help seemed most needed, he began working at a rural community mental health center in northwestern Vermont. He is currently a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Vermont and medical director at Northwestern Counseling and Support Services in St. Albans, VT. In this setting he treats patients presenting with a broad array of mental health and social issues. Patients with the most severe mental illnesses are often treated in community mental health centers, where the team approach and community support programs offer hope for recovery and a fulfilling life. Dr. Sobel believes strongly in the value of listening to his patients’ life stories. He hopes to convey the poignancy of such stories through these fictional accounts and to provide others with a better understanding of the nature and experience of mental illness.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He writes for the daydreamers, the losers, the cynics and the temporarily insane. His stories are full of restless energy and driven by a passion for the unorthodox. He loves writing characters on the fringe of society: the drifters, the knights errant, the down-and-out. In his spare time, Chris is an unapologetic geek, spending far too long wrapped up in sci-fi books, watching old kaiju movies and playing video games. He lives in the far away land of New Zealand, and is currently working towards a Master’s degree in Forensic Science. He doesn’t plan on growing up any time soon. Chris also writes crime and noir fiction as Harry St. John.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The plot of this contemporary horror novel follows Rob, a man whose occupation involves cremating the infected bodies of victims of the Necro-Morbus virus. He looks upon death and what lies beyond death every day, thinking his task is unpleasant, but simply a way to pay the bills. The story really takes off when Rob discovers his beloved wife Anna has contracted the deadly disease, and left his four-year-old son Sammy in a quarantined zone full of zombies in the process. Whilst Burn The Dead has all the action, suspense, gore and thrills that you would expect from a good zombie run-around, what really struck me about this novel was the sensitivity afforded to Rob as he learns to appreciate the happy family life he had after it is put at serious risk. Steven Jenkins's characters have reality and credibility that is often missing from this particular sub-genre of fiction. I found that I really had an emotional investment in Rob and some of the other supporting characters, even after only a few paragraphs of meeting them. As a fellow Brit, I was also amused and in agreement with Jenkins's reflections on the government's approach to the Necro-Morbus virus in his story and I think he makes a pertinent point about how the general masses treat a crisis that is only personal to a small few. Overall, a rip-roaring read, but also thoughtfully crafted and with true heart.
