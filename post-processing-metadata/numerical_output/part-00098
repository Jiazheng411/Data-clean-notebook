They find a recipe for chicken piccata with capers on the Internet and shop for the ingredients, picking up a package of long grain and wild rice, and the makings for salad as well.

The Love Chapter of the Bible paints a perfect picture of love. It reveals the ideal love for which everyone yearns. But the passage is not a fantasy of what might be nice. It is a serious essay on how love can be lived, describing qualities ordinary people can cultivate to build extraordinary relationships.Relationship experts Drs. Les and Leslie Parrott have compiled fifteen translations of 1 Corinthians 13 to inspire and teach anyone wanting to be a better lover. In the preface, the Parrotts describe love as the supreme good, a gift that lifts us outside of ourselves. They follow with meditations on very diverse translations and creative paraphrases of 1 Corinthians 13—from the 20th Century New Testament translation published in 1900 to The Message, published in 1995, from J. B. Phillips (1947) to The Living Bible (1979), and from the Basic Bible (1950) to the New King James Version (1979).This book makes a beautiful gift for engagements, weddings, Valentine’s Day, anniversaries, or any occasion when love is celebrated --Publisher", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Instead, we have a disciple's adulatory  1975 foreword, which merely parrots the same themes of mystery and  esoterica that are espoused in the book. Readers who are unfamiliar with  Hall's work will be at a loss in ferreting out which chapters have stood  the test of time and which have been vigorously debunked (like the one on  Islam, which actually uses novelist Washington Irving as a primary source  on the prophet Muhammad).... --From Publishers WeeklyInto this volume has been compressed the quintessence of a  colossal learning.

'I feel terribly conspicuous.' Embarrassment coloured her face almost as red as the outfit she was wearing.'Oh, lighten up, Emily. You look great.' Tom grinned at her. 'This is a costume ball for Dad's favourite charity, The Children of Africa's Guardian Angel Project; he would have appreciated the Devil and Angels theme. Dad had a great sense of humour. Remember Mum's fortieth when he insisted everyone dress as Knights and Squires? I think he would have seen the funny side…''All too well. Most of the women ended up looking like young boys, dressed in doublet and hose. I wondered at the time if Dad had secret gay tendencies,' she quipped and then turned her sparkling blue gaze on her sister-in-law, a petite gamine-faced brunette. 'But this is different, Helen. There is nothing funny about being squeezed into a red latex suit that is a couple of sizes too small. What on earth were you thinking of when you ordered it?' she demanded, and saw the mischief dancing in Helen's brown eyes and her lips twisted in a wry smile.Tom and Helen had met at university and had married two years ago at the age of twenty-three. They were now the proud parents of a one-year-old daughter, who had been born the week before Tom and Emily's father had died suddenly of a massive heart attack. The child was named Sara after their mother, who had died three years earlier after a long battle with cancer.'I don't know what you are complaining about. You look fine, and I went to a lot of trouble to get that costume in the right size. At four and a half months pregnant I am actually the same bust measurement as you and I tried it on to make sure it would fit,' Helen said with a grin.'Did it never occur to you that you're five feet nothing and I am five nine—that it would have to go a little further on me?' Emily groaned. 'You damn near broke my neck pulling the hood over my head. It is still aching.' She slipped a hand beneath the heavy fall of her hair and rubbed the nape of her neck to emphasize the point.'Don't blame me. If you had come back to London yesterday as you were supposed to, you would have had time to get your own costume. But instead you spent another day on site and only arrived a couple of hours before the event. Plus it is April Fool's Day,' she said with an impish grin. 'And be fair— I did cut the hood off and twist it into a braid so you could wear the horns as a head band.' She burst out laughing.Emily bit her lip to fight down the answering grin that threatened. She had totally forgotten it was the first of April, and Helen was right—she should have returned from Santorini yesterday instead of flying into London this evening. She really had no one to blame but herself, but she wasn't going to let her beloved sister-in-law off too easy.'Anyone with a grain of common sense would have ordered an angel costume for me. The same as yours, I might add. It is only logical that the women dress as angels and the men as devils. Like my idiot brother T—''Excuse me.'A deep, slightly accented voice cut into Emily's good-natured tirade. 'Hello, Tom, nice to see you again.''Anton, glad you and your friends could make it.'Emily looked over at her brother as he greeted the new arrivals he had invited to make up their table of eight.She glanced up at the man who had so rudely interrupted her. His back was turned to her and he was pulling out a chair for his companion, a stunning brunette who naturally was dressed like an angel in a diaphanous gold and white fabric that seemed to reveal a lot more flesh than Emily imagined any self-respecting angel would reveal.At least her outfit covered her from neck to toe, she consoled herself, though she had been forced to undo the front zip a few inches to prevent the damn thing crushing her chest so tightly she could barely breathe. It wasn't her usual style, that was for sure, but it didn't really faze her. She knew she had a decent enough body, she just wasn't used to displaying it quite so dramatically.'Allow me to introduce my friend Eloise,' the deep voice continued as the brunette sent a social smile around the table, 'and my right-hand man, Max.'Emily glanced at the middle-aged burly man and smiled in welcome as he took his seat at the table next to Helen. Then the stranger turned to her.'Emily, isn't it? Tom has told me a lot about you. It is a real pleasure to finally meet you. I am Anton Diaz.' A large strong hand was held out and she politely put her hand in his, while her mind busily wondered how Tom knew the man, and why her brother would have mentioned her to him.Then suddenly her mind went blank as a bizarre sensation a bit like an electric eel snaking up her arm had her skin breaking out in goose-bumps under the latex. Hastily she pulled her hand free and slowly looked up.Emily had a long way to go… He had to be at least six feet four, she reckoned, and then her curious blue gaze collided with deep brown eyes and she simply stared…The man was like a sleek black panther: poised, powerful and predatory.She grimaced inwardly at the fanciful notion, really not her usual style.The introductions moved on and Emily supposed she had made the right response, though she could not be sure. Her mouth felt dry and she had trouble tearing her fascinated gaze away from the tall, striking man.He was dressed all in black. A black silk-knit roll-necked sweater outlined the impressive musculature of his broad chest. A short black cloak covered his wide shoulders and flowed down like bats' wings to broad cuffs around strong wrists, set off by tailored black trousers. He should have looked ridiculous in costume like the majority of the people present. Instead, if ever a man looked like a devil it was this one…Dark and dangerous, she thought, her heart inexplicably tightening in her chest, and for a moment she had difficulty breathing that had nothing to do with the latex suit she wore.His straight black hair worn slightly longer than was fashionable was swept casually back off his broad forehead. Distinctive arched brows framed deep-set almost black eyes, high cheekbones, a large hawklike nose and a wide sensuous mouth completed the picture. As she stared his lips parted to reveal even white teeth. He was smiling down at her. She lifted her eyes to his and even in her stunned state she recognized the humour did not entirely mask the cool remoteness of his dark gaze.The man was not conventionally handsome, his features too large and harshly chiselled for classic male beauty.Brutally handsome…was a better description.There was something insulting about the way his dark eyes slid casually down to her cleavage and lingered for a long moment. But even as she recognized his insolent masculine appraisal for what it was her skin prickled with shocking awareness. The breath caught in her throat and she gave a shaky inward sigh of relief when he casually pulled out the chair next to hers, and lowered his long length into it.It could be worse, Emily told herself, at least with Anton Diaz seated at her side, she did not have to face him.Instinctively she recognized he was a man who was supremely confident in his masculinity and totally aware of his effect on the opposite sex, and discreetly she crossed her arms over her suddenly hardening nipples. A sophisticated charmer with an aura of ruthless power about him that would intimidate anybody, man or woman, she concluded. Not her type at all…Even so, there was no escaping the fact he was an incredibly sexy man, as her body's unexpected response confirmed.'I could not help overhearing your comment, Emily. Shame on you, your chauvinism is showing.' The devil spoke in a deep, dark, mocking voice that made her hackles rise.'What do you mean, Mr Diaz?' she asked him with cool politeness, flicking him a sidelong glance, and was once again captured by the intensity of his dark eyes.'In today's world of equality between the sexes isn't it rather politically incorrect to assume all the women should dress as angels and the men as devils? And, given the very striking outfit you are wearing, just a little hypocritical,'he drawled mockingly.'He has got you there,'Helen piped up and everyone laughed.Everyone but Emily.'My costume was my sister-in-law's choice, not mine. She has a warped sense of humour,' she explained, forcing a smile to her lips. 'And I see you are dressed as a devil, rather upholding my theory. Though you do seem to have forgotten the horns,' she prompted smoothly.'No, I didn't forget.

My father was interested in astronomy.  My mother's father, a lawyer in Alabama, was also fascinated by astronomy and worked calculus problems for fun; he also played piano and violin.  My parents insisted I take piano lessons for eleven year.  Thus began a multigenerational involvement with music, with my children's playing French horn, piano and violin, plus my grandchildren's playing clarinet, drums, and piano (one of them exceptionally well).  My first wife was my high school sweetheart.  She was unique in her Christian faith and exceptionally loving and caring.  She worked her way through college and became a teacher. Love for the outdoors led my wife and I to move to Alaska in 1969, with three children.  There I established a solo family medical practice.  I did family medicine with obstetrics.  Over the years, it evolved into the practice of adult medicine and geriatrics, with some nursing home work and endeavors pertaining to alcoholism.  We added two more children.  These B four sons and a daughter -- have produced twelve grandchildren B eight girls and four boys.  My oldest grandchild has two children, a boy and a girl; she has been teaching third and fourth grade for ten years.     My daughter became a pediatric and, later, a gynecological office nurse; my sons have exercised their college educations in diverse fields, quite successfully.  In Alaska, we lived the frontier life of hunting for meat, gathering berries, and gardening.  Fishing and landing my airplane beside the house were other aspects of our lifestyle I began to write while we were in Alaska and continued in earnest after we moved back to Florida in 1991.  My wife died in 2004.  I gradually realized that the thought of Socrates/Plato, along with theoretical physics, melded something like seamlessly with the Old Testament and the Gospel, as do other disciplines of humankind.  I have produced nearly five books in all, only one of which is finished. In 2005, I married another wonderful lady, a widow with a small family which has melded beautifully with mine.  She helps me with my books.  My Alaska son is building us a \"parents' cabin\" on his property.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A flu pandemic as a catalyst for global government? A string of geneticists mysteriously dying like flies? If one didn't know Sharon had independently published this book in 2003 before it was optioned by Whitaker house this year, it would be easy to believe that a novel of such contemporary insights was written as a reflection of recent headlines. No wonder RaidersNewsUpdate.com once referred to Sharon as a prophetess.One thing is certain. You'll never take a flu shot for granted again. Imagine germ warfare combining bird flu with Ebola that goes to work in minutes!As The Armageddon Strain unfolds, Dr. Maggie Taylor's father, a genetic scientist, passes away under curious circumstances. While coping with his tragedy and drudging through the pains of her imminent divorce, two men, both with different agendas, enter her life. Simultaneously an avian flu sweeps the country, and the epidemic shows signs of jumping the species barrier. How will the government contain the situation? Special implantable microchips with biowarfare applications have been designed that will be injected into the masses under authority of Martial Law. Homeland Security begins the vaccinations, called Project BioShield, employing contractors BioStrain and Grayson Labs. Yet something strange is up with those little chips.With this all–too–believable storyline in place, the author intersperses a fascinating high–level mix of education and entertainment, backing her assertions with copious research and thought–provoking questions told through a nail–biting action–adventure yarn that slowly questions the origins of the avian flu. Was it synthetically produced by a government cabal seeking to manipulate the modern world? A consortium of patriots believe this is true, and they arm themselves against the shadow government.Yet what if something even more diabolical is occurring? Bodies start turning up that appear to be – for want of a better term – victims of Spontaneous Human Combustion. Has something unknown unleashed upon the world; an invisible influence seeking to conquer, to control, to ultimately change God's creation?Behind the grotesque ballet of incomprehensible death, a police car's siren wails in sympathy as a pair of red eyes peer out from the netherworld, eagerly watching the raw pain of a crumbling world, and the spirit–creature behind the flaming eyes begins to laugh.Thus begins The Armageddon Strain, a take–no–prisoners, edge–of–your–seat suspense thriller, filled with thought provoking dialogue about how science might be manipulated by evildoers of both the material and spirit world into concocting a prophetic invitation for end times totalitarianism.Though a bit preachy in places and lulled with a few too many redundant cafe scenes, there's plenty here to keep the mind in high gear and the nerves on edge as the truly cyclonic novel unfolds.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sixth-grader Kevin is home alone in Dorchester, NY, when an arrow flies through the air, pinning his baseball cap to the wall. Imagine his surprise to find a man claiming to be Koh Chu-mong, the Great Archer from a Korean kingdom in the first century B.C., in his bedroom. Archer claims to have fallen off the tiger he was riding, and has somehow landed in Kevin's bedroom. Much humor comes from the clash of the ancient and the modern. Archer is amazed and at times frightened by cars (surely powered by dragons), telephones, the computer, lights, and even a bed. Kevin, the grandson of Korean immigrants, is an ordinary kid, bored by school, especially history class. He feels that he is very different from his father, a programmer at a local university who loves math and precision. However, the need to get Archer back in time makes Kevin step up to the challenge. He takes the man to the local museum, but that idea doesn't help. A suspenseful trip to the zoo to see the tiger seems promising, but that tiger is from India, not Korea. During their wanderings around town, Archer tells wonderful stories of Korean history and legend. Finally, Kevin uses all his powers of reasoning and deduction to find the solution to Archer's quest to return home. In the process, the boy learns that ordinary people can do extraordinary deeds and comes to appreciate his dad. Although perhaps not as great as previous, award-winning books by this author, this tender title is still most worthy of attention.Connie Tyrrell Burns, Mahoney Middle School, South Portland, MECopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

McClung (English/Mississippi State; The Architecture of Paradise, not reviewed, etc.) locates the citys failure as an urban and suburban environment in a longstanding and unresolved conflict between its two predominating visions of itself: Arcadia and Utopia. The first implies a found paradisefertile, hospitable, beautifulto be preserved, the second a tabula rasabarren, dangerous, uglyto be improved by means of technology. McClung attributes many of Los Angeless defining characteristics (infamous sprawl, architectural ambivalence, common apocalyptic fears) to the citys misconceived self-perceptions. Part of the problem, he suggests, is that Los Angeles is so unclear about its heritageHispanic or Mediterranean?and confused in its desiresurban convenience or pastoral repose?that it has evolved in an erratic, rootless manner. McClung develops this premise in five chapters covering the citys architecture, painting, literature, urban planning, and early propaganda. His argument is strongest when he looks at the citys architecture and design and weakest with literature. But even his most astute interpretations leave the citys irreconcilable central irony mostly untouched: the dependence of modern Los Angeles on a supply of water first imported in 1913 from 250 miles away, in a monumental feat of the technological imagination whose purposeto improve this paradise to the point of habitabilityblurred arcadian and utopian ideals once and for all. McClung brings fresh illumination to a stubbornly incomprehensible place in this provocative, if intermittently narrow, addition to Los Angeles literature.

In chapters that alternate between biographical text and question-and-answer format, Zapata, a longtime friend of Allende, creates a portrait based on her subject's memories and bons mots on love, family and writing. And perhaps because the two women are old friends, Allende's comments fly loose and easy. On her relationship with editors, Allende says, \"No one except my mother corrects my books.\" Asked to comment on her erotic experiences: \"Erotica? I don't know, my memories all blend together.\" On why women use little humor in their writing, she says, \"because we use ours up just surviving.\" And asked why she writes, Allende replies, \"Because I am filled with stories that demand to be told, because the words are choking me, because I like and need to write, because if I don't write my soul dries up and I die.\" Of particular interest is Zapata's commentary on Allende's poor reception in her native country. The novelist may be popular on several continents, but in Chile, Zapata says, critics view her as \"a Garc¡a M rquez epigone, simply a second rank writer.\" More personal profile than interpretive biography, this book is nonetheless full of meaty details that will interest Allende's fans and may be useful for libraries at schools offering courses on contemporary female or Latin American writers.

One by one, children disappear from the  area and Flavia and her friends decide to find out why. Woven into the mystery are problems and  issues of Roman life such as the abusive treatment of slaves and the class structure of the  patron/client system. The search for the missing children is fast paced and in several instances  peril seems imminent. Newcomers to the series may be a little confused by this one but fans will  enjoy it.Genevieve Gallagher, Orange County Public Library, VACopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's also a profile of sorts, the Jesus of the title providing the essay's ostensible subject, not to mention a few understated jokes. Without Jesus and legions of his fellow laborers, Graham suggests, \"our entire fantasy of individual and civic virtue would shatter like a broken mirror.\" One needs no green thumb to enter Graham's fecund garden of ideas, just an appreciation for an exquisitely woven tapestry of luscious language and ornate expertise.

And yet today banks still act with the same single-minded pursuit of profit that fueled the great recession. In this Kindle Single, Herbert Allison, former president of a Wall Street investment bank, reveals how America’s largest banks put their own interests above their client’s interest, how they quietly siphon half of an individual’s long-term savings, how they mine client information and convert it into profits through trading and advising activities, and how their business models periodically jeopardize their own survival while imposing huge losses on clients, shareholders, and the public. Allison also offers an 11-point plan to fix our banks. His common-sense solutions are sure to enrage bank leaders, while his exposure of bank business practices may leave readers with a certain disdain for megabanks. --Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00657YUNK"], "rank": 1221173, "title": "The Megabanks Mess (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Herbert M.

Readers find Billy sweltering in a tiny Arizona town with not much more than the dirty clothes on his back and eight dollars in pocket change. Hoping to turn his fortune around, he takes part in his first train robbery near his hometown. What starts off as a surefire way to get cash turns sour fast. Billy is recognized during the heist, and his cohorts are wanted criminals who try to cheat him. And the lawman responsible for bringing him to justice is his best friend and cousin, Willis Monroe. This twisting tale is full of horses, guns, greed, betrayal, regret, and love. A subplot featuring a feud between Willis and a local rancher gives the story an added dimension. Taylor's colorful descriptions and authentic language solidly anchor the setting in the Southwest. While at times slowing the pace, the character development and back story give the tale depth and complexity, which saves it from becoming a superficial shoot 'um-up Western. Taylor doesn't romanticize the events. Once Billy makes his decision to be a train robber and gunslinger, nothing, not even his winning smile and charming ways, can save him from his fate. An author's note explains Taylor's reasons for writing the story and gives a synopsis of the outlaw's real life. This story has definite appeal for readers interested in the era or those looking for a different kind of action book.-Catherine Callegari, San Antonio Public Library, TXCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Real characters, lighthearted and fun-to-read humor and bantering veil the surface of the plot with just the hint of an adult Nancy Drew mystery; missing anthropologist, mysterious professor, ancient artifacts, etc. By chapter 3 though, the veil quickly evaporates to reveal very real and very sinister events as the ship moves steadily into stormy waters and passengers begin to fall ill for unknown reasons. From here the plot darkens as it moves through a labyrinth of events where Mia and her husband find themselves abandoning the ship at the port of Haifa. Mia, believing they have escaped with their lives finds herself taken down into a subterranean cave and into a world of ancient horror. This novel has the elements that kept me turning the pages - suspense, intrigue, mystery - with characters and events provoking my emotions and my imagination. An excellent read. I'm ordering \"Asylum\" and I'm on the author's email list for her next novel pending. --Kindle review", "related": ["B00E5JZ09I"], "rank": 1286419, "title": "Primevil", "author": "Elizabeth Cameron", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Each contributes a generous essay presenting the merits of his own approach and offering a thoughtful rebuttal to the other's argument. If you’ve been seeking a concise introduction to the central debate in American constitutional theory, this is the book for you.\"—Gerald J. Russello,City Journal(Summer 2011)\"Solum and Bennett have produced a valuable book, particularly for students unfamiliar with the originalism versus 'living Constitution' debate and the literature it has spawned. . . . Rather than rehash their theoretical differences, the debaters thoughtfully weigh each other's arguments and acknowledge common ground, particularly regarding the limits of originalism in times of political or moral crisis and, more generally, the use of precedent in judicial interpretation. . . . This is an excellent resource; it includes an outstanding bibliography, and the authors discuss most of the true classics and key scholars in the field of constitutional interpretation. Summing up: Highly recommended.\" —Choice(February 2012)\"In a highly readable discussion, these two eminent legal scholars bring sophistication and nuanced insights to a perennially controversial topic.\" —Paul Brest, Dean Emeritus, Stanford Law School\"Constitutional Originalismis unique among books about its subject in adopting the debate format. It is refreshing to see a discussion of the connections between originalism and living constitutionalism developed by two authors who approach these issues from different perspectives but also find some common ground.\"—Keith E. Whittington, William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Politics, Princeton University, author ofConstitutional Interpretation: Textual Meaning, Original Intent, and Judicial Review\"Constitutional Originalismis a must-read for anyone interested in arguments over how to understand the Constitution.  In a highly sophisticated yet immensely readable point-counterpoint, Robert W. Bennett and Lawrence B. Solum offer powerful arguments for and against interpreting the Constitution on the basis of its original meaning.  Wherever one stands on the question, this book provides challenging new insights from the opposing view.  The debate over the merits of originalism is gaining new prominence in American law and politics, and no one on either side of it can afford to ignore this contribution.\"—Michael D. Ramsey, University of San Diego School of Law\"Anyone interested in how the Constitution should be interpreted must read this fascinating debate between Lawrence B. Solum, a leading theorist of originalism, and Robert W. Bennett, one of originalism's most fervent critics. As in a courtroom, after each clearly and respectfully presents his case, the reader gets to be the jury.\"—Randy E.

LetThe Eurodollar Futures and Options Handbookarm you with the latest knowledge on these important trading vehicles, and provide you with the strategies and techniques you need to make the most of this liquid and lucrative market.Today's Eurodollar market--the market for dollar denominated deposits outside of the United States--is perhaps the largest and most liquid of the world's short-term dollar markets and is becoming the new standard of value for fixed income markets. For over a decade, futures and options traders in this market have relied onEurodollar Futures and Options(by Burghardt, Belton, Lane, Luce, and McVey) for accurate market analysis coupled with solid, results-oriented trading and hedging strategies.  Markets have changed dramatically, however, and the need for a comprehensive new handbook has become obvious and acute.The Eurodollar Futures and Options Handbooktakes over where that book left off and incorporates all of the major advances in understanding how Eurodollar futures and options work and how traders and hedgers should use them. With contributions from Galen Burghardt, his colleagues, and collaborators, this hands-on volume focuses on every facet of this powerful market. It provides practitioners with practical, detailed discussions of:The Eurodollar Market--Growth, expansion, and consolidation of the interest rate markets * Key money market developments * The birth of Eurodollar futures * Exchange-traded money market futures and OTC interest rate swapsEurodollar Futures--The Eurodollar futures contract * Forward and futures interest rates * Hedging with Eurodollar futures * Pricing and hedging swaps * The convexity bias, with new convexity bias series * Measuring and trading term TED spreads * Hedging and trading with stacks, packs, and bundles * Hedging extension risk in callable agency notes * The S&P; 500 calendar roll * Trading the turnEurodollar Options--The Eurodollar option contract * Price, volatility, and risk parameter conventions * Caps, floors, and Eurodollar options * Structure and patterns of Eurodollar rate volatility * Trading with serial and mid-curve Eurodollar options * Relative versus basis point volatility, including volatility cones * Hedging convexity biasUntil now, most of the material in this book was available only in assorted and often hard to find research notes.  Eurodollar futures and options traders had to seek out special courses or know someone who had access to these notes.The Eurodollar Futures and Options Handbookcombines greatly improved basic tools and research applications with current research on Eurodollar futures and options, and saves you both time and money by giving you all of the important basic tools and applications in one comprehensive, accessible volume.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

You may know Dee and Marshall Saunders. They currently reside on Whidbey Island and own Penguin, a Newberry Port 52 sundeck trawler, previously docked in Roche Harbor.Dee and Marshall are inveterate and avid cruisers and fisher people, having circumnavigated Vancouver Island and cruised and fished from Desolation Sound to Southeast Alaska. They were not always power boaters, however, and Unsinkable is a remarkable story involving an incredible accident at sea while sailing their beloved sailboat, Clambake, a Tayana 52 sloop, from Mexico to Tahiti, and the even more incredible story of their recovery from that disaster.The acquisition of Clambake was the culmination of one dream (retirement) and the beginning of another (becoming live-a-boards and sailing to paradise). Marshall had sailed across the Pacific a number of times on other boats and he and Dee had set a goal of early retirement so that they could resume blue water cruising on their dream boat.The book chronicles their businesses successes and setbacks and their early sailing days prior to acquiring Clambake. With their goal in sight, and having a stroke of luck in finding the  perfect  boat, Dee and Marshall commenced the dual tasks of liquidating their business and preparing for the trip to Tahiti. They moved all of their worldly possessions aboard Clambake. After all, this boat was now their home.They were prepared for every eventuality   almost. The first night out, off the coast of Mexico heading towards Tahiti, on a warm, clear night, they were struck by a 700 foot long Korean freighter. Clambake went down in 90 seconds. The freighter kept going.Dee tells of the amazingly difficult rescue and what it was like to lose virtually everything, including their identities, and then climb back, along the way fighting a big Korean company, lawyers and insurance companies.They did persevere through courage and determination and they eventually did make it to Tahiti, although in a substantially different manner than they had planned.This book is just a darn good read. --Ron Einboden, AP", "related": ["B00B7N299O"], "rank": 1793110, "title": "Unsinkable eBook", "author": "Dee Saunders", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Readers find themselves questioning their own sense of right and wrong, attraction and desire.  The author believes that an erotic romance should first begin with romance and only then does she offers a look behind the closed doors to the passion. Kim Chambers lives in Cincinnati, Ohio where many of her stories take place.  She has a son and daughter, two dogs and a cat.  She writes in the genres of science fiction, youth, horror, street lit and poetry.  She is a member of several online role-playing groups and hosts several blogs.  In addition to writing, the author is also an artist, an introverted recluse, a self proclaimed empath and a foodie.", "related": ["B00JQS5FIO"], "rank": 389882, "title": "Wheels of Steel Book 2", "author": "Pepper Pace", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 72.0}

He stutters, does poorly in school, and has no friends, finding consolation in an abandoned churchyard and its environs where he watches birds and other wildlife.

He also finds a family of foxes, and when the vixen is run over, Billy rescues one of the cubs and runs away with it (aided and abetted here and there by the d.e.m.). Ultimately, Billy finds a home and a family, the fox returns to the wild, and the d.e.m., ``her mission accomplished at last,'' heads for the swannery. This is overwritten in spots and has other weaknesses to boot (Billy, portrayed as a keen nature observer, fails to notice the swan's bright red leg band for months). As it stands, this plot is too contrived to be convincing.

The author elucidates the criticisms of Gandhi by such contemporaries as Rabindranath Tagore and M. N. Roy, pointing out that neither man found a way to connect freedom and power as Gandhi did in his 24-day protest march in 1930 against the British tax on salt in India, and in his 1947 fast in response to communal violence in Calcutta. Dalton offers an intriguing chapter comparing Gandhi, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., and suggests that while King embodied Gandhi's tactics and Malcolm X traveled a similar journey of personal emancipation, neither managed to combine both swaraj and satyagraha . Dalton concludes by reflecting how Gandhi's example proves that political life can include ideals and truth.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I was hoping that this story would eliminate some of that hard way of learning for her.After I gave the story to her, it just sat in my files while I wished I could think of something good to do with it.About 9 years later my dear friend Kari read the story and for my birthday and hired an artist to illustrate it for me. She picked the perfect artist (as you will see) and in the process demonstrated love just as in the story.But, life continued and I never had time to package and publish it and another 7 years went by while this fable about love continued to wait in my files.\n And then love happened again.One Christmas I confided to my husband, Del, how every Christmas I would think how wonderful it would be to put this story together and give it to my family and friends, but it never happened because I never had the time to do it.Without hesitation, and all on his own, Del put aside his work and spent the next 5 days working on publishing the story for me. It was more beautiful than I ever thought it could be!That was how this story ended up in a PDF form, but it still wasn't accessible to everyone.Finally the gift of Ebooks arrived and now 24 years after writing it, we are publishing it for everyone to read.For me, this is a timeless story, I hope it is for you.It exists because of a love for my daughter, and love from the bears, and love from my friend, and love from my husband, and of course the story from Love Itself.I hope you and your loved ones enjoy it, and benefit from its telling.", "related": [], "rank": 804270, "title": "Love's Silent Sweet Secret: A Perception Parable About Love (Perception Parables Book 1)", "author": "Beca Lewis", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The stories she told in classroom grabbed her reluctant readers’ attention and guided her toward putting the stories on paper.  Her story lines and ideas develop by combining a dash of urban real life with great storytelling fiction and imagination.  E. Marie seeks to grab the reader, youth and adults alike, in the very beginning and continues to build momentum throughout the story in order to make the reading experience a joy for those who frown upon the pastime.  Her first book, To K(no)w Avail, won the 2011 Favorite Book of the Year honors with From a Writer’s POV Magazine.  E. Marie is a National Board Certified Teacher and a member of the National Education Association and Association of Supervision and Curriculum Development.  She and her husband Eric reside in Lumberton, North Carolina.", "related": ["B00K91TWHW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cooper attended Yale, but was expelled in 1805 and spent five years at sea on merchant then naval ships. He married in 1811, and eventually settled in New York. Precaution, Cooper's first novel, was written in 1820 as a study of English manners; its successors, The Spy and The Pilot, written within the next three years, were more characteristic of the vein of military or seagoing romance that was to become typical of him. In 1823 he began the Leatherstocking Tales series of novels, centred on a shared Native American character at different periods of his life, for which he is chiefly remembered. Cooper's reputation as one of America's leading authors was quickly established, and spread to Europe by a long stay there from 1826, making him one of the first American writers popular beyond that country. After his return to America in 1832, however, conservative political essays and novels dramatising similar views, as well as critiques of American society and abuses of democracy, led to a decline in his popularity. James Fenimore Cooper died in 1851.", "related": ["B00J1IN4B4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I Googled it and saw that she was the first child executed in the United States. I tried to find information from various websites, but not much information is known about her or her life. I felt compelled to tell her story the best way that I could. Even though she committed an unspeakable crime, I wanted to know why she did it.What do you want your readers to know about Hannah?That history wasn't so kind to her for obvious reasons. I want the readers to realize that Hannah, like Eunice were just children at the time. Hannah didn't have the benefit of social services to help her nor did she have a parent in her life to steer her in the right direction. I want my readers to know that Hannah was just a child when she committed this crime. That doesn't absolve her of anything because she was aware that murder was wrong. She didn't have the support system that is required to raise healthy children, physically and emotionally.Tell us more about the process of writing a historical fiction novel.It isn't easy that's for sure. I did a ton of research on this book before I wrote one word. Since very little is known of her life before the crime was committed, I thought that I would fill in the details. The first half of the book focuses on the lives of Hannah and the family that she worked for to give the reader a taste of life in Colonial America.The second half of the book focuses on the crime that she commits but how Hannah faces her own mortality. Numerous sources talked about how Hannah was \"indifferent\" when it came to her execution: almost as if she didn't understand what was going on. Many people attributed it to her mental status but that explanation is far too convenient.I feel that at the age of twelve, one would worry about what would happen to them when they died. Hannah didn't have the benefit of a sophisticated mind to ponder this thought, nor did she have an adult leading her down the right path.In colonial America, Hannah wasn't a little girl, she was a simple servant...a possession.What is your stance on capital punishment?(smiles) Well I go back and forth with the issue all the time like many people. I can say that it definitely isn't a deterrent for people to not commit crime. If it were, we'd have less of it, not more. Colonial America was a very pious and strict place to live. Merely stealing, not going to church enough, or adultery could get you the death penalty in many situations: especially if it wasn't your first time committing the offense.What about James Arcene? Wasn't he the youngest? He was the youngest  sentenced to death but he didn't have a meeting with the\nhangman's noose until he was twenty three. That still makes Hannah\nOcuish the youngest child executed in the United States.Anything else?I just hope that I did Hannah's story justice.

This leaves poor parents wondering what on earth to do with their precious baby who so desperately needs sleep (and so do the parents!). Some advocate no crying - you must soothe your baby to sleep. But how long does this go on? Is this really the best for my baby? Then there are others who say you must let your child cry, no matter how long it takes. Parents shift uncomfortably as they read this. Can I really let my baby cry for hours? What will this do to him in the long run? I'm just not sure...Weary parents today wonder if there isn't a middle ground. Is there a way to let my baby get the sleep he needs while still meeting his needs for nurture and comfort as well? That's what this book is all about. It's about helping parents navigate the path to a well-rested, happy and healthy baby as well as a happy, healthy family too.

What inspired you to start writing about natural methods of stress relief?Women everywhere are experiencing severe amounts of stress in all aspects of their lives, on the job and at home. I see it all around me every day, and I know from personal experience that coping with stress is a difficult prospect. Unfortunately many turn to \"solutions\" that often do little to improve things and may even make their situation worse--drinking too much, using narcotics, or giving in to fits of anger; these things only hurt you and those around you and rarely do anything to actually address the situation that is causing stress.I discovered from my own personal experience that there are many positive and beneficial things that can be done to address stressful situations naturally. First of all, facing the situation and doing what you can to change it is vitally important, even if it means making long-term plans, long-term goals, and long-term lifestyle changes. That's why I decided to write about natural methods of stress relief, identify and expose the core causes and detrimental effects of stress for women, and share the high-performance strategies and techniques that women can use immediately to improve their lives. Natural methods work to relieve stress effectively and naturally.2. What are your best sources for coming up with tips to share with your readers (your own experience, research, suggestions from other people...)?My best resource is by far my own personal experience, as well as the experiences of the many women whom I have worked with in my professional life during the last 20 years. Women coping with divorce, family conflict, parenting challenges, financial tragedy, job burn-out and frustration; women who are overwhelmed by the pressures and anxieties of modern-day living. Really, who isn't stressed these days?But in addition to my own experiences, I also do a lot of research and reading on healthy living and wellness, not only focusing on physical wellness, but also on emotional and spiritual wellness. For women, emotional and spiritual wellness is supremely important for inner-peace, joy, and happiness.But more than just reading about healthy living, emotional wellness, and spiritual wellness, I work hard to apply what I learn.I used to be a stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed woman, but I learned how to slow down, re-organize my focus and priorities, and bring balance into my life. I discovered that there is a lot I can do to manage my stress levels and keep them within acceptable standards. When I see how natural stress relief methods work in my life, such as gardening, walking, juicing, proper time management and money management, camping, nutrition, aromatherapy, etc, I write about it so that other women can learn to implement these natural stress relief methods too. They really do work!3. In addition to your books, articles, and stress management for women ezine, what services do you offer in terms of personal support?I offer one-on-one support via email. I always answer emails personally.Most of the time when we are stressed, having someone to talk to goes a long way in helping to soothe frazzled nerves or just to help regain perspective and direction. Some women may not always feel comfortable opening up to family members, and others may live far away and isolated from family and friends, like I was for many years. Yet, via cyberspace, with the click of a button, you can connect with someone in a meaningful way that brings some perspective and peace to your life.Developing a meaningful support network is by far the single most important natural stress management strategy for women. The support network does not have to be big and extensive. It can be as strong as one person you can confide in, one pair of shoulders to cry on, and one pair of trustworthy listening ears.", "related": [], "rank": 3901084, "title": "Nutrition For Stress Relief (Self-Help Stress Solutions Book 2)", "author": "D.C.

The choreographed style of violence and 'obsessive' treatment of sexual parameters, seek to gratify both types of potential audiences. his novels are definitely not a pulp construction.Steve was a AS Film Studies Lecturer in the South of England and now enjoys writing, spending time with his family, supporting his beloved Queens Park Rangers and walking his two Black Pumas along the beautiful sandy beaches of the Isle of Wight, UK.

Her more recent Scriptural Rosary books are Speak, Lord, I am Listening (now in 2nd edition with Luminous Mysteries) (for Children, but adults love it as well) and The Suffering Servant's Courage (based on the virtue of Fortitude and Courage).Additionally, she wrote a book that was a departure from her works of Scriptural Rosaries but she continues in the genre of using Sacred Scriptures verses to support meditation during prayer - in this case, the Chaplet of Divine Mercy. This was set to music and is on the CD called Time for Mercy.A Scriptural Rosary based on the message of the sanctity and dignity of life was also written by Christine Haapala and is available on double CD.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Launched with enthusiasm in 1957, Plowshare attempted to utilize nuclear explosions for peaceful activities. The US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) ultimately conducted 27 underground nuclear explosions in a quest to create new elements for various purposes, build heat storage caverns, build canals, exploit minerals, and excavate roadbeds. Many projects were planned outside the Nevada test site, but opposition to all nuclear explosions was growing, and a serious effort to negotiate a nonproliferation treaty with the Soviet Union led to a moratorium on testing all nuclear bombs. Negative outcomes were replete; a gas-and-oil stimulation program attempted in New Mexico followed by a decade-long natural gas storage effort in Pennsylvania generated public concerns related to radioactive isotopes. Kaufman provides detailed accounts of sometimes misguided projects, answering questions of who, what, why, when, and where in an organized fashion. The book contains elements of a history book, a scientific thesis, and a good novel. Interested readers will return often to this book to review the complexities of underground nuclear testing. Summing Up: Highly recommended. Lower-division undergraduates and above; general readers.\"—Choice\"Kaufman's work is impressive as a narrative of the Plowshare program, and essential reading for those interested in nuclear history . . . he has produced an elucidating and stimulating work that is most highly recommended to all those interested in the age of atomic utopianism.\"—David A. Burke,American Historical Review(February 2014)\"Scott Kaufman's book on Project Plow­share is a tale of atomic bureaucracy, written in an evenhanded style, in which the aec tried against all odds to keep the program alive. . . . Scholars will findProject Plowsharea useful guide to the national and international politics of peaceful nuclear explosions.\"—Jacob Darwin Hamblin,The Journal of American History,(March 2014)\"Scott Kaufman has written a clear and compelling account of the Plowshare program. He provides a comprehensive analysis of Plowshare with extensive archival research, especially in material that has only recently been opened to scholars. While specialists will certainly be attracted to Kaufman's work, his clear narrative style will also allow the broader public to benefit from his insights.\"—Shane J. Maddock, Stonehill College, author ofNuclear Apartheid: The Quest for American Atomic Supremacy from World War II to the Present\"This book is the type that all scholars aspire to write, but seldom do. It is impressive in both its intellectual breadth and depth.Project Plowsharemakes important contributions to the fields of diplomatic history, the history of science and technology, western history, environmental history, presidential studies, and Australian national history. Scott Kaufman connects environmental history to diplomatic history—a relationship that might not seem obvious at first glance—and challenges conventions in both. This book will clearly be the standard account of its topic for several decades to come.\"— Nicholas Evan Sarantakes, U.S. Naval War College, author ofDropping the Torch: Jimmy Carter, the Olympic Boycott, and the Cold War\"Historians already knew about Project Plowshare. Until this book we didn't know how little we actually knew about one of the early Cold War's most infamous and intriguing nuclear programs. Based on extensive research, Scott Kaufman's book will be the go-to work on Plowshare for years to come.\"—Jeffrey A. Engel, Director of Presidential History Projects, Southern Methodist University, author ofCold War at 30,000 Feet: the Anglo-American Fight for Aviation Supremacy\"Project Plowsharerecovers a fascinating but forgotten strand of Cold War history, when the idea of nuclear explosions conjured up not only death and destruction but a future of technological achievement and progress toward peace and disarmament. In deft, fast-paced writing that draws on extraordinarily wide research, Scott Kaufman recreates the extraordinary vision of Plowshare proponents and their allies in Congress and the private sector, showing how their prospects and ultimate failure were shaped by politics and science, fear and hope, economics and Cold War competition. For anyone interested in the future of the planet, Project Plowshare's rise and fall offers salient lessons about unintended consequences, technological hubris, and balancing risk and promise.\"—Barbara Keys, University of Melbourne, author ofGlobalizing Sport: National Rivalry and International Community in the 1930s", "related": [], "rank": 2123382, "title": "Project Plowshare", "author": "Scott Kaufman", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cleve Bollinger is a wanted man now living straight as Clint Bowles. He and his saddle pal, Speck Adams, head to New Mexico after learning that an old friend, Sam Cooper, who Clint thought was dead, is alive and in trouble. On arrival at the small pueblo town of El Jardin, Clint and Speck side with Cooper in a vicious land war with land baron John Rawlings, his small army of hired guns and his paid-for sheriff and judge. Once the baddies realize Cooper has help and Clint's true identity is discovered, the lead starts to fly, and Clint's six-guns don't have time to cool off. The bad guys soak up most of the lead in this oater, and Conwell cleverly helps Clint ride off into the sunset in a satisfying, concluding plot twist.

Book #2 in the series, “Blood Therapy,” was published September, 2012 in the UK [plus the USA kindle version]. The USA print edition arrives February, 2013.

Masterfully combining a charming story of mischief, intrigue and an 'oh so happy ending' with beautifully crafted words and illustrations 'My Crazy Purple Pen' will delight readers of all ages. Playfully naughty notes written in purple ink mysteriously appear to all sorts of people  -  including the Queen herself! But how and why these notes are written is a mystery. As indeed is the worry of where the next one will appear. Suspicion is firmly placed at the owner of a Purple Pen, but when the Policeman with the Shiny Black Shoes comes to investigate, all traces of evidence are magically hidden away. Imaginative and lightly-rhyming words encourage young readers to follow, whilst the less experienced readers will enjoy exploring the colourful pages that burst with fun-filled extra detail. And without a doubt everyone will enjoy searching for the mischievous Crazy Purple Pen that finds a new place to hide on every page! 'My Crazy Purple Pen' is a delightful edition for any child's bookshelf. Look out for the second book in the series: 'The Day My Teacher Came to Tea'.

At issue are valuable historical documents and a hidden fortune, and there are some who are willing to kill for these treasures. Cliff, despite a quadruple bypass and a permanent limp, remains tough enough and savvy enough to give as good as he gets, while complications and the body count both mount.

Her debut with Medallion Press, Restore My Heart, led to a mention in Publisher’s Weekly as one of ten new romance authors to watch. Running Scared, a romantic suspense set in Jacksonville, Florida, and Washington D.C., received a Perfect 10 from Romance Reviews Today. Reviewer Harriet Klausner calls her writing “Mindful of Linda Howard.” Rebuild My World, the sequel to Reclaim My Life, was her first novel published by Turquoise Morning Press. Cheryl has combined her passion for writing and healthful cooking by publishing three cookbooks (two were finalists in the EPPIEs in the self-help category).

Barton is the author of several fast-paced mystery and thriller series, featuring lively characters and lots of action. \"Miz Scarlet\" (Scarlet Wilson Mystery series) is a teacher-turned-innkeeper, who throws herself into danger with a feisty determination to make things right, relying on cohorts like \"Captain Peacock\" and \"Colonel Grey Poupon\" to help her solve the clues. Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans.

While there, his dad rented a cottage near the ocean. As a young boy, the author spent two Summers living there with his family. He fell in love with the ocean and dreamed of one day owning a cottage on an ocean beach. While at W.P.I. he was selected, along with nine others, to join an organization known as THE SKULL. During the initiation process he learned a significant lesson that stayed with him all his life. It was \"If you want to do something hard enough and you make a commitment to do it, you at times can accomplish what initially seemed impossible.\" His wife Ann also loved the ocean, so when they had a chance to buy land and build a cottage at Saquish Beach, it was an opportunity they could not pass up. It would be a wonderful place for them to raise their two young daughters. Saquish is located on a remote peninsula only thirty miles southeast of Boston. It has no town roads or services. Commercial electricity and land line telephone service were not available. You had to drive five miles using a 4-wheel drive vehicle to get there. During high tides it was often inaccessible. The author writes about the times he and his family spent there during the forty years. He relives the memories, observations and experiences in building a cottage and participating in a host of activities on a remote beach.

It is composed of a collection of clinical experiences with patients who have developed erotic transferences. These experiences reflect a wide range in gender and sexual orientation configuration of patient and therapist. As Dr. Rosiello points out, the important area of erotic transference and counter-transference has, for the most part, been neglected in the clinical literature. She describes these erotic narratives with courage and sophistication. It is clear that the expression of loving and sexual feelings in the transference involves emotional risk taking on the part of the therapist. In these beautifully and sensitively written vignettes, Dr. Rosiello demonstrates that working with the erotic transference creates the basis for a very special emotional intimacy in the therapeutic relationship. This volume is highly recommended to clinicians at all levels of experience. (Jefferey Seinfeld, Ph.D., Ehrenkranz School of Social Work at New York University)Dr. Rosiello has performed the enormous service of taking the erotic transference and countertransference out of the therapeutic closet. In this scholarly and incisive account of the psychoanalytic view of the erotic transference, she courageously ventures into territory that has tended to be off limits. With rich illustrations, she vividly shows how both same- and different-gender patients and therapists struggle to make sense of and deal with their erotic feelings in treatment. Dr. Rosiello has significantly enlarged our view of the meaning of the erotic transference to encompass a patient's positive developmental strivings for connection and intimacy. She makes a major contribution to our understanding of the ways in which therapists need to participate with patients during psychotherapy. (Eda G. Goldstein, DSW, Ehrenkranz School of Social Work at New York University)Today's psychotherapist is faced with the important challenge of making use of his or her individual voice and temperament. Florence Rosiello takes up this challenge where others might avoid it, in the difficult arena of the erotic transference and countertransference experience. Dr. Rosiello uses creativity laced with humor to demonstrate how her unique point of view can be used in this context to deepen the relationship between therapist and patient.

As a writer for the stage: Robert Lynn's full-length Christmas-themed comedy, The ReGifters, is the winner of the New American Comedy Festival and is published by Heuer Publishing as is With Friends Like These. The Stupid Economy, a one-woman show is currently on tour. It will be produced at United Solo Artists Festival on Theatre Row in NYC in October 2013. His ten-minute play, Palindrome Love was a winner in the Short & Sweet Sydney 10-minute play festival, was performed in Sydney Australia in February 2009, and was performed in the Washington DC Capital Fringe Festival in the summer of 2010. He is a member of the Dramatists' Guild of America, Inc. As an actor: Acting is in Robert's blood, along with a whole lot of alcohol.  During a performance of Godspell in 1998, Robert literally followed the pre-show advice of the backstage crew to \"break a leg\" when he fell into the orchestra pit drunk, and broke the leg of the viola player. The subsequent lawsuit cost him thousands of dollars and had him as the viola player's butler for a time, but Robert remains upbeat about the sobering experience. \"It was really a wake-up call for me,\" said Robert. \"Now I do all my drinking upstage, and don't go anywhere near the orchestra pit…unless I need someplace to throw-up.\"  Reviled by theater orchestras everywhere, Robert was voted \"Most Likely to be Found Impaled on an Oboe\" in 1999. Robert’s most recent film project, “Code of Ignorance,” has him playing a simple-minded beekeeper whose only amusement comes from calling his wife “Honey.” Says Robert, “It’s fun working with all those bees. It’s like having a million tiny supporting actors.” Robert recently completed filming for his latest movie, in which he plays a spice consultant for inept housewives in “A Man for All Seasonings.” Robert literally “brought the house down” in a performance in Maine in 1990, when he accidentally set the theater on fire. “How was I to know I shouldn’t put my lit cigar in a pile of oily rags in the heating oil storage room?” said Robert. Robert was arrested in Montreal in 1989 for doing the nude scene in “Hair.” It just so happened that the rest of the cast was doing “The Diary of Anne Frank.” Last summer, Robert played a well-meaning, but tragically misguided hardware store employee who befriends a little blind girl in “Power Tools for Paula.”", "related": ["B00KAM07RY"], "rank": 3777853, "title": "Boy Meets Girl", "author": "Robert Lynn", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I appreciate every one of your comments and look forward to the launch of book three, JUDE (Shae's brother), in 2014. In the meantime, here's a tempting teaser from ETHAN, book two:                from Chapter One:\"Honestly, Shae, you'll\nbe doing yourself a favor.\"\"And you, too,\" she pointed\nout. Not that she had a problem with that--she'd do just about anything for\nStevie. He'd believed in her when no one else had, except family. Back when she\nwas living out of her parents' cast-off mini-van and writing in the back of a\nsurf shop in Santa Monica. \"It's just that I planned to leave.\"\"Connections,\" he\nreminded her. \"In this business it's all about connections.\"\"Of which I have\nplenty,\" she returned.\"You can never have too\nmany,\" he argued, and he was right.Ethan Abrams was on the\ncusp of joining the elite in the big-time, power-house. He directed or produced\na film every year and they were high quality, A-list projects that rocked the\ntheaters. But he wasn't a writer and Shae didn't want to try to shape him into\none. Especially not now-she had plans. Big-time mommy plans that ran by their\nown clock.\"You know that I'm\nleaving,\" she tried again, because Stevie had a way with denial Shae had never\nexperienced before. He could spin a 'no' into an 'absolutely' faster than a\nmarshmallow melted in July.\"A bad decision,\" he\npointed out.\"Nevertheless--\" \"You're leaving. I know.\"\"Tomorrow,\" she\nemphasized, and pushed back a strand of wheat-blond hair the wind had picked up\nand tossed. She listened to the silence as it built on the other end and\ncounted down to his mini-explosion. Stevie tried to keep a steady passage, but\nhe often failed.\"What? Tomorrow? You\ncan't be serious, Shae. Hollywood is your life. It's your livelihood.\" \"I'm not leaving the\nbusiness,\" she reminded him. \"Just the landscape.\"\"I thought you were\ntalking vacation.\"She'd told him\ndifferently, but Stevie's form of denial was reflective. Anything he didn't\nwant to hear bounced off him. Of course that denial had done wonderful things\nfor Shae--it landed her big contracts, including her first with DreamWorks when\nshe was only twenty-three years old.\"I sold my house.\"\"Buy another.\"\"I plan to. In Mill\nValley.\" She wanted home--suburbia, thirty minutes north of San Francisco. She\ndidn't worry she would lose her creative drive. That an environment of tall,\nleafy trees, smiling faces and green belts would suck her dry. She'd realized,\nas many veterans of the trade did sooner or later, that Los Angeles had a dying\npulse. She didn't have to live in The City of Angels in order to produce works\nthat moved the human heart.She wouldn't be able to\nsurf as much, not from Mill Valley, and she'd have to travel further to do it,\nbut she wanted family more than anything else. When one of her\nscreenplays went into production, she would have to head south again, but lots\nof people in the business did that--flew in, settled in a rented house for six\nmonths, then when the movie wrapped, escaped to parts unknown.Stevie returned to his\noffensive stand. \"Ethan is an amazing talent.\"Shae already knew that.\nShe followed Ethan Abrams' work and had probablyseen\nevery movie he'd directed--including a docu-drama that had her crying from\nmid-point to finish.\"But he's never written\nbefore.\"\"That's not exactly\ntrue.\"\"Stevie,\" the reprimand\nwas light. They both hated it when directors crossed out lines and wrote in\n\"possibles.\" It was part of the process, of course, and often times Shae had\ncome around to believing the director had a point. Still, applying patches to\nsomeone else's work was not writing.\"You'd be proud to be a\npart of this project. It hasdepth.\"Shae didn't doubt it.\nEthan was known for projects that had a full arc of emotions. He didn't limit\nhimself to blockbusters, either, but loaned his talent to indie films and\nstart-ups that he found worthy.Which was part of\nShae's dilemma. She'd never been asked to give back before. And shouldn't she\nbe doing exactly that? Facing her thirtieth birthday, she was ancient by\nindustry standards but had accomplished so much more than many people did in\ncomparable careers. It hadn't come easy, but she'd arrived at an astounding\nlevel of success through hard work and her share of luck. She felt her resolve\nbegin its landslide.\"What's the project?\"\"I don't know,\" Stevie\nadmitted.\"But you said it has depth.\"\"It does. Everything\nEthan does has depth.\"\"Storyline?\"\"He isn't saying. First\ntime jitters and all that.\" Shae rolled her eyes.\n\"You're his agent.\" Who else, if not your agent, to bounce ideas off of? \"Fine.\nHave him e-mail me what he's got. I'll take a look at it.\"\"Not gonna happen,\"\nStevie insisted. \"Listen, if I didn'tknowthis was going to be the movie of the year and that you weren't the\nabsolute right person to help, I wouldn't be bothering you.\"\"You're not bothering\nme, Stevie.\"\"Well, I am. A little.\"\"Okay. A little,\" she\nconceded. \"What does he want?\"\"For you to meet with\nhim. He'll come to you.\"\"I am a suite at\nChateau Marmont,\" she reminded him. She thought about lunch in the bar\ndownstairs, but there would be too much exposure there. While she was able to\nmove around her world unrecognized, Ethan wasn't as lucky, so there would be\ncameras to deal with outside the private patio and inside, hopefuls digging in\nfor their chance to make it.

By her agent. For a man who\nwanted something from her, but strictly on his terms. Crazy.\"The man will be damn\nlucky if I show at all,\" she muttered.\"Of course you'll\nshow,\" Stevie chided. \"It's the decent thing to do and you, love, are that rare\ngem found among the plastered fakes--decent.\"\"Some consider that a\ncharacter flaw. Others take advantage.\" Another thing she really didn't like\nabout living in L.A.

It was eight-thirty in the morning and the sun was\nalready hot enough to reflect off the pavement. September in Southern\nCalifornia was like mid-summer anywhere else in the country. She sat under a\ngreen and white umbrella and enjoyed what little breeze managed to flutter this\neast of the Pacific.She didn't smile. That\nwas not done here, not unless you were glammed up and in front of the cameras.\nAnd that was precisely the reason she was so hell bent on leaving. She didn't\nwant to raise her child in an unfriendly environment, where you didn't know\nyour neighbor's name and if you needed cream for your coffee you had to drive\nto the nearest mini-mart.And more than anything\nelse, Shae wanted a baby.", "related": ["B00DJB6KE2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

These divine messengers, her Tovarysh, have remained a benevolent presence throughout her life, guiding her through all aspects of her life. After receiving a biology degree from Bucknell University, Celine pursued a career in medical research both at Stanford University Medical Center and Duke University Medical Center. She has over 30 publications in infectious disease, biochemistry and cardiovascular scientific journals. Ten years ago, Celine realized a lifelong dream when she became a blueberry farmer in addition to pursuing her professional career. The proud owner of a successful farm that she started with 600 tiny starter plants, her bushes now yield over a half a ton of blueberries each season. She supplies many of the university and corporate cafeterias in the area, as well as the local farmer's market. In One With All of Thee: Growing Your Sacred Connection, she has assembled a collection of the messages she has received as a practical tool for readers, to help shape awareness and guide progress towards a sense of serenity, a feeling of well-being and greater purpose. This is her first book of a series sharing the divine wisdom passed down to her.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There are some excellent character moments and some\ngreat one-liners. Aussie humour shines through the narrative.

Your IQ is determined by measuring your problem solving abilities, memory, general knowledge, and spatial imagery. The average God-given IQ of an adult is 150. It cannot be increased by medical science, because of the microbiology of the brain. It can, however, be improved. The average effective (day-to-day) IQ is only 100-110, mostly due to neglect - lack of brain exercises. Therefore, if you exercise your brain, you can increase your effective IQ. Word puzzles, such as Word Scramble, provide the necessary mental activity.\nMental Exercise\n            Word puzzles help expand vocabulary, strengthen word recall, and improve memory. You do not realize while you are working puzzles that you are using thinking skills. Your brain learns new skills and acquires knowledge throughout your life. Mastering puzzle-solving skills improves your thinking.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bartik gives readers a sense of the individuals and institutions who shaped computing in the twentieth century as well as her perspective on important issues such as continuing gender disparities in the field.

In this compassionate and endearing children's book, Thank You,\nShadow, Terri Kelley broaches this painful, yet important, subject. The story\nstarts with the direct and poignant lines, \"Today is one the worst days of my\nlife. Today is the day my Shadow passed away.\" With this same openness and\nhonesty, a young boy tells readers of the day he found out his dog, Shadow, had\ndied. Shadow was his best friend and now, without him, the boy doesn't know how\nto be happy again. However, with the support of his parents, some sage advice,\nand a little time to heal, even this sorrow can be overcome. This sweet tale\nwill teach young and old how to cope with loss and the importance of creating\nmemories.Thank You, Shadow is a sweet tale that deserves a place amongst children's\nliterature. Death is a difficult topic for most to discuss, but Terri Kelley's\nbook takes away some of its sting and provides an avenue for discussion with\nyoung children. The young boy who tells the story goes through a variety of\nemotions, from denial to anger and beyond, making this a tale that those going\nthrough the same emotions one they can relate to. Along with a moving story,\nThank You, Shadow has coupled stirring water color pictures by Tiffany England.\nI think this is an excellent\nbook for teachers and parents to have in their collection in order to open\ndiscussion on the very sensitive subject of death. I will definitely be looking\ninto Terri Kelley's other works to see how she handles other subjects. If it is\nanything like this tale, I expect to be quite pleased.", "related": ["B00HEBWG0A"], "rank": 3811197, "title": "Thank You, Shadow", "author": "Terri Kelley", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Im Laufe der Zeit arbeitete sie die Geschichte aus, bis sie zu dem wurde, was sie heute ist.  Ihr Interesse am Schauspiel bewegte sie außerdem dazu vier Drehbücher zur Buchreihe zu schreiben, die sieben Romane umfassen soll. Der Künstlername „Winter\" steht für ein Herz aus Eis, das sich von Romantik nicht mehr beeindrucken lässt und zu einer Autorin gehört, die trotzdem darüber schreibt.", "related": [], "rank": 4231160, "title": "The Golden Heart: Strength of Love", "author": "Vanessa Winter", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The eBook explains the deep connection between Seth, Jane, Future Seth, and myself and that information is freely available on my Seth webpage which has much of the audio in chronological order with some commentary.  But that said, Seth has clearly said than ANYONE can channel him. You don't need to buy this eBook to find out. If you look on YouTube I have freely posted much of what has come through from Seth so far (including the transmission called 'Anyone can channel me') so you can hear Seth for yourself and it is pretty clear it is him. Especially if you listen to the more personal chatty channels as his personality shines through most in those (I love transmission 14 - search YouTube).I know Seth said a statement to Jane that implied he would not be channeled by anyone else, but he said to me that he only meant 'in Jane's lifetime' and that the wider implication was a distortion. And anyone that has read the 'Early Sessions' books knows that Seth says again and again that the process he uses with Jane is open to distortion but it is much more preferable to him than putting her in a deeper trance.I am not here to convince anyone of anything, I am just sharing my experience in just the same way I always have and will forevermore continue to do. I do however playfully suggest that if just the idea of someone other than Jane channeling Seth makes you feel angry without you even investigating it, then you may wish to check yourself for religious fanaticism and then read what Seth (through Jane) has to say on that energy :-) and by the way I am now channeling Jane so I look forward to enjoying the fanatics reaction to that one!

The highest achievement of a Scientist is to become a Quatist -- someone who can change the rules of Science with their mind. The antithesis of Quatists are the Fae -- those who, by using an Unseen, non-quantifiable power, are able to change themselves.  The brothers, Tad and Etan, are thrust down different paths. Etan studies Quat Theory while happenstance sends Tad into the realm of the old faith. Or is it happenstance? Although the Quatists don't believe in prophecies, one makes them shudder -- A resurgence of the old faith that would call the Quatists' very existence into question.The trilogy begins with The Stone where Tad is sent on a mysterious quest by his secretive mother to find the Stone. He has no idea what it is or who to trust. He soon learns that men of untold power, the Quatists, want to destroy the Stone before it can take back its control over the world and that one of the most powerful Quatists that has ever lived, his father, is seeking to destroy him. Tad meets impossible characters who destroy the fabric of the Science he had always been taught as he finds himself caught up in the revolt against Quatist rule.", "related": ["B00JUHJ51O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
