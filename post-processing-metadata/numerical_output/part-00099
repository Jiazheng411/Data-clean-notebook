This acknowledgement of human frailty—starting with his own—broadens his observational powers immeasurably…. [providing] a new capacity for wonderment [and a] new willingness to explore the authenticity of indigenous African belief…. The tone of this, his most recent foray into the search for life’s meaning, is respectful and sometimes even hesitant…. [W]e move from one voice to the next without really noticing that the speaker has changed. There’s not a lot of unnecessary scene-setting: what’s important is what’s being said…. Naipaul has always revealed a curious admixture of extrovert and introvert on the page…. Now…more adept at switching between these two ways of being with less violence…he has found a greater ability to poke fun at himself…. [With this] new kind of humor—one that, being softer, is even sharper [Naipaul] transcends the shadowy wryness to which his readers have long been accustomed…. [His is a] brilliant and elastic mind.”         Eliza Griswold,The New York Times Book Review “A master still at his craft….Naipaul’s writing [is] simple, concise, engaging…. Like Flaubert and Hemingway, Naipaul uses less to say more, and here he has few equals…. [T]he obscurity of his inquiry makes it fresh….

In this adventure retired civil servant Carole Seddon struggles with the secrets of the Chadleigh family, whose Elizabethan home is about to become a museum honoring the literary efforts of a second-rate early-twentieth-century poet. Simon Brett captures the very souls of the characters and makes them vividly real for listeners. His only faulty portrayal is that of the American professor, whose accent is never quite right. Listeners will find the quirky characters interesting and even the meetings of the board of trustees for the museum a source of clues.

When Rianna Lancaster sees a naked man materialize out of a fog, she sensibly ignores his claims of being a prince come to take her home to the planet of New Symtaria, sprays him with Mace, and calls 911. But everyone in the very small town of Miller Bend, Tex., already thinks Ria is crazy, so the sheriff tells her to see a shrink, and her parents rent out her old bedroom to the wealthy, handsome \"foreigner.\" Prince Kristor's overbearing, aggressive attitude puts Ria off, but he has plenty of animal magnetism, and it doesn't take long before the two are enjoying celestial sex.

I love it because the characters are so intense and fluid as they move the plot at record speed. I was able to embed five mysteries to be solved within the novel, and the unique main plot and its way of trapping everyone in the web of conspiracy is done with humor and unexpected revelations.The fact that the story takes place in some of my favorite locations, Nashville, New York, and the wonderful fictional town of Secret Springs, Arkansas makes my author's pen skip a beat. I love the town and it's mysteries and people. I enjoy that it reflects the true Arkansas nature of its people in that while they are hospitable, they do not embrace strangers into their inner circle easily. \"What happens there, is buried there, and sometimes prematurely.\"The Matriarch, Marguerite McKenna is the epitome of what we all percieve to be the \"in control and perfectly revered and renowned town monarchy\" by virture of her wealth and power. Feared, resented and yet respected, she has ruled from her on high home for her entire adult life. When she summons Blaine Stryker, equaly renowned in her own world as a Pulitzer Prize nominee,  it is with trepidation that she is forced by the Matriarch to respond. The reader can smell the \"blood and fear\" as the words lead the scent of the hunt.It is perhaps the men in the storyline who intrigue the reader as much as the heroine. Each has a role in her life that creates conflict and doubt between the men. There is no doubt that Walker Rhoades is a man's man and sees the world as a federal agent; cut and dried, black and white. He views women, especially professional and independent women as: burdens, threats and untrustworthy. Enter Blaine Stryker. With her, all his negatives and doubts are magnified when he looks past the immediate problem of physical attraction to her, and sees her ever present and vigilant mystery man and companion, Cory Stryker.The mysteries keep the reader moving at such a fast pace, that it is hard to catch your breath when you see the flames of attraction being fanned and you know the emotions are simmering. One doesn't know if they want to turn the page and solve the mystery, or turn the page and experience the passion.The humor, love, compassion, and spirit of the mysteries will forever brand in your heart the gut wrenching experiences which drive these characters, and the immense sacrifice and unconditional love of Cory Stryker and all it means to be a \"real man\".", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Henry Van Til's Calvinistic Concept of Culture remains an excellent guide for anyone wanting to learn the ways of cultural obedience to the One who claims every square inch of the creation as his own.\" -From the foreword by Richard J.  MouwHow should a Christian live in a secular world? This classic work looks at the issue of the relationship between religion and culture from a Reformed perspective.Van Til uses the term culture to designate \"that activity of man, the image-bearer of God, by which he fulfills the creation mandate to cultivate the earth, to have dominion over it, and to subdue it.\" Culture, therefore, is removed from a totally secular context, is placed in the arena of Christian activity and influence, and is constructively viewed from a biblical perspective. The text explores both the historic development and the contemporary implications of the Calvinistic framework of culture and theology.Henry R. Van Til was professor of Bible at Calvin College. He received his Th.M. from Westminster Theological Seminary and also studied at the Free University of Amsterdam", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His utilitarian theories, though empiricist in nature, acknowledged the necessity of incorporating mystical and spiritual interpretations. Educated at Bath College and Fettes College, Edinburgh, and at Trinity College, Dublin, Stace held positions of magistrate and judge in the British civil service in Ceylon (1910–32), where he studied Hinduism and Buddhism before teaching philosophy at Princeton University (1932–55) in the United States. Influenced by the German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel, he published many works exploring commonalities of human thought as related to religious empiricism. His key books include The Philosophy of Hegel (1924), The Theory of Knowledge and Existence (1932), The Concept of Morals (1937), Time and Eternity (1952), and Mysticism and Philosophy (1960).", "related": ["B0050YV1R2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Later, after he discovered that the Pinkertons had been falsifying reports about the unions and brutalizing union members, he tried to publish his book, Pinkerton's Cowboy Detective. The publication of the book was \"blocked by the Pinkertons, held up in the Superior Court of Chicago\" until he changed the title to The Cowboy Detective and made substantial changes to the text. Written in the unvarnished style of a Texas cowboy, this book is skillfully narrated by editor Murphey.

(Michael J. SethThe Historian2012-04-01)This significant work on the Park Chung Hee era is composed of 21 chapters by as many Korean specialists...The work provides an enhanced understanding of the political and economic goals of Park Chung Hee (i.e., rich country and strong military) and the forceful means he was willing to use to achieve these goals. The scope and insightfulness of this collection of essays on this critical period in South Korean history make it a must for undergraduate and graduate library collections on Korea. It is strongly recommended for private collections on Korea as well. (J. M. PeekChoice2011-11-01)Somehow [this] escaped the notice of much of the broader world...This [collection] is superb, as it offers a very detailed and also fairly comprehensive look at the seminal years for South Korean economic growth…Not everyone will want 650 pp. on economic (and other) policy under South Korean autocracy, but if you do this is the book for you.

To join her accessible explication and close reading of a wealth of scholarly writing makes not only for an exciting intellectual adventure but also will touch our humanity at its core. She helps us to become better clinicians by subtly formulating an ethic for human relations that can operate beyond clinical practice.The Suffering Strangerrecognizes the commonality of suffering and estrangement that plagues therapist and patient alike and offers a perspective that can move us beyond suffering to connect with ourselves and others.\"- Frank M. Lachmann, author of Transforming Narcissism(Routledge, 2008)\"There are few psychoanalysts who can match Donna Orange's compassion for ethical and vocational aspects of psychoanalysis, and few can write better about the way these aspects of our field are informed by Gadamerian hermeneutics and Lévinsian ethics. Her choice of the five \"subversives\" who dared to challenge the analytic status quo of their times demonstrates her central thesis convincingly. The value of this book is greatly enhanced by her remarkable ability to write with clarity, fluency, and a sense of immediacy that makes her message come vividly alive.\"- Anna Ornstein, Boston Psychoanalytic Institute, USA\"Donna Orange, a serious philosophy scholar and teacher prior to her psychoanalytic career, has been perfectly situated intellectually to contribute to the current upsurge of interest in philosophy among psychoanalysts.The Suffering Strangeris a treat for those familiar with her work and is especially useful to clinicians who haven't yet recognized the significance of philosophy to their clinical practice. Chapters devoted to Ferenczi, Fromm-Reichman, Winnicott, Kohut, and Brandchaft focus on their human spirit and attitude of trust, underpinnings that decisively influenced their ways of being with, listening to, and talking with their patients. Her engaging treatments of these classically trained psychoanalytic innovators explicate the 'hermeneutics of trust' and illustrate the ethical responsibility delineated by Lévinas and Gadamer. Some may be delighted to discover (like Moliere's character who exclaimed, 'Good Heavens!...I have been speaking prose without knowing it') they have always, if unknowingly, had a philosophical basis for their own interpretive style. All will usefully gain enhanced awareness of the sensibilities in psychoanalytic theories.\"- Shelley Doctors, co-author of Toward an Emancipatory Psychoanalysis(Routledge, 2010)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Having took him the best part of 10 years to write, he says that it's likely to be his first and last.  \"I knew I wanted to write this book and had the basic premise of the story, but was never really able to commit the time. I would write 2 or 3 chapters and then it would stay on my laptop untouched for months (sometimes years) on end. Each time I went back to it I had new ideas and the story would evolve in ways I never originally envisaged. I always wanted it to be exciting and have lots of twists and turns. I also wanted it to be thought provoking and maybe just a little controversial, but even I was surprised by the eventual direction of the storyline. I hope it will surprise a few people\". Borrowed Time is not just a fictional account of how things might have been if Germany had won the 2nd World War, but offers a real alternative to the events that we believe to be our history.  \"I was always fascinated by time travel and the paradoxical changes it could cause. I wondered if there was one moment in history, which would be so pivotal that if altered would change the face of the entire World?\" This book not only answers this question, but also looks at the effects of the paradox from the point of view of a single person; in this case the books main character, Tony Smith. The consequences of time travel on Tony Smith is probably the most emotive and thought provoking element of the book, and gives us plenty of food for thought. Asked if he would consider a follow up David said; \"It would depend on the success of Borrowed Time, not just in sales, but in terms of feedback. Knowing that the book is being read after all this time, would give me a great sense of satisfaction\" \"Without giving the plot away too much, I admit it might be fascinating to find out the fate of Tony Smith, in fact it would be nice to find out the fate of all of us.

The result is a short, eye-opening, three-fold study: a fascinating look at what presidential precedent means after the headlines die down, an object lesson in the dangers of Congressional hypocrisy and ineptitude, and a passionate defense of journalism's responsibility to keep a close watch on the often inscrutable legal battles about national security policy. --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B0078XH8XE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Vilified as unimaginative and heavy, it has traditionally been recognized for only two achievements: the English breakfast and Christmas dinner. But, Spencer explains, even before the Romans brought their civilization to the islands, Celtic agriculture and animal husbandry produced a wide range of foodstuffs. Anglo-Saxon England knew how to stew meats with savory herbs before that practice became common in Europe. The Norman conquest introduced exotic spices. Medieval England even saw the invention of fast food, in the cookshops that lined the Thames, catering to boatmen and travelers. And imperialists returned home with knowledge of India's elaborate food tradition, full of strong, penetrating spices and herbs. Victorian home cooking succumbed to uniformity under one of the earliest cookbooks: Isabella Beeton'sBook of Household Management(1800). Rationing and postwar austerity in large part gave birth to British cooking's modern evil reputation, but globalization and affluence have transformed London into one of the world's gastronomic capitals. A glossary assists readers with old and unfamiliar kitchen terms.Mark KnoblauchCopyright © American Library Association.

Her personality is so multifaceted that her friends have spent countless hours scratching their heads in wonder. A scientist with a passion for history, music and photography she loves to travel and experience new places but is terminally shy around people she doesn’t know. Trina has been devouring romance novels since her tender teenage years, although only began writing in 2007. When her debut novel was met with resounding success, she said “Hey I can do that again”. The rest as they say is history. Her choices in reading and writing material are as diverse as her iTunes library, which contains music from Mozart to Metallica. Her one concession is all stories must have a happily ever after ending-did we mention she’s incurably romantic? She lives in Missouri with her loving and indulgent husband, and orange tabby cat–affectionately referred to as ‘Houdini’ for his stealthy escape attempts.", "related": ["B004H4XJLC"], "rank": 1648123, "title": "The Scent of Seduction (Phantom River Book 1)", "author": "Trina   Lane", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her job entailed international travel, including an unforgettable year spent in Ireland. While travelling, she noticed a tremor in her right hand and was told it probably was an “Essential Tremor”, a condition considered by some to be a “health nuisance”.  Since it can also be an early symptom of Parkinson, her doctor told her to check it out with a specialist. She chose to believe the essential tremor diagnosis, until her personal physician insisted that she see a Neurologist for confirmation. She was greatly disappointed when the doctor diagnosed her with Parkinson’s as well as Essential Tremor.  Chris is an avid exercise practitioner, and believes strongly that “Exercise is medicine!” She chose to have Deep Brain Stimulation surgery, but had to discontinue the treatment because of some healing issues. She and her doctor are presently deciding “What’s next?”  Chris now lives and shakes in Florida and Cape Cod with her husband Dale, where she continues to appreciate every day with joy and enthusiasm. Dave Anderson was born and raised a small town boy, and ultimately worked in a challenging environment in international advertising with a Fortune 500 company. After taking early retirement he noticed a slight tremor in his left hand, which was diagnosed as PD. His personal journey through the disbelief, anger and denial affected his outlook and that of his support group. Working together with a personal trainer, Wayne McKenna, a rigorous training program was put in place, which Dave credits with not only slowing the progress of PD, but actually reducing some of his symptoms. Dave’s passionate commitment was “ahead of his time”; studies done since then indicate that there are many benefits to patients who are faithful to physical fitness. The program and Dave’s developing friendship with Wayne had a profoundly positive effect on Dave’s attitude and consequently his symptoms. The results, both physical and psychological led Dave to write “How to Tame Parkinson’s by Keeping Fit,” released in 2005, which chronicles Dave’s criteria for selecting a personal trainer and developing exercise routines for the various stages of Parkinson Disease.  His ability to capture his feelings has provided us with an appreciation for the difficulties of having an unpredictable disease; he also was able to lift our spirits at the wonder and inner strength he exhibits.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jews for Jesus founder Moishe Rosen first commended this book and its author to me. I have since read it and have developed a deep appreciation for the author as well. Now I am so very pleased on behalf of my friend Paul to commend this book to others.”  —David Brickner, Executive Director, Jews for Jesus“Paul Liberman is a Messianic Jewish trailblazer. We are all indebted to him for helping to clear the way for Jewish followers of Messiah Yeshua to serve Him as Jews. As Paul articulates so clearly, Jews who believe in Yeshua don’t form a new denomination of Christianity, but remain within the fig tree of Israel—the Jewish people—and are essential to its blossoming in our day.”  — Russ Resnick, Executive Director, Union of Messianic Jewish Congregations“The Fig Tree Blossomscarries the fragrance and originality of a fresh new move of God’s Spirit. Written by a man who has been central to the Messianic movement, Paul Liberman with the skill of the elder statesman that he is, addresses the issues and answers the questions of the day regarding Messianic Judaism.”  — Rabbi Jeff Forman, Chairman, International Alliance of Messianic Congregations and Synagogues“The Fig Tree Blossoms,written 35 years ago by Messianic Jewish pioneer, Paul Liberman, remains one of the most important books ever written about the emergence of the modern  Messianic Jewish movement. It has served to communicate, in layman’s words, the marvelous prophetic fulfillment of God’s promise to Israel to physically and spiritually restore the Jewish people in ‘latter days.’ Over the years this is one of very few books that I have regularly given to Christians and others to explain Messianic Judaism as a prophetic movement. I am thrilled to see this important work given the opportunity to gain a new and wider audience … for such a time as this.” — Joel Chernoff, General Secretary Messianic Jewish Alliance of America", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I wanted to know how many of us think the way I do. I have lived in the most depressing and joyful situations.

From my vantage point, humans are the most unpredictable, astonishing, hateful and sacrificing creatures. I want to understand us (humanity) better and, for me, understanding of humanity comes from writing fiction, and examining what people might do when they feel no one is watching, what people are capable of (horrible and great), and imaging how seemingly normal people would react if they had exhausted the rational (and sometimes irrational) options.

Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in 1804 in the city of Salem, Massachusetts to Nathaniel Hathorne and the former Elizabeth Clarke Manning. His ancestors include John Hathorne, the only judge involved in the Salem witch trials who never repented of his actions. Nathaniel later added a \"w\" to make his name \"Hawthorne\" in order to hide this relation. He entered Bowdoin College in 1821, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1824, and graduated in 1825. Hawthorne anonymously published his first work, a novel titled Fanshawe, in 1828. He published several short stories in various periodicals which he collected in 1837 as Twice-Told Tales. The next year, he became engaged to Sophia Peabody. He worked at a Custom Houseand joined Brook Farm, a transcendentalist community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem, the Berkshires, then to The Wayside in Concord. The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to The Wayside in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, and was survived by his wife and their three children. -wikipedia", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After graduating from Penn State, he went on to get a master’s degree in film from Stanford University.  Among his work there was a documentary called \"Some of My Best Friends Are Bottomless Dancers.\"  That lascivious title and a few film festival prizes led to Pollack being accepted as one of the first writing-directing fellows at the American Film Institute in Los Angeles.  Pollack's opportunity to become a professional “paid” writer came after he spent a summer traveling with carnie folk, researching another documentary.  That summer, he came to know nearly every “freak” in the United States - the fat lady, the pin cushion man, midgets and giants.  As a result, he had the perfect back-ground for Roger Corman to hire him as the casting director for a movie called \"Freaks.\"  That picture was never made but after showing the Cormans some of his writing, Pollack was hired to write the remake of John Huston’s \"Asphalt Jungle\" and turn it into a “black” film. That was how Barry Pollack became the white \"black exploitation” writer-director of MGM’s 1972 feature film \"Cool Breeze.\"  That picture did relatively well at the box office but his next endeavor, the film \"This is a Hijack,\" he ignobly claims as being one the top ten worst pictures in the history of cinema.  Pollack says, “As the cliché goes, I couldn’t get arrested after that as a director.” After mulling over his options in the film business, he made a drastic career change.  He went to medical school and became a doctor, graduating from the University of Oklahoma Medical School in 1980. Pollack began writing again during his residency in emergency medicine at Los Angeles County USC Medical Center.  Since then, he has written several prime time television dramas; magazine short stories; ten years of columns for the Scripps-Howard Ventura County STAR newspapers; and in December 2009 his debut novel, the science fiction thriller FORTY-EIGHT X: The Lemuria Project, was published by Medallion Press.

I spend part of my time teaching at a local preschool and writing, while the rest is devoted to my family.  Writing is new to me, but storytelling has been a life long hobby.  I love using words to create images and feelings for others.  I can honestly tell a story about almost anything.  Some of my favorite storytelling memories are of telling bed time stories to my children and nieces and nephew.  They would pick random things, such as the ceiling fan, and I would make up a story about it.  Those moments are treasures to me and I hope they will be remembered by those special children too.  In that way I hope to bring special moments to my readers as well.  Writing offers me an escape from the wonderful chaos that is my life.  Raising two small children takes a lot of energy and I often collapse in my office chair late at night and let my ideas flow.  I often write from an outline, but just as often I simply sit at the computer and type until I run out of ideas.  Then I go back to make sure it all makes sense and works.  Often I find myself captivated by the story as I read because in my mad rush to type it all out I don’t really embrace the story in the way one does when reading.  My husband often laughs at me when I am reading a book of my own while wiping away the stray tear or two.  I feel it is a pretty good sign that it can touch me in that way and I hope my readers can feel the emotion that I try to inject into my stories. I find that I enjoy my self-published status because it gives me the freedom to write what I want, how I want.  I often choose characters who may not fit the norm of what most think of as a hero or heroine.  I like my characters unique and I like their story to flow from me instead of what someone else’s guidelines. I hope you enjoy my stories.  I enjoy hearing from you.  I do read emails and I try my best to reply if necessary.  I would love to hear your ideas and all about the types of books you enjoy most.  Who knows, you may give me a great new book idea?

Most importantly, the work focuses on the implementation of\nthe agreements rather than the negotiations that led to them. The author\n selects four areas for study: US-Soviet (and Russian) nuclear weapons\nagreements; multilateral nuclear weapon agreements; multilateral\nchemical and biological weapons agreements; and multilateral agreements\nthat banned land mines and cluster munitions. The choice of case studies\n is deliberate. The approach takes the reader through an evolution of\narms control since the 1940s and the ways the end of the Cold War has\nchanged the agenda, the process, and the politics of implementation.\nChevrier reaches several important conclusions regarding the future of\narms control. First, the interplay of agreements is a neglected aspect\nof arms control. Lessons learned from negotiation and implementation of\none agreement play a large role in future agreements. Second, the\nadvance of technology, as both a problem and solution for future\nagreements, needs further study. Third, and most important, the range of\n actors in arms control has changed. What once was mainly a nation-state\n process has expanded to include the private sector and civil society.Summing Up:Highly recommended. All readership levels. -- W. W.

The impetus came from his own run-ins with brutal South African police and the spirit of resistance across the continent. Biko was a teenager when Nelson Mandela created the military wing of the African National Congress and was later arrested and imprisoned. Biko devoted himself to developing a philosophy of black consciousness, partly inspired by the U.S. civil rights and black nationalist movements, urging black South Africans to reject oppression and take pride in their own heritage and traditions. He developed a socialist perspective more tied to the African than European experience, focused on oppression based on race rather than class. Biko directed his organizing efforts to black South African youth, inspiring the Soweto uprisings. He was killed by prison interrogators in 1977; he was 30 years old.           South African documentary filmmaker Wilson analyzes Biko’s legacy in the aftermath of apartheid and expresses continued concerns about racial conflicts and growing concerns about class divisions. --Vanessa Bush", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A Mortality Tale was shortlisted for two of the most prestigious Australian literary awards, the Australian/Vogel and Miles Franklin Literary Awards, and Percussion got some pretty good reviews, too. Jay has a PhD (in genre and crime fiction), and a Master's degree (memoir) in Creative Writing from the University of Queensland.  In 2009, she received a Dean's Award for Outstanding Research Higher Degree Thesis for her PhD.  La-di-da and yippeekiyay, or exclamations to that effect.  Seriously though, she was quite chuffed to received the award and has it framed on her wall of - yes, framed things - at home.  Occasionally, she shows it to her cat, Dotty, intending to pull her into line and create a sense of awe.  So far, however, Jay remains the servant and Dotty the boss.  The universe is as it should be. Jay's third novel is Spawned Secrets, a thriller set in a rainforest and featuring disgraced stockbrokers and a serial killer (yes, he's after the stockbrokers - fictional payback is cathartic and fun).

Her creative artistic side could never rest as she tried her hand at every form of artistry. Eventually her hobby became an expertise, and Sharon became a guest lecturer for the Utah Shakespeare Festival, taking her knowledge and love of history and Shakespeare on the road to high school advanced placement and honors English classes with presentations and lectures. Sharon’s passion for Shakespeare and her love of acting moved her from books to the actual stage. She has performed in numerous reader’s theatre productions and been a judge of high school drama competitions. At the age of 70, Sharon hit on the ultimate outlet for her skills, knowledge, and artistic talents and became the creator of her own magical world—the Kingdom of Hamelot. She loves and cares about the characters of the kingdom as if they were family. She takes the greatest pleasure in seeing the joy her stories bring to others. With more than 100 characters and 50 stories so far, Sharon plans to spend the rest of her life continuing to bring life, adventures and characters to her beloved Hamelot.", "related": ["B00BMAFUHA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As it turned out \"The Trust Casefiles\" was an imaginative, witty and well-written novel that took vampire mythology and turned it one its head. The novel features a cast of characters that draw you in with their thorough backstories, their oftentimes witty and humorous encounters, their actions within the novel and the vivid characterizations that bring this novel to life.It follows a group of the Trust operatives who fight an unseen war with demonic forces, protecting humans in the shadows. When a Nelapsi, otherwise known as a vampire, starts wreaking havoc and killing members of an isolated island community it is up to leader Alexandra and her team of operatives to suss out the creature and do their duty of protecting the human population.This was a fun read that sucked me in, winding me up with supernatural mythology, secret societies and heroic people who fight to save humans who are unaware.

He struggled through school academically. Diagnosed with dyslexia meant being removed from class to attend ‘remedial” lessons. As a child, Ben did not enjoy reading and writing, and left school early to work with his father as a builder. It wasn’t until his mid-twenties that Ben persisted in teaching himself to read — and finally read his first novel. Ben emigrated to Perth, Western Australia in 1990, where he now lives with his wife Michelle and two adult children, Chelsea and Zac. To pass the hours working as a bricklayer, he would think about writing a novel. However, it took many years for him to pluck up the courage to turn his dreams into words.  His dyslexia, and informal knowledge of the English language and grammar, made his first book a real challenge. Luckily, he had plenty of people around him to help him on his journey. His love of scientific facts, futuristic possibilities, and fast-paced action infects his plots and writing style. He thoroughly enjoys pushing himself creatively, which means venturing into many types of storytelling. As a consequence, his catalogue is a mixture of sci-fi, speculative and horror fiction. Ben now has a growing number of novels to his name, and he fully intends to expand on that number.", "related": ["B00I9E5G3U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As well as romantic novels, she wrote historical biographies, 6 autobiographies, theatrical plays and books of advice on life, love, vitamins and cookery. She wrote her first book at the age of 21 and it was called Jigsaw.   It became an immediate bestseller and sold 100,000 copies in hardback in England and all over Europe in translation. Between the ages of 77 and 97 she increased her output and wrote an incredible 400 romances as the demand for her romances was so strong all over the world.She wrote her last book at the age of 97 and it was entitled perhaps prophetically The Way to Heaven.  Her books have always been immensely popular in the United States where in 1976 her current books were at numbers 1 & 2 in the B.

This book is what I've learned.  What is true to me and maybe after you read it you'll agree it's true for you.The coolest thing about my book is it's for everyone.  It doesn't matter if you're from Maryland or Maine, Canada or Nigeria.  Relationships are tricky. We all make mistakes.  It's through our mistakes that we grow as people, partners, lover and spouses.  Why did I write this book? The people made me do it.  Haha. I'm serious.  People INSPIRED me to make my advice available to more people.  The people who I've touched created this book.  I'm just a vessel.  A vessel with a big mouth, a lot of experience and the courage to tell the truth even when it's not popular.  I speak the truth even when it's not what the reader wants to hear, but later they comeback and say \"Thank You!\"I love my job!I've put together a great book full of sound advice ANYONE can use.  I have long riffs on relationships, short bursts of honesty and last, but not least, grand points that will challenge the way you think and hopefully create discussion.  Read my book. Let the ideas swirl around in your head. If you find the words valid use them.  Change your life for the better.  You are the director of your life. Direct your life in the direction you want to go. Get off cruise control and take control.  I mean well and I'm proud of my work.Thanks for reading!Cheers!Tim.", "related": ["B00I1M4LIG"], "rank": 2463575, "title": "Truth Hurts - but it beats a lie!", "author": "Tim TheBartender", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her goal is to give her reader the ability to connect with her through her characters and then ask the tough questions to reflect inwardly on self.

I loved every moment of it.Ms. Beverley Oakleycreated an original and amazing plot. She keeps our attention through the whole book. And the characters... what can I say? Outstanding! I loved Mis Fanny and adore Lord Fenton. I enjoyed with their misunderstanding and I was delighted by their torrid and passionate meetings. And the end... made me burst out laughing. It rocks! 5 stars for her and I can hardly wait to read her new release...Ms. Beverley Oakley, I'm not above begging for more! I expect I won't have to wait too much longer for it, you are now one of my favorite writers.\"Just Erotic Romance ReviewsReviewer: Barbara McCormick - 5 Stars\"...The characters in Rake's Honour, a Regency romance, leap off the page and into the reader's heart....Ms. Oakley brings the setting and time period to life without lengthy descriptions of society's strict rules. The sex, oh my goodness, the sex is hot and in unusual settings as Fenton and Fanny must hide what they are up to from the eyes of judgmental society.Supporting characters like Fanny's younger sister and her friend and confidante, Lord Quamby, bring added life to a lush story. The pacing is just perfect, keeping you in your chair reading right through to the end. The \"mamas\" are ever present, placing demands on their children to marry well for family's sake. In the end, Rake's Honour is about satisfying society's demands while still finding ways to remain true to oneself and one's heart. For these reasons, Rake's Honour earns an honored spot on my re-read stack.\"", "related": ["B00LI91B0K"], "rank": 550003, "title": "Rake's Honour (Scandalous Miss Brightwell Book 1)", "author": "Beverley Oakley", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There are all sorts of ecommerce sites on the web. Why do so many of your books focus specifically on eBay?Answer. I think eBay offers the best shot for new sellers to gain traction selling online. eBay is easy to get started selling on; it has a built in customer base of over 250 million eager buyers; and you can sell just about anything.Question: That last part is the million dollar question, what are the best things to sell on eBay if you want to make money?Answer: That's the great thing about eBay. It really doesn't matter what you sell. There are so many people on the site, with so many interests, that you can sell just about anything if you package it right.Question: Can you give us a few examples?Answer: Think cell phones, consumer electronics, and video games. eBay has hundreds of sellers moving these same items. The problem is these are almost impossible fields to compete in. You're up against the likes of Best Buy and the other big box giants.Question: So what do you do?Answer: Smart sellers narrow their focus down and serve a niche.     Do you service and sell used cell phones? There's a huge market for refurbished phones on eBay. If you have a ready source of phones, and can restore them to factory settings you're going to do well.     Let me give you another example. My Kindle went crazy last fall and wouldn't charge. None of the computer stores in town wanted to look at it. The one guy I did find who was willing to give it a shot wanted eighty bucks, but he wouldn't guarantee anything. I searched eBay and found a guy who would reset the charger stem (return postage included) for $34.95. When I checked his feedback he was doing a booming business, and he wasn't the only one. Five other sellers were thriving doing the same thing.     In my case, I take old magazines libraries and book stores are begging to get rid and harvest articles and pictures from them that sell for twenty to fifty dollars each. In fourteen years of doing it, I've made over thirty thousand sales.Question: But aren't there too many sellers already? How can the average guy hope to find a new niche that will make them money? Isn't it a little like finding the proverbial needle in the haystack?Answer: Ideas are all around you?     Do you run a local screen print shop? You can do short orders of six, twelve or twenty-five t-shirts and cater to the small business market. Are you an artist? Open up an eBay store and put your masterpieces out there for a larger market to find. Is there a local business in your area that everybody just loves? Test the waters and put a few of their products on eBay.     If you're really at a loss for what to sell, take a drive around town; open up the phone book; follow your kids around for a day and listen to what gets them excited.Question: Earlier you mentioned you can sell anything if you package it right. What did you mean by that?Answer: You've got to be creative in your listings. That means crafting awesome titles loaded with keywords; your pictures need to showcase what you're selling and make people want to buy it; you're item description needs to make customers drool for more.     I keep thinking back to a designer I use on Fiverr. She describes her book covers as being so realistic customers will want to reach out and lick them. Are auction listing so enticing customers will want to lick them. If not, you probably want to go back to the drawing board.Final Question: What's the best way to get started?Answer:  Dive in head first. So many people talk about what they want to do. They put all of these obstacles in their way. I'll do it when I can spare a thousand dollars. I'll start when I'm on vacation next summer and have the time to do it right. I need to get more information before I get started.    Listen to me. That's all a bunch of horse-hockey we tell ourselves to keep from trying. The best way to start doing something is to do it. Make a few mistakes. Who cares?     Read my books. Learn how to sell on eBay. Whatever you do, don't over think it. It's not rocket science.     What's the worst you can do? Loose a few bucks. Maybe make a few extra bucks. You'll never know until you give it a shot.", "related": [], "rank": 1084465, "title": "Ebay Ninja Tips & Tricks", "author": "Nick Vulich", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this candid interview, Greene offers what you'll rarely get in TV interviews with even well-known scientists accustomed to the spotlight: a frank insistence on the beauty, the challenge, and the sheer inspirational bravado of ideas at the forefront of scientific theory and discovery. Greene understands lay readers, exudes infectious enthusiasm, and doesn’t pull punches. \"Science is not a subject,\" he insists. \"Science is a way of life that allows for a rational evaluation of all that you experience… There's a grand poetry in [even] the most esoteric science.\" Reading this interview vividly refreshed the memory of coming across his work for the first time. --Jason Kirk", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 279411, "title": "Brian Greene", "author": "Rivka Galchen", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.6, "rating_total": 46.0}

He had always been interested in studying the human mind and the society. Ian holds a BA degree in Sociology and apart from writing and investigation he works as a HR consultant for many European companies from various sectors.  In his free time he really enjoys travelling and getting to know different cultures. His favorite way of travelling is a spontaneous, adventurous travelling on a very little budget- something he has been doing since he was a teenager and became a part of his lifestyle. Hitchhiking, as well as using services like ’’couch surfing” are his preferred modes of immersing himself into new cultures and staying out of his comfort zone. He just loves the thrill of unpredictable travelling! Another passion of Ian’s is music. He plays the guitar, sings and composes music. He is also an electronic music producer- something he does as a hobby.  As a child and a teenager, Ian suffered from shyness and low self-esteem. Looking for solutions he would find consolation in doing lots of reading and writing songs. It wasn’t until he began to confront his fears and do exactly the opposite that his brain was telling him. He likes putting his experiences on paper, who knows - maybe they can inspire you in a way?", "related": ["B00HI0L8YC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 4.875, "rating_total": 78.0}

Sometimes a story develops slowly over time, inspiration trickling in. Other times, it comes in a flash. With Measure of Devotion, it came as an image.I was standing outside my bedroom closet when, as clear as day, I saw Kale in the last scene of Measure of Devotion. I instantly forgot what I was doing. There was something about him that drew me in. The anguish on his face was so compelling. I had to know how he got there. What had happened to him?Over the next few days, Kale told me his story. I was instantly in love with him, and getting to know him and Jason was like connecting with old friends. I even found myself feeling for Renee and the difficult situation in which society had placed her. All the characters came together to form the story of Measure of Devotion.The first person who ever read Measure of Devotion was my best friend. I actually read the end to her while she was driving and I was positively giddy to see that she cried. I was elated that she felt so close to the characters that she was brought to tears by their pain. The very first thing she wanted to know was what happened next.\"That's the end,\" I told her.\"You can't do that,\" she said.From the beginning, I had intended Measure of Devotion to be the story of this particular slice of Kale's life. Nothing more. I was happy with the ending. Kale got what he wanted, and that was that.\"Well then, write a sequel just for me.\" As if novels are the product of a long weekend.This argument went back and forth and ended with me conceding that I would remain open to inspiration for a sequel, but I wasn't going to force anything.Life continued.Work progressed on getting Measure of Devotion published, but there was that nagging voice of my best friend demanding a sequel. I spoke to Karen, my editor, about it and she liked the story as a standalone. She understood that I liked it as it was: a beautiful, bittersweet story of a man who experienced true love instead of the selfish love that is so rampant. However, she did think that a sequel would certainly be welcome if one came to me.Meanwhile, I moved on to other stories while Measure of Devotion was being prepared for publication.And that's when it happened.As soon as I turned my attention to another story, inspiration struck again. Only this time, it was Jason who called to me. I saw him sitting in the bar at the beginning of Measure of Strength. I needed to know where he was going from there.It didn't take long for Measure of Strength to take form after that. Additionally, I knew what would happen in a third book, although I didn't think at the time anyone would ever be interested.Why do I tell you this now?Mainly because several people have stated that I only wrote Measure of Devotion as a cliffhanger and setup for Measure of Strength. The truth is, the sequel wasn't even a thought until right before Measure of Devotion was released. I'm sure after reading this, those of you who thought I was mean before will think me doubly so now that you know I was willing to let Measure of Devotion stand.Also, my best friend wanted credit for the sequel.So there you have it, the story of how Measure of Devotion came to be.", "related": ["B00KFKXV10"], "rank": 447019, "title": "Measure of Devotion Trilogy Box Set", "author": "C.
