Merton was already one of the most influential spiritual writers of the twentieth century when he died unexpectedly in 1968, and in the more than 25 years since, his influence has continued to grow. This collection is a fascinating personal glimpse into the intellectual and spiritual sources of that influence. Moments of brilliance are intertwined with ordinariness lifted to extraordinary heights by increasingly disciplined reflection. The book will be of particular interest not only to those who seek a greater understanding of Merton, but also to those who seek a greater understanding of spiritual development and the spiritual dimensions of the political developments of this troubled century.Steve Schroeder", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book reviews the possible explanations for these problems and is quite successful in giving the reader a well-balanced picture of the field.\"--Physics Today\"Douglas Hoyt and Kenneth Schatten point out that the large numbers of sunspots during the 11th and 12th centuries made Earth significantly warmer, allowing Vikings to settle in Greenland, for example.

In three parts, the authors present material on solar activity, development of humankind's understanding of the sun, and the sun's variations; the sun-climate connection, particularly on the 11-year timescale; and possible alternative explanations for variations. Throughout the book, the authors pose the question `Does the sun affect the climate?' and present evidence to support and to discount the theory.\" --Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society\"Hoyt and Schatten's book is a fascinating and well written history of this interesting chapter of science that is relevant to the understanding of the earth system on one hand and to the increasingly fierce battle between conservationists and industrialists concerning global warming, on the other.

According to Sen, human well-being does not depend on the consumption of commodities but on the freedoms human beings have reason to choose and value. The capability approach has frequently been criticised for a lack of attention to the ways in which unjust social, political and economic structures restrict human capabilities. The contributors to this volume take up this criticism in a number of ways, both theoretical and practical. The theoretical discussion engages with the thought of Sen himself and with the hermeneutical tradition represented by Paul Ricoeur. The practical discussion consists of five case studies examining the effectiveness of the capability approach in dealing with cases of structural injustice. These cover: racism in South Africa; access to labour markets in Europe; participation in higher education in the UK; poverty and welfare reforms in the US; and biotechnology patents. How effectively, ask all the contributors, can Sen’s capability approach be deployed in the transformation of unjust structures?", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Savage Horsekin tribes escalate their bloody assaults on Northlands settlements in the name of their goddess, Alshandra.

Barely employed as an usher at a Village cinema, he falls for a colleague who seems dewily innocent even as he continues dumping his dirty clothes on girlfriend Sarah's floor. Then all in one day he loses his job, his chance for new love, and Sarah herself and winds up sleeping on the coach of a friend who's probably even more of a fuck-up than he is. From here he moves swiftly through trying to score, trying to keep his job at a porno theater by pretending that he's gay, and somehow getting himself involved in a robbery. Nersesian, a former editor at a literary magazine called The Portable Lower East Side and an English instructor at a community college in the Bronx, writes briskly and acutely, with a good sense of detail. At least he's not a fuck-up. But this isn't exactly the \"slice of gritty New York life\" promised on the cover.

It drew me in and just wouldn t let me go. I couldn t put it down. The characters were extremely well written. You felt as if you knew them and understood what they were going through. The intensity of the drama was gripping and held you in its grasp refusing to let go. This is not the type of book that I normally read and at first there were a few minor issues that annoyed me like the lack of racial diversity in Detroit s projects. Yet, I couldn t seem to stop reading and within a few chapters the annoyances became such a minor issue that I pretty much ignored them. Many books have twists and turns in their plot. Blood Sister has them too but with very unique twists and turns. I was pleasantly surprised on how Mr. Denny pulled off the ending. It definitely was not cookie cutter! I m not sure how to classify this book or if it s even possible. It has the innocence of childhood along with the violence of gang warfare. It has the loyalties of close friends and the betrayal of those you think are close to you. There s a mystery, some suspense, a bit of love and a lot of excellent writing. This book needs to come with a warning sign and not just against the violence throughout it.

In today's world of ever-shrinking resources and ever-mounting constraints we need creativity more than ever before, but the editors and the contributors have done all of us great service by warning of the disruption, pain, and danger that it may leave in its wake, not least to the creative people themselves.\"- Paul Ekblom, Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design\"An intriguing intellectual journey into the mad genius and sometimes psychopathically deviant roots of creativity.\"-  J. Reid Meloy, University of California, San Diego\"The question of the role of creativity's 'dark side' is one of the most important yet understudied phenomena in the social sciences. Indeed, in this age of corruption, financial meltdowns, and technological advances that outstrip our ability to understand them, are there more important topics in the study of creativity than ethics, unintended consequences, and potentially negative outcomes of creativity and innovation? I think not. This excellent volume provides a first-rate summary of the state of the art regarding these topics, and many of the chapters provide insightful analyses of where additional work is needed. The chapters are written by authors with wide-ranging backgrounds, who are among the leading thinkers on these topics from around the world. Speaking of diversity of perspective, kudos to the editors for including a chapter that questions whether there really is a dark side of creativity at all!\"-  Jonathan Plucker, Indiana University\"This is one of the most important books on creativity to be published over the last twenty years; its list of editors and contributors stands for high-quality chapters. With the 'dark side' illuminated from many different facets, a vastly neglected aspect of creativity has been opened for scholarly discussion. The volume offers an inspiring source and starting point for further research, bringing together a still much broader range of disciplines - since all realms and areas of human thinking and acting owe their benevolent, and malevolent, progress to creative persons, be it scientists, artists, politicians, or engineers, etc. Deep insights and knowledge about the 'dark side of creativity' as provided here may help to generally develop more responsibility and more wisdom in dealing with creative motives, actions, processes, and products in the interest of a more humane human cultural evolution.\"-  Klaus K. Urban, Leibniz University of Hannover, Germany\"....highly recommend.... The title of the book is simple enough to understand, and gives a thorough treatment of the issues negative to creativity; the content deserves more respect and acknowledgment than is currently given. If you read a chapter every night before going to sleep, bedtime stories will never be the same again.\"-Current Issues in Creativity Research, Kimberly T. Cardina, State University of New York/Buffalo State\"....The Dark Side of Creativity is a refreshing book with original insights.... easy to go beyond its boundaries and connect to other related ideas about creativity that have been circulating lately. I would recommend the book to anyone interested in creativity.\"--Stephen J. Guastello, PsycCRITIQUES\"....provide interesting reading but also reveal the chaotic state of research on creativity.... these essays shed light on the many ways in which scholars in the field think about negative creativity--and their many areas of disagreement.

I was determined to write something where the reader would identify with one of the characters, get to know them, be with them while they planned their robbery, and experience the set-backs. I wanted to capture the essence of the expression 'best laid plans of mice and men' and show how even serious setbacks can be circumvented.I worked in the 60's as a SONAR operator on board a diamond dredging vessel off the Skeleton Coast of South West Africa (NAMIBIA) and that gave me a lot of insight into the diamond mining business. This is slow starting book, because of the desire to build a relationship with the team, but once the action starts, it takes your breathe away.Most of my books relate to AFRICA and either my own experiences or the inter-woven experiences of close friends and relatives. However, this book is pure fiction as is stated inside the cover. If you are into high-tech stuff, this will make interesting reading. I read about very fast boats built to outrun even fast helicopters, commissioned by drug barons, that gave me the idea for the SEAWITCH used in this story.I enjoyed writing this book, it exercised my brain in more than one direction and I had many sleepless nights trying to work out how to get round this problem or that one.As I wrote it, I visualised it as a film and I would love to see it on the big screen.", "related": [], "rank": 2669612, "title": "Diamond Raiders", "author": "Bob Curby", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My mom had kept it and I found this paper while cleaning through my closet during my college days. According to my dreams back then, I wanted to be a farmer, but my last line was -but alas, girls can't be farmers.Well, I got my Bachelors Degree in Agriculture/Horticulture from Kansas State University, did agronomy research for years before starting a wholesale horticulture business. My company, Prairie Flower Creations, grew and dried flowers, ornamental corn, and mini pumpkins for the florist trade.In 1990 I was featured in Country Woman Magazine, but at the same time, my husband's job was transferred to California. I sold my business and tried to cope, growing flowers and pumpkins in five-gallon buckets on our cement lawn.I started writing about the family and farmland I was homesick for and started a new career, writing about women ancestors who had moved to the new state of Kansas and farmed its land.We eventually moved back to Kansas, bought land next to my family, raised buffalo, and I have a garden again. So not only have I fulfilled my dream to be a farmer, I've written about past and present women that have also tilled the prairie land of Kansas.Please read and enjoy my book series which are about the family that homestead our family farm, and my ancestors that homesteaded in Kansas in the 1800s.Considered historical fiction, these quality paperback books are age appropriate for everyone from age 9 to 99. Book, quilt, and Scandinavian gift shops sell them (or ask your local store to stock them for you) and schools use them in class studies to portray early pioneer and Kansas history.My writing time most days is spent on the computer with marketing my businesses, and working on the next book series.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Online information includes an image bank which has a good selection that you can use in your presentations but this resource could have been expanded to include some assessment tools to test knowledge. This book can be utilised by students, practising physiotherapists or in fact anyone with an interest in electrotherapy: it has something for all. It is simply enough explained for the novice but with enough depth for those with a bit more experience. If you want a good book that you will not outgrow too quickly and that you will continue to refer to, then this is the one.\"- Linda Wilkinson, Physiotherapy Student, University of Southampton, UK.\"Coming to the subject from a non-technical background, this electrotherapy text was definitely the right one for me as it doesn't get too technical or complicated. I'd recommend this book for anyone trying to get to grips with the subject.\"- Mayuri Butchart, Physiotherapy Student, King's COllege London, UK.“In summary this textbook provides an excellent up to date, evidenced based yet clinical relevant textbook encompassing all aspects of electrotherapy theory, a must for students!

Feder is rescued by Casey, brought home to the barn, and that's where the fun and games begin.One of the tropes of the erotica genre is that everything ends happily ever after, no matter how amazingly unlikely that's going to be. So when author Lorne Rodman starts exploring Casey’s thought process, and has the pragmatic rancher consider the unlikely pair's possible future, it was a welcome and well-crafted surprise. Then when a surprisingly satisfying end comes out of what appears to be an unworkable situation, it is even more delightful.A pleasant change of pace. It's nice to see a shape shifter story that doesn't involve abandoned houses, clan wars, and government conspiracy, but still has plenty of hot sex.", "related": ["B002C1A1Z4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Deadman's Throttle ain't literature, but it is a page-turner. And it's got something that you rarely find in novels that make the 'Greatest Books' lists: characters who ride motorcycles, crash motorcycles, talk about motorcycles, and read motorcycle magazines. Just like in real life.\" Twistgrip, Winter 1998 --Twistgrip, Winter 1998\"Deadman's Throttle might be a mystery novel about motorcycles more so than a mystery that includes motorcycles, but is quite a good read, well-crafted, believable, and entertaining.\" BMW Owners News, July 1999 --BMW Owners News, July 1999\"I read the book in one sitting and found it riveting as it is a page turner...... Without a doubt the author has talent and will develop as a novelist as he continues to write fiction..\"\"I thought the book was quite well written. I enjoyed it and it kept my interest. It was very good because it gave me some understanding of the motorcycle publishing business. The various technical terms, deadlines, etc. . . were believable and informative. All in all a very good effort - I'd look forward to a sequel.\"\"Suspense that truly keeps even the most seasoned rider. . . riveted to the edge of their seat! A wonderfully mysterious but deadly rider's adventure by Jerry Smith. Best read on black stormy moonless nights. . . by candlelight.\"\"I heartily recommend that you read Jerry Smith's fictional mystery thriller, Deadman's Throttle. The insight into the moto-mag business that Jerry presents is realistic and surprisingly on target, and he created a rollicking good tale. . . . The plot twists, and there's some who-done-it suspense, a surprise ending and even a little romance to keep things amusing.\" American Rider, December 1998 --American Rider, December 1998\"If you enjoy mystery stories, here's a good yarn about a moto-journalist who tracks down the killer of his brother. Author Jerry Smith spins an intriguing tale of Jason Street, the feature editor for fictitious Motorcycle Monthly magazine, who happens upon a motorcycle accident, discovers the victim is his brother, and quickly uncovers clues that it was murder, not an accident. In between brief forays to the office and track, he alternates between dallying with his sexy sweetheart and crashing various test bikes. The reader gets lots of clues to enable solving the mystery early. Smith weaves so many details of the motorcycle publishing business into this fantasy mystery, that you might think the real life of a moto-journalist is as exciting, rewarding, fast-paced and sexy as Jason Street's fictitious lifestyle.\"While Motorcycle Monthly is supposed to be at the bottom of the motorcycle-mag feeding chain, it's got a plush conference room, a garage full of test motorcycles, a full-time mechanic, credit cards for expenses, a full-time receptionist who even lines up photo shoots, and just one or two feature articles per month expected of each of the five full-time highly-paid staffers. I was about to call Motorcycle Monthly for a job before I remembered this was just a fantasy. Deadman's Throttle isn't the typical 'biker' pulp, but a well crafted yarn, woven onto a motorcycling warp with lots of fast action and believable dialogue. If you enjoy fiction, why not lay in a copy for one of those cold winter evenings when you can use at least a vicarious motorcycling fix?\" Motorcycle Consumer News, March 1999 --Motorcycle Consumer News, March 1999\"The insight into the moto-mag business that Jerry presents is realistic and surprisingly on-target, and he created a rollicking good tale.\" --American Rider\"The tale is as satisfying to a reader as one of those mountain roads is to rider. A person who is both rider and reader can't go wrong with Jerry Smith. . .\" Motorcycle Times, May/June 1999 --Motorcycle Times, May/June 1999\"The writing hold the reader's attention from cover to cover. And aside from the title, Smith avoids using cliches. If you're interested in the moto-mag business, one of the best parts of the book may be the glimpse into the inner workings it provides. . . . Deadman's Throttle is a worthwhile book.\" Motorcyclist. --Motorcyclist", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Finally, I\nmanaged to get a temp job in a superstore, over the Christmas period, and when\nthe temp contracts were coming to expiry date we were told that there were two\nfull-time jobs opening. I think there were about twenty temps at the time. They\nall wanted to keep their jobs. I was shocked by the amount of backstabbing,\nrumours, lies and general horribleness that was going on. It did make me\nwonder, what would happen if keeping this job meant life or death? How far\nwould people really go? This was the birth of Five Days Notice. The book plays\non the many things I experienced and witnessed, but set in this dark gothic\nworld where having a job is like winning the lottery. I think it's an\ninteresting insight into the human mind, and how different personalities come\nup with different solutions to this life/death situation. Check out the book.

Well-known Duke University physician and psychiatrist Koenig offers a practical overview of the benefits of the relationship between religion and medicine as well as a detailed survey of the ways in which religion and medicine might work together beneficially. Using research studies of medical patients, he demonstrates that many patients say that their religious practices and beliefs enable them to cope with their illnesses or diagnoses. Koenig broadens his study to focus on the ways that religious belief influences mental health, immunological and neurological diseases, cardiovascular problems and longevity. For example, one study links the incidence of type-II diabetes with nonattendance at religious services; those not attending such services were twice as likely as attendees to have elevated levels of a protein that predicts the development of the disease.

Boyd, a women's studies professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, shows that as far back as the Gold Rush of 1849, the city manifested a charmingly lax attitude toward enforcement of public morals-gaining a reputation as a \"wide-open town\"-and repeatedly resisted civic moralists who tried to enforce antivice laws. By the 1930s and the fall of Prohibition, the city hosted \"publicly visible queer cultures and communities\" with tourist-friendly nightclubs and bars. While Boyd relies on standard historical texts and sources such as police records for basic city history, the book is deeply informed and enlivened by 42 oral histories she gathered with lesbians and gay men who have lived in San Francisco since the 1930s. Five are partially reprinted here, and this terrific material allows Boyd to explore topics that have traditionally been ignored by gay historians: how drag shows helped stimulate the tourist economy of the city; how its African-American community engendered changes in the structures of the gay community; how a distinct lesbian public space evolved with the advent of such bars as Mona's in the 1930s and '40s; and how the city put itself at the forefront of transgender activism in the 1950s and '60s. Boyd has a keen ear for distinctive details, and it is this (rather than her major contention, that \"the politics of everyday life were every bit as important as the politics of organized social movement activism\") that drives this welcome study.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Gay & Lesbian", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When Jesus died on the cross at Calvary, did he die for the sins of the elect only or for the sins of the whole world? Can anyone respond in faith to the gospel message? Or is the act of believing a gift of God only given to a subset of humanity called the elect so that the rest of humanity is unable to believe and destined to spend eternity apart from God? What does the term elect mean in the New Testament? These are fundamental questions about the God of the Bible and the salvation He provides in Jesus Christ. This book invites you to sit as an unbiased juror and consider the traditional principles of TULIP Calvinism as explained by the leading Calvinists in their own words, then to weigh their proffered Scriptural evidence to make your own determination. This book will address exegetically all of the most commonly cited proof texts for Calvinism, with a thorough consideration of the \"pillar\" passages like John 6:44, Romans 3 and 9, and Ephesians 1:4. This book will defend a middle ground position (called NULIF - \"new life\") between TULIP Calvinism and Arminianism and demonstrate that you can tell people with confidence that God loves them, Jesus died for their sins, and they can be saved by trusting Christ for the forgiveness of their sins based on his finished work at Calvary.", "related": ["B00DDHE1BG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

You could pick up a \"pulp\" magazine for ten or fifteen cents--published by a company like Street & Smith or Ziff-Davis and featuring a hero like Doc Savage or The Shadow. Or you could pop into your local movie theater and watch a cliffhanger serial like Flash Gordon, Spy Smasher, or Tarzan from a studio like Republic Pictures or Universal. Serials often were adapted for newspaper comics and radio plays as well.Although both the pulp magazine and the cliffhanger serial movie became extinct several decades before I was born, I was drawn to these genres in the late 1970s and early 1980s. That's when I came across the Bantam paperback editions of the Doc Savage stories. I also discovered Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark, two films that, according to creator George Lucas, were inspired by classic serial adventure films.As I planned my first novel, I thought about combining the fast pace and thrills of the pulp adventure story with the episodic nature of the old movie serials. The result would be a pulp-inspired adventure story that was told in episodes: a serial novel.Serialized novels aren't new; they've been around for a long time, going back to the Arabian Nights stories, the tales of Charles Dickens, and the many adventures of Sherlock Holmes. More recent examples of serialized novels include Tom Wolfe's 1987 bestseller, The Bonfire of the Vanities (which was first published in 27 episodes in Rolling Stone magazine), and Stephen King's The Green Mile (which sold over 18 million copies of six thin paperback installments in the late 1990s). At that time, King's publishers struggled with the logistics of issuing a new episode every month. They also struggled with pricing, initially proposing a fee of $7 for each short episode--the same price as a traditional paperback at that time. King and his people were able to convince the publisher to go with the more affordable price of $3 per episode.Today with e-books, distribution is a snap. And pricing is pretty close to what the old pulps sold for back in the 1940s. (A fifteen-cent pulp from 1946 would cost $1.81 in today's dollars.)So here we are: a modern series of pulp-inspired adventures, told roughly 10,000 words at a time, utilizing several classic storytelling ideas in a new way. It's called the LAND OF ENCHANTMENT series, and it features a very unconventional protagonist exploring the unknown in what's arguably the most mysterious place on earth: New Mexico, the Land of Enchantment.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Suddenly she was sharing space with dead people and experiencing the bizarre world of the unknown and the uncanny. An over-active imagination did not, at first, serve her well for she feared what she did not understand.  Learning to read opened her to the world of books and she read everything she could find about supernatural and paranormal phenomena. The more she read, the more she learned and the more she realized how little she knew. This has led to a lifelong search for knowledge, truth and enlightenment. Constantly inspired to write, from the age of eight she began telling the stories streaming like movies through her mind. Although determined to grow up and become a writer, her sense of adventure led to a career in the United States Air Force. Despite a busy and demanding life, Deborah continued writing the stories that came to her in flashes of inspiration and her quest for knowledge continued. Her military career now behind her, she is focused on her lifelong dream of being an author and sharing the stories she’s been so compelled to write.

Parts of it still surprises me. I read it and I'm like, \"Really? I thought of that? Interesting.\" I suppose that's because I barely remember the actual process of writing it- lots of staying up late, lots of mind-numbing medication and too much alcohol. That's what they tell us to do in writing school, right? Well, it wasn't like that, but I'll explain...Like most of my books- the darker ones, anyway- it started with a dream. The dream was simple: I was digging up a grave at night. I didn't know why I was digging it up, but it was very important for me to get the job done. My shovel finally hit wood and I sighed, glad that the heavy work was done. I opened the lid and there was my mother, alive and well.So, that was a pretty weird night. I have a lot of nights like that. I don't sleep much. I don't like to sleep. Some weeks, I go days on end without sleep. Too much of that, and it's easy to sympathize with a character like Terry Reed. Too many days like that, and you start getting crazy ideas in your head. The flip-side to that is, too much medication- the book mentions Xanax a lot, which I was a big fan of at the time- and you wind up like Maggie Thompson, too dull and numb to know how to navigate life.So I had those two characters down, but getting into Curtis Miller's head, however, was a bit more work. I'd spend my weekends watching serial killer documentaries and reading through cases on the Internet. I took it a step further, thinking\"What would Christian Bale do?\"and went all Method in my pursuit to get inside that poor, sad monster of mine- driving through Memphis, investigating some quiet, dark hiding places- sometimes at the risk of great personal danger- checking out the working girls, wondering what it would be like to toss them in my trunk. I didn't kill anyone in my \"research\", of course, but I definitely walked away with a bad taste in my mouth.The whole thing left me even worse off mentally than I was before, unable to sleep to the point that I began to hallucinate. I actually had the tip of my finger cut off at work because I was so sleep-deprived.Hell of a way to live.I drew heavily on two influences to put this novel together: comics from the great British masters (I'm a huge Neil Gaiman fan, especially his older stuff) and heavy metal. I even named the book after one of the many Opeth albums I was listening to at the time. I think the album compliments the book well. Both are dark, and even the softer moments are tinged with regret and pain.All in all, it was a fun trip into Hell, and I'm glad it's over.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The more he played, the more he enjoyed this humble little instrument and decided to start sharing his experiences on the internet. The response was massive with the site being hugely popular today. He doesn't so much write about 'how to play', but rather shares his love of the instrument and provides advice to new players on how to live with a ukulele.He doesn't class himself as a great player, just a strummer but has an infectious love for the instrument and a desire to help other new players who are just starting out. Following the success of the blog he was persuaded to put down his best tips and advice for new players into a series of books. They hit the shelves at just the right time with great success (his first book going on to become the best selling music book on Kindle at one point in 2011)The ukulele really is an instrument for everyone - its quick to pick up the basics (most beginners can easily be playing a simple song in 30 minutes) and it really gets people talking.Keep strumming!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I ask you, the reader the question. What were your dreams long ago? What did you want to be when you were a child growing up and how did those dreams vanish? What were they replaced with? Why were they replaced?   Not all of us find a relationship that allows us to follow our life path. Most of us, mainly the women, become mothers and wives, and the keeper of the house. We become focused on our relationships with those around us, often giving up our own dreams for the sake of others. Then what happens when your identity is removed, by the partner who leaves? Who do you become then? These topics are explored in this book, and so is the adventure of a lifetime that my Carnegie Lane gets to experience. Not all of it is great, yet all of it is compelling.. I hope you enjoy!IN THE BACK OF THE BOOK...Firstly, I would like to thank everyone for their kind words and amazing response to this story. I would like to answer one of my most asked questions. Is there really a book called 'Impossible Things'? The answer is a resounding yes, the book does exist and I look forward to letting you know when it will be available for release.I have listed many songs that reflect my music taste and those songs that bring back memories for me. There are so many others that didn't make it in this book although they are not forgotten. The website for Carnegie Lane has links to the bands represented from my poster collection on the cover and also links to the songs mentioned in this book and beyond.carnegielanebook.comis where you will find it. Check it out when you can and get lost in the wonderful world of sound. If you remember you loved the music, support the artists and buy the song. ITunes links also listed!Although this book is fiction, some of it is loosely based on events that have happened, just changed a little to protect the not so innocent.  These events are drawn not only from my world, but also from the world of my gorgeous friend and personal muse, Maree Furniss who helped me so much to write this.  Thanks woman!There has been many a laugh and tear constructing the universe of my Carnegie Lane. I got to rediscover my absolute love for all things 80's, taking me back to a time when I did wear Doc Martins, have jet black hair and follow the underground rock scene all over Sydney. So this is a great time to thank all the musicians in the world. The old and the new, the ones I don't know and... the ones I do, for keeping me sane with endless tunes while I write.  Oh, and a huge thank you to Robert Smith from The Cure, simply for existing! Music is a gateway to the soul.Remember to play it loudly.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.8333, "rating_total": 29.0}

Like many, he was blinded by the limitations that his ancestry placed upon him. As all who have twists and turns in life, he was stretched, bent and broken along the way, continually re- shaped. As a rebel, maverick and loner, he realized almost too late, how he had resisted conforming to \"fit in\". He insisted on doing it \"his own way\". He did just that; \"he found his own success\", albeit late, - but in his own way!\" His story starts with the family's roots in 1710, in New Jersey.

It is as insightful about the one as it is the other.\"--Raymond F. Collins, visiting scholar, Brown UniversityPraise for the Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture\"This series richly provides what has for so long been lacking among contemporary scriptural commentaries. Its goal is to assist Catholic preachers and teachers, lay and ordained, in their ministry of the Word. Moreover, it offers ordinary Catholics a scriptural resource that will enhance their understanding of God's Word and thereby deepen their faith. Thus these commentaries, nourished on the faith of the Church and guided by scholarly wisdom, are both exegetically sound and spiritually nourishing.\"--Thomas G. Weinandy, OFM Cap, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops\"I welcome with great joy this collection of commentaries on the Bible because the project corresponds perfectly to a pressing need in the Church. I am speaking about exegetical studies that are well grounded from a scholarly point of view but not overburdened with technical details, and at the same time related to the riches of ancient interpretation, nourishing for spiritual life, and useful for catechesis, preaching, evangelization, and other forms of pastoral ministry.\"--Albert Cardinal Vanhoye, SJ, Pontifical Biblical Institute, former secretary of the Pontifical Biblical Commission\"This commentary series appears to me to be a gift of the Holy Spirit to Catholic clergy, religious, and laity at this historic moment. Pope Benedict has effectively announced the rebirth of Catholic biblical theology, bringing together Scripture, tradition, and the teachings of the Church. This commentary reflects not only biblical criticism but also the unity of the Word of God as it applies to our lives.\"--Benedict J.

In 1988, while presiding at the San Antonio parish in Pouso Novo (RS) Brazil, he learned from local natives about a potent all-natural Aloe arborescens recipe they used to promote health when chronically ill. He began to recommend it to the chronically ill people he came to know and pastor. It was here he first observed the positive results obtained with phytonutrition against advanced disease states. Afterwards, he was sent to Jerusalem and Italy, where he continued to see great success in the nutritional benefit to the chronically ill when he recommended they try this recipe made with the whole leaf of the native Aloe arborescens plant that grows in the region. This inspired him to devote his life to research and education on the Aloe Arborescens botanical and the Brazilian recipe that has been published in the two books he has written Cancer Can Be Cured and Aloe Is Not Medicine and Yet ...It Cures At the request of many people and organizations, he has given lectures and conferences in Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, France, Italy and Brazil about the ability of the human body to heal and regulate itself when supplied with the cell-required concentrated micronutrients found in the polysaccharides (complex sugar molecules) of this Aloe plant species and the recipe.Father Zago explains how Phytotherapy Research has shown the abundant supply of herbal therapeutic and medicinal properties of Aloe arborescens provides supreme immune system support so the cells and organs of the body can regain their normal functioning.", "related": ["B00HI0L8YC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That, along with some questionable focus, caused him to reassess his direction. The following four years were spent crisscrossing the pacific ocean in the service of the United States Navy, where as they say, “It’s not just a job, it’s an adventure.” This would become a time of personal growth and a stockpile of stories for years to come. But it wasn’t until after spending several years in the technology fields of the mid-nineties that he started tinkering with writing. It was a way to escape the lightning fast and power hungry culture of the corporate data communication world; personal time where outside influences weren’t allowed in. And then, it happened. After leaving the major metropolitan area they had lived in for years, in hope of finding more time to devote to family, Stew and his wife were able to ratchet back the pace of life a notch.  Along with their three young children, they relocated to a small, rural community in southwestern Kansas. What they found was an opportunity to explore possibilities, and, various ways to make a living. In time, Stew's resume would include working alongside cowboys in a cattle feed yard, writing ad copy for a radio station and a member of staff in an industrial flour mill. During that time, the writing bug started biting and it wasn’t long before he had a short story in fiction ready for publication. Assorted writing opportunities followed in various periodicals, then a concept hit for a unique angle to explore conspiracy fiction.

(Enoch) Arnold Bennett was born in Hanley, Staffordshire, in 1867. Arnold followed his father into the legal profession but at the age of 21, he decided to leave his father's firm and moved to London and worked as a solicitor's clerk. He won a literary competition in \"\"Tit Bits\"\" magazine in 1889 and in 1893 became assistant editor of the journal, Woman. He published his first essentially autobiographical novel The Man from the North in 1898. His best work is contained in his novels of the 'Five Towns' which include Anna of the Five Towns (1902), The Old Wives' Tale (1908), Clayhanger (1910), The Card (1911), Hilda Lessways (1911) and These Twain (1916). During the First World War, he became Director of Propaganda at the War Ministry. He refused a knighthood in 1918.

Her work -- and it was work,\nincluding research of her own -- in restoring the White House, rather than just\nredecorating it, showed a no-nonsense idea of America's past and the crucial\nplace of the White House in it. (When the British wanted to insult the country\nsymbolically in the War of 1812, they understood what the White House stood for,\nand burned it.) After she survived sitting next to the bullet that killed the\nPresident of the United States and her husband, she insisted on working closely\nwith journalists and historians to set down an eyewitness record of the\nimportant White House era she lived through, years when the Berlin Wall went\nup; days of the superpower standoff of the Cuban missile crisis.           More surprises yet in\nher energetic life after the White House. In those years her education and her\nlively intellectual curiosity kept providing her with reasons to remain\nengaged. Her wealth and status offered other opportunities that she avoided:\nthe opportunity for nothing but leisure, a way of life that she worked hard to\navoid, and that she avoided by working hard.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His latest is no exception. Peach has been away from the CID for a year, during which solve rates have decreased and the department has faltered under the mismanagement of Peach's boss and nemesis, Superintendent Tommy \"Bloody\" Tucker. Peach is assigned to the high-profile case of prostitute Sarah Dunne, who's been brutally strangled. Tucker, one of those awful bosses who loves taking all the credit when his subordinates perform well, warns Peach that he'd better solve the case in double-quick time. Peach, whose great delight in life is to insult the pompous Tucker without Tucker quite catching on, continues his campaign to undercut his loathsome boss. But Peach is also a gifted detective who's dedicated to his job, and he's determined to find Sarah Dunne's killer, even with Tucker's bungling attempts to control the case. A compelling, funny, highly entertaining police procedural that makes a fine addition to any mystery collection.Emily MeltonCopyright © American Library Association.

Bremmer)  Bremmer has also written a stand alone thriller-Cornstalked. Growing up in Omaha, Nebraska, Patricia A. Bremmer had a strong fascination for mysteries and puzzles. As a young girl, she spent hours solving crossword and other word puzzles and devouring every Perry Mason book she could get her hands on. Patricia married at age twenty, and joined her husband on the road traveling across the United States with a stable of racehorses, giving her a feel for a variety of cultures and landscape. Not to mention an outstanding knowledge of horses. To earn extra money she made jockey silks and saddle towels to sell to trainers and owners at the racetracks. After starting her family, she moved to a small rural area in western Nebraska, which gives her the ability to write that small town country feel into scenes in her books as well as her big city experience.  Bremmer discovered her talent for storytelling in 2003 when she penned her first mystery novel. Since then she spends several months of the year putting her plots to paper. The rest of the time is devoted to her kennel of West Highland White Terriers. An excellent speaker, Bremmer makes guest appearances at libraries, book stores and schools to captivate her audiences with her relaxed tone while discussing her writing. And, to add to the excitement of her appearances, she frequently includes her real life detective who has become the sleuth in her novels. Together they charm and entertain the crowds.  To keep up with her puzzle loving personality she adds an Elusive Clue word puzzle hidden within the pages of her books-- a real treat that brings out the detective in her readers. Patricia Bremmer, mother of three has nine grandchildren.", "related": ["B0031ER172"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story is based on a discovery made in the Nevada Desert in 1940, when ancient remains were found. Later, those remains were determined to be the oldest mummified remains known in North America. They were also discovered to be unrelated to the indigenous people of the area, and surprisingly enough, were probably Caucasians. This fictional account offers one possible explanation to the events that took place so long ago. A far superior and more entertaining book than Clan of the Cave Bear, Cassinelli has done a wonderful job of getting into the heads of his characters, making each person real and distinct. His knowledge of archeology and the setting greatly enhance the story, but don't overwhelm it. You won't feel like you're reading a text book. Instead, readers will feel like they stepped out of the modern age into life in the Great Basin centuries in the past, and into a great adventure. If you'd like to treat yourself to a book that isn t formulaic or run-of-the-mill, read Legends of Spirit Cave. --Deana Hoover, Carson TimesDennis Cassinelli combines science with interpretation, fact with a highly believable fictional narrative. [Legends of Spirit Cave] will enhance our perceptions and understandings of very early Nevada history and is sound enough to be used in the classroom as a basis for discussion. Mr. Cassinelli's years of research on the very early inhabitants of the Great Basin -- and Nevada in particular -- and his strong belief in scientific investigation and validation, require judicial and open-minded reading of the story he weaves. --Mary Ellen Conaway, Ph.D., Director of Museums, Carson Valley Historical Society", "related": ["B00H8BG33C"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I spend part of my time teaching at a local preschool and writing, while the rest is devoted to family.  Writing is new to me, but storytelling has been a life long hobby.  I love using words to create images and feelings for others.   Writing offers me an escape from the wonderful chaos that is my life.  Raising two small children takes a lot of energy and I often collapse in my office chair late at night and let my ideas flow.  I find that I enjoy my self-published status because it gives me the freedom to write what I want, how I want.  I often choose characters who may not fit the norm of what most think of as a hero or heroine.  I like my characters unique and I like their story to flow from me instead of what someone else’s guidelines. I hope you enjoy my stories.  I enjoy hearing from you.  I do read emails and I try my best to reply if necessary.  I would love to hear your ideas and all about the types of books you enjoy most.

I left the navy in 1970 and became a civil pilot which I did until I retired at 55. I started and ran a business in London for seven years before retiring to Antigua. I lost my life's savings in the Stanford Ponzi Scheme so we manage now on my pensions which are quite small, but hell, we live in Paradise so it can't be all bad.I discovered I was gay when I was 35, (yes, I know, ridiculous), I had been divorced for two years by then so no one got hurt emotionally. I met Rafe in 1980 and my whole family fell in love with him, so no angst for me at all.If you want anymore info on me, just ask. I'm a very open person so you won't offend me if you want to get more personal.If you'd like to give me comments or suggestions to any of my books, feel free to shoot me an email at chris_johns@awesomeauthors.org.", "related": ["B00IZR0FI2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In old age, Rose shares her home with her sisters once more, as Lily nurses her bitterness after two unfulfilling marriages and June lives in a comfortable fantasy world delineated by her paintings and her selective memory. Sylvia, who has gone to college and built a career as a travel writer, returns to Ash Hill to make peace with her turbulent past, realizing that \"although Lily, June and Rose lived together and had shared much of what had happened in their lives, each one still held on to a separate way of seeing those events . . . .

My interest in space was further fueled by the awesome ‘B’ Sci-Fi films being made in the early sixties. There was adventure and hope and the possibility that we were not alone in the universe. Oh, and the chance that I might someday have a flying car, or a jet pack!Always an Artist and a Musician, I painted scenes of distant planets and environments that I referred to as “travel photos”, and with my wife Katharine, helped create a band called Windshadow, that played original music in the genre of…you guessed it, Spacey Progressive Rock. Although we never got our ‘big break’, the band played for almost 20 years opening big shows for the likes of Chuck Mangione and Rick Wakeman of “Yes” fame. Shortly after that, the music was put on hold and Katharine and I turned our attention to raising a family.Working as a Custom Woodworker, sitting on all of this pent-up creative energy, I felt it was time to apply my lifetime of Sci-Fi experience and imagination to writing. After all, I’d spent the last twenty years or so filling notebooks with lyrics and thought, hey, maybe I can write more than one page of words? The rest of the story, yet to be written, is hopefully contained in my work.", "related": ["B00ANXO4K6"], "rank": 3583541, "title": "Futura eBook", "author": "David Laake", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Binebine portrays these young men as supremely human, victims of powers much larger than themselves, and like any Kafkaesque anti-hero, cogs in an incomprehensible and monstrous machine.\"—Starred Publishers Weekly\"Moroccan painter, novelist, and former math teacher Binebine (Welcome to Paradise) writes with humor and pathos amid the novel’s grinding tragedy but never allows the narrative to veer into self-pity or cheap sentimentality. The book is based on the 2004 suicide bombings in Casablanca, and Binebine’s unblinking eye for detail makes thisa haunting tale.\"—Library Journal\"This is a heart-stopping, heart-breaking narrative—the story of a group of young men trying to make lives for themselves in one of Casablanca's poorest slums. It captures the intersection of politics, poverty, religion, and youth. It is a story as beautiful as it is disturbing, as sober-minded as it is astonishingly wild and expansive.\"—Pauls Toutonghi, author ofEvil Knievel Days\"Like Paulo Lins’s sweeping Brazilian sagaCity of God, Binebine’sHorses of Godis the story of a violent, maze-like city-within-a-city—Casablanca’s Sidi Moumen shantytown—its anonymous dreams and scavenger dumps, campfires and soccer matches and 'hashish-scented sky.' But, above all, it’s about Sidi Moumen’s soul and the 'living dead' yearning to escape, to be reborn, to grow wings and soar above its crumbling walls. Binebine writes living, breathing history, vividly capturing our incendiary daily world from the inside out.\"—Anderson Tepper, editor,Vanity FairPraise forWelcome to Paradise\"...determinedly humanistic and profoundly touching...\" —Shelf Awarenessstarred review\"...A strong, unsparing novel...\"—Booklist“A masterful account of North Africans trying to sneak across the Straits of Gibraltar into Spain . . .

The answers are explored in Mahi Binebine's terse, bleak compassionateWelcome to Paradisewhich is both topical and rare in tracing the phenomena to its roots: to the poverty and cruelty the emigrants are escaping.\"—Financial Times\"The suspense is compelling, and the novel's lyricism assails a dehumanising anonymity.

His books seem to have a life of their own. They take readers by the hand and lead them through a landscape of political upheaval, intrigue and scandal. I have enjoyed his previous book, 'Cry of Eagles'. 'Strike For Honor' certainly did not disappoint me. Vucak takes readers inside cabinet meetings, almost convincing me he has firsthand knowledge of what goes on in one. He has created realistic situations, lifelike characters and convincing dialog that place readers in the midst of what could be a disastrous political situation. Lives are at stake and political alliances are in jeopardy. If Stefan Vucak's previous books set a high bar for excellence, 'Strike For Honor' has surpassed that bar.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With a little help from her Gram, Liz gets a job as a maid in the Zanardi household, where she soon begins compiling a list of suspects. From her family to her ex-husbands to her servants, the bad-tempered countess, it seems, was hated by everyone. In between cleaning up the mansion, Liz uncovers more than a few secrets, but now she must decide if she wants to share this information with Ike.

In “Keeping Order,” the residents of a retirement home become unwilling hosts to a group of unruly younger women who upend routine upon their arrival. “It’s Going to Be All Right” follows sensitive 17-year-old Ardis, who cares for a couple’s baby at night. When the couple’s marriage begins to crumble, Ardis takes matters into her own hands. In “Living Together,” Ralph and Claudia, long isolated from one another over the course of their 52-year marriage, are suddenly forced back together. Whelan’s affecting novella, “Keeping Your Place,” opens with Anne Hennert’s return to her family’s remote Wisconsin cabin, built by her father after his return from WWI. The recently widowed Anne  has agreed to sell the cabin, much to the displeasure of a longtime family friend. As Anne prepares the place for demolition, her family’s perspectives and journeys are woven into the cabin’s history, creating a fitting complement to the book’s encompassing stories. --Leah Strauss", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a vivid portrayal of a world she clearly loves. -- Rachel Sylvester THE TIMES 20130608 It is briskly and competently written... if you are a Widdy fan, as she seems to believe most people are, you'll enjoy this book. -- Lynn Barber THE SUNDAY TIMES 20130609 Ann Widdecombe has sailed through life with the same brisk, no-nonsense style that she brings to this highly readable memoir. -- Lloyd Evans THE SPECTATOR 20130608 The book is breezily written, as befits the author of four novels, and characteristically honest. -- Stephen Moss THE GUARDIAN 20130606 a feisty public figure in an increasingly conformist world, a woman who doesn't give a toss what you think about her looks and isn't prepared to compromise her views for anyone -- Ian Thomson EVENING STANDARD 20130606 From Singapore to Dartmoor and Parliament to the pantomime stage, Ann takes readers on a gloriously entertaining journey through her life. HELLO magazine 20130617 Publishers know that the sales of political memoirs depend entirely on the author's popularity. This explains why Alan Johnson's autobiography has risen skywards while poor David Blunkett's performed a bellyflop. Widdecombe's ripping tale will follow the flightpath of the former. -- Lloyd Evans THE SPECTATOR If feminism is about robust individualism and uncompromising, occasionally bolshie personality - and your guess is as good as mine - well, she's up there with Mary Beard...She's good-humoured about the controversies but gets her own back. -- Melanie McDonagh THE EVENING STANDARD Ann Widdecombe is big. It's politics that got small. -- Liz Jones THE MAIL ON SUNDAY She has a compelling story to tell, particularly about political dramas at the heart of Westminster and, with the instinctive gift for narrative that has made her a successful novelist, she relates it in a highly readable style. -- Leo McKinstry DAILY EXPRESS 20130621 Hugely entertaining autobiography...the principal joy of this book, though, is that, reading it, you could just as easily be sitting chatting to Ann. -- Peter Stanford THE CATHOLIC HERALD But I have great pleasure in saying that this book is a cut above the usual political autobiography and I would have been proud to publish it. -- Iain Dale LBC.CO.UK The former minister, author and Express columnist's life story is clearly a gripping read. SUNDAY EXPRESS This is a charming portrait of growing up, an insightful portrait of an age, and a candid account of the mess of Parliament from a survivor of the electoral carnage of 1997. -- Pat Ashworth CHURCH TIMES 20131129 [on Ann] She had many of Thatcher's qualities, with more of the wit... -- John Rentoul POLITICAL BOOKS 20131222", "related": [], "rank": 2824046, "title": "Strictly Ann", "author": "Ann Widdecombe", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Now, however, Keith has become alarmingly physical in his efforts to resume their marriage. Then there's her renewed but unwanted attraction to old flame Reid Sayers, back in their shrinking Louisiana town to take over his late father's lumber mill. Sensitive, CIA-trained Reid, convinced he's too dangerous for love, has long harbored a deep attraction of his own and sets himself up as Cammie's protector. He becomes her no-strings lover, longing for but terrified of a closer role. When word gets out that European interests may buy the mill, possibly damaging the environment but surely saving the town, the two clash on the issue. Butting heads by day and pressing bodies at night, they find their passion drawing them closer even as their suspicions tear them apart. A person who discovers that Cammie may actually own the mill goes missing, a major player turns up dead and escalating doubt threatens the couple's unexpressed love. But as Cammie observes, \"The heart wasn't logical, of course, or particularly bright. . . . It had few principles, less sense.\" Exhaustive sex scenes distract from the solid plotting and truly felt male/female dynamics, but fans of the multimillion-selling Blake ( Arrow to the Heart and some 40 other novels) will be thoroughly pleased.

Today there are thousands of schools, clinics, farms and other organizations involved in practical work based on his principles. His many published works feature his research into the spiritual nature of the human being, the evolution of the world and humanity, and methods of personal development. Steiner wrote some 30 books and delivered over 6000 lectures across Europe. In 1924 he founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hannah’s baby girl is now 14 months old. No longer a grad student, Hannah is in Jerusalem, where her husband is attending a symposium. In an open-air market, Hannah witnesses an American man being hassled by several men; later, she learns that the man was murdered shortly thereafter. Invited to participate in a local dig, she eagerly accepts, hoping to escape the violence of the city, but she doesn’t count on the violence following her. Hagit, her baby-minder, says it’s the Evil Eye (in the market, Hannah allowed some women to pay compliments to her little girl, a serious no-no), but there is something more prosaic—and more deadly. Fans of the Jennings series will enjoy seeing Hannah in her new, more mature role as a mother, and, as always, the story is sharply told. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kurt has always loved to be outdoors. Having grown up in the suburbs of Chicago, he truly appreciates the fishing and outdoor opportunities his current residence in the northwoods of Wisconsin offers him. When not on the front deck of his bass boat, Kurt enjoys playing guitar and writing music, blogging and creating videos for fishingforward.com, studying Texas Hold 'em strategies and relaxing pizza/movie nights on the sofa with his wife and daughter. In his professional career, Kurt has studied all aspects of graphic  design, copywriting, advertising and marketing.

How could she not write about a scripture that required Israelite soldiers to shave the heads of their newly claimed Canaanite brides? Particularly after getting a haircut that took her from shoulder-length to nearly scalped with a simple request for a 'trim'! She has a sequel, His Brother's Wife, that will pick up the book about 17 years later, so soon you will be able to see more of Javan and Taleh, and meet some of the other inhabitants of this little village. She firmly believes that each book of a series should be able to stand alone, complete in itself. She also loves English history, and gladly writes about whatever historical events and oddities grab her. As for time travel, wouldn't it be great to be whisked off to another time? Since no one has a working time machine yet, she'll just have to content herself with sending her characters there. A lifelong Minnesotan, snow delights her and she is jealous of everyone who gets a blizzard when she doesn't. Blame that on early years living on Minnesota's beautiful North Shore.

Each day thousands of subscribers in 160 countries get it by email, Facebook, and Twitter. Subscriptions are free. The blog posts vary from day to day, and include jokes, satire, parody, books, music, films, videos, food, unbelievable but true news items, and anything that brings a grin, chuckle, laugh, guffaw, or just a warm feeling to readers. Most are new, and some are classics. A long-term devotee of Jewish humor, Al has been collecting it even before there was an Internet. For the last 25 years he has been editor and publisher of The Kustanowitz Kronikle, originally a family newsletter that went public when the Purim editions became too popular to keep private. Now they're all available as a book, The Kustanowitz Kronikle: 25 Years of Purim Parody. In 2012, Al wrote a series of seven interactive books with the series title Jewish Humor on Your Desktop. The seven volumes are subtitled: Volume 1: Old Jokes and New Comedians Volume 2: Israel is a Funny Country Volume 3: Humor in Jewish Life - You Can't Make This Stuff Up Volume 4: Jewish Traces in Unexpected Places Volume 5: Yiddish is a Funny Language Volume 6: Jewish Holiday Hilarity Volume 7: Yiddishe Nachas All seven volumes and the complete collection in a single volume are available at Amazon.com in Kindle and paperback editions. This book, Israel Is A Funny Country, is a revised and expanded version of the second book in the series. Al presents lectures on Jewish humor and a unique comedy experience featuring the funniest Jewish videos on the Internet at synagogues, Jewish Community Centers, resort hotels, clubs and other locations. If you are interested in booking his one-hour comedy programs (there are six of them), you can contact him for more information by e-mail at akustan@gmail.com.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ladie LeBlanc is the product of a single mother household who has had her fair share of trials and tribulations. Those only make her triumphs that much sweeter as she quips, \"I have no regrets.\" One of her greatest accomplishments is becoming a published author because she didn't think she could do it at first. With the right encouragement from people who recognized her literary genius, Captivity was published October 15, 2013 (can be found on Amazon.com). She credits her husband with keeping her head above water, which is why her release date is so treasured. Ladie LeBlanc is determined to become a world-renowned author and has a book of poetry, Idle Thoughts, released late November 2013.  Ladie LeBlanc brings you love, triumph, tears and turmoil as she fulfills her roles as friend, wife, and beloved granddaughter.

When the big art contest rolls around, he figures he's a cinch for the win. Then the top prizes are announced, and he discovers to his horror that the subject of the competition was a boat and not the goat he drew. His teacher reminds him that winning isn't everything and that paying attention to instructions is its own reward. Then, just like the ever-energetic blue heeler he is, Ozzie figures out a way to make his goat picture a boat after all. While not distinguished, the bright and bouncy watercolor-and-ink illustrations portray a busy classroom and a teacher who lovingly oversees the chaos. The lessons of learning to deal with losing and the importance of listening are gently given. Ozzie's dogged persistence will find a ready audience and resonate with children who often rush in without thinking.-Marge Loch-Wouters, La Crosse Public Library, WIα(c) Copyright 2013.

She retired from this work in 1950 but became so bored without the constant stimulus and irritation of teaching that she accepted a post at the Matthew Arnold School in Staines, where she taught English and history, wrote the annual school play, and coached hurdling. She was a member of the Detection Club, the PEN, the Middlesex Education Society, and the British Olympic Association.

Arnaldo was very young when his parents left South America for the warmth and tranquility of Florida where he grew up in Boca Raton. After graduating from high school, he attended college. Obtaining a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering, Arnaldo, thirsting for adventure, thought of joining the US Navy where he was readily accepted as an officer. Yet, destiny had other plans for the young man. Instead, Arnaldo went to work for Seagate Technology, SyDos and IBM. But Corporate America wasn't for him - Arnaldo wanted to be his own man, and manage his own business. It was then that he opened a restaurateur chain, which, eight years later, counted no less than seven restaurants and a gas station. Following the sale of his business, he founded the Millenium Limo in December 2001, in the wake of nine-eleven. Somewhat to his surprise, the business took off and rapidly became the top exotic limo service, not only in the State of Florida, but across the country. The father of three children, Arnaldo remained true to his adventurous spirit until one day a skiing accident locked him down. Beaten in his purpose, but undefeated, he decided to put \"his dream\" on paper and The Dream Maker was born. www.thedreammaker2.com www.thedreammaker2.com", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Golf-pro Lee Ofstead nearly gives up when a \"wicked slice\" hurts her game during the women's tournament in Carmel, Calif. Admiring while envying Kate O'Brian, star of the golf pro circuit, Lee dreams of similar triumphs, but the scenario becomes a nightmare when somebody murders Kate. Detective Graham Sheldon questions Lee first among many suspects, since she found the body and is now replacing Kate as the well-paid endorser of Sawyer's Sports Equipment. Helping Graham with information on the esoteric world of exhibition golf, Lee wins his heart, and together they investigate others: Milt Sawyer of the sports firm, tournament director Nick Pittman and the competing players. After the requisite endangerment of the heroine, the engagingly humorous thriller turns into a Lee/Graham love story.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Still, there were these characters in her head, worlds wanting to be built on paper, and stories wanting to be told and she began writing them down whether during or after class. She continues to this day. Only recently has it begun to become fruitful, spreading out to let others read and enter her worlds, meet her characters, and see what she sees. No matter what she writes, her stories of romance with their twists of paranormal, fantasy and erotica will always have their Happily Ever Afters. She currently works in a quiet office in Central Florida, where she also makes her home, and enjoys the down time to slip into her characters and worlds to escape reality from time to time.
