She considers four zones of the British Empire-the Mediterranean, North America, India and Afghanistan-between the years 1600 and 1850. For reasons of size, population and geography, Britain couldn't run its empire alone. In India and the Mediterranean, for example, collaboration and accommodation with indigenous groups was the rule; most \"British\" troops in India were native-born sepoys. And over two and a half centuries, tens of thousands of Britons were taken captive by foreigners. In North America, settlers were seized by Native Americans; sailors were sold into slavery by Barbary (North African) corsairs. Colley describes how these captives handled painful encounters with the \"other.\" To a surprising degree, she shows, captives learned to adapt to, and accommodate, a vastly different cultural milieu. Colley also provides an original account of the Revolutionary War, showing how captivity narratives became part of the propaganda war. In India, most British captives were soldiers taken in battle. These Indian narratives \"served to personalize overseas and imperial events\" to the larger British public. Colley, who in 2003 will become Shelby M.C. Davis professor of history at Princeton, makes a first-rate argument for her provocative thesis about the complex cross-cultural relations of empire, with lucid prose, exhaustive research and surprising insights from unexpected sources. This is highly recommended for those wishing a more nuanced, inclusive and less monolithic approach to the British empire. 74 illus.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

[B]reaking the rules became the most valued attribute. The greatest rewards went to conceptual innovators who frequently changed styles and invented genres.\" - Patricia Cohen, The New York Times\"David Galenson brings the insights of an economic historian to this fascinating study of innovation in modern art. He shows how changes in the structure of the market for new art altered the innovation process itself and how the nature of innovation developed in the lives of many 20th century artists. Anyone interested in the development of 20th century art and any economist interested in the general process of innovation will want to read this book.\" - Martin Feldstein, Department of Economics, Harvard University\"With this book, David Galenson burnishes his reputation as one of the most interesting economists at work today. Once you've read Conceptual Revolutions in Twentieth-Century Art, you'll never look at modern art - or the creative process - quite the same way.\" - Daniel H. Pink, author of A Whole New Mind\"David Galenson has written the most inventive, surprising, and illuminating book on modern art to appear in my lifetime. I can think of no other book on modern art that remotely resembles Conceptual Revolutions in Twentieth-Century Art. Yet it is a surprising book because Galenson draws much of his evidence from what artists and art historians have been saying about modern art for more than a century. What Galenson has done is to take often over-familiar material and to reshape it by asking simple questions about artists' behavior and then systematically setting out to explain them. Most importantly, I know of no artist, and certainly no art historian, who has seen so clearly the connection between the variety and pace of 20th-century artistic innovations and the increasing autonomy granted to artists by a richly competitive market. After introductory chapters on innovation and artistic importance, Conceptual Revolutions describes with unsurpassed clarity artistic behaviors new to recent art. Each chapter can be read independently of the others, but taken together readers will find clearly explained much of what often seems mysterious not only to the layperson but even to the art professional. Conceptual Revolutions offers new explanations for many familiar phenomena in modern art and challenges many received ideas held by scholars of 20th-century art, all presented in a prose style that is accessible to any intelligent reader. Conceptual Revolutions should change any open-minded reader's basic perceptions about art today.\" - Robert Jensen, Department of Art, University of Kentucky\"A fascinating and highly readable explanation of why the art of the 20th century changed so dramatically from that which came earlier. David Galenson goes further in using innovative methods of analysis to change our concept of modern art than anyone I know.

In 1991, the dead body of a male hippie is discovered in an addition, constructed 20 years earlier, to the building that had then been Madame Julie's. Homicide Lt. Frank Washington enlists the aid of Margo Fortier, formerly a stripper named Cherry who is now a newspaper columnist and wife-of-convenience to socially prominent (and secretly gay) Julian Fortier. As Margo checks out old co-workers, the corpse is identified as a youngster who had hung around Madame Julie's and even proposed to one of the dancers. Soon, however, people around the ex-stripper begin to die, and the plot turns predictable. Thankfully, Margo's breezy patter never does, as she offers observations on the Gulf war and frantically schemes to prevent Julian from being outed. Though low on suspense, this talky little tale gets high marks for entertaining chatter.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Mair, University of Pennsylvania)Inaugurating a six-volume series on the history of imperial China, this volume holds that characteristics of the first Chinese empire broadly endured for the succeeding 2,000 years...[Those] planning to acquire the entire series mustn't omit Lewis' solid foundation. (Gilbert TaylorBooklist2007-04-15)The standard multivolume history of China has long been the magisterial, exhaustiveCambridge History of China. Now Harvard University Press has announced a six-volume series that will cover the rise, development, and decline of dynastic China from the second century B.C.E. through the early 20th century in an up-to-date, compact, and approachable way. This opening volume by Lewis foretells that the series will become the new gold standard, as the author explains in clear and telling detail how the Qin dynasty ruthlessly defeated a succession of rivals to unify briefly what we now call China in 221 B.C.E. We then see how the succeeding Han dynasty (206 B.C.E.-220 C.E.) combined social engineering and political savvy to institutionalize control and form a 'classical' era parallel to the Greeks and Romans in the West. Han imperial structures, including religion, literature, and law, were quite different from what evolved out of them, but Lewis convincingly argues that later societies cannot be understood without understanding this classical foundation. (Charles W. HayfordLibrary Journal (starred review)2007-04-01)Mark Lewis's mind-opening and readable book reminds us of the enduring but changing realities of China. (Jonathan MirskyTimes Literary Supplement2008-03-14)Early Chinese Empiresis a brilliant example of nuanced, responsible popularization.

Out of her \"love\" and talent for Mathematics and Science she chose a field that seemed reasonable. However being raised in an environment that did not distinguish \"boy\" and \"girl\" interest as being different, she was naïve about the \"real\" world of discrimination that she was facing. In the 50's she was an anomaly, being the only woman in her mathematics classes. She was pioneer entering the engineering and technical field which was considered a men's field. And also a pioneer in the computer field which was in its early stages in that timeframe. She was the first woman manager in her company in the mid-1980's and first woman director a few years later. Because of the positions she held she was usually the only women at conferences and management meetings. Being a female in this male dominated environment, she always felt she was being viewed and evaluated by a different yardstick. Any mistake would be magnified versus a male making the same mistake. Also she had to be very cautious related to her emotions to avoid be labeled an \"emotional\" female. On the positive side, being involved in a leading-edge technical field she had the opportunity to work on very interesting projects. She worked on some of the computer applications for the early space program, as well as software for many other defense related applications. Also she was on the Internet before Al Gore \"invented it\" It was actually the ARPANET, a government network that was a precursor to the Internet. She has had a home computer since 1979. She owned one of the first Commodore Pet Personal Computers. In her \"retirement\" she continues to keep up with the latest computer technology. She volunteers doing Web pages for the local library, teaches and helps new computer users in her church and the community in general.

Misunderstood, ROI can stop worthy projects or green-light terrible ones. Meanwhile, if narrowly defined ROI is the only criteria for determining project worth, we can probably kiss the planet goodbye. And yet ignoring ROI would be equally devastating. That's why a deep dive on this subject is crucial, and that's what Patti and Jack Phillips have done, in a way that will be useful and applicable. (Auden Schendler, Executive Director, Sustainability, Aspen Skiing Company)Sustainability initiatives have to create value in excess of their costs. The Green Scorecard provides a framework to do so. It will help executives move away from sustainability voodoo-assuming projects create value-towards sustainability science-demonstrating value through measurement. (Gregory C. Unruh, PhD, professor and Director, The Lincoln Center for Ethics, Thunderbird School of Global Management)Written in an easy-to-understand format, this book shows how to measure the success of sustainability projects with a balanced set of data including ROI. This is necessary for the integration of social and environmental impacts into management decision making and the inclusion of metrics for sustainability into ROI calculations. (Marc J. Epstein, Distinguished Research Professor of Management at Rice University and author of Making Sustainability Work: Best Practices in Managing and Measuring Corporate Social, Environmental, and Economic Impacts)Jack and Patti Phillips unravel the mystery of measurement by presenting a balanced set of measures that show the full impact of programs, including bottom-line measures such as business impact and ROI. (Stephen R. Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People)Return on Investment is an answer to what executives are asking for-Patti and Jack summarize everything a practitioner needs to know and do.

So, when the folks at Tell Me a Story contacted us about their new cd, I have to admit I mostly just took it because it would give us something to entertain the kids on a car ride. I honestly didn't expect more than a time-filler. Well, this collection of stories is very much more than that. In the first place, the production values are excellent. The background music is good and the voice actors are uniformly excellent. But more than that, the selection of stories offers some really pleasant surprises. The tales were almost all new to me, at least, and if a couple were predictable, they were predictable in the most satisfying way--the unfolding stories leading naturally into a lesson with both narrative and moral clarity. But there's one story in particular that won me over: Searching for Fear. Gregory is a raccoon who doesn't know the meaning of fear, being fearless himself, and sets out in search of it. Personally, I was caught unawares when this seemingly simple tale turned into a profound metaphor about political power and the responsibility of governors.

This brilliant translation conveys all that and even preserves the ubiquitous wordplay of the original through cleverly chosen parallel American idioms. (This is the first novel of Wang Chen-ho, one of Taiwan's best-known writers, to be translated into English.) Dong Siwen, a pedantic high-school teacher, flatulent and fat, has been retained by his corrupt politician friend, Councilman Quian, to teach a crew of prostitutes a bit of English in order to make some money off American GIs on R&R; from Vietnam. Skewered here are the obsequious dependence of the Taiwanese on American dollars and a society that can countenance the lewdest and most mercenary activities wherever money is involved (the orientation of the prostitute recruits takes place, of course, in a church hall). Occasionally, the patter goes on too long, but by and large this is a wild, pointed romp from start to finish.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I don't describe myself as a pickup artist, or a dating guru. I respect their insights and the artistry of meeting women, but my approach is slightly more basic. I'm just an average guy who's put in 10 years exploring women, dating, sex, concepts around attraction and rapport, and who's experienced the typical pains and triumphs of meeting beautiful women.At no time do I claim to know it all, or to have all the answers.I think we guys often spend too much time challenging and teasing each other instead of helping each other. Ever notice how women have endless magazines based on dating insights, makeup and fashion tips, and seduction strategies?We guys need to stop fighting over women, and start sharing our dating mindsets.And so this is my first attempt at helping my fellow brothers with the dating insights I've seen work. Because not only do guys benefit when we share with each other, but women benefit by meeting more men who \"finally get it.\" IT'S NOT MAGICGetting the girl online isn't rocket science. It's not black magic. It's not surprising or wierd. BUT it's almost universally misunderstood.What makes a girl reject the last 99 guys but respond to you?It's simple.Being different, being playful, and being attractive. The core teachings of my books.As a matter of fact it's EASIER to be different than the last 99 guys simply because the last 99 guys are all saying the exact same things and all making the exact same mistakes.I wrote this book to help the average guy, like you and me, stand out from the online dating crowd in order to catch the girl we REALLY want, and ultimately deserve.She WANTS you to find her and attract her... now read this book and learn the fastest path to your first date!", "related": ["B0075T2U48"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When the D.C. Metro train she's riding in crashes, Hannah Ives (All Things Undying, 2010, etc.) winds up with a broken arm and a Garfinkel's shopping bag that belonged to the young man who had been sitting next to her. Feeling like a voyeur when she dips into the bag to see if she can identify the owner and return it, Hannah is soon immersed in a decades-old romance. Fifty-seven love letters and photographs document a 10-year affair between Lilith Chaloux and her married lover Zan. With gentle assists from her husband, her sister, her sister-in-law's husband (a Chesapeake County police lieutenant), internet searches and a snooping instinct second only to Miss Marple's, Hannah not only tracks down the reclusive Lilith, an artist and major-league hoarder, but stakes out the Lynx News headquarters to confront the man formerly known as Zan. In response, her home is burglarized, she's confronted by a seedy lawyer working for the young man who sat next to her on the train--now laid up for serious rehabbing in a D.C. hospital--and she meets Zan's wife, who tells her off in no uncertain terms. Meanwhile, a staffer at Lynx, a former college friend of Hannah's daughter Emily, is murdered, and the seedy lawyer heads for Lilith's cottage, which winds up ablaze, incinerating those 57 love letters and almost costing Lilith and Hannah their lives. If you've a taste for love denied, love reunited and coincidences piled on coincidences, you'll have plenty to swoon over here.     -- Kirkus Reviews, July 1, 2011Hannah Ives is returning home after a charity luncheon when her train crashes. Luckily, she escapes with minor bumps and bruises, but the man sitting next to her is critically injured, and Hannah does her best to comfort him. When she's released from the hospital, she's surprised to see, included in the personal items returned to her, the shopping bag the injured man was carrying. Hannah has no clue who he is or whether he survived, but she's determined to return the bag, especially after she opens it and finds a bundle of love letters charting the course of a decades-long affair between \"Lilith\" and \"Zan.\" Hannah, intrigued by the letters, vows to learn more about the lovers. Her innocent investigation soon turns terrifying when Hannah's home is broken into, and someone seems to be stalking her, all of which serves only to make the secret behind the letters more compelling. A keep-'em-guessing plot, plenty of humor (despite the danger), and a whimsical, charming heroine make this one appealing on multiple levels. --Booklist, September 1, 2011", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Howl of the Wolf was the first book in Diane’s Heirs to the Throne science fiction series.  It introduced the planet Drako, telepathic wolves, and the crew of the space ship that took sanctuary on a planet that banned technology.  In the second book, The Havenshire Resistance, Krystal’s teenage daughters must learn to use inherited powers and join an army of Samurai women, telepathic wolves, and commoners to save the kingdom from the evil plans of Jarrack.  Dragon Defense is the third novel in the series.  Donovan’s group must train teenagers and encourage wild dragons to defend Drako from destruction by the Institute.

It's more about the people involved and the nature of curses. Alex and Belle are very likeable characters and their sexual attraction is sizzling. Belle is so much more than just her physical appearance. Her courage and loyalty are what attract Alex. The plot moves along at a nice pace and there are a few interesting surprises. The sex is very hot but its Belle and Alex's connection that drives the story. They can't deny their feelings despite the sense of betrayal each perceives. Enjoyable read for a relaxing Saturday afternoon.\"- Emma of Night Owl Reviews\"The Beast's Redemption is a wonderful story of love conquering all. The writing grabbed my attention right away along with the family dynamics and strange requests. The characters are strong and well developed for a shorter story. The Beast's Redemption has a lot of passion and heart as Belle and Alexander try to figure out what is going on with each other as well as situations surrounding them. The Beast's Redemption is a must read for anyone who likes shifters and witches and the trials and tribulations that accompany them. There is a lot of passion, conflict, and soul searching within The Beast's Redemption that makes it a compelling story to read.\" -Sizzling Hot Book Reviews", "related": ["B009QQ5MIO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.6667, "rating_total": 22.0}

Likewise the second volume, which appeared in 1926. The book details Hitler's childhood, the \"betrayal\" of Germany in World War I, the desire for revenge against France, the need for lebensraum for the German people, and the means by which the National Socialist party can gain power. It also includes Hitler's racist agenda and his glorification of the \"Aryan\" race. The few outside the Nazi party who read it dismissed it as nonsense, not believing that anyone could--or would--carry out its radical, terrorist programs. As Hitler and the Nazis gained power, first party members and then the general public were pressured to buy the book. By the time Hitler became chancellor of the Third Reich in 1933, the book stood atop the German bestseller lists. Had the book been taken seriously when it was first published, perhaps the 20th century would have been very different.Beyond the anger, hatred, bigotry, and self-aggrandizing,Mein Kampfis saddled with tortured prose, meandering narrative, and tangled metaphors (one person was described as \"a thorn in the eyes of venal officials\"). That said, it is an incredibly important book. It is foolish to think that the Holocaust could not happen again, especially if World War II and its horrors are forgotten. As an Amazon.com reader has pointed out, \"If you want to learn about why the Holocaust happened, you can't avoid reading the words of the man who was most responsible for it happening.\" Mein Kampf, therefore, must be read as a reminder that evil can all too easily grow. --Sunny Delaney", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It also offers points of reflection and debate for scholars who themselves are interested in opening their respective areas of study to non-specialists across the disciplines.\"--Kirsten Ruther,Canadian Journal of History\"This important book, more than twenty-five years in the making, represents a significant contribution to the history of Christian-Muslim dialogue by an acknowledged expert on the interaction between indigenous Christians, particularly those of the Eastern Church's, and their Muslim rulers, resulting from the meteoric expansion of the new religion. Of value to the specialist, not least for the extensive bibliography provided, the book is nevertheless written in such a way as to be accessible to the general reader.\"--John Flannery,Cambridge Journals\"This will become a valuable resource for many years to come. . . .

It reminds us that Christian-Muslim dialogue has a long history. It helps us understand the beginning of Christian-Muslim dialogue that predated thinkers like Peter Abelard and Thomas Aquinas. . . .

Sharyn left school at 15 and always wanted to have her own business, but had no idea what to do.  After a few years moving up the employment ladder learning all she could and gaining business experience, she was financed by a previous employer to try property development.   She went on to build up a property development and construction company to one with an annual turnover of $35 million and a staff increase from just Sharyn alone to a large workforce of employees, consultants and sub-contractors, professionals to tradesmen.    Tough economic times hit; not only did her business go down but, due to personal guarantees, she lost her home, assets and investments.  20years of hard work behind, her knowledge, experience and drive got her back in business again very quickly.  Seeking diversification of income and assets, and particularly after her part time studies in law and accounting, Sharyn entered the financial market as a trader. Today Sharyn enjoys working with her property clients as a development and construction project manager, and trading currencies, as well as her new passion of helping people with their own personal development through her online business. Sharyn believes all times are good, maybe some more challenging than others, but at all times we should all be living our Ideal Life with Self-Made Success.   “I strongly believe, however, that life is best in having as much financial strength with which one is comfortable and can live with to suit one's values’ structure.”  She loves to work with people towards this goal.  Sharyn is an Australian, who has lived most of her life in Sydney Australia and now living her dream in Orange, a small city on the outskirts of Outback Australia.  “I so much want to pass on the knowledge and experience I have built up over the years running businesses in diversified areas and building up a rich and happy life in all ways possible.   I’m loving the joys and challenges of adapting to the exciting times of the future, whilst using my experience in business and personal development to work with clients so they can take advantage of today’s opportunities and maximize their own life adventure.”", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The heat is evident and the attraction, undeniable.\"--Tiffany Schlarman for Reader Views\"This Regency novel is set in Northern England and begins with the death of the Earl of Lansdown. His death was sudden and shocking, and the cause was quite unique. Since his widow, Jane, was childless, the estate will go to the next male in line, leaving Jane and her family penniless and homeless. However, there is a ten-month waiting period before settling the estate just in case the Earl had spawned an heir before he died, although Jane knows this is not possible. Her mother suggests Jane take a lover and do her best to conceive immediately. Jane rejects this idea until she meets Douglas Cartland, a notorious rake with a tragic past. Jane is now faced with a Herculean decision. Shirley Kennedy has written a refreshing, entertaining novel and has created a likeable heroine and hero the reader will miss when the book is ended.\"--Audrey Braver, Historical Novel Society", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The result is a formulaic though entertaining romance, with war intruding on an idyll that begins in Italy in 1938. Three young men--Steve, an American playboy; Kurt, a German musician; Hamilton Johns, an English painter--who share a house near Florence, meet and fall in love with three beautiful Italian sisters, the daughters of Prince Caeseri. As the couples pair off with remarkable ease, we follow their fortunes through the narration of Ham, the painter, whose contacts in the Italian art world, notably with Bernard Berenson at the fabled I Tatti villa, make him the most memorable of the otherwise stereotypical trio. Inevitably, political tensions impinge on everyone's happiness. Kurt returns to Germany and the military; Steve to the States; Ham to England. Recruited into the secret service, he comes back to Italy via cloak-and-dagger operations that involve Kurt, now his putative enemy as an officer of the Reich. The European war, particularly the bombing of art-filled Cassino, is evoked with good period detail.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While being a cowboy can be considered glamorous, riding high over the range, free wind in your face…being a shepherd is quite a different story.  You walk and hike and stumble trying not to get tripped up in badger holes or barbed wire or bitten by rattlesnakes.  You eat dust and constantly itch from insect bites, stickers and greasy wool; the incessant bleating and general helplessness and stupidity of a flock can sometimes almost drive you crazy.Having said all that, shepherds develop an enormous respect for their dogs who are every bit the equal in their loyalty and dedication to top working cow ponies.  And on lonesome, windy, sagebrush-covered hills and under starry skies, you feel a tremendous sense of empowerment and responsibility to your dogs and your flock so you walk a little taller.I really don’t like sheep,but I have a great and enduring admiration for the people and dogs who work in the sheep industry.Gary McCarthyAugust, 2012", "related": ["B00FED5D8C"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The owners are assuring loyal fans of the park, considered Florida’s oldest theme park opening in 1936, that the park will re-open in the spring, that the gardens and waterski shows will remain, and the zoo and rides will be replaced with a new water park.While the park is closed for renovations we thought you might enjoy a brief look at some of the history of the park, which now includes the rides as, courtesy of Arcadia Publishing’s Images of America Cypress Gardens.BOOK REVIEW: Images of America - Cypress GardensBy Mary M. Flekke, Sarah E. MacDonald,and Randall M. MacDonaldFlorida’s first theme park, Cypress Gardens, was the brainchild of Richard Downing “Dick” Pope, Sr. With his wife, Julie Downing Pope, he transformed a marshy, lakeside property in Winter Haven, FL, into a magnificent garden. The park’s first visitors in 1936 toured pathways surrounded by lush plants from around the world. Two years later, electric boats meandered through the park’s winding, hand-dug canals. Water ski shows commenced in 1942, and the park became the “Water Ski Capital of the World.”The Florida-shaped Esther Williams Swimming Pool still graces the shore of Lake Eloise. The park was a set for dozens of short and feature films, a stage for beauty pageants, and a site for special television broadcasts. A butterfly garden, zoo, rides, and the small-town Southern Crossroads shopping and dining area have been part of the park through the years. Kent Buescher purchased Cypress Gardens in 2004, and today’s expanded Cypress Gardens Adventure Park preserves the family-friendly appeal of Dick and Julie Pope’s magnificent park.”Authors Mary M. Flekke, Sarah E. MacDonald, and Randall M. MacDonald are long-time Cypress Gardens visitors. Drawn from the park’s archives, the authors’ collections, and area libraries, these images trace the development and life of Florida’s iconic roadside attraction and celebrate those who make Cypress Gardens memorable.Images of America - Cypress Gardens can be purchased at local and national bookstores or can be purchased at arcadiapublishing.com.<br /><br />Title: Florida's First Theme Park, Cypress GardensAuthor: Roland HopkinsPublisher: Carousel News and TraderDate: 4/26/09The historic Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven, FL, is saying so long to all of itÂ’s amusement park rides.

I wrote both these books in order to fight the war against childhood sexual abuse.

The selections range from well-known tales like \"Baba Yaga\" to the lesser-known story of the early life of Taliessen and the Icelandic folktale of the Black School, clearly a Hogwarts precursor. He even takes on Shakespeare'sThe Tempestand the story of Circe and Odysseus. Hague favors ornate language, so readers will need to cope with vocabulary like \"fortuitous,\" \"arboreal,\" and \"lithesome\" with little syntactical support. Full-page illustrations are brilliantly colored and feature characters with shockingly malevolent eyes, ramping up the drama of the stories. Readers who expect the illustrations to match the text precisely will note that Baba Yaga's dress of \"grayish-brown homespun\" morphs to red and gold in the illustration and that a dragon's \"serrated\" teeth are actually individual sharp points. Storytellers will find a lot of good material here, and lovers of magical battles of yore will find plenty to enjoy, too, and may even pick up a few thrilling new epithets: \"you pock-faced, craven doer-of-evil-in-the night.\"—Ellen Heath, Easton Area Public Library, Easton, PACopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Jager writes an ambitious, engrossing, and often disturbing history of the conflict, including its origins and its continuation since, technically, the war has never ended. As Jager indicates, Korea, which had a national identity as far back as the seventh century, was dominated by foreign powers for a century before WWII. The postwar division of the peninsula was inherently unstable, and there was considerable violence in the south even before the North Korean invasion in 1950. In analyzing the war, Jager provides multiple perspectives, including Korean, American, and Chinese. The war turned a civil conflict into a battleground of the Cold War. She now views the war as, however, a struggle for legitimacy between the two Koreas. This is a struggle that the North cannot win, and Jager sees that regime as dying but extremely dangerous. This is a superbly researched work that should be an essential tool in understanding the current crisis on the peninsula. --Jay Freeman", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Michael Robertson is a member of the South Carolina Writer's Workshop and New Hampshire Writer's Project. An avid, long-time reader of fantasy and science fiction, he is a student of ancient civilizations and their military organization and mythology—particularly the Romans, Celts, and Anglo Saxons. His membership in the re-enactment group, the Atholl Brigade, and its participation in historical re-enactments of ancient Scottish battles has given him insight into the fighting techniques of the Highland Scots. This knowledge is woven into his fiction and is reflected in the meticulous detail and vivid battle scenes peppered throughout Warrior of the Three Moons, his first published novel and the sequel, Sunspear. In addition to writing fiction, he also writes poetry. The Flowers of Culloden was published in the Clan Annual of Clan Donnachaidh in Scotland. Sunspear is Book II of the Series; The God Wars of Ithir. The Author is a retired U.S. Air Force officer and currently works as a part-time senior communications systems engineer with The MITRE Corporation. He holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from The Citadel and an MBA in Industrial Management from Farleigh Dickinson University. He is married and the father of two adult children.

After getting married and while raising two young children, Jones wrote two plays, one set in eighteenth-century Vermont and the other based on Japanese history. These two works were performed by the Honolulu Theatre for Youth in Hawaii. Jones and her family then moved to England,, where she fell in love with London and its colorful history. During her five years in England, Jones was able to explore the country; she also traveled throughout Europe, including a visit to the French region of Aquitaine. Her travels deepened her interest in history and the seeds of her novels began to take root. Jones made her fiction debut withThe Fatal Crown(1991), a historical novel about the twelfth-century British princess Maud. This launched Jones’s trilogy about three strong, passionate, and self-willed founders of the Plantagenet empire: Maud, Henry, and Eleanor of Aquitaine.", "related": ["B00E9POJ40"], "rank": 231959, "title": "Gilded Cages: The Trials of Eleanor of Aquitaine: A Novel (The Queens of Love and War Book 3)", "author": "Ellen Jones", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.1429, "rating_total": 29.0}

Who hasn't had occasion to think \"if I'd only known then what I\nknow now . . .\"? Julie-Anne took that one step further, and put\nit on paper, in the hope of preventing teenagers from making the mistakes she now realizes she made as a teen and young\nadult.... Julie-Anne\nbared her soul in her effort to help others. She has not only has\npublished this book, but is also in demand as a motivational\nspeaker, and has at least one other book to her credit.Some of the advice she gives is universally accepted as common knowledge\n among adults, but if you think back to your teen years, you may have a\ndifficult time recalling any of it passing through your mind. She\npresents her own mistakes without condemnation toward the teens to whom\nshe is writing. She spends a large part of this book trying to\nconvince those very teens that NOBODY else's opinion about them matters.\n Their own opinion about themselves is all that really matters, not only\n in the long run, but in the short term as well. Yet, in retrospect, how\n many of today's adults did NOT feel a great deal of pressure in High\nSchool just hoping others would esteem them to some degree? \"Things I\nWish I'd Known\" would be a very nice gift for your teenager, or for any\nteenager with whom you are acquainted. They may not absorb every piece\nof Julie-Anne's advice, but if they take ANY of it to heart, you will\nhave helped them cope with at least one of the many pressures they face\neach day, and helped them along the road to adulthood. I wish this\nlittle book had been available when I was in High School. If I only knew\n then . . .", "related": [], "rank": 3458289, "title": "Things I Wish I'd Known - An E-book for Teens", "author": "Julie-Anne", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Particularly compelling is his comparison of killers in Rwanda with those of the Holocaust.\"—Foreign Affairs\"Scott Straus ranks among the finest of the scholars writing in genocide studies.The Order of Genocideis fair-minded, important, and rigorous. Drawing on more than two hundred interviews that he conducted with convicted Rwandan killers, and on many other sources, Straus builds a dynamic process model seeking to explain why and how ordinary people could be mobilized to murder their neighbors in the Rwandan genocide.\"—African Studies Review\"The Order of Genocidewill be an enduring contribution to our understanding of the Rwandan genocide as well as to theories of ethnic violence and genocides more generally. Although his methods and findings will certainly interest scholars of genocides, violent conflicts, and African area studies, Straus does not obscure his work in specialist language.\"—Nations and Nationalism\"Straus's writing is lucid, the structure of the book is well thought out, and jargon is avoided, makingThe Order of Genocideaccessible to anyone interested in the subject. A must-read for those interested in politics and violence.\"—Journal of Peace Research\"Straus's study is comprehensive, thorough, and cogently and carefully argued. It is altogether an impressive work that is compulsory for specialists and invaluable for students. Straus is a former journalist and his writing is a model of clarity and economy.\"—Perspectives on Politics\"Straus shows tenacity and courage in explaining the unthinkable—how otherwise ordinary people could imagine, conceive, and carry out genocide.\"—Genocide Studies and Prevention\"Scott Straus has written a path-breaking book that will command the attention of scholars of the Rwandan genocide and of collective violence. The combination of an engagement with and application of theories of collective violence, a deep knowledge of Rwanda, sophisticated methodology, and extraordinary field research has produced an account that brings us closer than ever to understanding what produced this tragic event. Not only doesThe Order of Genociderank as one of the best books ever written on the Rwandan genocide, it is a major contribution to comparative politics and theories of violence.\"—Michael Barnett, University Professor of International Affairs and Political Science, Elliott School of International Affairs, The George Washington University\"Scott Straus's examination of the Rwanda genocide takes us to a new level of understanding of mass killing as a social and political phenomenon. The author's attention to social-science theory, his extensive use of hundreds of interviews with perpetrators, and his careful analysis of the historical and geographical determinants of the Rwandan events make this book an unusually important contribution to the burgeoning field of genocide studies.\"—Norman M. Naimark, author ofFires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in 20th Century Europe\"The onset of the Rwandan genocide, its dynamics, and the individual motivations of its perpetrators can be best explained, Scott Straus finds, by the combined effects of an ongoing civil war, high levels of state power (and the attendant social pressure), and the existence of a system of ethnic classification—rather than mass feelings of ethnic antipathy, nationalist beliefs, or radio propaganda. With its cogent theorization, multi-method approach, rich micro-level data, and careful attention to causal mechanisms,The Order of Genocideis a decisive step forward in the social scientific study of a phenomenon that has been notoriously resistant to systematic approaches.\"—Stathis N. Kalyvas, Arnold Wolfers Professor of Political Science, Director, Program on Order, Conflict, and Violence, Yale University\"The Order of Genocideis a real addition to what we know about the Rwandan genocide. Scott Straus describes the local organization of genocide—for example, information on the size of groups of attackers and the roles played by 'elite' and 'thugs.' He also profiles the perpetrators themselves in examining what moved them to act. The quotes from the perpetrators enrich the statistical data enormously and make the book come alive.\"—Alison Des Forges", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Born in New York, William grew up in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. He received his B.A. in anthropology from Brown University and then studied archaeology at Tulane University, investigating Maya and Central American prehistory. After years of excavations in Honduras and Costa Rica, he received his Ph.D. in 1996. As a tenured professor of anthropology and archaeology, William has spent the last fourteen years helping students explore the structures and functions of past and contemporary cultures. As an active field archaeologist, he spent summers on Peru's north coast excavating pyramids, mummies, and strange little mud walls. William is also a veteran cruise ship lecturer, traveling the world on some of the universe's largest floating cities, and speaking on topics as diverse as the Trojan War, Piracy in the Adriatic, and the Peopling of the Americas.  Spending long stretches of time at sea resulted in a keen interest in cruise ship culture - specifically the dynamics of the two separate but intertwined worlds on board; the passengers on one hand, and the staff and crew on the other. Moving between these two worlds, William began paying attention to cruise ship security, and to the elaborate but often invisible ways in which this unique society manages social control, and responds to crime. This prolonged attention produced the central protagonist of William's cruise ship mystery series - Henry Grave. Henry Grave is an investigator for the Association of Cruising Vessel Operators. A World War II P.O.W., Henry is as cunning as he is charming, and at 84 years of age, he fits right in with his fellow passengers. Henry Grave first set sail in 2009 with Grave Passage. He returned to sea in 2011 with Mediterranean Grave. In 2012, Grave Indulgence brought Henry to the scene of a very different sort of crime. 12 million people take a cruise each year. Most have fun. Some die. Henry Grave investigates. In 2012, Doonan's archaeological mystery American Caliphate was published. Based on Doonan's excavations in Peru, American Caliphate imagines a centuries-old secret hidden under the sand, and a Middle Eastern government intent on making sure that secret stays hidden. Doonan reimagined Peruvian archaeology in his new supernatural thriller The Mummies of Blogspace9. If you'd like to learn more than you bargained for about demons of antiquity, this is the book for you!", "related": [], "rank": 1934894, "title": "The Mummies of Blogspace9", "author": "William Doonan", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This was an effective technique as it serves to give the story a bit of a nightmarish feel. The reader has to concentrate to keep the threads of the story in line just as if the book has been a nightmare that is slowly fading from the waking mind of the reader. There is also some fairly harsh scenes in this book that might not sit well with the stomachs of the squeamish but there was nothing in the book that was gratuitous.This book is kind of a wild mess of a story but it works. Savage creates a vicious and surreal world in \"The dreaming field\" that is neither easy to define nor figure out. Honestly, I know that there is a lot more to this story than what I picked up on the first reading and I know that I will return to it again to catch what I have missed. The hitches in time that Savage employs not only gives the book a dreamlike feel in that it does not \"play by the rules\" but it also forces the reader to pay attention to what is going on. And, believe me, there is a lot going on. If you are into vanilla horror, then this book is not for you. If you like your horror a little bit strange, a touch surreal, and more than a little visceral, then \"The dreaming field\" is for you.", "related": ["B00BYFFQJU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 24.0}

She begins on Mohonk Mountain, where a nature preserve founded in 1869 is home to sustained and scrupulous meteorological records and observations of animal and plant life. This serves as a “template of attention” for Busch’s eloquent call for the practice of “citizen science,” in which volunteers collect data for research projects supported and shared via digital technologies as demonstrated by the enticing list Busch provides of citizen science programs and their apps and websites. In her sensuously lush and thought-provoking chronicles, Busch recounts her adventures counting herrings, glass eels, eagles, and a species of “dislocated” bats driven north in search of cooler temperatures and helping assess damage wrought by the invasive mile-a-minute vine. She has an extraordinary gift for combining glimmering personal reflections and sharp insights as she celebrates passionate watchfulness and committed stewardship, endeavors made urgent by the consequences of global warming. Elegantly illustrated by Debby Cotter Kaspari, this is a beautiful and incisive affirmation of how “full engagement with the natural world enriches the human experience.” --Donna Seaman", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Herbie's old ties to Keene put his life in jeopardy as he uncovers sinister terrorists bombing European and American sites as a prelude to a scheme known only as \"Magic Lightning.\" Herbie also learns that Keene had a second life as a world-class magician, and that he kept some of his spycraft very secret indeed; it's even possible that the master illusionist is still alive. Though Gardner provides the requisite treacheries and betrayals, a slow start and the often murky explanations of characters' complex relationships may deter some readers. In addition, while Kruger, with his mangled vocabulary and bulldoggedness, is affectionately drawn, supporting players rarely come to life. Still, readers who persevere will be rewarded when the plot's many dark secrets are finally revealed?appropriately enough, at a magician's conference in a besieged Washington, D.C.

Later assignments were in the U.K, Kenya, India, Thailand and Malaysia.

Well, the idea for the Harts of Arizona series came from chatting with a friend over dinner about a trip she and her husband took to a dude ranch. I sat on the idea for a couple of years and then decided on the twin's angle of trading places. I wanted to tell their love stories simultaneously rather than as 2 separate books and an e-book was the perfect vehicle. After writing for Arabesque and Harlequin for nearly 10 years, this is my first series on my own but I'm very excited about the stories ahead and thanks to some help from the folks at Westgate River Ranch, I hope will feel authentic. Given the complexities of the story, I turned Entangled Hearts into 2 volumes and ended Volume 1 with a teaser to leave readers dying to know what happens next. Entangled Hearts - Volume II will be forthcoming in December 2013. Thanks for your support.", "related": [], "rank": 494557, "title": "ENTANGLED HEARTS-VOLUME I (HARTS OF ARIZONA Book 1)", "author": "Yahrah St. John", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 44.0}

I was nearing the midpoint of book six in\nthe series, and I was feeling lost in a wilderness in which nothing exciting\nwas happening. At the time, things were terribly wrong with that series, going\nback to book one, but I had no idea where the problem lay, and I still had no\npublisher. I wanted something new and fresh. I was stuck.Unlike many of my novels, where I have this great, unifying plot in\nmind, and I just have to figure out how to get from a starting point to that\nend, I had a handful of things that I wanted my new novel to be, or not to be,\nas determined by my failure to continue The Dragon Eyes Chronicles. I\nwanted a warrior character, like Loric (Trenton). I wanted a love interest\n(Madeleine). I wanted a good friend (Grinley). I wanted an epic plot. I did not\nwant a sequel.That was it. That was my magic formula for The Last King of the Rock.\nI was not sure how to achieve those aims, and I had no vision for where to\nbegin. What did I do? I sat down and thought of an athletic competition. I put\nmyself into that contest, and I made up the rules for it, as I wrote it into\nbeing. One thought became the goal of the competition: I wanted a king of the\nmountain scenario, but I wanted it to be the ultimate king of the mountain. I\nwanted the childishness of that simplistic game, which suits the rustic quality\nof life in Greenock Vale, but I wanted the game to be grander and more\nmeaningful than inhabitants of The Vale knew it was.I believe I attained my goals and surpassed them. Trenton is very\nsimilar to Loric, with the exception that Trenton is more brash than Loric is. If\nyou have read The Dragon Eyes Chronicles, or any of the books in that\nseries, you will see a determined (most say stubborn) young man, with a strong sense\nof justice, and who is fiercely loyal to his friends. Trenton is like Loric,\nwith differences between them defined in ways their peoples view them in the\nbeginnings of their stories, and of course, supporting casts.Without spoiling anything, I must inform my readers that what I did to\nGrinley created the dramatic climax chapter one needed. The surprise, for me,\nwas the way I kept him in the story and gave his role significance. What\nhappened at The Rock became more than an event for the three stars of this\nnovel. Everything that occurs afterward is about them dealing with the\naftermath of one innocent contest gone horribly awry, which left me with the\nopportunity to show the greatest example of loyalty and trust between two\nfriends I could ever imagine, in the relationship between Trenton and Grinley.\nThe event itself strains the connection between Trenton and Madeleine and\ndrives the novel forward in ways I did not anticipate.There were two other surprise characters for me. The first of them is\nthe murderer. I added him as a point of interest, in what might have been a\nboring chapter, otherwise. I quickly recognized his potential and thought,This character is too intriguing for me to\nend his part in the story in Greenock Vale.He wrote his own role, and I\nwas more than happy to let him do so. The final point-of-interest character is\nLady Monica. Anything I say about her will spoil, so know that I never intended\nfor her role to be noteworthy. She also wrote her part in the novel, and I am\npleased with the job she did.My epic plot came\ntogether, almost of its own making. I wrote this and passed it,\nchapter-by-chapter, to a friend and coworker, who finished reading and wanted\nmore, almost before I was able to finish the next section. I arrived at the\ngrand climax, having loose threads dangling all around me, because it seemed\nlike I had too many to bring them together and finish in one novel, as I had\nset out to do. I sat down to write, being in the glorious position of being the\nfirst reader of the story. I did not know how this novel was going to end. I\nthought,What do I want?That\nquestion came from the perspective of me, as a reader, not as the author. Then,\nI closed my eyes, took a deep breath and started typing. The result still\namazes me. I hope you enjoy it, as well as I enjoyed it and still enjoy it.\nThanks for reading.", "related": ["B00G0GXKG4"], "rank": 1948282, "title": "The Last King of the Rock eBook", "author": "David S.

Except for college, she's always lived and worked in this area, and doesn't think she’d ever want to live anywhere else (although during ice storms in February, she could be tempted!) She often works from home, so her “writing day” never quite ends. She writes at night and on the weekends… and sometimes (thanks to her patient and self-reliant better half) on vacations. Meeting Mayhem is the fourth book in her \"Meeting Mysteries\" series (featuring Philadelphia native Laurie Kilcannon and her paramour, Tim Riordan.) It’s set in Ireland, on a trip that was a dream come true for the author doing research as well as the main characters! Before that comes Meeting Scandal, set \"down the shore\" in Cape May, NJ on a quite – eventful – summer vacation. Earlier, there’s Meeting Darkness, set in the fictional town of Barcliff on Cape Cod, which introduces the reader to a host of terrific characters – from beer-swilling fishermen to tony upper-crust estate-dwellers to the hard-working locals who form the backbone of the town. Her first book is Meeting Murder, set at a pharmaceutical product launch meeting in Miami Beach, FL. The books in the series can be read in any order. Meeting Mayhem is the last of the “Meeting Mysteries” series. Katy plans to tackle a young adult novella or 'tween series next. She also pens essays every now again to stay in practice. With all this writing, it’s a wonder she has time for a day job!

Led by a golden retriever, the canines eagerly dig up a forest, only to be forcibly ejected by irate woodland inhabitants. They then commence to wreak havoc on a nearby beach where they unearth a treasure chest. Despite relying upon a straightforward narrative, Meisel still infuses the plot with fun and whimsy: the dogs find themselves chased out by the disgruntled ghosts of pirates who buried the treasure, and the story ends with the animals finding a friend in a fellow digger, a bulldozer. Short, easy-to-parse sentences (\"See me dig,\" \"We dig and dig and dig,\"); large readable print; and repeated words make this an ideal choice to build confidence in budding young readers. Rendered in a combination of pen-and-ink, acrylic, pencil, and watercolor, the cartoonlike illustrations are filled with movement and animation, and the use of action lines (such as wagging tails or digging paws) adds to the energetic tone. Pairing these amusingly detailed images with an understated, pared-down text (a spread of foxes, bears, and squirrels glaring irritably at the crestfallen canines is described simply as \"Oh no! They are mad.\") produces hilarious results. These well-intentioned but mischievous dogs are truly winsome characters; their wide-eyed expressions, furrowed brows, and lolling tongues will readily endear them to children.

Rain\nfell in sheets, plastering her uniform to her body. A typical south Devon\nspring day. She belly crawled through the mud, sliding under several lengths of\nbarbed wire, then looked up as another member of her platoon nudged her and\npointed across the field. She stopped moving and glanced at the tall figure\nstanding to one side of the circuit. He didn't move or beckon her over, but she\ncould see him staring at her. His aura pulsed with blue, and she cursed, recognising\nthe command.She crawled on her front until she cleared the barbed wire,\nthen got to her feet. Walking across the field toward him, she studied his\nsmart, black uniform, dry under his umbrella. Running a filthy hand through the\nwet hair that had escaped its clip, she sighed at her sweat-and-earth-stained\nT-shirt and mud-splattered combat trousers. Her appearance wasn't something\nthat usually bothered her, but she must look a complete fright. Screw it. She\nlifted her chin as she approached him. She was a soldier; if she'd wanted to\nlook like a fashion model, she would have gone to work for Vivienne Westwood.As she approached, she saw his insignia. He was a major. She\nsaluted smartly, conscious of his critical gaze.He returned the salute. \"At ease, Captain.\"She stood in the classic soldier's pose with hands behind\nher back. \"You wanted me, sir?\" Her chest heaved from exertion, her breath\nmisting in the fresh air.He studied her for a moment, considering her words. Drips\nfrom his umbrella splashed onto her top, but he didn't apologise. His gaze slid\ndown her body to her muddy boots, then meandered up to her earth-streaked face.\nShe flushed, aware she was cold and her nipples were standing out like buttons.\"You look like you need a bath, Captain,\" he said.His deep voice ran an ice-cube up her spine. He towered over\nher, intimidating and, frankly, quite scary, and this coming from a witch who'd\nonce fought an alpha werewolf hand-to-hand.\"I'm sorry, sir.\" She frowned. Why was he criticising her? \"I\nwas training, and it's a wet day.\"\"So I see.\" He surveyed her with serious eyes. \"Do you need\nsomeone to scrub your back?\"Imogen stared at him, eyes widening. He didn't smile. Had\nshe misheard him? She glanced at the badge on his shoulder, seeing now the hammer\nand anvil of an iron warlock above the crown denoting his rank. Warlocks\ntrained in the lore of metal were extremely unusual, and she knew immediately\nwho he was--Cameron Hawke, the infamous captain who'd been promoted after an\nassault on a vampire lair in Soho. He'd led the raid, risked his life to rescue\nthe dozen prisoners the vampires were keeping in the basement, single-handedly\nfought off daemon reinforcements threatening to overwhelm his squad, and\nbrought his whole team and all the prisoners back to the base unscathed. Every\nfemale officer in the S.U. was talking about the tall, dark-haired maniac who\nwas allegedly the most powerful warlock the army had ever had. And here he was,\nasking her if she needed someone to scrub her back.She cleared her throat. \"Why, sir, are you offering?\"\"Goodness me, Captain, personal relationships are completely\nforbidden in the British Army, you know that.\"\"Absolutely, sir, prejudicial to good order and discipline.\"\"That's right.\"\"Yes, sir.\"\"I'm glad we understand each other.\"\"Definitely, sir.\"\"Good.\" He nodded to her formally. \"Now, I'd like to see a\ncopy of the report you wrote on training for an invasion in the Brecon Beacons.\"\"Yes, sir. Shall I go and get it now?\"\"No, Captain, you may continue your training for the moment.\"\nHe studied her thoughtfully. \"Bring it to my room at twenty-one hundred hours.\"\"Twenty-one hundred hours... Yes, sir.\"He nodded, and she thought she saw brief humor light his\neyes before he walked away casually, twirling his umbrella, pausing as he\nwatched a group of new recruits being put through their paces.Imogen watched him go, a small smile curving her lips.\nCheeky bastard. Ordering her to come to his room! A small part of her wanted to\nrefuse, to see what he'd say, but the other ninety-nine-point-nine percent of\nher--mostly located below her navel--shouted it down. So what if he only wanted\nsex? She hadn't had any for,oh my God,\nover eight months, and, frankly, she was worried it was going to go rusty down\nthere. She certainly wasn't going to pass up the opportunity to go to bed with\nMajor Cameron Hawke!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A busy work schedule currently excludes partners, pets and children, but I hope, eventually, to enjoy all three.I have been writing short stories for as long as I can remember. Over the last ten years, erotic fiction has gradually seduced and dominated my creativity. We are at our most vulnerable when naked, when giving ourselves unreservedly to another human being, and I love to explore and describe the dark and dangerous themes thus engendered. An erotic story, I believe, should say more than who did what to whom - it should say something about what it is to be human. We should learn something from it. When our physical needs are in conflict with society's constraints, a fertile fictional furrow is sown and it is surely the writer's duty to consider the resulting harvest. Written almost exclusively in first person, my stories may include references to an adulterous partner, and the protagonist often uses this as a springboard/justification for his/her own amorous adventures. Indeed, my own impetus to write has sublimated from real and often debilitating heartache. Having four older brothers and having enjoyed the diverse delights of several talented, intelligent and passionate lovers, I feel equally comfortable writing from either the male or female perspective. Such has been the importance of men in my life, it does not surprise me that the majority of my stories are told with their words and are seen through their eyes.I love stories where any sex that occurs is 'forbidden' (but not underage or incest, as they are anathema to me) and there is inner turmoil. I need to know what the characters are thinking, why they are there, what drives them. And I love the sex to be graphic, touching and honest, rather than porn mag fantasy: I try to make my characters real people with real insecurities, failings and doubts. In so doing, I believe their experiences will appear more believable while being, at the same time, even more remarkable.If you enjoy my torrid tales, my naughty shorties, or have any comments or questions whatsoever, please feel free to contact me.", "related": [], "rank": 2965596, "title": "Literal Fantasies", "author": "Alexandra Amalova", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I loved the characters and how relatable they were. The book contains the heavy subject of Breast Cancer but it was conveyed in an appropriate way for a Romance Novel. The story moves along well and my attention was grabbed as soon as I started reading the book. It is a fast read and easy to read multiple times. I am looking forward to reading other books written by Annalisa Nicole.  Julie F.         5 star review...A beautiful love story that was short but sweet.This was such a lovely story that often bought a tear to my eye. Willow and Asher were a beautiful couple and I loved how you could feel how strong they loved each other.There was the story line of Willows cancer but there wasn't loads of drama, this story didn't need it however so the fact that there wasn't, was perfect for this book.It was just a beautiful love story.

Sam befriends the dead man’s client, the beautiful Cordelia, as the first step in avenging the murder. They move through Miami’s gangster-tinged nightlife, and Sam learns why Cordelia needed protection. She’s a member of a particularly cruel crime family. Sam gets invited to their San Juan estate, and the novel becomes a long family dinner, with semi-senile Dad, quarreling brothers, a bitter half sister, and more. Readers who believe crime originates in family pathology might like this development. Others will shudder when they see there are 200 pages to go. But the plot shapes up into chases, fights, and betrayals, allowing time for readers to notice that the father is named Reyes (i.e., King), his adviser is Kent, the snarky daughter is Cordelia, and the banished brother is Edwin. Subtext or in-joke? Whichever, it’s another slowing device in a narrative that reveals its secrets at its own pace. Not up to the standard of Abbott’s previous high-energy thrillers, but entertaining all the same. --Don Crinklaw", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story inspires one to look at the brighter side of life and to believe that a better tomorrow is always possible.

One is the extremely high quality of exposition. Coleman writes clearly and cleanly, with a conversational tone and a high regard for motivation. He clearly has a great deal of experience teaching this subject and has learned what points are likely to cause confusion and therefore need expanded discussion. The author also employs the nice pedagogical feature of page-long ‘preludes’ to each chapter, which not only summarize what the chapter will cover and how it fits into the general theme of things, but also typically provide some brief historical commentary as well. In general, the overall effect of this book is like listening to a discussion by a good professor in office hours. … very highly recommended. I don’t know when or if I will ever teach an undergraduate PDE course, but if I ever do, this book will certainly be on my short list of possible texts.\"—Mark Hunacek,MAA Reviews, September 2013\"… a pick for any college-level collection strong in applied mathematics and nonlinear science, and provides a thorough assessment updated for the latest mathematical applications. From modeling problems ranging from heat flow to sound waves and algae spread to equations based on methods of solution and physical and mathematical applications, this reviews PDEs and their applications and is a pick for advanced math collections whose patrons have an basic knowledge of multivariable calculus and ODEs. Any working with MATLAB codes and problem-solving applications need this!\"—California Bookwatch, November 2013Praise for the First Edition:\"The strongest aspect of this text is the very large number of worked boundary value problem examples.\"—SIAM\"This is a useful introductory text on PDEs for advanced undergraduate / beginning graduate students of applied mathematics, physics, or engineering sciences. … a nice introductory text which certainly is of great use in preparing and delivering courses.\"—Zentralblatt MATH\"Readers new to the subject will find Coleman’s appendix cataloguing important partial differential equations in their natural surroundings quite useful. … Coleman’s more explicit, extended style would probably allow its use as an advanced graduate or reference text for UK engineers or physicists.\"—Times Higher Education\"The book presents very useful material and can be used as a basic text for self-study of PDEs.\"—EMS Newsletter\"Each chapter is introduced by a ‘prelude’ that describes its content and gives historical background.

Reinhardt started off as a non-fiction writer. Her publishing credits include: LIVE!, Vista, The RevWriter Resource, The Secret Place, and numerous other periodicals and anthologies. She changed gears and began writing fiction after an experience in Gettysburg. Surrounded by history, she *heard* the voices of the forefathers as fading echoes. Attempts to write a poem or non-fiction piece were unsuccessful, so she put the thoughts aside and prayed. Eight months later, Susan and her late husband were discussing that event when he declared, \"That's it! That's your book, and it will be written in 4 months and be called Ghosts of the Past.\" The first draft was written in 4 months and underwent a name change to Echoes of the Past. Later, it became The Moses Conspiracy. Now, after 2 years of caring for her husband through cancer until his death and 6 years of honing her fiction skills, The Moses Conspiracy has been published. A widow, stepmom, daughter, and follower of Jesus Christ, Susan enjoys reading, couponing, gardening, family time, and searching for small treasures in antique shops.

Along came a woman found half-drowned in the river and a bounty hunter looking for a runaway heiress. I don't know where it comes from but before I knew it I had this couple half in love with each other while half a dozen unsavory people hunt them down, determined to find out who she really is.  After that it became--and this is true for all my books--a matter of putting the story together, scene by scene, then going back and making sure I leave the good parts in and take the boring parts out.That seems to work for me. I've made a half dozen or so national bestseller lists, won a PRISM award for my sci-fi time-travel, been a finalist in a number of other writing contest and, more currently, I released KNOW WHEN TO RUN to five-star Amazon reviews. So now I'm jumping into yet another genre,  paranormal mystery . . . with zombies.

There's also great recipes, product reviews, and giveaways as well.From a reader: \"An interesting blog run by a work at home mom. Normally I tend to dismiss parental writing because it carries a stigma of criticising anything fun and tries to convince people that human larvae need to be bubble wrapped and kept away from video games and social networking. But she’s very much a refreshing change. She’s honest, blunt and not afraid to give her 4 hellions a pop if they make a scene in Wal-Mart. And any mom who uses the the work “fuck” liberally while making good points is alright in my book. You’ll also find a network of parents through her that run along the same noble breed of awesome caretakers. My Husband Ate All My Ice Cream is a realistic and humourous look into modern parenting, conception and keeping a young spirit despite putting forth little blank templates of coupled DNA into the world.\"Kindle blogs are fully downloaded onto your Kindle so you can read them even when you're not wirelessly connected.

Rosa tells him his wish is impossible--and then calls right back to say that she has found the perfect girl.The protagonist says of himself: \"I have never gone to bed with a woman I didn't pay ... by the time I was fifty there were 514 women with whom I had been at least once ... My public life, on the other hand, was lacking in interest:  both parents dead, a bachelor without a future, a mediocre journalist ... and a favorite of caricaturists because of my exemplary ugliness.\"The girl is 14 and works all day in a factory attaching buttons in order to provide for her family.  Rosa gives her a combination of bromide and valerian to drink to calm her nerves, and when the prospective lover arrives, she is sound asleep.  Now the story really begins.  The nonagenarian is not a sex-starved adventurer; he is a tender voyeur.  Throughout his 90th year, he continues to meet the girl and watch her sleep.  He says, \"This was something new for me. I was ignorant of the arts of seduction and had always chosen my brides for a night at random, more for their price than their charms, and we had made love without love, half-dressed most of the time and always in the dark, so we could imagine ourselves as better than we were ... That night I discovered the improbably pleasure of contemplating the body of a sleeping woman without the urgencies of desire or the obstacles of modesty.\"Márquez's style never falters throughout this recounting of his life and his exploration of love, found at an unexpected time and place.  The erstwhile lover is still capable of being surprised--and fulfilled.  After an absence of ten years, it is a treat to have another parable from the master.--Valerie Ryan", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But romance is still my favourite. :) For many years, I wrote technical and non-fiction materials for professional use and had only dreamt about writing a novel. Then, one day, after a period of binge-reading sexy romances, I decided to sit in front of my computer and start writing my first fiction book. The result?  My debut novel, \"Will To Love\", the first in the hot and sexy Lifestyle by Design series. After that, I knew that I would love to tell more beautiful love stories through my books.
