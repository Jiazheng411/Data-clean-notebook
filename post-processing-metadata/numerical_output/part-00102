Born in Dublin, Ireland, he left school at fourteen and in 1876 went to London, where he began his literary career with a series of unsuccessful novels. In 1884 he became a founder of the Fabian Society, the famous British socialist organization. After becoming a reviewer and drama critic, he published a study of the Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen in 1891 and became determined to create plays as he felt Ibsen did: to shake audiences out of their moral complacency and to attack social problems. However, Shaw was an irrepressible wit, and his plays are as entertaining as they are socially provocative. Basically shy, Shaw created a public persona for himself: G.B.S., a bearded eccentric, crusading social critic, antivivisectionist, language reformer, strict vegetarian, and renowned public speaker. The author of fifty-three plays, hundreds of essays, reviews, and letters, and several books, Shaw is best known for Widowers’ Houses (1892), Mrs. Warren’s Profession (1893), Arms and the Man (1894), Caesar and Cleopatra (1898), Man and Superman (1903), Major Barbara (1905), Pygmalion (1913), Heartbreak House (1919), and Saint Joan (1923).

Jehovah's Witness elder Silas Endicott hires Raszer to find his 20-year-old daughter, Katy, abducted by three men in dark business suits after she left an abandoned dance hall high up in a canyon. Raszer probes the twists of fate that led Katy from her life as the last pure thing to an enslaved pawn of a modern descendant of the original assassins. From California and New Mexico to the war-torn borderlands where Turkey, Iran and Iraq meet, Raszer relies on both technology and mystic connections to track Katy. In the end, Raszer must figure out how to penetrate an ancient fortress, where the leader known only as the Old Man holds sway. Hill's overheated and at times laborious mix of religious arcana and the occult may make this a slog for those expecting a conventional thriller.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This isn't wishful thinking - it's hard science. And it changes everything.\" Colin Tudge \"Peoplequake is a debate-shaping book. Sobre, fascinating, it redraws the boundaries of the population debate. Pearce points out that the Earth could adequately meet the needs of a bigger population, but only once natural resources are shared more equally and managed using ecological principles. The population bomb would defuse itself even quicker if we tackled over-consumption by the rich instead of fretting about the poor having children. This brilliant book's insights could save many lives and stop many more from suffering.\" Andrew Simms, Policy Director at the New Economics Forum \"What a wonderfully rich and humane book!

Those who are already familiar with Lamm's teachings and style may find it easier reading than those seeking instant consolation. The depth and demeanor of these pages require a level of concentration that renders them almost inappropriate for the recent mourner. Instead, just as many people purchase travel guides before visiting a new place, this book should be considered a guide to the inevitable journey through bereavement. Like a Living Will or Power of Attorney document, readers will want to have familiarized themselves with the book before they actually need the information it contains. Lamm addresses the Jewish laws and traditions of death as well as the very human feelings, frustrations and concerns associated with ultimate loss. His theme ultimately remains optimistic: despair \"teaches us about our inner strength\"; encourages us to ask \"le'mah\" (for what) rather than \"lamah\" (why) and culminates reassuringly in the words of the Psalmist, \"They that sow in tears shall reap with songs of joy.\" Unfortunately, readers may miss many of Lamm's fine, lustrous pearls of parable, story and anecdote, since they are deeply embedded in a loquacious and sometimes repetitive work.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A water-covered world circling a binary star system, Kainui is far from a tropical paradise-colonists must wear pressure suits in the poisonous atmosphere and must don further protective gear when working in the salty and corrosive seawater. The planet's Maori-descended colonists live a nomadic existence, traveling about by boat or on one of the planet's anchorless floating cities. Hoani participates in the sea-mining operations of the good ship Malolo, while studying the odd culture of child-swapping among Kainui's nomadic couples. After a mass of gelatinous human-made \"pseudo-life\" nearly sinks the ship, Hoani and the Malolo's crew discover a new form of secreted iron that has arisen from a mutation of the illegally \"hacked\" life form. Centuries of human technology is transforming Kainui, and, for better or worse, the colonists must find ways to adapt. Clement follows the blueprint of his classic 1954 novel, A Mission of Gravity-a dramatic extrapolation of conditions within an extraterrestrial environment-but here fails to develop much of a plot in the midst of exposition-laden dialogue and prose that veers unpleasantly close to a turgid science lesson. Clement is unsurpassed in the exacting detail of his settings, however, and for many fans this may prove satisfaction enough.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 1592168, "title": "Noise eBook", "author": "Hal Clement", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

How about the indigeneous people still free to roam and live they had since the beginning of time? Did they have slaves? Were there any reasons to get involved?Questions, questions, and more questions. My great, great grandfather fought in that war, though I know very little about his war record.

(CHOICE)PRAISE FOR PREVIOUS EDITIONSDespite the importance of international negotiation there are remarkably few texts that can unconditionally be recommended for international relations courses. Professors Starkey, Boyer, and Wilkenfeld are to be congratulated for producing an authoritative introduction to international negotiation that is at once clear, interesting, innovative, and enjoyable. The authors have produced an excellent, user-friendly text for students that brilliantly succeeds in getting across key features of the negotiating process. They cover the major concepts, approaches, and theories in the field in a concise and highly readable way. Their synthesis of case study and theoretical analysis is just what is called for. What particularly impressed me was the ability of the authors to explain the context and mechanics of international negotiation while at the same time placing negotiation exactly where it should be-at the heart of international relations. As well as enthusiastically endorsing the adoption of this fine study as an introduction to international negotiation, I would also wish to recommend it most highly as an essential component of general courses on diplomacy and foreign policy.

Read about places you have never been\n or cultures you are unfamiliar with, you never know what types of ideas\n it will spark. You don't have to write what you already 'know' about.\nAs you will see in the book, changing the setting can change everything\nand make your story stand out.What message do you find yourself repeating over and over to writers?Don't\n worry about making things perfect the first time out, just get your\nstory down on paper and then go back and make it perfect.

However, the process of discovery is thoroughly enjoyable and well worth the effort. The large variety of alien cultures is choke full of fascinating ideas, making each new species unique and truly bringing it to live. As the story takes you through many places where multiple species mingle freely - from high class diplomatic occasions to in-the-dirt lowbrow bar fights - you get to know each new species across the full range of the social spectrum. Lale's aliens have a very organic quality to them, reminding me of the sprawling chaos encountered in... the many great writings of Ursula K. LeGuin. Throughout the story, the use of clever linguistic tools subtly reinforces the \"alienness\" of these aliens, which differ not only in appearance but also in their behavior from the more familiar form of homo sapiens.The state of humanity is derived from a future history where the African continent has emerged as the globally dominant power, and Africa's children have become Earth's representative in the interaction with other species. Using her great talent of weaving ethnic cultural influences into the background of her stories, both her human and alien characters are engrossingly complicated.The sheer scope of the story virtually guarantees to offer something for everybody; however for readers who particularly enjoy the rich complexity of a world as imaginative as it is believable, \"Punch\" is a must read.Ralph Ewig, author of \"Eleuthera\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Upon recapture, Terry was sentenced to a fresh term of 16 years, during which time he took full advantage of the prison education system, and nine years later he achieved his release on parole to attend university. Terry now lives with his family in the backwaters of Essex, and has become a best-selling author and crime consultant. Totally reformed, he now goes to work with a sawn-off pen. He knows that his love of the English language and writing has become his saviour. Terry's other published books are 'The Art of Armed Robbery' and 'Two Strikes and You're Out'.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the course of the investigation, Ab is kidnapped, and the young people soon figure out that some of the guests at the local bed-and-breakfast know about the treasure. Added to the mystery is the appearance of the Black Moriah, the island's legendary ghost. This multilayered mystery holds readers' attention well. Interesting characters, a fast-moving plot, and a satisfying and surprising ending make it a quick read.

He wishes only to say that he is in fact not acutually Lucian Morgan; that is, this pleasant enough name of the pen protects the Author against getting googled while looking for honest work;  the Author does not wish to find himself explaining what he means by Dog Christ during a job interview. Point of fact, Lucian is the Author's real name (in the middle, rarely used position). Morgan is an old family name that connects the Author with his Welsh gypsy roots, and this pleases the Author. If the Author were pressed to say something about himself he might offer this: went to a mediocre college and flunked out of the seventeenth grade, twice; since has had twenty plus jobs over forty-five grueling years and not one worth a damn; after much scribbling wrote his first novel Dog Christ at age fifty-five in a wan and futile effort to ascribe meaning to life; said novel is chosen as finalist in big deal competition; prefers playing the piano to all other activities; the half dozen or so people he is acquainted with all agree his second novel is extraordinary; they urge him to stop playing with it. He cannot. The premise is ridiculous: a mediocre old poet is obsessed with learning to play the allegretto from the Beethoven D minor Sonata... And what happens to this crummy old piano playing poet?  He writes a novel, of course,  about himself. What other subject could there be? Having skewered the wealthy in Dog Christ (again, an award winner) while making his glib fun of anyone who believes in anything, the Author takes a predictably cautious turn with novel number two. And with all the trouble he's had writing it, calling it number two pretty much says it all. The Author mentions this only to illustrate his zealous dedication to the amateur's art. It is unlikely that this second outbreak of literature will survive the thorough editorial scrubbing the Author relentlessly gives it, though the Author also claims he has done all he can with the manuscript and is now prepared to conclude his number two post haste. The Author would add that this may not happen until he finishes yet another project,  a third novel, more in the vein of Dog Christ, all about richies again. So far it is shaping up to be an even bigger test of the reader's patience.  The Author would not beg the reader's indulgence. He does not need the $4200 a year he might hope to earn writing novels.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this sense, the 'Boudicca' sequence has a great deal in common with David Harsent's Legion, which represents a similar attempt by a non-combatant poet to engage intelligently with the realities of war.

Waugh was the only boy ever to be expelled from The Old Shirburnian Society.Despite setting this record, Waugh went on to become the successful author of over 50 works, and lived in many exotic places throughout his life which later became the settings for some of his texts. He was also a noted wine connoisseur and campaigned to make the 'cocktail party' a regular feature of 1920s social life.", "related": ["B004TPUP3O"], "rank": 1800128, "title": "The Loom of Youth (Bloomsbury Reader)", "author": "Alec Waugh", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It emphasizes basic history, physical diagnosis, laboratory testing, and the understanding of evidence-based medicine in order to establish a differential diagnosis...

The entire textbook is beautifully illustrated with numerous tables, graphs, photographs, and artists illustrations that are a rich resource for clinicians at any level.  There are charts and tables that one would not find in a traditional textbook, such as typical odors in various diseases on page 99.  This book is an excellent resource for both the fledgling and veteran clinician.  It attempts to do the impossible--ie, make the enormous subject matter of internal medicine digestible.  ...The material itself is presented in a clear, simplified, and approachable manner, making it user-friendly. While striving to be comprehensive, aesthetically appealing, easy to use, and simple, it comes close to hitting its mark and is a worthwhile addition for clinicians to have at their disposal.--Journal of the American Medical AssociationThe outstanding strengths are its completeness, the beautiful illustrations, and the compact presentation. Chapters usually give a succinct description of the whole differential diagnosis, together with ultrashort summaries of relevant diseases. These chapters can be perused in less than 15 min, which makes the book suitable for use in practical settings. Because of the very beautiful layout and illustrations, this book can be useful for teaching medicine. ..This book should be readily available (and used!) in every internist's practice, and even more so when students are around.--European Journal of Internal MedicineOne of the most comprehensive books on developing alternative diagnoses...The color photographs are among the best I have ever encountered...an extraordinarily helpful and authoritative book and well worth the price.--Doodys Book Reviews", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Seth Rogovoy's The Essential Klezmer and Mark Slobin's Fiddler on the Move: Exploring the Klezmer World are both valuable works, but Strom's entry is in many ways the most satisfying. A New Yorker who is himself a klezmer bandleader as well as the author of several books on Eastern European Jews and Gypsies, he presents a history of klezmer that is at once scholarly and personal. The historical accounting occupies four chapters: \"From King David to Duvid the Klezmer,\" \"From the Enlightenment to the Holocaust,\" \"Klezmer in the New World, 1880-1960,\" and \"From Zev to Zorn: The Masters of the Culture.\" The first appendix, \"Klezmer Memories in the Memorial Books,\" is one of the most moving sections, featuring a collection of commentaries on klezmer music and musicians from hundreds of memorial books written by Holocaust survivors.

Ethan writes towards a peaceful world with a sharp and unique perspective.Ethan proudly dropped out of high school, though he later admittedly graduated. He later dropped out of college and the proverbial rat race, moving to the mountains to pursue snowboarding. This led him to pursue tai chi chuan, yoga and meditation. Being a dropout Ethan has been able to honestly observe and present his observations, his many articles appearing on leading news websites with global audiences as well as several magazines. Ethan wrote The Complete Patriot's Guide to Oligarchical Collectivism. In it he explores history, philosophy and activism through an Orwellian lens. The Matrix of Four, The Philosophy of the Duality of Polarity, is a metaphilosophy on the development of individual consciousness and understanding of collective consciousness. It provides insight on meditation as well as political observation through universally shared ideas leading to the portrayal of the righteous rebel archetype as well as the philosophical point of nullisis. The Terraist Letters is Ethan's second piece of fiction, this one set in uptown Manhattan. It is the story of Sean Enstitue. Ethan was inspired to write it after the Fukushima disaster. The story contrasts nukes and nugs, but it is much more than potfiction. It is the story of the archetypal rebel only set in the new world order, where our postmodern hero is a blunt smoking, high school dropout, graffiti artist, physics hobbyist who believes we are under archon and extraterrestrial invasion. 108 Steps to Be in the Zone is an inspirational exploration of the metaphysical number 108, symbolic for oneness, nothingness and the infinite. Ethan explores how the sacred number can be utilized to enhance intuition, practice meditation and elaborates 108 steps to develop self and surroundings in the toxic postmodern world.", "related": ["B00FTIZJKE"], "rank": 2046721, "title": "Down and Out in Mendocino", "author": "Ethan Indigo Smith", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It may seem as though a team of writers, so to say, had their way with extensive revisions. Not much of my original version remains!I'll say no more here, except to tell why I came to write this story.In early March 2011, I was traveling in Costa Rica and staying nearby Manuel Antonio National Park. The Pacific's sandy beaches in this park are some of the best I've seen. On Friday March 11, I caught a headline on CNN that a massive earthquake hit Honshu, Japan's main island. Thousands of people were unaccounted for. I'm sure you saw as I did the same wreckage, costal villages swept to sea, ships stranded on top of buildings.After leaving Costa Rica, heading back to Seattle, I kept thinking about the earthquake- and the new disaster unfolding with 3 nuclear reactors undergoing meltdowns.Long ago, when I lived in Germany with my former wife, a geologist working on nuclear waste, I came to know about, of all things, the unique challenges of long-term storage of nuclear waste and why geology matters (water loves to run wild underground). Had I married a mortician's daughter, I would have written a different story.At that time in Germany, I was working at a research institute on plant molecular biology projects. I spent a lot of time waving my arms, writing in color on chalkboards- enjoying the scientific exchange of new ideas with students and colleagues, talking about mutated plant genes and how we planned to observe them in future generations. Had I focused on the molecular biology of rare orchids, I may not have written this story.Somewhere inside left field, it started in the days after the nuclear accident and on the long flight back to Seattle, I felt inspired to take out a red moleskin notebook that I had bought at the airport. More and more, I jotted notes, one inspiring another note- linked by circles and squares- some with lots of circles! Out the left side of my plane, across the Pacific, Fukushima Daiichi a week earlier was the world's 25th largest nuclear plant; now it was even bigger- a top environmental disaster site as bad as Chernobyl.By the time I finished Nuclear Snakes, it took a year, writing at night and on weekends, the story unfolded in ways I had not dreamed of starting on that long flight back. 'Dreamland' came late in the writing, and when it did, I felt the story 'snap' together. I knew it was done. I have a recommendation for reading Nuclear Snakes and that is to use a Mac or PC version of Kindle. That way, you can connect to links meant to enhance your reading experience, like pink tumbleweeds. \"You should see this video,\" lets you know about key external links. You can still read the text on the basic Kindle, but the 'color' version is how I intended folks to read it. My hope is that by weaving an entertaining format, going light on science, the novel's colorful characters showing and telling, that you'll come away knowing a lot more about nuclear waste- and what it might mean to you.I'm sure of one thing. I bet my answer to \"What's the worst that could happen to me?\" will surprise you.It surprised me.Wishing you well,Robert MastersonRobert@NuclearSnakes.com", "related": ["B009W92RME"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This veteran author started reading Mills & Boons at age 6 and the born romantic writer comes through in her latest e-book, which is a classic sexy tale with spot-on freshness laced with touches of humor.Real Temptation, a sequel to Tempting the Mogul, moves at a steady clip with penny-pinching Kael Whittingham and shopaholic Rae Tyson. This sparring couple is brought together by a reality TV show and the hope for the $100,000 win. For three months, they will live together, attend therapy sessions, and learn from each other. But that's if they can survive each other's bad habits.\"Do you have scissors?\" he asked the gum-chewing cashier with the blank stare. Then turning to Rae, he said, \"I'll take that.\"\"Take what?\" Rae asked, perplexed.\"Your credit card?\"Before she could respond, he whipped the card out of her hand and cut it to shreds.I laughed heartily through that scene and went into the \"Oh no, he didn't!\" mode on Rae's behalf. But I would have been the friend, while holding Rae's hand in sympathy, silently agreeing with Kael. The man had to have some courage to risk going to sleep in the same house after that stunt.These two pushed through and pulled against their bad habits and drama that persistently dominated their lives. Not only their strength was admirable, but the hot-blooded attraction that sizzled from their first meeting couldn't be denied. They were opposites in so many ways, and yet, they were a natural fit, even if they didn't see the truth. I hope Rae's friends will also have their chance at love.", "related": [], "rank": 1790919, "title": "Real Temptation", "author": "Marcia King-Gamble", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 3.6, "rating_total": 18.0}

Any mistakes about anthropology or ghost whisperers are solely mine or intentional in order to serve the story.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He received a Bachelor's degree in Astronomy from UCLA and worked as a civilian space scientist for the U.S. Navy for a few years after leaving college, but has made his living as a writer/editor most of his life. He served the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America for close to three years as editor of the SFWA Bulletin, and another three years as the organization's Western Regional Director. He has lived with cats all his adult life. Artistically, he enjoys Broadway musicals and surrealist art. MARY MASON was born in Bakersfield and has lived in California all her life. She earned a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from CSU Sacramento, and has worked counseling abused children. Her first husband was a member of \"Hell Bent For Glory,\" a pre-Hell's Angels motorcycle gang, but she made the bikers check their weapons at the door and wash her dishes, in exchange for her fine cooking. Her philosophy regarding martial arts is, \"My black belt beats your black belt, because my black belt's in Smith & Wesson.\" She is also a sound lady, mixing live music for bands--usually Chicago blues and S.F. rock, but also swing, folk, and both Country and Western. She has run several Nebula Award banquets for the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America as well as science fiction conventions, and founded the 1993 San Francisco WorldCon bid.

A confluence of circumstances placed a substantial increase of working middle-class black students at many public and private universities as well as historically black colleges. Biondi exposes the inverted emphasis of American media coverage, for the perceptively white student antiwar uprising at Columbia was preceded by a black student demonstration against racism. Similarly, the student deaths at Kent State were preceded by substantial numbers of deaths and arrests at black colleges as students protested racial discrimination and segregation. Biondi argues that this population of black students had an outsize impact on changing social conditions, an impact that has often been overlooked. A major legacy of the black student protests was the creation of black studies departments, followed by others of other ethnic, as well as gender, studies. Those academic programs have continued for more than 40 years, not without controversy centered on their origins, with compelling ideological and political priorities. Biondi’s work offers a fresh perspective on the student protest era, acknowledging the major and overlooked contributions of black students. --Vernon Ford", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Plenty of documentation of him has been found but doesn't help much with persistent questions: Why did he move around so much? Why did he have constant money troubles? Why is he almost completely mum about his own life? Martin, who like his subject is both businessman and novelist, believes such questions can be answered if one presumes not that Defoe was fearfully hiding youthful participation in Monmouth's rebellion, as other biographers have thought, but that Defoe was a cross-dressing homosexual. Martin admits to speculating but thinks Defoe becomes clearer if his clandestine sexual identity and the blackmail it laid him open to are considered plausible and inferentially investigated. The major clues Martin follows up are Defoe's less-than-cozy marriages; his long, intense relationships with certain men; his novels' protagonist-narrators' personalities and doings; and the curious ways he went through money. Professional scholars may pooh-pooh Martin's exercise. Those hooked by Defoe's fundamental elusiveness may be spellbound.

Guy Mankowski's portrayal of the ballerina Yelena is wholly convincing, taking us inside her thoughts and feelings as she describes the course of her life, from harrowing childhood to professional success, punctuated with turbulent emotional crisis. This is clearly a writer of great talent. -- Dr. Andrew Crumey, Longlisted for The Man Booker Prize Letters from Yelena, is a fantastic literary achievement, instantly setting aside any concerns over a difficult second novel for this immensely talented north east author. Following on from his excellent debut, The Intimates, this novel is an intimate character study of a highly skilled, yet psychologically scarred ballerina, told in epistolary form. The epistolary form is often seen as a rather old-fashioned literary device, but here, Mankowski breathes new life into it, creating a captivating, engaging narrative which plucks at our heart-strings. It's clear that the novel has been excellently researched Mankowski was awarded a grant by the Arts Council to visit the world-famous ballet school in St Petersburg and, in his acknowledgements, he also states he has spent a great deal of time with dancers from a school in the north east of England but this is far more than simply an information-dump. There is a real, honest-to-goodness story here. And the way Mankowski tells it? Astounding. The characters are delicately described. The atmosphere created is tangible. The language pirhouettes, spins, soars: some of the imagery is simply brilliant. More: the comparisons between dancing and writing are great. -- Andrew Kirby I felt I was watching a ballet in a darkened theatre, unable to look away until the story had unfolded, so beautifully, before my eyes. From opening this book on Thursday I was unable to put it down until I had finished it. More than that, I was talking about it through dinner, and thinking about it too. It is wonderfully written, and I was fascinated by the world of the ballet. -- Ruth Dugdall I finished Letters from Yelena in two sittings. The mental and physical strain of the professional ballet artist is almost tangible. Mankowski creates a bleak and isolated landscape, where aspiration and ambition can be crushed under the sheer weight of their own internal pressure. 'Yelena' has more emotional and intellectual depth in a chapter than the entirety of The Black Swan. Instead it harks back to something like the visual masterpiece of The Red Shoes; romantic, dark, uncompromising, and beautiful. I defy any woman, and any dancer, to not see parts of themselves in Yelena. Exceptionally talented. Thank God you don't write crime/thrillers or I'd be bitter and jealous. -- Hanna Jameson, author and aspiring ballerina Unfolding through the letters between a Ukrainian dancer and her lover, the novel explores art and how people use it in their lives to complex and compelling effect.' - Attitude Magazine 'A beautifully written story with convincing characters and a good if sometimes heart-breaking plot. Overall, a great novel from Mankowski' - Novel Kicks 'This epistolary novel takes the always present fascination with the torments of ballet dancers and adds a romantic twist. Mankowski brings every bruises foot and strained limb to life.' - The Simple Things magazine 'From his time working at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg as well as having access to the Vaganova Ballet Academy, Guy Mankowski has written a truly wonderful epistolary novel. It has shades of The Red Shoes and The Black Swan, with its dark thematic intensity of child abuse leading the main protagonist Yelena into self-harming, and ultimately suffering mental health problems.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.", "related": ["B001FB5TUY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In Powerlines, my first novel, and Young Lions, its sequel, I have enjoyed satirising the profession of architecture from the point of the view of the ever beleaguered assistant, who suffers the whims and mood swings of his famous and powerful employers. As one reader pointed out though, I could have been describing any professional environment. The Marble Boy, my third, is a quite different novel based on a journey through the Mediterranean. Written from the point of view of one man escaping a past, and the straightjacket of his sexuality, he is in search of love and acceptance. I am currently writing a new novel, which at this stage will be a tragi-comedy set in the Middle East, and several short stories. I was born in Bury St Edmunds, England in 1962, and grew up in Southend on Sea before a permanent move to London, where I now live. I have studied architecture in London and Glasgow, and then, after years in a high profile firm of architects, where I became a senior design Partner in the business, I am now currently practicing as an architect independently. I am also an artist, and regularly exhibit in galleries in the UK. I have also travelled extensively, including the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Asia and beyond, and look forward to much more travelling in the future.

A genuine Sufi shaikh and representative of the Mevlevi order of Sufism in North America, Helminski seeks to create what he calls \"a spirituality adequate to our times.\" InThe Knowing Heart's collected essays, Helminski delves into the unique characteristics that define Sufism and make it relevant to seekers today. Along the way, he explains the difference between a shaikh and a dervish; the purpose of the dervish's whirling dance during asema; why Sufis chant thezikr; when a spiritual conversation is asohbet; and how love turns service into ecstasy. Although the author is reaching into an ancient foreign tradition, there is little in this book that's arcane or awkward. Helminski softens his delivery with liberal use of poems, especially from his lineal forebear Rumi, and with pithy stories that are the hallmark of Sufi teaching. The overall message is that true spirituality requires sustained  self-development, andThe Knowing Heartoffers an attractive path.--Brian Bruya", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What am I doing here? What is my purpose? What does it all mean? But I was looking in the wrong places.    I presented myself to the world as a self-confident, all-knowing, opinionated person who seemed to know where he was going. Little did anyone know that beneath this false façade was a little boy lost. Because I was wracked with self-doubts and insecurities, I looked to pleasure-seeking, self-gratification and addictions to dull my fears and cover up the pain. After years of futile searching, none of these distractions answered my questions. Indeed, they only led to more pain and self-doubts.    In 1989, at the age of forty-six, I plummeted into deep depression having concluded that nothing made sense and my bogus, inconsequential life was going nowhere. Nearly two years of traditional therapy didn’t help much and my gloomy outlook placed huge stresses on my marriage which eventually disintegrated.    On the night my marriage ended, in my rage and despair, I cried out to God for help (which was an interesting thing for an atheist to do!). As a result I had a profound spiritual experience. This was a turning point that steered me towards a radically different path to the one I’d been following. A journey within my own mind to find the answers to the above questions.    I’ve found we’re all on a voyage of self-discovery, whether we realize it or not, and our life’s experiences are a result of the choices we make. Inexorably we make wrong choices driven by egocentric forces within our minds. While the purpose of these choices is to primarily satisfy our own selfish needs, they always come back to bite us through guilt and self-punishment. Fortunately, we always get another opportunity to correct our mistakes and make different choices if we so desire.      This is my second book and it focuses on the extraordinary healing power of forgiveness. My first book, THE POWER, THE MIRACLE AND THE DREAM – A Beginner’s Guide to Lasting Happiness, introduced the idea we are more than we think we are and there is a power within our minds that can solve all of our problems. This book further explores tapping into that power to bring peace and happiness into our lives and to everyone we touch, through practicing true forgiveness.

He grew up in northeastern South Carolina where he was the seventh child in a family with ten children. He shares a very close relationship with his six brothers and three sisters, most of who still lives in the area. After graduation from Chestnut High School, an all black school in North Myrtle Beach, SC, he attended college at Marshall University in Huntington, W.V. He was a member of Marshall's foot team in 1968 and 1969. His life suffered a tragic jolt in 1970 when he lost several close friends and school mates in the plane crash that took the lives of nearly the entire Marshall University football team. Years later he met and married his wife, Regina, in California where they lived for more than twenty-five years. They have a son together and now live in The Triangle area of North Carolina. Chuck enjoys hiking, fishing, golfing, traveling and writing. His biggest pleasure comes from spending quality time with his family and working in his garden.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She started her first book, a sci-fi, in grade school. With only one more chapter to write, her aunt found the manuscript hidden in Sue’s closet. Without reading it, she called it garbage, a waste of time and paper, then forced Sue to watch as she tore it up and threw it in the trash.  Giving up writing until she had left home at 18, in college, Sue earned a journalism scholarship. She wrote her first full-length book, a memoir about her life after the kidnapping. She’s written two other books in the Bitter Memories series, plus a book of poetry with stories that inspired each poem, exposing feelings never shared before, and a few short stories. The Rose, one of her short stories, is her first fantasy since her aunt tore up her sci-fi so many years ago. Still remembering her main characters from that book, she brings them back to life in The Rose: A Tale of Fantasy. She is currently working on several more non-fiction books. Today she lives in Nevada with her husband, two dogs, a cat and a bird. She enjoys the outdoors, reading and writing.

After the two meet at a local bar and share a steamy evening, Shane applies for a job at Campania to do a little reconnaissance. He doesn't expect to fall in love with the plucky chef, who's got something to prove to her staff, to her family, and most of all to herself. As minor crises—including a broken oven and a destroyed tomato shipment—start to look like sabotage, Shane wonders whether there's another fixer trying to get the Grimanis to sell. But Shane has a bigger fear: that once Gabriella discovers his agenda, she'll ditch him. Plumley's lovably flawed protagonists are charmers, and their story will win hearts despite a somewhat predictable ending. Agent: Karen Solem, Spencerhill Associates.

Her stories are volcanic in heat, deep in emotion, and sprinkled with doses of humor. When not indulging in her passion for books, she loves the outdoors, film and music. The Pacific Northwest is the ideal spot to enjoy both hiking and beachcombing. Once upon a time she was the singer in an indie rock band that toured the West Coast and charted on U.S. college radio. She currently resides on the northern coast of Oregon, where the constant rain and fog remind her of visits to her family in England and Scotland when she was a child.

The thing, however, is that the Boxer, despite their gentle nature, is essentially a big, muscular, powerful animal, and it can be headstrong at time--that's why rearing it correctly and raising it well is absolutely important--as a dog master, you must know everything there is to know about the dog who is in your care. That's why John Williams' book, 'The Boxer: Scholar and Clown' is something that every dog lover should have: it provides complete information about the personality, characteristics, and temperament of the Boxer, among other things.'The Boxer: Scholar and Clown' also provides training and rearing tips especially meant for this specific dog breed. And most importantly, the book provides feeding and vital health information about the Boxer--what you can do to protect your beloved dog from diseases common for the breed, as well as what you can do when the dog is sick.For those who already have a Boxer, Williams' book is a great eye-opener and allows you to know your beloved dog better, which hopefully will further deepen your bond and friendship with them. On the other hand, for those who are still deciding which dog breed to have, then this book might sway you toward getting a Boxer, especially with the dog's many endearing qualities. Overall, this is a highly indispensable book for the dog lover. Order a copy of this today and you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend! - Meghan rated it 5 of 5 stars", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I think it sends a wonderful message to American youth that not all people look at drinking as something to do only to get drunk. Also with the story being set in Austria, Jen Minkman uses typical German phrases and greetings frequently, which lends to the authenticity of the story. It also makes you want to live in a place with so much history that certain things are continued through the generations. Add to that the forest and Celtic folklore, and you have a full and wonderful romance and coming of age story that is wonderfully written and great for any age reader.

This book compiles the letters that George wrote home to his family before he died from boot camp and through the days that he served over a period of three years. We also get thoughts and memories woven in with the letters from George's younger brother, 65 years after George died. This is a very real story in a very turbulent time for the world and shows us what  valiant real-life heroes lived and died during that war.Darla Noble has put together a beautiful book that shares the story of George and his family through letters and memories. World War II is always an emotional period to read about, whether it is fiction or non-fiction, but reading these letters, words from someone who was really there, touches you. We always say that all soldiers are heroes but rarely get such a personal look at to what they are feeling or thinking during the whole process of war. I think it is the fact that this is a real and very human story that brings you into it. I hope that everyone will read this book because it is a story that needs to be read and remembered. The author has done a wonderful job at presenting it in a memorable way that will keep you reading from cover to cover.", "related": [], "rank": 2209927, "title": "All My Love, George eBook", "author": "Darla Noble", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It wasn’t until she was a teenager that she started writing down the stories she came up with. Marissa is blessed with a wonderful supportive husband, Thomas. He’s her other half and allows her to stay home and pursue her writing. He puts up with all her quirks and listens to her brainstorm in the middle of the night. Her writing buddies Max (a cocker spaniel) and Dawne (a beagle mix) are always around to listen to her bounce ideas off them. They might not be able to answer, but they’re helpful in their own ways.

During her stay in Rio de Janeiro, Strays of Rio, a thriller set in this city of contrasts, took shape. In 2008 she traveled through Chile, supposedly the safest coun­try in South America. Stopped at a red light in their rented SUV, she and her partner were sandwiched between two trucks on the Pan-American highway. An unplanned excursion to the local hos­pital and the Carabineros de Chile allowed her insights she never meant to gain but wouldn’t want to miss. A new story idea sparked: Crumple Zone. Together with British author Francene Stanley, she co-wrote the Higher Ground series of four post-apocalyptic fantasy adventures.", "related": [], "rank": 1903862, "title": "Caution: Wet (Adventure Trek Book 2)", "author": "Edith Parzefall", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Who would not prefer King Juris? And who would argue that toleration is not important? Andrew Cohen's snappy, often amusing, style makes the issue come alive, and is more effective than a straightforward argument for the importance of toleration. Cohen also challenges society-wide shibboleths by arguing that drug use, pornography, and prostitution by and with consenting adults ought to be tolerated, but corporations as they are currently instituted ought not.

They were over 60\nyears old - written by our father to our mother during the Second World War. We\nhad been unaware of their existence until that moment. Our parents had met\nwhile my father was in basic training in Cowra, where my mother had lived all\nher life. Their courtship, which was conducted almost exclusively by mail and\ntheir subsequent marriage 3 days before my father embarked for the Middle East,\nwas laid out before us like the pages of a book.  How powerful is the written word. How sad it would have been\nif we had not found those letters, we almost threw them out as rubbish! It was a\nwhole chapter in our heritage. It also made me think about the number of times\nthat this story had been played out in other families and other wars, on both\nsides of these conflicts. Ever since that day I had a strong conviction that\nsomeone had to tell their story, not only to future generations of our family\nbut to the world at large.It was only after my circumstances changed several years ago\nthat I started to feel that I could be that person. Not for fame or fortune but\nto leave a legacy to my family and its future generations, and to history. I\nwant them and anyone else who chooses to read what I finally came up with to\nrealise the powerful part that the written word can play in their lives.   The idea of writing\nit as a work of fiction, based on their characters, formed after years of\nresearch and the realisation that as powerful as those letters were, they\ndidn't depict the whole story. Censorship and lack of records would have made\nit almost impossible to write an accurate account as a family history, so I\ndecided to use the information in the letters and official records of my\nfather's unit (the 2/3rd Pioneers, AIF), as the background for a\nwork of fiction with, I hope, historical significance. The war photos used on\nthe cover were actually taken by my father during his tour of duty in the\nMiddle East. I have supplied details of them on my website. I have also\nincluded many other photos and family history details. The maps I have included\nin my book and on my website highlight the actual places my father's unit was\nstationed.My parents both survived the perils of war and went on to\nsuccessfully raise 6 healthy and successful children, staying happily married\nuntil my father's death in 1988. Their life after war was not without hardship\nand they made many sacrifices raising their children, instilling in them the\nvalues and convictions espoused by the characters in my book. I am eternally\ngrateful for their love and devotion to each other, as well as to myself and my\nbrothers and sisters.I would also like to acknowledge by writing this story, the\nmany men and women of all nations who have put their lives and relationships on\nhold to fight for their country during wartime.I hope I have done them justice.", "related": ["B00G475C3I"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
