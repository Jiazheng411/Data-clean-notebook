Average citizens are bombarded with so many sleek and produced images a day, they've lost track of authenticity, according to Adatto. Paying particular attention to the photo op's political influence, she compares coverage of the 1968 campaign between Nixon, Humphrey and Wallace with the showdown between Dukakis and Bush in 1988, demonstrating how, in a mere 20 years, photo-ops and sound bites had transformed news. Adatto doesn't delve as heavily into contemporary elections; however, she scrutinizes some of the most well-known images from the invasion of Iraq (George W. Bush posing under the Mission Accomplished banner; the photos of prisoner abuse from Abu Ghraib), and her solid grasp and interpretation of pertinent pop culture from Bogart to Warhol to the filmsNetworkandThe Truman Showamply compensate for the lapse. This book is an admirable analysis of the role of the image in modern culture and an eloquent defense of why words still matter.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But as a contemporary professional, I appreciate even more the way he captures, as few historians have, the operational role of cavalry through the ages and into the future. As he explains, cavalry is more than a mere state of mind, it is the enabler of operational art and operational level maneuver. At each technical revolution it takes some time to refine the means and methods, and he describes these struggles well. When the 21st century Cavalry takes shape we will all recognize it for what it is. The horse may be gone but the function persists. <STRONG;>Brigadier General (ret.) Huba Wass de Czege U.S. Army</STRONG;><br /><br /> In this engaging study, Jarymowycz demonstrates that cavalry really is a state of mind. He convincingly links the warhorse of the classical and medieval eras with the cavalry regiments of Desert Storm. A great read full of ideas worth pondering. <STRONG;>Terry Copp author of Fields of Fire: The Canadians in Normandy</STRONG;><br /><br /> There is no one quite like Roman Jarymowycz, a modern scholar, raconteur extraordinaire, and 18th century hussar all rolled into one high-energy package. Cavalry from Hoof to Track will thrill aficionados of the horse arm, as well as their modern descendants in helicopter and tank. The scope is epic, from Macedon to the M-1, Bucephalus to Basra, and the author's inimitable style rarely fails to delight. <STRONG;>Rob Citino Eastern Michigan University</STRONG;><br /><br /> Written with all the elan of a charge by Curassiers, Roman Jarymowycz's masterful study of the history of cavalry is based on deep research. For all the author's learning, his volume is great fun to read as it leads one to ponder what might have been and still is. --J.L.

He found that, as with many pop-cultural notions, it has no single definition, nor can it, because each person must deal with the end of life in individualized terms, even when, ironically, those terms seem dictated by perceptions of others’ expectations. Casarett draws upon dozens of anecdotes garnered from decades of professional experience to profile people facing imminent death. The stories are remarkably compelling. Some have months or weeks in which to carry out their wishes; others, only hours. Many have their wishes and priorities in order. Most have vague ideas and uncertain priorities and need counsel. Still others have neither wishes nor priorities and refuse counsel. Although Casarett has his own notion of a good death, he doesn’t let that obscure his attempt to understand others’ ideas. --Donna Chavez", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My name is Samuel Clemente. I was born and raised in the city of New York. More specifically in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Before observant readers accuse me of being rich, I'd like to point out that: I only had one maid growing up, but my mother hates it when I call her that. I should also specify that I am of Dominican descent. Some readers may be asking \"What part of Mexico is that in?\" To those readers I answer \"uhh... South.\"Much of my early youth was spent standing next to microwave ovens, in the off chance that the radiation would give me super powers. Aside from my uncontrollable twitch, this experiment was a failure. The majority of my teenage years were spent pondering the mysteries of the world. Mysteries such as: If cavemen didn't have sofas and they only sat on rocks; does that mean that Hispanic cavemen sat on rocks covered in plastic?After spending some time being beaten up by the local neighborhood bully, a name my mother also hates being called, I attended a state university. The next seven years are a giant blur. Eventually I would return to Brooklyn, where in I decided to use the 80 pages of \"comedic\" material I wrote while digging through cow feces, for the goal of one day being able to write numerous ebooks.Some people may ask \"why ebooks?\": It's quite simple. It should come as no surprise that the main reason authors write books is to go on book tours. At these book tours authors are asked to sign either copies of their books or if they're lucky, breasts. By writing an ebook I have eliminated the physical product and therefore maximized my breasts signing opportunities. Some readers may attempt to defeat this brilliant strategic maneuver by asking that printed copies of the ebook be signed; I will promptly draw signed breasts on these printed copies.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Bremmer had a strong fascination for mysteries and puzzles. As a young girl, she spent hours solving crossword and other word puzzles and devouring every Perry Mason book she could get her hands on. Patricia married at age twenty, and joined her husband on the road traveling across the United States with a stable of racehorses, giving her a feel for a variety of cultures and landscape. Not to mention an outstanding knowledge of horses. To earn extra money she made jockey silks and saddle towels to sell to trainers and owners at the racetracks. After starting her family, she moved to a small rural area in western Nebraska, which gives her the ability to write that small town country feel into scenes in her books as well as her big city experience.  Bremmer discovered her talent for storytelling in 2003 when she penned her first mystery novel. Since then she spends several months of the year putting her plots to paper. The rest of the time is devoted to her kennel of West Highland White Terriers. An excellent speaker, Bremmer makes guest appearances at libraries, book stores and schools to captivate her audiences with her relaxed tone while discussing her writing. And, to add to the excitement of her appearances, she frequently includes her real life detective who has become the sleuth in her novels. Together they charm and entertain the crowds.  To keep up with her puzzle loving personality she adds an Elusive Clue word puzzle hidden within the pages of her books, a real treat that brings out the detective in her readers. Patricia Bremmer, mother of three has seven grandchildren and one on the way.  Bremmer is a member of Sisters in Crime and the Nebraska Writer s Guild.", "related": ["B00597RRZU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A few computer commands saved on a disk do the trick. \"Joe\" is full of surprises, from mowing the neighborhood's lawns to sending bullies flying through the air. Unfortunately, it's suddenly Golem meets Frankenstein as Joe gets out of control, which includes mistakenly tying up the teacher. While many children will be intrigued by a mechanical figure that comes to life, it may be asking too much to suspend disbelief over the fact that the robot was fairly easy to create by a fourth grader, and that it fooled adults into thinking it was a real person. Expressions such as \"Holy Hanukkah\" and \"Perilous Passover\" sound campy and might be lost on readers who are unfamiliar with the Jewish terms.

The crime scene features a woman shot in the head who has been lovingly laid out on a bed and a man found in the adjoining bathroom minus his head and hands. The woman is Jeanine Sterling, but is her companion in death her husband Parker? Both Jeanine's mother Victoria and her brilliant 13-year-old grandson Freddy claim that Parker left the body of a stranger to cover his disappearance, and not for the first time. The grandmother is involved in mysticism and is heavily influenced by her much younger boyfriend, Jason. Down-to-earth Lucinda is very interested in Jason, who can't be found, and PR person Pamela Godfrey, whose DNA is discovered at the scene. Physical evidence shows that Freddy is Jeanine's son but not Parker's. When Freddy is kidnapped, Pierce's FBI friend Jake Lovett joins the team. Good thing, because Pierce must cope with two deaths in her own dysfunctional family; a number of men including Jake who love her despite her facial scars; and a complicated case that turns on an unusual motive for murder. Despite a case with some elements that beggar belief, Lucinda (Punish the Deed, 2009, etc.) is such a strong heroine that she should engage many readers.  --Kirkus Reviews, 1st April 2010", "related": [], "rank": 1510177, "title": "Mistaken Identity (A Lucinda Pierce Mystery Book 3)", "author": "Diane Fanning", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cambridge University fellow Hoskin (The History of Astronomy) presents the early 19th-century German-born siblings who pursued careers in music until William's hobby of astronomy eventually provided both with financial support from the King of England. William became famous as a builder of precision telescopes; Caroline was his faithful assistant. Both made significant discoveries, despite the fact that their names are virtually unknown to the average person today. Using homemade telescopes widely known to be the best available, William discovered Uranus, some of its moons, and moons of Saturn, while Caroline studied nebulae and discovered eight comets. William also discovered the existence of infrared radiation through the use of colored filters. Drawing from William's papers, as well as journals and autobiographies penned by Caroline, Hoskin relates the fascinating story of a man who pursued his passion and left a large legacy to science, and the sister who abandoned a singing career to familial obligations, which in time produced rewards for her as well.

After my best friend was murdered, I had a difficult time functioning on a day to day basis. I couldn't sleep. I was filled with rage at the idea that someone could take a life so callously. I'm sure that family members of murder and crime victims understand the anger and helplessness that's felt when someone intentionally harms the ones they love. I began writing all the ways I wanted to kill the SOB I felt was responsible for her death. Slowly, over twenty years, it turned into a fantasy and a work of fiction. While there are a many true elements in the story, the story itself is fiction. Locations and dates were changed; characters, while based somewhat on real people, are also made-up.For the first 4 or 5 years, I fought back tears every time I sat down to write. Sometimes the story sat on the shelf for a year or two at a time before I could resume writing. In the last few years, it began a life of its own, becoming a story where I could control the ending.I'm now working on a sequel and a \"pre-quel\" to this story. This allows my characters to move-on, grow and have a different \"life of their own.\"And while I have finally recovered from the loss of my friend, she is still in my heart everyday.", "related": ["B00ANTUTMC"], "rank": 2727875, "title": "Moon of the Hawk", "author": "Watt", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a must-read for all those who want to understand the security complexities and challenges we face and the policy implications this changing world presents. (Anthony C. Zinni)Sean Kay has written one of those rare studies that is truly as important as its subject. With clear-eyed prose, sober intelligence, and scholarly depth, he examines a comprehensive array of today's new global security challenges-illuminating every important issue of the day related to international peace and stability, from crucial new areas such as the security consequences of global warming and energy scarcity to perennial problems in the search for international peace and prosperity. Anyone looking to make an impact on international affairs should start here! (Robert Pape)I would rankGlobal Security in the Twenty-first Centuryas one of the finest textbooks on the market today for international security courses. It presents an innovative and effective balance of classic and contemporary dimensions of security. Another great asset is Kay's deft ability to combine theoretical approaches and policy-oriented questions and frameworks. His book offers an authoritative, thoughtful, and highly engaging discussion of critical issues in global security. (Jeffrey S. Lantis)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was followed By \"Evil in the Islands\" in 2006 and a second edition \"The Carnival Never Got Started Redux\" in 2008. He most recently published \"Of Daemons Possessed\" and \"The Story Teller Kindle.\" He is currently helping his wife with the publication of her cookbook \"Caribbean Cooking Made Simple\", a collection of recipes and stories she gathered over 25 years in the Caribbean.  The Story Teller is a collection of seven short stories by S.Guy Lovelace. The stories range in subject matter from re-incarnation in Love at First Sight to Marmey an allegory on the sadness of aging. Blood Brothers explores the true meaning of friendship. While The Entrepreneur, Harlan’s Gifts and The Stereopticon present radically different approaches to becoming wealthy. The Twelve Dollar Dinner provides comic relief, with an opportunity to chuckle at the miscues of a naïve young couple on their first time abroad.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Consider them as under copyright by my name, my pen-name, or mynom-du-blogof Sgt. Mom. One or two were written for contests or proposed anthologies, but did not make the cut. The first five were written almost immediately upon my retirement from military service, as homage to Rudyard Kipling'sSoldiers Threecycle, an attempt to put my military experience into perspective for myself, and to explain it to other people. I had even less luck than the usual freelance writer does in interesting a publisher of any sort in those stories - as it was extremely difficult to sort out what kind of publisher to take them to: a traditional military-oriented publication or to one oriented towards women's experiences? Not fitting into anything resembling a conventional pigeon-hole is something of an ongoing challenge, so I got no further with the Leroy-Orvis-Maculhaney cycle than working them into a play, at the request of a dear friend active in local theater, who loved the stories and the characters very much and constantly lamented the lack of strong roles for women in original plays. The finished play didn't get any farther than the stories got - so here they are, for the delectation of the reader. The last two stories are re-workings of episodes in myAdelsverein Trilogy, which I thought made interesting stand-alone stories in and of themselves. Having despaired of seeing them published on their own merits by others, as originally intended, I have resolved to make available in this way. Enjoy. I should add that I made all this up, mostly. Any resemblance in my characters to anyone, save certain historical persons who are mostly dead at this stage of the game, is purely coincidental. Really.

John Kennedy, Dr. Martin\nLuther King, and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was rather passive until my\nsister kick-started my research with one phone call. That phone call,\nthe same one our hero Tom Regan receives from his sister in THE OSWALD\nCONNECTION, led to me quitting my job, just like Regan does in the book,\n and sent me on a trip across the western part of the country in search\nof real answers, just like Regan takes in the book. My story and his\ntook place at the same time. All of what I did on my trip is in the book\n with some action thrown in for entertainment value. Regan's mother was\nplayed by mother, and she loved being in the book. The character Hewitt\nwas played by my older brother. Actually, I crossed my brother with\nTruman Capote to come up with Hewitt. I used my brother's home as\nHewitt's. Same brother is also an author. Check out his books. Same last\n name. Milt Harrod, the editor of the newspaper in Phoenix, was a cross\nbetween actor John Randolph and a real life editor that I didn't meet\nuntil a few years after I wrote the book. Yes, that's right. I didn't\nmeet him until 4 years AFTER I wrote the book. My writing career is full\n of things like that. First one of those ODD events came with my first\nbook, THE LEGEND OF EAGLE CLAW. I put the hero's pre-Columbian Indian\nvillage at a bend in the Grand River in Michigan, just outside Grand\nRapids. I wrote the book in 1974. In 1975, a pre-Columbian Indian\nvillage was discovered on the very spot I had placed my hero's. Can you\nsay Twilight Zone? Nearly every book I've written has some paranormal\nthing about it, including this one. You see, I wrote this book BEFORE\nthe House Assassinations Committee Investigation.

A sensitive and thorough writer, Maggie Hamilton provides a solid overview of mens challenges from the time theyre conceived to late adulthood. The research will promote more empathy than men usually get. Credit for much of this impact goes to narrators Dino Marnika, who delivers quotes with great sensitivity from the men interviewed, and Marie-Louise Walker, who handles the rest of the program with a lovely speaking style and audible respect for the material.

He practised as a solicitor in Edinburgh 1840-45, after which he went to London and became head of the firm of Martin and Leslie, parliamentary agents. His first contribution to literature was the humorous Bon Gaultier Ballads, written along with W.E. Aytoun, which remained popular for a long time; originally contributed to a magazine, they appeared in book form in 1845. Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London Martin's translations include Dante's Vita Nuova, Oehlenschläger's Correggio and Aladdin, Heinrich Heine's Poems and Ballads, Friedrich Schiller's Wilhelm Tell, and Hertz's King René's Daughter.[1] He also published a complete translation of Horace with a Life, and one of Catullus. He is probably best known for his Life of the Prince Consort (1874-80), the writing of which was entrusted to him by Queen Victoria, a work which won him her lifelong friendship. He also wrote Lives of Professor Aytoun and Lord Lyndhurst. In 1851 he married Helena Faucit, a well-known actress, and authoress of studies on Shakespeare's Female Characters, whose Life he published in 1901. The couple lived for some time at Bryntysilio {The Hill of St. Tyssilio} which he bought in 1861, near Llangollen, where in 1889 they were visited by the queen during her progress in Wales. Martin kept up his intellectual activity into old age, published in 1905 a translation of Leopardi's poems, and Monographs (1906). He was Lord Rector of St. Andrews 1881, LL.D. of Edinburgh 1875, and K.C.B. 1880. He died in 1909 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Whilst gifted  academically and musically, she was not encouraged to  further her  talents by attending university, and instead joined the  civil service  in Scotland as an assistant press officer. In 1946, she  married  Alastair Dunnett, who was at the time the chief press officer to  the  Secretary of State for Scotland. He went on to become editor of The   Scotsman newspaper, whilst she later worked on a statistics handbook   for the Board of Trade. After a brief spell in Glasgow, the couple   settled in Edinburgh where their home became a centre for hospitality   and entertaining, mostly in support of Scottish art and culture. Dunnett   had also taken evening classes at the Edinburgh College of Art and the   Glasgow School of Art, and from 1950 onwards she established a  prominent  career as a portrait painter, being exhibited at both the  Royal  Scottish Academy and the Royal Academy. She was also an  accomplished  sculptress. Her interest in writing developed during the  1950's. Her own  tastes took her to historical novels and it was her  husband who  eventually suggested she write one of her own, after she  had complained  of running out of reading material. The result was The  Game of Kings, an  account of political and military turmoil in  sixteenth-century  Scotland. Whilst turned down for publication in the  UK, it was  eventually published in the USA where it became an instant  best seller.  Other titles, such as the Lymond Chronicles and House of  Niccolo series  followed and which established her international  reputation. She also  successfully turned her hand to crime, with the  Johnson Johnson series.  He is an eccentric artist, famous for bifocals,  and of course amateur  detective. All of the titles in the series  somehow also feature the  yacht 'Dolly', despite ranging widely in  location from Scotland, to  Ibiza, Rome, Marrakesh, Canada, Yugoslavia,  Madeira and The Bahamas.  There is plenty of sailing lore for the  enthusiast, but not so much it  detracts from the stories genre; crime.  Each of them is told by a woman  whose profession explains her role in  the mystery and we learn very  little about Johnson himself, save for  the fact he is somewhat  dishevelled in appearance.", "related": [], "rank": 1210020, "title": "Roman Nights (Johnson Johnson Book 4)", "author": "Dorothy Dunnett", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Then one of her best girlfriends who had always accepted me and who had a gift for putting me at ease told me. She bluntly said to me, Nancy saw something in you Thomas. When we talked, she would tell us girls that you had a quality in your voice and it was like Poetry. Did I, it was kind of her to say so; it pulled me back from the sorrowful edges and help me to focus again. On a winter Sunday morning, I wrote my first poem. It was about burning an old Apple tree in a beautiful grand fireplace and going outside in the cold raw wind to watch the smoke come up the chimney. I guess that is when I learned that words are capable of healing as well as hurting us.

Husserl's phenomenology is thereby articulated as a single unified structure, and a notion of the ethical emerges, which grounds the activities of making epistemological claims, and provides criteria for metaphysical claims about what there is and its modes of givenness. Intuition, as given in Husserl's principle of all principles, takes on the guise of a categorical imperative to take responsibility for making sense.

Maspero still remains the Handbook of Egyptian Archaeology. But Egyptology is as yet in its infancy; whatever their age, Egyptologists will long die young. Every year, almost every month, fresh material for the study is found, fresh light is thrown upon it by the progress of excavation, exploration, and research. Hence it follows that, in the course of a few years, the standard text-books require considerable addition and modification if they are to be of the greatest value to students, who must always start from the foremost vantage-ground.The increasing demand for theEgyptian Archaeologyby English and American tourists, as well as students, decided the English publishers to issue a new edition in as light and portable a form as possible. This edition is carefully corrected, and contains the enlarged letterpress and many fresh illustrations necessary for incorporating within the book adequate accounts of the main archaeological results of recent Egyptian excavations. M. Maspero has himself revised the work, indicated all the numerous additions, and qualified the expression of any views which he has seen reason to modify in the course of his researches during the past eight years. By the headings of the pages, the descriptive titles of the illustrations, and a minute revision of the index, much has been done to facilitate the use of the volume as a book of reference.Each Week we will be adding exciting new additions to our E-book Sections.  Check back frequently so you don't miss these much loved stories at fantastic savings.", "related": ["B00KTJPDPO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dombek's book provides a scenario familiar to anyone aware of the controversy surrounding genetically modified organisms and commercial biological engineering: A rural animal-husbandry research facility has another, more hidden agenda. Where one might expect an action-adventure thriller about a stolen solution for world hunger or perhaps a viral weapon created by a rogue intelligence cell, Dombek's fictional ABLINC company goes beyond its mission to engineer a bioweapon that renders the enemy docile. How the bioweapon affects its victims, and how that could change the world form the spine of the narrative. The ante is raised when a mysterious rival company-GHOST-takes a surreptitious interest. After GHOST begins nosing around, loyalties fall into question. No one is above suspicion. The stakes of the game escalate as it's understood that ABLINC may have invented a miracle: a world without violence. Dombek's characters are roughly hewn. The dialogue crackles, and the plot speeds along. From its eye-catching title to its provocative penultimate chapter, the author clearly intends a brash, dynamic story that takes no prisoners. A good selection for fans of high-tech thrillers, adventure novels and near-future sci-fi. Fast-paced adventure with an unusual premise.", "related": ["B00K4JESUK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this brilliant and engaging book about culture and the interstices that comprise the grounds for our interactions, Adrian Holliday shows us the necessity for a cosmopolitan process that expands the basis of our intercultural work. This is a compelling book that should be read by scholars and the general public alike. It is accessible, factual, and clearMolefi Kete AsanteProfessor, Department of African American Studies at Temple University and author of 'Erasing Racism: The Survival of the American Nation'Adrian Holliday’s highly readable and thought provoking volume is a welcome addition to the existing body of work on Intercultural Communication and Ideology. The rich dataset and analysis of well selected excerpts challenge essentialistic understandings of the notion of culture and linguistic behaviour. With its comprehensive coverage of studies in the field and critical discussion of dominant theoretical paradigms, this refreshing book provides a valuable resource for both students and experienced researchers but also everyone interested in Intercultural Communication. An authoritative and open minded book the field will embraceJo AngouriSenior Lecturer in Linguistics and Intercultural Communication, University of the West of England, BristolFor interculturalists who feel limited by the essentialistic constraints of the individualismllectivism divide and by the West's propensity to define culture as nationality, Intercultural Communication and Ideology offers a refreshing and more complex frame for analyzing and theorizing intercultural communication. Advocating a critical cosmopolitan approach as analytical frame, Holliday attends to the influence of ideology and the marginalization of non-Western cultural realities typical within traditional schools of thought in intercultural communication studies.  A must read for those interested in understanding and analyzing  intercultural interactions in more complex ways than offered by traditional Western perspectivesDreama G.

The main character Jean is grinding through her job, trying to raise money for her films, and sagging under the burden of a husband who was once a \"vital passionate young man\" and is now an \"aging, empty vessel.\" Jean remedies her lifeless marriage by drafting e-mailing to a former flame Doug but never presses send. Then she meets a man named Benjamin Kraft at a bar on a business trip who offers up his number. When he doesn't return her text later on, Jean searches the Internet for him, improbably concluding he is a criminal, maybe a murderer. More and more enticed, Jean hires a private investigator to track him. Ben finally returns her second text and they meet. Neiderhoffer delivers pitch-perfect micro-renderings of human behavior throughout: describing \"carnivores posing as vegans\" in a bar, and \"near-misses at wit\" during a flirtation. But the strength of the novel is in Niederhoffer's ability to do this on a larger scale. She intricately portrays her dynamic protagonist as slightly unstable and only sort of self-aware.

The victim is the missing wife of a wealthy local businessman, but the person who discovered her body is Christie’s longtime enemy, Steve Flynn, a former cop accused of raking off the proceeds of a drug deal. He fled the country despite being cleared of the crime but has come back to help a dying friend. Although Henry hoped never to set eyes on Flynn again, he realizes that his old enemy could prove useful. As Henry unravels the case clue by painstaking clue, he uncovers some very unpleasant facts, but nothing can prepare him for the discovery that some of his closest colleagues may be involved. As usual, Oldham offers up an action-filled, high-octane plot with plenty of crazy twists and turns, but it’s his Henry Christie character who makes this series a real standout. --Emily Melton", "related": ["B0078XFXMW"], "rank": 2249399, "title": "Fighting for the Dead (A Henry Christie Mystery Book 18)", "author": "Nick Oldham", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Could productivity gains acquired in one part of an organization be transferred to another?   These are among the questions addressed inOrganizational Learning: Creating, Retaining and Transferring Knowledge.  Since its original publication in 1999, this book has set the standard for research and analysis in the field.  This fully updated and expanded edition showcases the most current research and insights, featuring a new chapter that provides a theoretical framework for analyzing organizational learning and presents evidence about how the organizational context affects learning processes and outcomes. Drawing from a wide array of studies across the spectrum of management, economics, sociology, and psychology,Organizational Learningexplores the dynamics of learning curves in organizations, with particular emphasis on how individuals and groups generate, share, reinforce, and sometimes forget knowledge.  With an increased emphasis on service organizations, including healthcare, Linda Argote demonstrates that organizations vary dramatically in the rates at which they learn—with profound implications for productivity, performance, and managerial and strategic decision making.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story line came to me at a point in my life where I had nothing to read and my local book exchange seemed to have run out of any paranormal romances. So it though 'hey, I will just write my own!'I love seeing twins and triplets, and am totally fascinated by them, so it was no surprise when I decided to make my vampires all triplets. What a challenge! I also decided that I would make my vampires society a female warrior society because there was a great shortage of men. Go girl power!I have to say I was totally taken by surprise by the existence of a 5000 year of prophecy when I got halfway through the book! It took much scrambling and character interviews to ascertain where 'they' were going with this, but in the end it all worked out well.I love my male characters. They are strong and macho, but also have a gentler side that they are never afraid to show. They can be soft and cuddly or rough and though, and they don't mind bowing down to the strong women in their lives.I decided to name all my triplets after the same thing, for example, my main character Sable, is named after black, so her sisters in her set are named Ebony (black) and Raven (black). I cannot begin to explain to you how difficult it was to find three 'nice' names for the same thing. If you want to know any other names, you have to read my book.

My flying background is reflected in this book, too, since I have\nthe chance to guide the captain in the preparation of the spaceship for major\nmaneuvers, which explains some of the detailed checklists the crew uses. The\nair-turbine-motor (ATM) is a major plot-builder, and it entertains similar\ncharacteristics to the ATM I'm familiar with on the C-130 Hercules military\ntransport, an aircraft which I'm intimately acquainted. All-in-all, the\ncharacters did what they're supposed to do in a successful novel -- they took\ncharge as I wrote this book.

Late one night as a teenager on top of a mountain, a sighting and event as an unexplainable occurrence undid his conventional mind and led him to question everything. This happening put him on a trajectory that led to his relationships with some of the teachers that helped to provide answers to what had happened.  Dr. Christopher Hills, Steven S. Sadleir, Tony Robbins, Doc Childre and The Hoffman Institute have been just a few of the personal influences that have inspired Landon Andrews to produce his own creative work that would incite change and collective awakening. For classification purposes the book has been categorized as Science Fiction but his own in depth experiences and analysis challenge us all to entertain a different perspective that might reveal to the reader that the program we have been downloaded with is indeed more of a fiction than the tale itself. Landon is currently launching his \"Sovereign Global Manifest\" on line and is planning a worldwide book tour.

The Ice Woman Assignment is a thriller following psychically linked business partners Morgan Stark and Felicity O'Brien as they enter a security venture and find themselves against the rise of Ice, a drug being trafficked by a pair of brothers with their own psychic gifts. The Ice Woman Assignment is a keenly exciting adventure, highly recommended. --Midwest Book ReviewThe Ice Woman is one of those rare books that does a lot of things and all of them well. Austin Camacho's sizzling tale smoothly blends action-adventure with the paranormal in a book that rivals Stephen King's Firestarter or John Farris' The Fury for power and relevance. As blisteringly original as it is wondrously structured, The Ice Woman is a one-sitting read that is not to be missed. --Jon Land, bestselling author of Pandora's TempleTake Ed McBain, Mickey Spillane, and a dash of Lawrence Block and what do you get? Austin Camacho! And Camacho means non-stop action, inside knowledge of military procedures and the world of the FBI & DEA. Camacho knows how to keep us turning pages with the deft hand of a master at action and adventure with heroes that make Bond a boyscout by comparison. The Ice Woman Assignment is the 4th installment of the Stark & O'Brien Series, and it provides more entertainment than a Magician Convention in Vegas; a truly adult roller-coaster if ever there was one. --Robert W.

Mark did not tell anyone about this event until four years ago, and only now has he truly understood why this happened to him. He was invited to a very powerful healing group who recognised his gifts, leading him on to his psychic and healing paths by some of the most powerful psychics, healers and teachers in the world. Mark knew this was his path and he has never looked back. Mark is known as one of the most kind, gifted psychic and powerful healers on the Costa Del Sol coast in Spain where he currently lives.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With a large selection of books garnering impressive reviews, Steve's output is diverse, sometimes thought-provoking, entertaining, and always interesting.   Working within the Independent market gives Steve the freedom to explore some unusual ideas and avoid being pigeon-holed. Without the marketing resources of a mainstream publisher, readers have to search out Steve's work but once they have, they usually stick around to see what's coming next.   FICTION:  Steve's fiction aims to take the reader to some very dark places. Frequently bordering on horror, these stories involve intense research to really bring the subject matter to life. From the high seas to the barren desert, from the heat of the jungle to the icy depths of space, the locations are skilfully presented and often become characters in their own right. There are dozens of unforgettable characters scattered throughout Steve's fictional worlds, including a poor, mistreated dog (A Dog's Life), a ferocious whaling captain (The Whaler), a child-murdering skeleton with a love for gardening (Crackly Bones), a tight-knit gang of dangerous bank robbers (People of the Sun), a psychotic, pyromaniac baby (Bebe) and even a talking spider (The Farda). There is often a sense of humour within Steve's stories, even during the darkest moments.

Howard, but I chose to write Heroic Fantasy because of my affection for the adventure classics.  Books like The Three Musketeers, Captain Blood, and Scaramouche that I read in my youth, have stayed with me to this day.These works, and others like them, are so much more than swashbuckling adventures.  Their depth of character, romance, and style make them literary tales at their very core, even as they take your breath away with deeds of derring-do.  The weight of words, and the truth of story found in these classics force you to take them seriously, and at the same time the author's sense of humor shines through the lattice of drama.  This makes for great reading.  I can only hope that one day my own work will reflect the passion I hold for this kind of literature.", "related": ["B00K4MGC4W"], "rank": 29171, "title": "Call of the Flame (Knights of the Flaming Blade Book 1) eBook", "author": "James R.

I'm hoping that the book will connect with people with a love of music in general, and/or who are inquisitive and just want to learn more about the music they enjoy listening to.    I believe that a large part of the enjoyment that can be derived from listening to music and other entertainment forms is the social interactions that accompany them. Reading a great book, watching a great movie, or listening to good music are all far more satisfying when we share our experiences with others. Through our discussions with our friends, we come to a deeper understanding of what we read, hear and see. Music in particular has the power to transform our thinking, and even to change the world. In the Elusive Genius Project, I have aimed to communicate that sense of wonder and power that music has.    Although the book is closely based upon certain albums from rock history, in a way the albums themselves are not important. You can substitute your own favourite music. So it isn't important that readers share my particular taste in music! I hope you can enjoy simply following Rupert on his journey of self discovery through music, and enjoy reading how he negotiates his way through the various hurdles that Walter De Greu has laid for him. It was important for me in writing the book that, even if the reader has little or no knowledge of the music described in the book, that they can read the story as a simple old fashioned adventure story. Above all I wanted the book to be fun to read.    I had a lot of fun writing the book despite the fact that writing it was a huge undertaking. I have two young children and a full time occupation after all! But overall I really enjoyed the process. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading my book and I look forward to making connections with readers in the future! Please feel free to email me to discuss the book or make suggestions or comments. Thank you and enjoy!", "related": ["B00FA1MZA2"], "rank": 4477607, "title": "The Elusive Genius Project", "author": "Steve Getto", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His matter of fact way of speaking is what makes this a scary read.The book is written in a stylized format which makes it a pretty fast, yet intense read. Be prepared to be affected by it.

The text takes readers step-by-step through the basics for achieving success. From the beginning, the author urges students to set reachable goals and priorities that focus on creating adequate time for study and test preparation. Sample weekly schedules and different note-taking tips are nicely outlined in examples and diagrams. Students are shown how to create individualized study guides from their notes or from teacher-supplied guides. Though getting enough sleep is mentioned several times, the sample schedules fall short of the National Sleep Foundation's recommended 8.5 to 9.5 hours per night for adolescents. Useful hints for dealing with challenging teachers and school assignments are also covered. Struggling students who are determined to make improvements will also find the book helpful.–Elaine Baran Black, Georgia Public Library Service, Atlantaα(c) Copyright 2013.

There are all sorts of ecommerce sites on the web. Why do so many of your books focus specifically on eBay?Answer. I think eBay offers the best shot for new sellers to gain traction selling online. eBay is easy to get started selling on; it has a built in customer base of over 250 million eager buyers; and you can sell just about anything.Question: That last part is the million dollar question, what are the best things to sell on eBay if you want to make money?Answer: That's the great thing about eBay. It really doesn't matter what you sell. There are so many people on the site, with so many interests, that you can sell just about anything if you package it right.Question: Can you give us a few examples?Answer: Think cell phones, consumer electronics, and video games. eBay has hundreds of sellers moving these same items. The problem is these are almost impossible fields to compete in. You're up against the likes of Best Buy and the other big box giants.Question: So what do you do?Answer: Smart sellers narrow their focus down and serve a niche.     Do you service and sell used cell phones? There's a huge market for refurbished phones on eBay. If you have a ready source of phones, and can restore them to factory settings you're going to do well.     Let me give you another example. My Kindle went crazy last fall and wouldn't charge. None of the computer stores in town wanted to look at it. The one guy I did find who was willing to give it a shot wanted eighty bucks, but he wouldn't guarantee anything. I searched eBay and found a guy who would reset the charger stem (return postage included) for $34.95. When I checked his feedback he was doing a booming business, and he wasn't the only one. Five other sellers were thriving doing the same thing.     In my case, I take old magazines libraries and book stores are begging to get rid and harvest articles and pictures from them that sell for twenty to fifty dollars each. In fourteen years of doing it, I've made over thirty thousand sales.Question: But aren't there too many sellers already? How can the average guy hope to find a new niche that will make them money? Isn't it a little like finding the proverbial needle in the haystack?Answer: Ideas are all around you?     Do you run a local screen print shop? You can do short orders of six, twelve or twenty-five t-shirts and cater to the small business market. Are you an artist? Open up an eBay store and put your masterpieces out there for a larger market to find. Is there a local business in your area that everybody just loves? Test the waters and put a few of their products on eBay.     If you're really at a loss for what to sell, take a drive around town; open up the phone book; follow your kids around for a day and listen to what gets them excited.Question: Earlier you mentioned you can sell anything if you package it right. What did you mean by that?Answer: You've got to be creative in your listings. That means crafting awesome titles loaded with keywords; your pictures need to showcase what you're selling and make people want to buy it; you're item description needs to make customers drool for more.     I keep thinking back to a designer I use on Fiverr. She describes her book covers as being so realistic customers will want to reach out and lick them. Are auction listing so enticing customers will want to lick them. If not, you probably want to go back to the drawing board.Final Question: What's the best way to get started?Answer:  Dive in head first. So many people talk about what they want to do. They put all of these obstacles in their way. I'll do it when I can spare a thousand dollars. I'll start when I'm on vacation next summer and have the time to do it right. I need to get more information before I get started.    Listen to me. That's all a bunch of horse-hockey we tell ourselves to keep from trying. The best way to start doing something is to do it. Make a few mistakes. Who cares?     Read my books. Learn how to sell on eBay. Whatever you do, don't over think it. It's not rocket science.     What's the worst you can do? Loose a few bucks. Maybe make a few extra bucks. You'll never know until you give it a shot.", "related": [], "rank": 2496732, "title": "Sell It Online 2", "author": "Nick Vulich", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her first big break was interviewing the junior high school custodian – and she’s had an interesting career ever since. Pat wrote for her high school and college newspapers, then after getting her Master of Journalism while at UCLA decided to concentrate on television news. After nearly a decade of on-camera anchoring and reporting, Pat put her reporting skills, judgment and experience to work in corporate America, specializing in media relations and handling many significant events. She was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal and appeared on NBC’s “Today” show among hundreds of national and international media and trade press while serving as the corporate worldwide media spokesperson for a multibillion-dollar product recall that involved more than 600 lawsuits. Even after she left the company, she was deposed three times.  Based on that experience, Pat has authored “Deposition vs. Root Canal: Preparation Techniques to Make Dental Work the Only Painful Experience” available in paperback and e-book formats. In Houston, Pat established her own PR firm before she and her husband transferred to Washington, D.C., and she became vice president of communications for a major trade association.  After several years and seeking a change of pace, she moved to Las Vegas and was the public relations manager for a famous Strip hotel and casino. Pat likened walking through the casino every day to get to her office as being a “kid in a candy store.” Pat then returned to television, where she wrote, produced and hosted a number of programs connecting citizens and their government through Clark County TV.  Now Pat focuses her skills as a full-time professional speaker. Based on her many years of working for a variety of types of employers, she speaks about “Fitting In: for Square Pegs in the Round Holes of Life.” And, from years of being an accomplished writer and proofreader, Pat offers an entertaining and humorous look at “The Trouble with ‘Typoes,’ Grammar Goofs and Sloppy Spelling: Mistakes Can Cost Millions and Muddy Your Message.”  “Fitting In” and “The Trouble with ‘Typoes’” are available in paperback and as e-books.    In her spare time, Pat is president of Doberman Rescue of Nevada, a non-profit organization dedicated to rehoming this noble breed into the forever homes they richly deserve.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Born in the West Indies, Diane immigrated to England in her early twenties. She studied nursing at Kingston University in London from 2007 to 2010. She has wanted to be a nurse for as long as she can remember. Her hobbies include taking long walks, listening to music, singing, cooking, helping others, and writing. The inspiration for writing this book came from her experiences while working as a nurse. She has a great passion in caring for people, and it gives her pleasure to see them become well again. Diane is soft spoken, and some would describe her as timid. However, by writing this book she feels that her voice can be heard. She does not allow her dyslexia to stop her from achieving her life's goals, and her belief in God has always been the source of her strength.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Faced with incredible circumstances, together they overcame the challenges before them. As their family grew, so did the cherished memories and friendships that will always remain with them. Alaska bestowed Her free spirit upon them, strengthened their character and gave them lasting self-reliance.

Familiar characters from the Super Human series make brief appearances, but this fourth entry is about the notably unsuper but nonetheless wily Lance and his attempts to escape from Max’s control. Getting inside the mind of a con man isn’t easy, and by design Carroll keeps readers at arm’s length from Lance as he ages him from 14 to 27 years, focusing on action rather than self-reflection. A flurry of odd jobs (including time in a carnival), a brief romantic fling, and an intriguing epilogue make this appealing to all sorts of readers, and as always, Carroll delivers a super story.

Unfortunately, I don’t possess the temperament to be happy or successful teaching in a traditional classroom setting, so I have always found other ways to fulfill my perceived vocation. For many years, I developed and presented workshops on topics as varied as personal budgeting, leadership development and catechism. Someone once pointed out to me that storytelling is the most powerful and well-received form of teaching. That’s one reason that Jesus, among other great teachers, used it so liberally and to such effect. Since that time, I have dreamed of coming up with an entertaining and inspiring story that would allow me to share some of the life lessons I’ve learned. In particular, I wanted to tell a story that would elucidate the role of gratitude in creating and living a joyful life. Since I Last Saw You is the result of that desire. Thanksgiving—the most underappreciated holiday on the American calendar, in my opinion—seemed like a perfect backdrop for such a tale, and is featured prominently in my novel. It’s my hope and my dream that Since I Last Saw You becomes a holiday tradition— a story that readers will want to revisit year after year and share with their families—much in the way that watching It’s a Wonderful Life is for me.  … Author Alice Ann Kuder writes both fiction and non-fiction. Her essays have been published in the Seattle Times and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. As the Telltale Scribe, Kuder interviews individuals from the Greatest Generation—those who grew up during the Depression, then survived World War II— and has written mini-biographies for their loved ones.

Along the way I learned new ways of looking at the world, participated in a few magikal rituals, and made some friends who might just attend my funeral one of these days. But part of what I learned pointed to deeper questions of free will and ethics that don't fit cleanly into newspaper features. Such as, what if Aleister Crowley's controversial maxim \"Do What Thous Wilt Shall Be The Whole Of The Law\" actually describes the underlying truth of human existence? And while modern Wiccans live by The Threefold Law (mistreat someone magikally and three times the bad stuff will bounce back on you), more experienced witches will occasionally speak candidly (if privately) on the often-renounced slogan \"Who Cannot Hex Cannot Heal.\" In other words, at the deeper levels of mystical practice, there lie ethical quandaries that are probably best left alone when speaking to initiates and Internet dabblers.That's upsetting to a lot of 21st century Westerners. We like our religion grand and benign, our ethics pristine, abstract and remote.But to really get a taste of the situational ethics that arise beyond the boundaries of our artificially constructed public morality, imagine a world in which there are no armies and police forces to protect the public order. No drones, judges and contractors. Just you, your community, and all the various threats that life presents.How do you integrate those real-world choices -- and actions -- into our cool Western philosophies?No religious system deals more explicitly with those issues than the Haitian voodooo society described by Wade Davis in his classic non-fiction book,The Serpent and the Rainbow. Voodoo takes care of its own in Haiti, and that's a good thing, since the rest of the world has been treating the country like shit from the moment the slaves there overthrew their vicious French captors and declared themselves a free republic in 1804. Bokurisn't a story about religion or history. It's a fantasy entertainment about people loosed from the constrictions of their default ideas of ethics and morality, a story that takes place at the intersection of abstract rules, secret dreams, and practical consideration. Plus it's a story where sex advances the plot, rather than putting it on hold. Which, you know, is kinda fun. But at its foundation, the story plays with the same questions you confront whenever you dip beneath of the surface of any magikal system. What if we are, all of us, truly free? What if we live a universe without an arbiter, unconstrained by judgment or punishment, bound only by consequence?That might make for one hell of a party.", "related": ["B00GL9XQ0U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She illustrated these stories as well, even though now she admits she can’t draw. Her parents would buy her extra school notebooks to write her stories in and her favourite place to write was under the carport during a rainstorm. She would sit at the picnic table and write for hours during summer storms. While still in high school, Serenity had nearly finished writing a full length novel. Unfortunately, the notebook fell out of her backpack during her Junior year (she believes on the bus) and was never found. Devastated, she turned from writing and threw herself into drama. For many years she participated in school musicals and community theater. She even had a very small (uncredited) part in the 2001 Tim Burton film \"Planet of the Apes\". She did get to meet Burton though and said he was \"eccentric but very nice\". She also did some modeling in the past few years and continues to pursue that venue as well. During this time she began writing again for an online RPG game based on the show \"La Femme Nikita\" (one of her favourite shows of all time). Slowly, she began to have ideas for her own stories again but always found that the middle of the story was missing. She wrote the beginning and left it until her block was defeated. In 2013, Serenity started writing again full force. Serenity is the wife of an author. She is mum to 3 boys, currently aged 20, 16 and 2. Serenity graduated from Cerro Coso Community College in 2002 with two Associates Degrees in Social Sciences and Humanities, then went on to graduate in 2005 from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelors in Psychology and a minor in Latin American/Latino Studies. She is a proud Banana Slug and a proud sister of Sigma Pi Alpha Sorority. In the little free time she has between family and writing, she enjoys gardening, reading, crafting things, henna art, and watching such shows as \"Burn Notice\", \"Covert Affairs\", \"Warehouse 13\", \"Law & Order SVU\", \"Kitchen Nightmares\" and others.", "related": ["B00DQGN0ZC"], "rank": 3292393, "title": "The Fantastical Life of Serenity", "author": "Serenity Valle", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Williams (LRW) fell in love with writing at age 12 and married it at 18. From the moment she began penciling down thoughts and ideas in her first diary, and then formally learning how to compose essays and pieces of fiction during her high school and college years, she knew that she would someday have an opportunity to share her gift with the world. Her given name was perhaps a foreshadowing of the works she would produce to establish herself in history as a Literary Trailblazer.  After graduating from Florida State University in December of 2008, LRW set out to build her professional writing portfolio by pitching stories and carrying out reporting assignments for various publications. She is now well-known as a Motivational Poet, Devoted Freelance Writer, Skilled Editor, Independent Publisher and Bestselling Author (Amazon & UBAWA: Urban Books Authors and Writers of America). Her published catalog as an author includes: Amateur Thoughts: A Personal Collection of iWrite Poetry & LRW Quotes (12/12/12) Amazon Bestseller, Dearly Beloved S.I.S.T.A.S (Fiction Novel - 9/21/13) UBAWA Top 100 Books of 2013, Words from the Write Side of My Heart (Poetry - 12/25/13), LIVE YOUR DREAM: How to Set and Accomplish Deadline-Driven Goals (Nonfiction Guide - 4/1/14), Spelling B (Children's Book - August 2014) and Date Knight: A Man Who Findeth A Wife (Romance Novel - 12/13/14). In the process of developing her inspirational LIVE YOUR DREAM movement and expanding her entrepreneurial knowledge, LRW originated a unique term to define her purpose--#WriterGrind: a strategic quest to accomplish various writing objectives while striving to conquer the demands of authorship. She believes that anything is possible with the determined mindset of Effort, Perseverance and Faith. In her own words, \"If you're living without giving, your talents are null and void.\"", "related": [], "rank": 2819881, "title": "Words from the Write Side of My Heart eBook", "author": "Liltera R.

So, why am I offering it separately?I get notes from readers sometimes, and I pay attention to reviews. Looking at everything together, I'd say at least half of the comments made on this series are some variation of how much people like Jenner -- the evil, sadistic lieutenant-slash-psychiatrist who has a main role in every House Phoenix book, and serves as a pretty direct counterpoint to Gabriel, the \"other\" main character.Can't say I'm displeased with that. I'm pretty fond of Jenner, myself -- I love a good antihero.Therefore, I decided that for the people who enjoy reading about Jenner, I'd put up his story all by itself. This way you don't have to bother with all those other non-Jenner stories in the anthology (although the other long-ish story inOriginsis about Jenner, too).Thanks so much for reading. I hope you enjoy this twisted little tale.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As an Author, I try to keep my stories as tasteful as possible while still remaining true to my characters. The men in my stories are over the top Alpha males, who will do anything to get the woman that they have set their sights set on. If any of these things offend you, then this is not the series for you.  I do not write stories that leave you hanging in hopes of you having to buy the next book. My stories are complete and will not leave you feeling as if you were forced into buying a sequel. Though my books come in series, each book is capable of standing alone and can be read without having to go through a numerical sequence. I also go out of my way to keep my pricing fair to the reader, because these books are 'self-published' and they are not as long as a standard published book would be. I chose to self-publish these fiction books in order to build up a fan base. As is the case of any other writer, I am growing and learning daily. I am constantly researching and studying in order to better myself for the people who enjoy my books. As my fan base grows and finances come along with that growth, I can promise my readers the traditional published and edited books. Though I am not a world renowned Author, I do have a very vivid imagination and the capability to tell a very emotive and provoking story. I look forward to growing with you and for you, because in my world it is all about you the reader. I hope that you enjoy reading my stories as much as I enjoyed writing them for you.", "related": ["B00L1M0AH4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
