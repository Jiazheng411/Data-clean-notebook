Beset by tragedy—his wife was murdered and, later, Byronys twin, Reuben, was accidentally killed by bullies—Terence focuses all his energy on Byrony, but when she begins sneaking out to meet boys, Terences stepped-up efforts to thwart her behavior backfire, and soon shes seeing one of the boys involved in Reubens death. As Terences drive to protect rapidly morphs into a dangerous obsession, his dead sons spirit begins to haunt him, and Bryony pulls further away from her weird, creepy fascist father. The themes of possession and control are pounded out repeatedly, and Terence seems like a construct more than a person, coming off as repellant rather than complex and troubled. What could have been an original look at human relationships unfortunately devolves into a heavy-handed study.(Mar.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Refresh your faith in the God of miracles. That's what this book is about. God doing extraordinary things for ordinary people.  In a time of anxiety and uncertainty, these stories reveal the surprising power of God's love for you. Bestselling author Ann Spangler shines a light on the God who is far bigger and more merciful than you think ... the God who deeply cares about you ... the God who generously offers the help you seek. Whether you are sitting before a cozy fire or taking a break in your frenzied day, reading these devotions will help you draw closer to the only One who is capable of being your refuge in every kind of trouble. Each reflection will remind you that, even in the midst of life's challenges, one thing remains true: You belong to a God who is eager and able to care for you with wisdom, kindness, and unfailing mercy.  Drawn from Ann's previously published works An Angel a Day and A Miracle a Day, these devotions open with a Bible verse and close with a prayer.

In a sort of riff onA Christmas Carol, Jacob Noah, a Holocaust survivor turned wealthy Dutch businessman, dies in a 1980 car accident near the town of Assen in the Netherlands. On the same night, the town is home to a massive rave, and this breakneck party forms the backdrop for Noah's peregrinations with the ghostly Jew of Assen, who takes dead Noah on a tour of the loved ones he lost contact with during his financial rise. On the same night, celibate intellectual Marcus Kopla has one last chance to win back Noah's daughter, Chaja, and though the fates of the two men don't intersect, they are linked by their love for Chaja. The novel is well conceived, and its free-form prose flows, but the characters don't come across, stripping the book of emotional impact and dramatic suspense. Moreover, the sprawling story's potentially intriguing historical and philosophical implications are never worked to their potential.(Mar.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Leaving behind a troubled relationship with her mother in America, young Maya enrolls at Hebrew University in tense Jerusalem shortly after the Gulf War. There she spends time with her older cousin Tami, an Israeli whose distressed relationships with her husband and grown son have followed a difficult girlhood with an emotionally distant mother of her own. As Maya tells the story of her love affair with an abusive Israeli veteran haunted by memories of his tour of duty on the West Bank, Kadish interpolates lyrical, psalmlike passages spoken by the inner voice of Shifra, an aged recluse and concentration camp survivor living in the apartment below Maya's. Shifra comes to think of the American girl as a sort of Messiah who will save her from the tormenting memories of her tragic past?an apotheosis made all the more ironic by the glowing letters home that Maya writes to cover up the violent, complex relationship in which she is trapped. In the end, redemption for these characters lies in having the courage to exit the \"sealed rooms\" of their fears and memories. Only Shifra falls beneath the burden of her past, but not before her brief, intense visits with Maya ensure that her strong voice survives in the girl. Kadish draws her characters with fine compassion, psychological penetration and attention to detail.

It's not your standard adventure yarn, nor is it a survivor tale filled with moments of high anxiety. In this book, which has The Raven (an airplane) crashing near a deserted island, a young man and a pre-pubescent girl are the only survivors. The way they find a way to eke out a living and to continue to hope for rescue is infectious and endlessly intriguing. But it isn't until the psychological drama begins that the book gathers speed. As they await for help to arrive, the man becomes unavoidably attracted to the young girl, who runs around in a perfectly understandable state of undress. She is curious about him and he is tormented by her, until it seems the man's sanity will crack.  Without giving away the ending, this book thoroughly plums the soul of a sexually aware man who also is burdened with the yoke of cultural responsibility, resulting in a conflict so deep it threatens both characters.  The island scenes are interspersed with scenes of a more stiff-upper-lip scandal unfolding in London. It's an interesting foil to the drama unfolding on the island.  Coming from a small publisher, this book has some editing gaffes that a larger house would have tidied up. But don't let that stop you from enjoying this most penetrating look at sex, morals, and the business of living from day to day in a world perhaps not so different from our own. --L. BlumenthalThis book really surprised me, both in it's excellent writing style, and unusual content. A bit reminiscent of Nabakov's Lolita in content, but at the same time, a really fresh, unusual, and surprisingly sensitive (if still disturbing) look at a relationship between an older man and a young girl. One of the strongest points of the novel is the phsycholological aspects of each character - I was amazed at the way the author really seemed to understand the pyschology of an [...]girl. And the way he makes you sympathetic to characters to whom your knee-jerk reaction would have otherwise been to judge as terrible. The reader becomes sympathetic to these characters, at the same time feeling disturbed for being so affected.  A sensitive and honest exploration of sexual discovery and human relations, this novel will if nothing else REALLY make you think. I read it some months ago, and still find myself thinking about it, hashing over certain situations, and, indeed, feeling disturbed about some of the events. Either way, I hadn't read such a thought provoking novel in a long time. It's sad that really innovative literature like this can't find a wider audience through mainstream publishing, but it is one that I hope eventually finds the note and recognition it deserves. --Dragos Anastasiu", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Unlike the haphazard tendencies of death and rebirth, however, his occasionally shocking language or subject matter are not without purpose--they shock you into seeing something differently, and, hopefully, into understanding a bit more of humanity's shared susceptibility to the whims of cycles that take no heed of worthiness or will for survival (Jessica A.

He's seen and caused plenty of carnage fighting Russians, but\nnothing prepares him for the camp, where trainloads of Jews, Poles and\nGypsies--\"material\" to the Nazis--are shipped in ostensibly to quarry granite,\nbut really for extermination. Through his eyes, Watkins sees a panorama of\nbarbarism... Watkin's meticulously\nresearched depiction of these horrors is matter-of-fact but grimly evocative.\n\"There was a shrieking inside the shower that sounded like wind in a tunnel,\"\nhe writes. Unbearable scenes of cruelty, mothers mourning or abandoning their\nchildren, prisoners killing each other over scraps of food or a last gasp of air:\n...\nOver the camp, like crematorium smoke, hangs the despair in knowing that every\nkindly human impulse amounts to nothing. As Peter struggles to retain a shred\nof decency, he becomes a revealing study in moral corruption. Although he\nconsiders himself better than his sadistic comrades--he beats and kills\nprisoners only when ordered--Peter flounders in ghastly ironies: ...With chilling realism and shrewd\npsychological insight, Watkins captures the hellish glow of inhumanity\nwillingly kept aflame by normalized evil. A shocking, disturbingly\nbelievable portrait of the Final Solution and the depravity that enabled it. Kirkus Reviews, February, 2012", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He did not commit the crime, but an assistant director pursuing him is a deadly mix of opportunist and sexual psychopath and is willing to kill and maim to hide the truth. The story comes to an exciting but not unexpected conclusion causing the listener to ponder the irony of law enforcement and how many innocent men and women may be caught up in events beyond their control. Villers's ability to move from a male to a female voice displays suitable versatility. This is a thrilling tale, with a human side that brings a deeper meaning to this audiobook.

Urgency is added to the investigation when other animals are slaughtered and whispers of witchcraft begin, aimed at the local Jewish community. Pieter fears for his wife, Racqel, a Jewish physician shunned by her people for marrying out of her faith. As Pieter uncovers evidence of religious mania and Racqel begins to resume contact with her people through her medical skills, an Indian linked to their past comes to their aid.

At the beginning of 2009 we decided to get married and this has proved to be a good decision as it has only served to bring us closer still. We have many interests in common but writing erotic fiction is a recent development for me. In the past I have only ever read other guys works but one day I decided that for once I would like to direct the plot. So what appeared to be a quick bash out on the keyboard for a couple of pages story proved to be the beginnings of an interesting new hobby and bringing pleasure to other readers of gay erotica.

It is a quintessential novel for all the Americas – north, central and south – from the top of Canada to the bottom of Chile.\" --Alan Twigg, BC Bookworld\"Everybody who is interested in the origins of today's South and Central America should read this very well researched novel about the conquest of Venezuela! It is remarkable how the author succeeds in connecting the reader to both the Indian and the Spanish side, and their very different ways of seeing the world. No other historic novel that I have read is as objective and historically accurate and personal at the same time.\" --Sabine ReihlThe first novel by Luisa Maria Celis could be included among the best modern historical accounts about white civilization meeting the innocent and paradisiacal culture of Indians in the New World. The foundation of the city of Caracas is the epopee of these men who risked lives and beliefs in search of the Unknown. But it is also the story of these \"savages\" - so human and close to every other people in the world - consciously facing the loss of their ancient world.Historical, scientific, and Natural documentation about the facts and epoch are impressive. The reader is transported in a few pages to the times of our ancestors and can feel as if being part of their lives. Descriptions are so vivid that can be recreated like a mental movie. This is one of the best achievements of this novel and what keeps the reader breathless to the end.Language, Spanish sayings so well translated into English and atmosphere between characters reflected in the book are the real portrait of the true people that even today can be found in Spain and South America.The always conflictive heritage of European settlements in the New World has its roots in these first exchanges in which the good will of a part of conquerors was overcome by war and economic interests of newborn nations struggling between the feudal customs and the new principles of human rights and modern revolutions.Arrowsleaves an open door to hope and mystery. We wait for a \"to be continued\".A must read for everyone curious about history and humankind.

The miners were followed by those who could sell their services, and thus the area known as Otago became a town. Its ancillary characters are the people Beverly Dunn tells about in her forceful, memorable reading. Dunn is Australian. The narration points to California and Scotland. When one arrives at the actual location of Otago, it is in New Zealand. Given this, and Dunn's pronounced Scottish burr, it is difficult at first to orient oneself to the story. Soon, however, we appreciate her diverse accents, and the burr becomes easier to understand. Dunn's desire to tell this story makes us want to hear it.

We must treat it as so. Logic dictates that if we are able to make a simple matchbox, with all the engineering and design involved, the machinery and the raw materials, such a simple object, then why didn't a matchbox show up on the chain of evolution? Much simpler than say, a dinosaur.Something made us, made our existence. Ancient aliens made us? Maybe. But who made them. Big Bang. Fifteen Billion years. Heck, the US debt is seventeen TRILLION dollars. What was there Seventeen TRILLION years ago. What came before our universe? What comes after it?Somehow us humans popped up. The matchbox didn't make itself. We didn't make ourselves.

He rested his hands lightly on her shoulders, guiding her to the middle of a room where other couples were dancing. A curious boy, Logan always seemed to duck his head shyly before meeting Rafia's eyes with his own.Rafia and Logan danced with half a dozen other boys and girls. In the living room, Logan seemed to have even less to say. Rafia wondered if he found her attractive. Wondered if they'd eventually find their way into one another's arms later tonight. But he seemed attentive enough and the volume of the music prevented talk, so Rafia didn't mind much. She held onto her drink and nodded to the couples Logan introduced her too.Logan wore his blonde hair in a clipped crew cut. He had color in his cheeks, perhaps from the heat of all the bodies in the room. His forehead grew moist from the exertion of dancing, and Rafia longed to run her fingers over the short stubble on his head.When Logan finally leaned to her ear and suggested they go upstairs, she smiled and took his hand, quickly nodding her assent.Rafia was no shrinking virgin herself. She loved to be petted, especially between her legs. When the time came, she loved to straddle a boy's thigh, grinding her hips and crotch against him until she came. She knew well how to use her mouth and hands to satisfy a date. Had managed to obtain a diaphragm and had already had intercourse one time, though it had been a big disappointment. Quick and over before she knew it. She longed for a satisfying sexual experience, a partner with stamina who wouldn't fade.As she ascended the stairs behind Logan, Rafia enjoyed the other girl's glittering eyes and whispers to one another. Likewise, one or two of the boy's slyly popped their chins at Logan or offered a shaking fist of encouragement.Rafia enjoyed the attention. Enjoyed the idea that everyone knew she would soon be making out with this popular boy. For Rafia understood what her father did not: This was all part of being an American teen. You had to go upstairs with the boys. Had to be sexy and obliging. A girl had to be willing to give a little.In the upstairs room, Logan took Rafia's drink from her hand and set it aside.Holding her tightly, he pressed his tongue into her mouth, his hard cock against her hip. Rafia sighed as she felt his body against her own. He was big between his legs. She grinned up at him, eager to be with someone so self-assured, feeling her own blood quickly rising.The easy grin Logan had worn most of the night quickly disappeared, replaced by a look of grim determination. \"Come on, baby,\" he whispered, his hand sliding down over her hips, then doubling back, slipping up the front of her dress, and deftly cupping her sex.Rafia gasped.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All books  published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has  been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions  of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these  great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best  feature must be Everyman's uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers  these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most  inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable  binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly  standards.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Most deer hunters have jobs that only may permit them to\nhunt perhaps three weekends a year or possibly every weekend during deer\nseason. Spending that short amount of time hunting deer each year means learning\nenough to consistently take big whitetails is hard. However, most of the men in\nthis book hunt whitetails for a living, either as guides, TV hosts,\nvideographers and/or company representatives. At the writing of this book, I\nfelt like the Hunter's Specialties pros, who have to produce videos and TV\nshows every year on hunting and taking big whitetails, had the most knowledge and\nthe most experience over many years of being successful with older-age-class\nbucks - the bucks I call the PhD whitetails.

These deer are the ones that have taught the hunters in this book\nhow to hunt.Question: How much do you think reading this book will help\nme take a deer?Phillips: Just reading this book won't help at all, if you\ndon't apply what you've read and try some of these tactics, especially if you\nknow you're hunting older-age-class deer. Remember that the hunters in this\nbook already have accomplished many times over the task of taking a PhD buck,\nand I truly believe that what they've learned and passed-on to you who read\nthis book will stack the odds in your favor when you're hunting a trophy\nwhitetail.", "related": [], "rank": 1487445, "title": "PhD Whitetails", "author": "John E.

He also gained firsthand experience with the previous recession in 2002, when he closed his Boulder, CO based computer training business. If he was crazy enough to list on a resume other stretches of his odd path, it would include office manager, bookkeeper, taxi driver, framer, plasterer, ski instructor, and bugler at Santa Fe Downs. Russell is currently taking his own advice, pivoting away from his high stress corporate and management experience. With their youngest off to college next fall, Russell and wife Kathy are selling the house, and proceeding with their plan to purchase and move aboard an east coast based sailboat.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With depth, sensitivity, and candor, Sung Bae Park discusses his country's contribution to Mahaµyaµna Buddhism and also shares his personal experience. A monk in the Korean Chogye order during his early twenties, Park is uniquely qualified to offer the reader some valuable insights into the experience and philosophy of the Zen Buddhist.Focusing on the Korean conceptsmom(which refers to the body) andmomjit(which refers to its gestures or functions), Park examines their nondual, interdependent nature and their relevance to ordinary human beings who are living in these turbulent times. He also introduces a specialized spiritual practice using thehwadu,which aids the religious practitioner in loosening his conceptual, intellectual grip on his life and the world around him. In addition, the author explores the relevance of his views to other religions and philosophies, including Taoism, Confucianism, and Christianity. Those well acquainted with Buddhism will find much food for thought here, as familiar topics such as emptiness, nonduality, and enlightenment are presented in a refreshingly original way, and those new to Buddhist thought may find themselves stimulated to learn more. A helpful glossary of terms is included.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The anthology consists of four stories from new and upcoming talented authors and each writer has a destinctive writing style that will keep readers engrossed. \"Picture Perfect\" is a clever spin on what happens when so much built up sexual tension become apparent that the two main characters Peanut and Bea often fight with, an attraction that started in their adolescent that has followed them into their adult lives. It was a short and sticky sweet story that ended too soon in my opinion, but like all anthologies this is always the common complaint. \"The Competition\" tells the oh so familiar tale of finding love after loss and two unlikely people are Jordan and Alicia who find themselves in their own way trying to fight what is very apparent. \"The Honeymooners\" tells a story of newlyweds and these two are definitely working on forever as man and wife but one decision to bring another into their bedroom, this can start off as sexual bliss during but often times it turns into a nightmare when clothes have to be put back on, this was a good story that had me rooting for a happily ever for Marques and Aubrey. \"Torn in Two\" is an added bonus to the anthology that tells a story of how to proceed when you want to mix business and pleasure without the complications that are often associated with such arrangements. Overall Rendevous: Guiltless Pleasures was a a good read and I enjoyed all of the authors literary efforts in this anthology and definitely left me interested in reading other works by them. As I stated before regarding anthologies they are samples and just right when you are getting to the good part the story is over but mission is accomplished by the writers to keep us the readers on the edge of our seat anticipating more. --Kisha Green for Literary JewelsRendezvous: Guiltless Pleasures by L.A. Smith, Starr Noble, Krystol and Black Angle Publishers is a collection of quick reads that has something for various taste. Some includes some of my favorite things in a story....engaging story lines accompanied by good characters. The first story in this anthology is Picture Perfect by L.A. Smith (which is my favorite) is the story of Quincy (Peanut) and Bethani Bee) and as it unfolded, I was glued to the pages and fully engaged in the details of these two as they grew up from 4th grade to adulthood and remain connected in one way or another. This was penned is the way that one anticipates, what's next while delving into all the things and \"conversations\" that are occurring. The second story, The Competition by Starr Noble is a detailed but short story of two people that meet at their children's swim meet and take a chance with each other. Will the past interfere with them making a future together, it's worth the read to find out. The third story The Honeymooners by Krystol is an story is a story of a couple that ventures from their wedding through their honeymoon and in some fantasies as well. This one left me wondering of the thoughts of the writer. It was definitely thought provoking and tapped into various emotions for me. The fourth story Torn in Two by Black Angle Publishers is a story of a powerful woman, Kirstin, that established her foot hold in the business world at a young age and built an empire in the process. During business dealings, she comes across Warren and is intrigued with the \"man\" to say the least. Read the this short and to the point story and watch what blossomed. --Rhea Alexis M.

As a business and marketing consultant, John has advised some of the largest software and Fortune 500 companies in the world, including Microsoft, IBM, Xerox, Kaiser Permanente, John Hancock, The United States Postal Services, and countless others on emerging technologies and marketing strategies. John has addressed audiences on the state of market conditions, strategies, and usability issues across North America and Europe. His articles have appeared in many industry magazines and publications, including Information Week, INFORM, Group Computing KMWorld, eDoc, Knowledge Management Magazine, and many others. Formally schooled in psychology, sociology, and economics, John is an avid reader and researcher of physic, metaphysics, mysticism, history, and philosophy. Along these lines, he has experimented with a myriad of alternative states of consciousness, from conventional yoga and meditation and Jungian analysis, to forays into psychotropic medicines of ayahuasca and waschuma, and earlier in life, psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline. As an online marketer, John specializes in music and book publishing, providing soup-to-nuts consulting and implementation services. He also serves the medical/alternative medicine, hotel/motel, real estate markets, as well as a select few startup companies. As a musician, singer/songwriter, and music producer, John created the 1st MultiMedia eBook in March, 2011 that integrated a scholarly theological essay, entitled, The Big Bite: The Two Creation Myths of Genesis and the Shocking Truth About Original Sin with his music video, In Heaven (there ain't no) which plays in the chapter of the same name (ePub version only). John also produced the album, The Sedona Sessions the music companion of the 1st MultiMedia Music Novel, \"Cathedral of the Senses\" in March of 2011. In May of 2012, John published the critically acclaimed DEFECTIVE CHARACTERS: Understanding the Underlying Ideas, Beliefs, and Principles of ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS.

She has long been fascinated by the vivid, archetypal images of the Tarot, the ancient art of divination, and—like her alter ego, Hotel Atlantis owner Kikki Trieste—currently reads for an international clientele.

Highly recommended reading.\"- Rachel Veres, www.cybermodeler.com (November 2012)\"In this book by Steve Blake, we get a good look at the 82nd from inception until the end of the war. Its early days of training in the US as well as its exploits in North Africa, Sicily and Italy are covered in some detail. We get to meet the pilots of the unit, read of some of their more interesting exploits and see period photos of these men and their aircraft. Typical of the series, the research is very well done, something we have come to expect from Osprey titles.\"- Scott Van Aken,Modeling Madness(September 2012)", "related": ["B0078XH8XE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What inspired you to start writing about natural methods of stress relief?Women everywhere are experiencing severe amounts of stress in all aspects of their lives, on the job and at home. I see it all around me every day, and I know from personal experience that coping with stress is a difficult prospect. Unfortunately many turn to \"solutions\" that often do little to improve things and may even make their situation worse--drinking too much, using narcotics, or giving in to fits of anger; these things only hurt you and those around you and rarely do anything to actually address the situation that is causing stress.I discovered from my own personal experience that there are many positive and beneficial things that can be done to address stressful situations naturally. First of all, facing the situation and doing what you can to change it is vitally important, even if it means making long-term plans, long-term goals, and long-term lifestyle changes. That's why I decided to write about natural methods of stress relief, identify and expose the core causes and detrimental effects of stress for women, and share the high-performance strategies and techniques that women can use immediately to improve their lives. Natural methods work to relieve stress effectively and naturally.2. What are your best sources for coming up with tips to share with your readers (your own experience, research, suggestions from other people...)?My best resource is by far my own personal experience, as well as the experiences of the many women whom I have worked with in my professional life during the last 20 years. Women coping with divorce, family conflict, parenting challenges, financial tragedy, job burn-out and frustration; women who are overwhelmed by the pressures and anxieties of modern-day living. Really, who isn't stressed these days?But in addition to my own experiences, I also do a lot of research and reading on healthy living and wellness, not only focusing on physical wellness, but also on emotional and spiritual wellness. For women, emotional and spiritual wellness is supremely important for inner-peace, joy, and happiness.But more than just reading about healthy living, emotional wellness, and spiritual wellness, I work hard to apply what I learn.I used to be a stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed woman, but I learned how to slow down, re-organize my focus and priorities, and bring balance into my life. I discovered that there is a lot I can do to manage my stress levels and keep them within acceptable standards. When I see how natural stress relief methods work in my life, such as gardening, walking, juicing, proper time management and money management, camping, nutrition, aromatherapy, etc, I write about it so that other women can learn to implement these natural stress relief methods too. They really do work!3. In addition to your books, articles, and stress management for women ezine, what services do you offer in terms of personal support?I offer one-on-one support via email. I always answer emails personally.Most of the time when we are stressed, having someone to talk to goes a long way in helping to soothe frazzled nerves or just to help regain perspective and direction. Some women may not always feel comfortable opening up to family members, and others may live far away and isolated from family and friends, like I was for many years. Yet, via cyberspace, with the click of a button, you can connect with someone in a meaningful way that brings some perspective and peace to your life.Developing a meaningful support network is by far the single most important natural stress management strategy for women. The support network does not have to be big and extensive. It can be as strong as one person you can confide in, one pair of shoulders to cry on, and one pair of trustworthy listening ears.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 25.0}

Pel Brown, an average, middle-class guy from Maryland, is newly freed from space pirates. After he crosses paths with visitors from two parallel universes--a magical realm, Faery, tyrannized by the evil Shadow, and a galactic empire straight out of corny 1950s sf--he finds himself and a motley crew of fellow earthlings drafted into fighting the Shadow for the freedom of both realms. Thereafter, returning to Faery with imperial forces and wizards fighting and dying at his side, Pel starts to realize that the only way he'll get home is by facing the Shadow in person, and no one really knows who, or perhaps what, the never-seen Shadow really is. Watt-Evans blends just the right touch of whimsy into his well-told action adventure to balance its improbable premise. Genre fans tired of swords and sorcery may find this fantasy delightfully different and entertaining.Carl Hays", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When it came to writing this book, he was greatly influenced by the life of Keith Payne VC, whom he met in the Commandos. As a non-combatant himself and with the storyline he'd chosen, Keith's story, \"Where to for Valour\", by Stan Krasnoff, published by Shala Press, fitted the bill when it was necessary to describe the actions of a man in combat conditions.

Here are the four myths that I often see perpetuated in the world of manifesting:You can have absolutely anything you want if you just get rid of your limiting beliefs - including, one would presume, a couple extra arms and a light sabre.If you think positively enough, you don't have to do any actual work.You can control your thoughts without addressing the deeper issues that cause negative thinking in the first place.Having whatever you want will make you happy.This eBook is the antidote to these myths, by providing a framework that not only explains with great clarity the esoteric principles behind successful manifesting, but also the practical application of these principles. Thus, rather than set you up for failure by perpetuating these myths, I will set you up for success - and true happiness.Everything I've written here comes from the experience I've gained from over two decades of learning, playing, and experimenting with the Law of Attraction. This is not just a book about getting what you want, but a road map to spiritual freedom - a journey to inner clarity and outer prosperity. I hope you will join me on that journey.", "related": ["B00C7Q72IS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Alice was devastated to learn that Richard is actually her biological father, and she suspects that he murdered his first wife and their mysterious daughter, Camilla. She's also furious with her mother for keeping this life-changing secret from her. Charlie is running wild with easy access to alcohol and pot and a handsome young man. With the parents gone on their honeymoon, the sisters act like typical, unsupervised hormonal teens and they have sex (not explicitly described but no mention of protection either) and get into nonstop petty fights. Everything is intense and full of intrigue; the plot is fairly convoluted. While the dialogue is occasionally unrealistic, the setting, romance, and over-the-top suspicions, secrets, and lies will keep teens riveted.

No Montauk tribes, no familiar home town, and no characters from previous novels. The story sprang from a writing exercise that challenged me to step out of my comfort zone: \"Write about what youdon'tknow. Study an unfamiliar painting and let it talk to you.\"     So there I sat in the local Fine Arts Museum, staring at the painting, Woman by the Sea, which featured a sad woman in Victorian clothing, standing along a shoreline in France. After a long silence, I asked her why she was so sad. More silence. I decided that her sister was missing. (I have a brother, but no sister.) To find a plot, I researched everything Victorian, (all new to me) and attempted to set the  novel in Victorian times, but the slow pace didn't work for me.      Photos of modern-day New Jersey resort towns with a Victorian flair pointed me in a new direction. The name of the fictional town where the story takes place became Belvista, meaning beautiful view, an ironic touch for a town where several murders occur.  Mysterious outdoor settings pictured in books added intrigue. The idea of a stranger coming to town to find her missing sister in a community with many secrets began to take shape.  A long conversation I had with an expert familiar with serial killers cranked up the evil that would set the story in motion. For added inspiration I researched serial killers from Jack the Ripper to more recent ones, including those who chose Florida for their vicious rampages.    The Cinderella Murdersis my favorite because of its long round-about journey before it finally found its voice, characters, and ambiance. It turned into the scariest story I've ever written. But in the end, it warmed my heart to see that vile serial killer brought to justice by a heroine and a detective whom I had created. I cheered them on, every step of the way.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As in the first book, the characters begged to be written, and the relationships insisted on being revealed in all their human failings and strengths. Connecting the modern protagonists with their ancient counterparts - specifically the mythical Isis, Osiris, and Horus - and making their ancient story into an updated 21st Century version also took a few unexpected turns; Isis, Osiris, and Horus insisted on being actual characters rather than mythic-ancestral figures, and turned out to be quite distinct and different from their psychic heirs. So I had to write them in as individual characters as well. And the face-to-face meeting(s) between them and their heirs was incredible to write.", "related": ["B00EBCB6D8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Things are going great for Terri Bookman: she runs a successful dog bakery and pet accessories shop, is an animal rescue volunteer, and the loving owner of two easily excitable dogs. And she's just met handsome, pet-loving Carter Morris. Then the evil, dog-hating landlord of her shop hands her an eviction notice, prompting Terri to begin a campaign to save her store while her romance with Carter blossoms--but can their relationship last once Terri learns that Carter is involved with the very company evicting her from her store? Schwartz (A Sweet Deceit) makes no bones about this being long on cute and short on substance; there's more pet care than plot, and it's tough to get your dander up about the conflict the whisker-thin characters encounter.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Imagine a world in which being a vegetarian and a defender of animal rights might turn you into a traitor in the government's eye. Imagine a world in which meat is eaten for breakfast, lunch, snacks and dinner and a world in which the growing of vegetables is quite a serious crime. This is the world of Ima Pigg. It is also a world in which certain people have the ability to speak with animals and it is a world in which transfurmations (\"fur\" is not a spelling mistake) occur. Some animals have the ability to switch places with humans: they can take over a human body and the human's soul will in turn take over the animal's body. This book tells the story of some of those animals and people - and their plan to make the world a better and less cruel place for animals.You don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy this story but it certainly helps if you have a love and respect for all living beings. It is the kind of book that makes you say \"just one more chapter before I turn off the light\" but then you end up reading a lot more because you simply want to know where the story is leading and what will happen to the characters. The book is a great read and also makes you think about the love between people and animals.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I currently live in\nFlorida caring for a disabled family member.  At one time, I spent 10\nyears in Oregon.  I fell in love with the Pacific Northwest and finally\nfound the home of my heart.  It is my plan to move back to the Pacific\nNorthwest in the future.I came to writing later in life than\nmost.  In 2010, I was laid off from my place of employment due to\noutsourcing.  A perusal of the current job listings showed a need for a\nBachelor's Degree.  Apparently, 30+ years work experience wasn't enough\nanymore.  Since I didn't go to college right after high school, I\ndecided to take that time and go to college.  I am currently working on\nmy Bachelor's in Technical Management with an emphasis in Small\nBusiness.  I have 5 more classes after the two I'm currently taking and I\n will graduate.During my first English Composition class, I had\nto write some short essays and papers.  I found out I had a knack for\nwriting.  As I wrote more papers and essays, I grew to love it.  As a\nresult, I started writing essays about things I was thinking about.  I\nstarted a blog to post these essays on.Soon, the essay writing\n led to poetry writing.  So, I took an elective course on poetry.  As a\nresult, I have an appreciation for poetry that theretofore did not\nexist.Around this same time, I came across a deck of oracle\ncards by Cheryl Harnish.  These cards contained fractal designs.  My\ninterest was peaked and I started researching fractals.  In the course\nof my research, I came across a free software program, downloaded it,\nand started creating my own fractals.I am excited to see where\nthis part of my journey takes me.  It is my hope that the words I write\nand share touch the hearts and souls of those who read them.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Carmen has always hated Jenny, and when she is given the opportunity to take revenge on her, she doesn't hesitate and takes it. She meets Ramcen, a strange creature that frightens her, but she is ready to strike a deal with him when he promises her he'll help her defeat Jenny. What Carmen doesn't know is that Ramcen was borne from her own anger, which makes him part of her. So, when she wants to give up on her revenge because someone's life is in danger, it's difficult for her to get rid of him. Carmen will have to fight her own fears and insecurities. Slowly, she will learn about love and friendship. Ramcen's Assignment is based on a great idea, although frightening to some extent. It makes you wonder how your own feelings would look if they were to truly materialize. Carmen learns her lesson the hard way, and we get to see her evolving as a person. The character development is amazing, and the plot is very creative and intriguing. There are plenty of twists and turns to keep you glued to the pages until you turn the last one and hope that the second book in the trilogy will be published soon enough.The metaphor that we all have our own demons and we need to fight them has never been more fitting. Ramcen's Assignment is exactly about that, if we feed them, our negative feelings become monsters that will eventually destroy us. We must learn to love, forgive and give second chances ---Jo Ammons, examiner.com", "related": ["B00FQ7APHA"], "rank": 4421255, "title": "Ramcen's Assignment (Emotions Trilogy Book 1) eBook", "author": "Simone Gillespie", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a young man he was involved in the struggle for independence as the ‘Winds of Change’ swept through the continent. He married and after three years in the police force left to pursue his love of farming. When terrorist attacks on farmers began he joined the Police Anti Terrorist Unit and for 12 years was involved in the ‘Bush War’. During that time he and his unit came in ‘contact’ with terrorists on a number of occasions. Leaving the country towards the end of hostilities he took up a contract in Swaziland where he worked for ten years. He moved to Kwa Zulu Natal where he owned a crocodile breeding and banana farm before selling up to return to Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) to farm. In 2003 with the land reforms in the country he and his wife were violently forced, under threat of death from government sponsored thugs, to abandon their farm. Ken is now retired in the UK and uses his life time experiences in Africa to write books set in the country he loves.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Did Nate and Christine marry? What about Harry and Greta? And\nheavens, did Gloria Blacksworth ever get her comeuppance? The correspondence\nfrom readers requesting more was heartfelt and humbling, and yet, turning a book\ninto a series that was never intended to be one is a huge and daunting task. I\nwasn't going to do it unless I could feel the passion for the continuation of\nthat story. It was a struggle, yet it remained in the back of my mind as I\nwrote one book after another.I\ndo some of my best thinking when I'm walking my dog and during a particularly\ncool morning walk, I started playing around with scenarios and characters. I\nlet my imagination go and didn't try to shut anything down. I did the same\nthing the next day, and soon Lily, Nate, Christine, Harry, Gloria, Greta--the\nwhole crew-- had taken residence in my head. They wouldn't go away and that's\nwhen I knew Ihadto write about them and gave the series what I think is an\nappropriate name:Truth in Lies.I\nhave absolutely loved every part of this process and the characters have\nentertained me as well as broken my heart a time or two. Long before I wrote\n\"The End\", I'd already decided what the storyline would be forA\nFamily Affair: Summer. If you guessed Cash Casherdon and Tess Carrick, you are\nexactly correct.

Johns has dreamed of writing a book for many years and finally has been able to get to a place to make this happen. She is a \"self made \"woman, with the will to fulfill her dream. Growing up in Eastern Tennessee, she wasn't exposed to many social changes of that era. She married young and became a mother as an early teen. She endured many responsibilities, dealing with raising her children alone and working many different jobs and living in many places. She ended up in Tucson to be near two of her sons. Her life is busy, filled with contentment, joy, and love. She is a wife, mother, grandmother and a business owner. Still, she has taken the time to write, while still enjoying play times with her grandchildren, vacations with her husband, and work. All, which she loves to do. Life is full of joy if you make it happen. Writing has always been a release for her and she has had great support from her husband. He has been the real inspiration for her. He has read the book, sometimes feeling the book, and events were real. The book is a fiction, he is the love of her life. This book is packed with love, lust, and moral decisions. She hopes everyone that reads it will get the pleasure and joy she got from writing it.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She had published a novel, short stories, and several poems under a pseudonym for years, but her friends and family kept trying to convince her to publish under her real name. The novel you are about to read was written back in 1993 and published under a pseudonym. It took Sherrie 23 years and a lot of convincing by her friend Curt to finally publish it under her real name. Once she had the novel published, she realized that this was what she wanted to do for the rest of her life; she had found her calling as an author, editor, and publisher. Sherrie and Curt opened their own publishing company, Plucky Penguin Publishing, where she not only publishes her own work but also assist writers in getting their fiction, nonfiction, and/or professional works created, edited, formatted, and published. Sherrie has written several novels, two collections of poetry, and many short stories which she now has published under her REAL name and two pseudonyms. When she is not working, she enjoys listening to Duran Duran (she’s been a stalker, I mean fan, since 1979), spending time with her family, and traveling to warm, sunny places. She has now opened her own publishing company called Sanhedralite Editing and Publishing.

Reinhardt started off as a non-fiction writer. Her publishing credits include: LIVE!, Vista, The RevWriter Resource, The Secret Place, and numerous other periodicals and anthologies. She changed gears and began writing fiction after an experience in Gettysburg. Surrounded by history, she *heard* the voices of the forefathers as fading echoes. Attempts to write a poem or non-fiction piece were unsuccessful, so she put the thoughts aside and prayed. Eight months later, Susan and her late husband were discussing that event when he declared, \"That's it! That's your book, and it will be written in 4 months and be called Ghosts of the Past.\" The first draft was written in 4 months and underwent a name change to Echoes of the Past. Later, it became The Moses Conspiracy. Now, after 2 years of caring for her husband through cancer until his death and 6 years of honing her fiction skills, The Moses Conspiracy has been published. A widow, stepmom, daughter, and follower of Jesus Christ, Susan enjoys reading, couponing, gardening, family time, and searching for small treasures in antique shops.

She also has spent time in Asia and Mexico and has traveled extensively throughout North America. Three years after returning from Italy, her son, Jeffrey, was born; three years later her family expanded with the addition of her daughter, Stephanie. A rocky transition followed, as Linda became a single mom coping with everyday fears of providing for her two children. These fears ultimately became a gift, as her love and passion for helping people led her to a very successful real estate career in both sales and management, while incorporating a positive attitude interspersed with fun and laughter. In fact, her motto was \"Turning Dreams into Reality\" which is the way she continues to live her life.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Story is a native mid-westerner. He was a late-bloomer, beginning his journey onto the creative avenue of fictional literature quite late in life. Although he was a published author of numerous magazine articles, mostly on the subject of recreational boating safety, he'd been constantly encouraged to use his easy, flowing writing voice on more extensive projects. After turning 70, he relented, and wrote his autobiography, \"The Frosting on My Cake,\" with limited distribution to family and friends. He followed that with his first fictional novel, \"KABA 1330,\" set in the '50's, and in 2012, a much darker \"The Night Poet.\" \"In preparing to write \"Nickel,\" I put many hours into researching the 1930's and  the cultural turmoil that was sucking the life out of people living in that era. Somewhere along the way, I began to feel that I was living it. The characters emerged as real people to me, and in some cases I found myself trying to protect them from what I was writing about them! I've gotten close to my characters before, (except for Victor Szabo in 'Night Poet'...I never really got to know him well). But Jacob Brewster and his family, and the other characters in this book, are people I feel I really know. And I think I'm better off for it.\" In keeping with his zest for diversity in his writing, the author's newest project is a farce of ridiculous proportions, as yet untitled. A long-time fan of Monty Python, he's taken to the word processor with a flair for the Python silliness, embedding a murder mystery within the idiocy.   \"I sit at the keyboard with fingers flying, my mind thinking in a British accent, seeing John Cleese and Michael Palin fumbling around and speaking in a dialogue which causes me to pause occasionally and laugh out loud. It is the most fun I've had so far, and a major departure from the way I usually veer off into darkness. Now, all I have to do is find a reader or two who appreciates silliness, and I will have succeeded with the project as well.\" Story's objectives in writing fiction have always been to provide readers with an experience that causes them to meet, and love, and appreciate characters they've never met, but can only imagine meeting.  \"I want them to put faces to them, and voices, and personalities, and then decide why they're so important to the story.  If I accomplish that, then I'm happy.\"", "related": ["B00B4Z5KNM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The author's narrative is clear, easy to read and engaging. I do not think that students of the battle will find much that is genuinely new here in terms of the basic facts, but the stories, quotes and anecdotes bring life to the proceedings and reveal weaknesses in British structure, tactics and command. There are a number of simple and clear maps to help navigate what for some readers will be new territory (which, by the way, is well worth a visit) and a good selection of photographs by way of illustration.

While these uncertain times are difficult, they also provide the opportunity for great leadership.

Across the board, people say their greatest moments arise out of the most difficult periods of their careers.Turning Adversity Into Opportunityreveals how leaders at any level can transform difficult circumstances into opportunities for growth and success. Kouzes and Posner offer a clear set of six actionable strategies, showing how extraordinary leaders navigate through uncertainty, hardship, disruption, transformation, transition, recovery, new beginnings, and other significant challenges. Exemplary leadership disrupts the status quo, and Kouzes and Posner show how to awaken and pursue new possibilities and opportunities, no matter what the circumstances.Wherever you find yourself in your organization or community,Turning Adversity Into Opportunitywill help you embrace the chance within any challenge to make a real difference.", "related": [], "rank": 436179, "title": "Turning Adversity Into Opportunity eBook", "author": "James M.

Most of the time, when you read, About The Author, you discover that said author has three dogs, two cats, a turtle named Harley, and enjoys hiking with her husband of five years, and generally, the piece is written in the third person. I have no quarrel with such an expose, it’s just not for me. If you are reading this assume you really do want to know About Me, and I want to give you that, from me, so here you go. I write about the Dominant/submissive dynamic, because I am a submissive, and having experienced the thrills and spills that D/s romance offers, I don’t just feel qualified to do so, but I am truly, deeply and wholly passionate about the lifestyle. Every second of every day it’s on my mind and in my heart, which, by the way, has been shattered into a thousand tiny pieces, and made shining and whole and filled with joy. Such are the highs and lows Dominance and submission can bring. Having tried and failed with vanilla relationships, during which I was constantly frustrated and unfulfilled, I came to an understanding and acceptance that vanilla simply doesn’t work for me. If you read my blog you can learn more about the addiction to this lifestyle, and while every interaction is unique, each share one truism. The submissive wants and needs the romantic domination of her man, and the Dominant wants and needs the gift of submission his girl offers.
