Advice ranges from obvious (first impressions matter) to insightful (using the \"adaptive unconscious\"), but never makes the kind of impact that would convince someone to, say, hand over $200 million for some Latin American links.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Over the six decades of his own highly successful career, he inspired many executives to find success and helped many companies to solve their most complex management problems. In 1929, Mr. Wetherill discovered a natural law controlling people's personal and interpersonal behavior. The law states that a person is required to think, say, and do what is right in order to get a right result. It further states that when he has a personal problem or trouble, it is because something is wrong about his thinking, conversation, and behavior. In addition to stating the law of behavior, Mr. Wetherill explains the penalty that results from attempted violation or disregard for that law. As with all natural laws, the behavioral law is self-enforcing. The person who deviates from what he knows is right installs, in the recesses of his mind, the wrong thinking he uses to justify his behavior.", "related": [], "rank": 2128883, "title": "Suppose We Let Civilization Begin", "author": "Richard W.

That’s the question that haunts Adam Anker, the middle-aged, New Zealand–based music professor who narrates most of Olsson’s poignant new novel. Growing up in Sweden, Adam forever wondered why his distant Polish mother wouldn’t tell him about the circumstances of his birth and the father he never knew. When his own daughter, Mimi, is killed in a tragic accident, Adam sets off on a quest to find his roots. His search, which begins at a Holocaust exhibit in an Auckland museum, takes him to Krakow, Poland, where he spends time in the company of two wizened gentlemen who dispense a series of devastating secrets. (Adam also intermittently reflects on Mimi’s mother, Cecelia, a lover long absent from his life since she forced him to make a heartbreaking choice.) The novel’s final chapters are narrated by Cecelia, as she anticipates a reunion with Adam after nearly 20 years. As in her first novel (Astrid & Veronika, 2007), Olsson renders luminous prose that lingers over the startling beauty of New Zealand and the blistering truths of the human heart. This is a potent, piercing tale of revelation and regret. --Allison Block", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This story starts out with a bang and doesn't stop. The sexual ride is quite intoxicating and explicitly naughty. Melanie is determined to get the best trainer and she is willing to do what she must. She is a combination of propriety and sensuality; the opposites make her character quite appealing. On one side she shows a facade to the world but on the inside she is a sexual tigress. Though Miguel shows outward control, Rico is an integral part of the interview. Rico's character shows a depth that intrigued this reader, I was eager to turn the page and read more about him. Ms. Dane, yet again, doesn't disappoint.

Siu makes a major contribution to international migration and Chinese oversees studies by developing the theoretical concept of 'diasporic citizenship.'  Rather than taking for granted a coherent, homogenized 'Chinese diaspora,' Siu demonstrates its complexities and disjunctures.\"—Journal of Chinese Oversees\"[The] theoretical framework of this ethnography, of diasporic citizenship and the fluidity of culture and identities (albeit firmly embedded in power relations), should represent a point of departure for a fuller and perhaps more inclusive discussion of the intersections of culture and politics in the hemisphere as a whole.\"Journal of Latin American Studies\"Memories of a Future Homeis a masterful ethnography, focusing specifically on the different groups of Chinese in Panama and their ongoing negotiations regarding identity, nationality, and home.  Proposing that these must be contextualized both in terms of the complexities of Panamanian politics and the global status of the country of origin, Siu makes a highly original contribution that illuminates the dynamics of cultural citizenship among 'new' and 'old' Asian immigrant populations in the Americas, as a whole.\"—Lane Ryo Hirabayashi, University of California, Riverside\"Lok Siu's investigation of the Chinese in Panama is a unique entry in the ongoing investigation of the broader, globally significant processes of migration.  This work illuminates some of the major conceptual debates in contemporary scholarship.  The author's theoretically informed thick description makes this manuscript sing.\"—Ien Ang, University of Western Sydney\"Lok Siu has written a fascinating story about the Chinese living in Panama, equally vulnerable to memories of home and the ruptures of nationalist politics.  The notion of diasporic citizenship captures a kind of interstitial belonging shaped by cross-currents of culture and politics, most recently including ripples from emergent Asian powers.\"—Aihwa Ong, author ofFlexible Citizenship,Buddha is Hiding, andGlobal Assemblages", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In April 1967, a dozen murders occur in the normally quiet town of Holloman, Conn., in just 18 hours, culminating in the death by bear trap of Evan Pugh, a student at Chubb University with a penchant for blackmail. The disparate victims include a hooker, a college dean and the head of a major corporation; among the killing methods are four poisonings, three shootings and two pillow suffocations. In an unrealistic move, Capt. Carmine Delmonico of the Holloman police, who's in charge of the unwieldy investigation, sends his sergeants home for a good night's sleep while the crimes are still fresh. The solution may elicit unintended giggles as it papers over holes in logic rather than filling them.(Dec.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sporting only cowboy boots and hat, Linda cavorts on the runway to pay for her education as a psychologist. At Copp's home, she wears even less, until someone hiding outside tries to kill them by firing rounds of ammunition through the one-way picture window. When the girl vanishes later, the detective traces her to Hawaii where rich Jim Davitsky provides women in a \"talent pool\" to high U.S. government officials. Protected by corrupt cops, Davitsky tortures and kills the prostitutes, recording the outrages on film. Numerous scenes of violence and tension should suit fans of the raw shocker if Copp's flaunting self-image as a \"hard case,\" invincible macho, doesn't put them off.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 976428, "title": "Copp For Hire, A Joe Copp Thriller (Joe Copp Private Eye Series Book 1)", "author": "Don Pendleton", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I immediately fell in love with Daniel Lawless (although a detective named Lawless made me roll my eyes, I'm used to it now). I knew I was going to love this book because of the last line in the second chapter:\"Modesto needed a Dirty Harry, a man of action who carried a big gun he wasn't afraid to use, but what they got instead was Daniel Lawless, a man who carried a small gun he preferred not to use, a man who liked shoes.\"Everything about this story has made me very excited to continue on and I spent most of the weekend sneaking a few pages in whenever possible. Wow, just wow. Blown away.On one hand I am sad that I've finished one of the best books I have read for a while, on the other hand if there had been much more action I may have had a heart attack! Somewhere I read that writers should avoid having too intense of action for too long. Everett pushed the envelope on this one. When it seemed too much was happening, day break would hit and everything slowed down again (Daylight is the monster's only weakness).I loved this story, I loved the characters, I loved the monster, I loved the storyline. -- D.

The Ohio-born Tourgee (pronouncedToor-zhay) served in the Union Army during the Civil War, studied law and found his life's calling in North Carolina during Reconstruction. African-Americans and civil rights advocates hailed him as a dedicated champion of the political, legal and economic rights of former slaves, while many southern whites called him a Yankee carpetbagger. Later, Tourgee (1838–1905) produced 15 novels, eight books of nonfiction, and hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles on race and racial injustice. In addition to founding the National Citizen's Rights Association in 1891, he helped write the nation's first antilynching law in Ohio in 1896 and served as lead attorney in the famedPlessyv.Ferguson, the first constitutional challenge to segregation argued before the Supreme Court. (Tourgee coined the phrase \"color-blind justice\" in his Supreme Court brief in that losing effort.) Elliott goes a long way toward restoring Albion Tourgee's name to a prominent place on the list of American civil rights heroes. 20 b&w photos.(Dec.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Fusco chillingly recounts how female officers and soldiers at Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay endorsed and participated in the abuse and sexual humiliation of prisoners. According to Fusco, these soldiers cannot be dismissed as a few bad apples, but must be recognized as the products of an entertainment culture that depicts torture as effective and even sexy, and a military culture that embraces sexual and cultural stereotypes. Fusco chides feminists who have remained silent about the issue, saying, It is high time that we recognize that it is nothing short of a lie to frame American women's experience exclusively in terms of powerlessness. In the intercultural theater of military torture scenarios and in the exercise of global power as Americans, women are called upon and agree to act in public capacities as aggressors, frequently by making strategic use of their femininity. Fusco confronts her deeply disturbing material with unflinching bravery and characteristic originality.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Brought up in Belfast, Peskett was educated there and at Cambridge University, where he read natural sciences. His professional life was spent in Suffolk and in London. Now retired from all the excitement of earning a living, Peskett lives in Pattaya, Thailand where he spends his time tending his jungle garden and, naturally, writing. Peskett’s adopted country of residence continues to provide ample material for his observation: three novels and collections of essays and short stories deal with issues in a distinctly Thai setting.", "related": [], "rank": 3309226, "title": "Mango and Sticky Rice: And Other Stories", "author": "William Peskett", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a major change in the way the Legions used tactics that enabled them to conquer country after country to conquer the whole world. The amazing thing is that they held it for almost a thousand years. The name is, \"Scipio\". It is from the great Roman and Greek writers from over 2000 years ago. A young Roman general took command of what was left of the Roman Legions as the armies of Hannibal attacked the Roman cities.  Most people don't know that Scipio's Legions invaded Africa and beat Hannibal's hoards of barbarians. This book brings history to you on a gigantic scale and you will feel you are in the middle of Scipio's Legions as history unfolds all around you. It has romance and heartbreak that is written in good taste, and it is all true. It took me over 10 years of research before the copyright was obtained in 2010. I received an Academy Award of T.V. Arts and Science ( Emmy )  and Disney's life acheivement awards when I worked at ABC in Hollywood. Google rates me as a High Authority on Ancient History and this is my greatest work.", "related": [], "rank": 3106504, "title": "Broadcasting, Behind The Cameras and Into The Control Rooms", "author": "Ray Ives", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The plot of the story was well thought out and I could\nreally see most of this story really taking place in someone's life. Both Jake\nand Roan are great characters. Jake is a very smart person, but like most\npeople he still has many issues he has to deal with. In Roan's case, he is one\nof the sexiest men around, but still has a hard time finding people who like\nhim for himself and not just for what he can do for them.This\nwas the first book I have read from this author. Not only did I enjoy it, but I\nlook forward to reading more from this author and this series. 5 HeartsThe Romance StudioIt's\nfunny how, when you read a book that is so good, the characters not only hold\nyour attention but your heart as well. In this story I got to see the lust and\nlove of both Roan and Jake grow and bloom into something everlasting. As I\nwatched the tale unfold, I could not help but wish them both the best and hoped\nthey'd come away with everything they wanted. Not only does the book have an\nin-depth plot that broke my heart, it also had a beautiful air of tenderness\nthat left me breathless. Best Book -- 6 CherriesWhipped Cream Reviews I absolutely loved this book. I loved meeting Jake's family. I\nloved seeing Jake grow into himself. I loved seeing Roan as a multidimensional\ncharacter.

The book should thus appeal to Clark's colleagues, as well as to scholars in the humanities whose specialty is undergoing the same predicaments as history. But Clark's survey is also useful because it bears witness to the difficulty of calling for more theory and living by one's own standard--the difficulty of being \"theoretical enough.\" Clark's work, in this respect, is most representative, for it testifies to the efforts of a scholar who, with much spirit, attempts to negotiate the requirements of being \"theoretical\" with those of being \"user-friendly.\" (Philippe CarrardClio)Elizabeth Clark'sHistory, Theory, Text: Historians and the Linguistic Turnis a brave and fascinating undertaking. It is a valuable contribution to both historians and philosophers alike--historians looking to understand how history can benefit from the work of philosophers, and philosophers who wish to understand the ways in which their theories can be applied to other disciplines. Likewise, as a fair and balanced lesson in historiography, this book is an excellent source for students learning the role of professional historians and the ways in which the academic disciplines have interacted in the last century. (Georges-Claude GuilbertCercles)I come to [review this work] neither as a historian nor as a scholar of late antiquity, but as a literary historiographer who has never had the good fortune to find a really clear, richly-documented survey and analysis of contemporary literary theories as they bear on the practice of writing history. Not, that is, until now.History, Theory, Textoffers practicing historians and historiographers alike an overview of what they do, and a challenge for how they (might) do it...[Clark's] generous approach to other scholars' work; her lucid exposition of the most difficult theory; and her own enthusiasm for her subject makes this book unputdownable. I hope that those historians of premodernity who have not yet picked it up, will do so. (C.S. KrausBryn Mawr Classical Review)Clark's self-described \"user-friendly survey\" of nineteenth- and twentieth-century historiography is successful enough at two tasks to warrant a new label for its style: the expository polemic. The book's success as an expository work is straightforward. Clark takes the new reader smoothly but carefully through over a hundred years of historiographical innovation and conflict, leaving the reader feeling oriented rather than overwhelmed. More knowledgeable readers can engage the voluminous conversation in the endnotes (a hefty 125 pages of notes for 185 pages of text) to appreciate the finer details of the narrative...Beginning with Ranke, and moving through structuralist linguistics, narrative, hermeneutics, and poststructuralism, the reader is swept along with the narrative logic of the story and left with the sense that there can simply be no return to objectivist history, and further that intellectual rigor is not sacrificed in the process. Clark's expository polemic is a fruitful reading for, quite simply, anyone interested in history. (Boyd BlundellReligious Studies Review)Each chapter focuses on an issue of historiographical significance (though not always within the realm usually considered that of \"theory\"), and any could be used easily in a graduate or an undergraduate historiography seminar as a source for bibliography and as a structure for discussion...To many readers, Clark's account of the literature of post-structuralism will be familiar and persuasive, but most compelling are her digressions into the ways in which an understanding of ancient theology may change how we view what is called theory.

On one hand, women consider cars important and useful machines, but ordinary machines worth only what they are supposed to nevertheless. Men, on the other hand, treat cars as extensions of themselves--they dote and take care of their cars to a fault; spend startling amounts of cash to buy many of them; and considers them a source of both pride and joy.If there are those who find Mr. Butler's claims hard to believe, skeptics need only take a look at his book for proof. Mr. Butler apparently loves cars so much that he gave an account of his experiences in owning some. He likewise discussed significant events and periods in the history of automobiles and even wrote poetry about his love for them.\"Why Do Men Love Their Cars and Drive The HELL Out of Their Women?\" may appeal to a car collector and car enthusiasts. ---Janessa Parks, Editorial Coordinator for Dorrance Publishing CO.", "related": [], "rank": 3083786, "title": "Why Do Men Love Their Cars and Drive The HELL Out of Their Women?", "author": "David  Butler II", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Paying close attention to both domestic politics and international relations, Rathbun covers the most important cases of negotiating world order in the 20th century and shows the important contribution of trust in all of them, often in counter-intuitive ways. It opens a door between history, psychology, and foreign policy that should never have been closed in the first place.\" - Ian Hurd, Associate Professor, Department of Political Science, Northwestern University\"Rathbun makes a compelling case for the importance of generalized trust in international relations.  He shows how fundamental beliefs about whether other people tend to be trustworthy underlie attitudes towards international institutions. The book is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the psychological foundations of current foreign policy debates.\" - Andrew Kydd, Associate Professor of Political Science, University of Wisconsin\"In this important new work, Rathbun offers a fascinating account of the origins and logic of multilateral security cooperation in the 20th century.   It will stimulate new debates about international cooperation and invigorate our historical understanding of the origins of American-era multilateralism.\" - G. John Ikenberry, Albert G. Milbank Professor of Politics and International Affairs, Princeton University\"How trust explains not only people's attitudes toward multilateralism but the design of international organizations is the subject of this highly original and timely book.  It offers an important challenge to rationalist models of institutional creation, and is a must read for anyone interested in questions of world order and global governance.\" - Deborah Welch Larson, Professor of Political Science, University of California, Los Angeles", "related": [], "rank": 2817909, "title": "Trust in International Cooperation (Cambridge Studies in International Relations Book 121)", "author": "Brian C.

A middle school boy, of course, after pilfering the amphibian organ from a dissection tray in his life science class.That story, one of many anecdotes Sharon Neuman has collected during 17 years as principal at Lakeland's Lawton Chiles Middle Academy, illustrates the sometimes inexplicable behavior of middle-school students.Neuman and co-author Richard Marshall strive to help parents and educators understand why middle-schoolers do what they do in their just-published book,The Middle School Mind: Growing Pains in Early Adolescent Brains....Neuman and Marshall, an associate professor of education at the University of South Florida Polytechnic, hope to promote empathy and understanding of oft-maligned early adolescents with the 130-page book. They state their premise with one declarative sentence in chapter 2: \"Middle school students have gotten a bad rap.\"(The Ledger (Lakeland, FL))ReadingThe Middle School Mindreminded this reviewer of starting out as a teacher in the 1970s and of the middle-school kids and that often awkward time in their lives. The discussions in this text are practical in nature, covering such topics as the adolescent brain, identity formation, and the kinds of predicaments middle-school students often get themselves into. The most enjoyable chapters are those that review the emotional and social struggles young people face during early adolescence. However, the most insightful chapter is \"The Gifted Teen's Adventurous Nature.\" It contains some interesting and thoughtful perspectives about the \"bottom line\" and the gifted student. Marshall (Univ. of South Florida Polytechnic) and Neuman (principal, Lawton Chiles Middle Academy) share with readers some intriguing thoughts on puberty and brain development. The appendix contains some interesting lists of \"developmental characteristics\" of middle-school students from intellectual to moral to physical and emotional.Summing Up:Recommended.(CHOICE)“Anyone who has spent time working in a middle school will nod and smile and maybe tear up a bit while readingThe Middle School Mind: Growing Pains in Early Adolescent Brains. Sharon Neuman uses her experience and expertise as a middle school principal to clearly and in an interesting manner mesh descriptions of young adolescents with Dr. Richard Marshall’s technical information about brain development. The juxtaposition of the anecdotal view of middle schoolers and the brain research is fascinating and useful. Middle school principals, teachers and parents will find this work to be a valuable resource.”(John R. Nori, Director, Program Development National Association of Secondary School Principals)\"A fun and informative journey into the illusive teen mind. Neuman and Dr. Marshall reintroduce the \"sense\" into what often seems to be nonsensical adolescent behavior. If you want to communicate and connect with an adolescent in your life, this is your guide.\"(Kent Healy, co-author of Cool Stuff They Should Teach in School and Chicken Soup for the Soul: Extraordinary Teens)“You know a middle schooler? You wondered why young people in middle school act the way they do? This realistic analysis of what happens to the middle school mind and body and why they do the things they do should be required reading for parents and teachers of middle schoolers—for anyone who is related to, works with, or knows a middle schooler. For parents, grandparents, relatives, teachers and others who work with middle school young people, this is a guide to what’s going on in their heads and bodies. Make some young person’s life happier by reading this book and understanding why they behave as they do, how long it will last, and what you can do to help. This blend of science, experience, and the opinions of the students themselves will reward you with more positive life experiences with middle school young people.”(Dr. Pat Wentz, Dr., Professor of Educational Leadership, University of West Florida)“Powerful information that is easy to read (and sometimes hard to swallow), this book strikes a nerve with anyone who has ever been affiliated with an adolescent. Authors Marshall (a psychologist) and Neuman (a middle school principal) peel away the mysteries and enigmas characteristic of this age. They offer practical, palatable suggestions for those struggling with this most challenging phase of the human experience. A must read!”(Dr. Sherrie Nickell, Superintendent)“Today, more than ever, the challenges and opportunities facing adolescents in our society and those with whom they interact are daunting, to say the least. Steeped in everyday scenarios, co-authors Marshall and Neuman offer a compelling balance of insight and practicality relative to the exploding compendium of brain research and its causal impact on learning and behavior during this unique developmental period that make their book a must-read for parents and practitioners alike.”(David Lewis, Associate Superintendent)“TheMiddle School Mindis a perfect balance of scientific research and easy-to-relate-to anecdotes of life with teenagers. As a parent of four and teacher of middle-schoolers I see this book as a valuable resource for fostering a smooth transition for our youth into adulthood.”(Michelle DiGioia, Middle School Teacher and Parent)“Thoughtful and humorous. Marshall and Neuman guide readers through this challenging time in a person’s life in a relevant yet entertaining manner.”(Punam Saxena, Parent)“As a teacher, I often tell my students about the method to my madness for using certain strategies in my classroom.The Middle School Mindmade me realize that my students may not have amethodbut certainly areasonfor their madness in the classroom and halls of middle school. Sharon Neuman and Richard Marshall describe stories that share common threads with episodes in my own classroom and explain why middle schoolers are so often Einsteins in class but lack the same genius in life. I felt my students' growing pains as I read this book, and I have grown as a teacher because of the wisdom and knowledge in this extraordinary book!”(Lisa Rosa, Middle School Teacher and Parent)“This book offers understanding and encouragement for us all. There is well articulated insight, indeed wisdom, organized in an efficient manner. Authors Marshall and Neuman provide us with clear and concise interpretations and explanations. They remind us that Juliet was just 13!”(Dr. Richard Frates, Pediatrician)“This book is an absolute must for any parent, teacher, counselor, or anyone who aspires to understand the adolescent brain and how puberty impacts the turmoil of the middle school years.As recipients of often contradictory adolescent behaviors, we all are challenged to better understand and cope with the adolescent in their highly personal middle school social whirlwind. But we also must struggle with our own emotional reactions to our experience with adolescents who sometimes seem to behave in ways that are truly incomprehensible. The basic fundamentals of adolescent development and personal stories reflected in this volume will help even the most confused parent or teacher better understand that what they are observing is often not atypical and that there are ways to productively engage the middle schooler.As a child neuropsychologist, I think the basic fundamentals of adolescent brain-behavior relations are easily presented and integrated in this book. The personal experiences of adolescents shared in this book bring light to our understanding and pave the way toward more productive interactions. These accounts ‘tell it like it is,’ often with well-expressed jolts of the sharp reality experienced by middle schoolers.This book should be at the top of the list of gifts for anyone who has or works with adolescents!”(Dr. George W. Hynd, Provost & Executive Vice President, The College of Charleston)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was very touching and reminded me that life is too short to ignore the small stuff. Something as simple as saying,I love you, is worth more than all the gold in the world.  Story: 5 The story played out like a beautiful song. I could almost hear the melody in my head as the story progressed. It was very well written and it was written from the heart. The words clearly echoed those of someone that loved their grandparents very dearly. The story was genuine and that is hard to come by. My favorite part of the book was the end. There is a page with just lines and a salutation that says, Dear____;. This is the perfect gift for grandparents everywhere. Illustrations: 5 So wonderful! The images and the story go together perfectly. They were so whimsical and intriguing. It was almost as if the images were coming to life on the pages of the book. I love the colors and the emotion on the faces of the characters. They were the perfect compliment to a lovely story. I strongly urge you to support this author and purchase this wonderful book.

Skull Eye Island has won the 2012 Grand Master award sponsored by the Clive Cussler Collector's Society. The books are based in the early 1800's on the main character Jonathan Moore and his adventures on the sailing ship HMS Poseidon, a forty-four gun fighting frigate of the Bristish Royal Navy. The volumes are age approriate, no magic or vampires, and historically accurate.  Peter Greene was born in Glen Cove, Long Island, to artistic parents. He attended Warren Township High-School and later received an AA degree from College of Lake acounty. In 1981 Peter graduated from Illinois State University with BS in Theatre and Speech Education. Moving to Los Angeles, Peter wrote a short sci-fi story called “The Education” that was re-written as a screenplay with Patrick Read Johnson and was eventually optioned by 20th Century Fox under the name ”Fortress”. In 2007, following a request by his wife to read a bedtime story to his two children, Peter decided to make one up on the spot, and Skull Eye Island was born. His wife urged him to create a novel of the story. “I wanted to create a story that would be exciting for children and young adults, and one that was easy to read aloud. I also wanted to keep the adults interested so that children could see their parents enjoying the story and see that reading is fun,” said Greene. “That’s how we create future readers, by setting an example.” Jonathan Moore, the hero of Skull Eye Island and Castle of Fire succeeds using courage, intelligence and determination. “I believe that is a wonderful lesson for everyone: that they have it within themselves to do something great,” says Greene. “No need to wait for a magical event or some strange relative to grant you a bizarre power – we can succeed and excel with what we have inside ourselves.” Peter lives in Arizona, with his wife and two children.", "related": ["B00H2BGCWK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.75, "rating_total": 38.0}

Until recently, feedback has been the forgotten stepchild of personality assessment with the MMPI-2.  This work fills a glaring gap in MMPI-2 assessment and serves, not only as a guide to using feedback in a positive way, but also provides a remarkable example of the description of personality functioning in general.  There is nothing else out there like it; this book is destined to become a classic.” -Philip A. Marks, PhD, retired clinical psychologist, Professor Emeritus, Ohio State University, USA“Lewak, Siegel, Nichols and Stolberg offer a valuable blueprint for providing sensitive, person-centered, solution-generating MMPI-2 feedback; in essence, they supply the words for engaging in a meaningful dialogue with the client and mobilizing his or her positive potential. Included in their descriptions are rarely discussed strengths associated with MMPI-2 scores and codetypes and resilience-enhancing recommendations. This is an excellent resource for personality assessment practitioners, instructors, and graduate students.” -Radhika Krishnamurthy, PsyD, ABAP, Florida Institute of Technology, USA\"The authors have done a splendid job of developing MMPI-2 interpretations that are user friendly, empathic, connected to the client’s experience, and are likely to facilitate client change. This is an essential and much needed development in research and practice. I highly recommend this book to any professional involved with psychological assessment.” -Gary Groth-Marnat, PhD, ABPP, Clinical Psychology, California School of Professional Psychology, San Diego, USA“This comprehensive textbook will expand any reader’s bandwidth of understanding MMPI code patterns and their relationship to psychopathology and, more importantly, the subjective world of individuals with psychological profiles captured by the MMPI-2. It gives therapists and diagnosticians detailed information that is critical for them to understand their clients’ experiences of themselves and others. From the complaints, thoughts, emotions, and behaviors to the lifestyle and family background of individuals producing code patterns, these authors have eloquently described the nature of personality functioning and make what otherwise might be complex material quite easy to grasp and digest. This text, with its recommendations for interpreting profiles in an emphatic and useful way for clients, will become an immediate classic—one that every personality assessor should have on their shelf if they utilize the MMPI-2.\" -Dr. Alan Friedman, Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, USA", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

These subjects, as weird and disgusting as they might be, have been pretty thoroughly researched. It creates a reading experience that is both entertaining and - God help us - educational.' The Maine Edge 'I'm not going to lie, I read this book with unabashed joy, and in the process I truly feel I learned a lot. Granted, I'm not sure when the information I learned will ever come into play (how many times a day does Hitler's potential Crystal Meth addiction come into play?), but it's still all interesting to know, and certainly fun to read, thanks to Haviland's ability to be both educational and whimsical at the exact same time.'

GQ (India) 'Reading medical books usually fills me with dread (and I'm a doctor!) but this is one with a difference - it's hilarious! David has put together a compilation of interesting and intriguing facts that anyone would find hard not to like. I keep finding myself having to read that little bit more each time I put it down! If you've ever wondered why so many murderers are doctors or how frequently a person can vomit in a twelve-hour period then this book has the answer! I now know if people can grow horns, which surgeon accidentally cut off his patient's testicle (ouch!) and why pig farmers are more likely to have their appendixes removed. My pub conversations are going to be so much better! This book is a must for anyone with a thirst for funny and far-reaching medical anecdotes.

But as time went on, the\nidea grew that perhaps my story just might encourage others to follow\ntheir passion from healing to painting to anything that felt like a\nsoul's calling. I now believe that we are all called and for far too\nmany of us that call is drowned out by the static of the doubt of\nothers, or our own self doubt, or the religious beliefs of others that\nmake us feel guilty about standing up for ourselves rather than\nremaining meek. There are so many authority figures who cross our paths\nfrom family to teachers to well meaning friends who tell us why we\nshould play it safe. Too many of us hide and remain \"safe.\" The only\nproblem is that in that safety we may become depressed, angry and\nfrustrated which can come out in many ways.Well, I finally got that my overcoming my own resistances might\nactually help other people, and so I made the decision to write and\npublish the book you are reading.If you have ever had that urge from deep within you that got drowned\nout, if that still small voice has tried to speak to you or if your soul\n has made its calling felt or heard at any point along the way, only to\nbe drowned out by the din of self or other's doubt, I encourage you to\nread my book and begin to understand that your particular calling is\nyour destiny and why you are here and to use my book as a spark to light\n your own fire and follow your dreams. And never let anyone tell you you\n can't have them or that you'll never accomplish them because I am\nliving proof that if you listen and act, you will realize your dreams.Perhaps the formula could be stated as listen, dream and act. Listen\nto your inner urgings and inklings. Dream what your life could look like\n as you take on your new identity and feel how you would feel, look and\nbe if you were living your dream and most importantly, act to move\ntoward that dream. As you will learn from my story, it's not necessarily\n going to be easy or quick and there may be many detours along the way\nbut if you hold onto your dream, you will find yourself living it as I\nhave. Of that I am certain.May your journey to your dream be supported by loving friends and helpers and by your genius and wisdom awaiting release.Julie", "related": ["B00B1MZMHM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In his two-page introduction, Falvey explains the political situation that led up to the conflict and concentrates on the human aspects of his job as a military policeman. The students' questions range from the conversational (if Falvey has pets or plays a musical instrument, etc.) to the more serious. When asked if the war will be over soon, Falvey simply replies, \"The President of the United States is our Commander-in-Chief, and it is his decision.\" One child inquires, \"Why are we fighting for Iraq's freedom? Do some people not want freedom?\" and Falvey responds by discussing Al-Qaeda and terrorism, noting, \"The hope with Iraq is to have a free country in the heart of the Middle East, where Al-Qaeda is unwelcome, and that this freedom will spread throughout the Middle East, creating a safer world.\" For some youngsters, the book may seem unrealistic, since it seldom mentions danger or death.

Set in the 50s in an Alternative Universe,\nSydney is a theocracy controlled by the Inquisition. In Inquisitor\nBlues, the protagonist, Conway Cave, is a ground-level Inquisitor recovering\nfrom a brush with a werewolf that ended badly for both parties; he comes out of\nrecuperation to defend a disgraced colleague and solve a deadly mystery at the\nscandal-riven Holy Office. In this second installment, multiple changes in his\ncircumstances have made him a target for bloodthirsty Werewolf activists. Both\nbooks feature femmes fatales literal and metaphorical. Those familiar with the\nauthor's earlier output will be delighted to find that her flair for action\nsequences, violent, hyper-dramatic set pieces and vivid, sensual imagery has not\ndeserted her. Nor has her interest in the tension between the drives of ambition\nand the demands of that most vulnerable of organs, the heart.", "related": [], "rank": 4066625, "title": "Baker Street Inquisitor (The Conway Cases Series Book 2) eBook", "author": "Cin Eric", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Religion touches the lives of almost everyone on the planet. It is as passionate as life itself. Believers defend it to the death, while others scoff at it and others muder because of it. It is big business: many became wealthy through both honest labor and scams, each selling the stuff with promises of grandeur, riches and happy joyous lives, which is not always the case. For people to become rich from spreading of 'God's words' others became poorer and I do not believe that this is what Jesus was all about. Raised in an Anglican environment I attended Sunday services, was baptised, confirmed and sang in the choir.

Third-grader Eddie Akamai decides to skip school after he’s assigned to remedial reading classes; he balks at the idea of being put in a classroom with first-graders. He takes out the family boat, and Eddie’s sister Emma and their friend Kim Kokua join him. Eddie manages to pilot the boat through an unexpected storm, and the three kids discover Aloha Island, a magical world where animals talk—one even has a tendency to overuse synonyms—and letters grow like flowers. The island’s human residents, Aunty Pono and Uncle Aka, convince the children to help them save the island from the threat of Ignorance, which has already trapped neighboring Mele Island in darkness. A band of talking animals joins the children in their effort, with occasional assistance from a tricky creature from Hawaiian mythology called a menhune, and a lei made of letters instead of flowers. The Flaming Illiterates, a trio of animals with less noble motives, do their best to subvert the kids’ mission, and they prove particularly adept at using Eddie’s insecurities against him. Throughout the book, the children face challenges involving phonics, wordplay and literacy. The story’s many surprises should appeal to in reluctant readers, and the short chapters are likely to sustain kids’ interest. The author keeps the phonics lessons and the pro-literacy message from overwhelming the story itself. Although the pronunciation guides and definitions of Hawaiian terms may seem excessive at times, they provide necessary background about what may be an unfamiliar culture for many readers.

Although the case is outside her jurisdiction, Howard and her team investigate and find her dazed assistant, Trudy, at the scene when race-car driver Duke Beatty is shot dead. When it looks as if Trudy will be accused of the crime, her husband, one of Sharyn's deputies, quickly confesses to the murder and is arrested. Sharyn believes neither Trudy nor her husband to be guilty, but her efforts to clear them run afoul of a long-term FBI investigation. Likable characters, fast pacing, and an intriguing subplot about Sharyn's attempts to learn the truth behind her father's death make for an enjoyable read.

The short answer is no, it's not a real story. However, the story was inspired by events that occurred as I was growing up as a missionary kid in Asia. There were instances of kidnappings of missionaries throughout my growing up years. One had endings that was sad--the missionary kidnapped was killed. Another had an unknown ending--3 missionary men were eventually declared dead after 8 years based on reports although their bodies were never recovered. And yet another had a happy ending--the missionary was released after 810 days in captivity. It was those events that inspired me to writeFaith, Hope & Love. Also in my mind was the knowledge that many (all?)of us struggle at times with wondering where God is when things are rough. Or wondering what the bigger picture is when our view of our circumstances is so narrow. There are situations where we never do see the bigger picture, the impact our struggle may have had one others. But through it all, God remains faithful. We just have to keep our trust in Him. Showing that struggle for Quinn and Cassie was an emotional journey for me as well. I hope that as people read this story they are encouraged to keep their trust in God even when circumstances make them feel abandoned and alone.", "related": ["B00KG252XM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 32, "rating_average": 4.6563, "rating_total": 149.0}

Drawing on Swedenborg's philosophy, Carl Jung's archetype theory and the work of Joseph Campbell, the Larsens use myths as vehicles for examining the dynamics of love and relationships. Their combined expertise renders them well qualified for this creative collaboration: they also co-wrote a biography of Joseph Campbell; Robin Larsen has edited a Swedenborg anthology, and Stephen Larsen is the author of The Shaman's Doorway and The Mythic Imagination. Here, they retell stories from the world's myths, discussing legendary figures and explicating their psychological symbolism, in a similar fashion to the volumes of Robert A. Johnson (He, She, and We). The Larsens' treatment is lengthier and broader than Johnson's, however, with the added element of transcribed discussions of their own and other couples' conversations about mythical themes. Such interpretations must by nature be subjective, so the book lacks the authority of laboratory proofs or case studies. But the stories make the book more interesting to read than abstract psychological theories, and readers with a bent toward communicating through story or with an interest in Jungian thought will find this approach fascinating.

If you got something on your mind I suggest you spill it.\nYou got something you wanna say to me? What is it jealously? That's what\n it is isn't it? I can see it in your eyes. You want to be in my shoes\ndon't you bitch?\"\"This nigga right here is TRULY delusional\" Falynn thought to herself, smirking as she listened to Pebbles pompous ass rant.\"Listen\n Falynn, I know your ass done got all comfy and shit laying up in my\ndamn house but make no mistake this is MY house. I make the rules. I\nknow Adrian and I have the perfect relationship that any woman would be\nenvious of but the bottom line is you gotta get your own man, he is off\nlimits. I mean I don't blame you for wanting my life, who wouldn't? Hell\n if you had played your cards right I might have even given your sorry\nass a few tips on how to step ya game up, but you done fucked that all\nup by not staying in ya lane. So I suggest you have your ass a seat.\"I\n smiled as I fluffed my hair and pouted my lips at that hoe. I couldn't\nwait for this bitch to be out of my house. Not only did she want my man,\n the bitch wanted to be me!Falynn couldn't believe what she was\nhearing. \"The audacity of this manly muthafucka thinking I was jealous\nof HIS ass!\" she thought. It was at that point that she had listened to\nall she could take. Pebbles was truly a fucking nutcase and it was time\nsomebody knocked her ass down a few notches.Falynn was about to go in her room when she quickly turned around to stand toe to toe with me.\"I\n knew your ass was crazy but I didn't know you was delusional also.\nAnswer me this; why would I want to be in your shoes? With yo big ass\nfeet! Why the hell would I want the life of a murderer?\" Falynn raised\nher eyebrow and waited for my response.I stood there in silence,\nshock and disbelief. How in the hell did she know I had killed someone?\nAt that very moment I felt as if my whole world was about to come\ncrashing in. The scene of me slicing Tasha's throat flashed before my\neyes. I had tried my damndest to put that whole experience behind me. It\n was bad enough that Adrian was constantly talking about her and now\nhere this bitch stood as a blatant reminder. I wanted to snap that\nbitch's neck on the spot but she was carrying our child. Besides if she\nknew others could know as well. I had to pull back and dig a bit more. I\n had to find out exactly what she knew.\"Murderer? What the hell you talking about?\" I tried my best to play it cool but the look on my face said otherwise.Falynn\n busted out laughing. \"You should see the look on your damn face. What's\n the matter Peyton? Tasha's ghost done came back to haunt your crazy\nass?\"\"Peyton? Tasha?\" I had started sweating and my heart was\nracing a mile a minute. I had been exposed! I tried my best to look\nconfused as though I didn't know what she was talking about but it\nwasn't working, this bitch had my number.Falynn went in her room and sat on the bed.\"I'm\n a little tired today so I'm gonna stop toying with your simple ass.\"\nShe was perfectly relaxed as she stretched out on the bed.\"You mighty damn brave to be laying your ass down in front of me after all that shit you just talked.\"Even\n though she was on to me she TRULY had no idea who she was dealing with.\n I would snuff this bitch's lights out in a heartbeat and start again\nfrom scratch before I let her fuck up all of my hard work! My eyes were\nnarrow as slits as I gave her a vexing stare that would cut through ice.\n \"You might be carrying that baby in your belly but that won't stop me\nfrom knocking you upside your mutha fuckin head\" I said as I stood over\nher picturing myself tossing her ass straight into the damn amour.Falynn propped herself up with the plush throw pillows that were on her bed and leaned against the headboard.\"You\n wouldn't do that because you want this baby too bad. Or should I say\nyou NEED this baby. Have a seat Peyton while I lay out my list of\ndemands.\"\"List of demands?\"I couldn't believe it! This hoe\n was going to try and blackmail me! Falynn had proven herself a worthy\nopponent. I had no choice but to humble myself and see what this bitch\nhad to say.After taking a seat in the rocking chair that sat in\nthe corner of her room, I watched as Falynn opened her nightstand drawer\n and pulled out a journal.\"First things first, I saw you kill your friend that morning. You thought no one saw you but I did.\"My\n mouth dropped open. I was utterly speechless. I thought I had covered\nall my tracks!  How in the hell did she see me? It was dark outside plus\n I was wearing a mask. There was no way, it just wasn't possible. This\nheffa must be bluffing. I didn't say a word. Instead I let her continue\non.\"I was staying with my grandparents at the time. They just\nhappened to live on the same street as your friend Tasha. I was mad\nbecause I had gotten into an argument with my parents the night before.\nMy grandma started in on me extra early that morning about how I needed\nto start taking responsibility for my actions and how I needed to stop\ngiving my parents so much grief. Bottom line is I didn't want to hear\nthe shit. I stormed out of the house and sat in the car. I turned it on\nfor a little while to warm it up but my grandmother started talking shit\n out the doorway about wasting her gas so I killed the engine. After she\n went back in the house I sat in the car and pouted for the next half\nhour. That's when I noticed someone dressed in all black slip beside the\n house across the street. I slid down in my seat so I wouldn't be seen\nand waited to see what was about to happen. Little did I know I was\nabout to witness a damn murder.\"\"When the lady in the house came\nout someone grabbed her from behind. I couldn't see exactly what was\ngoing on. All I know is whoever it was left her ass lying in the\ndriveway in a pool of blood with the car running.\"\"Now seeing as\nI'm a bitch that's on her grind that desperately needed to hit a lick so\n I could move the hell away from my grandparent's house I decided to\nfollow the person who killed Tasha.\"I sat back in disbelief as\nFalynn shared her story of how she followed me to my house and cased me\nout for days till she finally got a good look at me in the daytime.\"Your crazy ass wasn't scared to follow me after you saw me kill somebody?\"I\n knew this was an admission of guilt but hell I had already been found\nout. This bitch seemed to be bout that life and I needed to see just how\n far she was planning to take this little witch hunt of hers.\"Hell\n naw! I ain't scared of shit, plus I was packin heat my damn self. Don't\n let the pretty face fool you. Anyway I figured whoever killed this\nchick must have a reason to want her dead. And They THOUGHT the dirty\ndeed went unseen, but I saw that shit with my own two eyes. I just\nneeded to find out who was behind the mask and what the motive was.\nThat's when I started casing your ass every day.With that Falynn\nhanded me a manila folder. Inside were pictures of me entering my house\nthrough the side door the morning of the murder. This bitch had pictures\n of me dressed in the all black as well as shots of me coming and going\nin my everyday attire. She had my home address in the shots, license\nplate number and everything. How in the hell could I have slipped like\nthis?", "related": ["B00HVJNS7A"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 23, "rating_average": 4.6522, "rating_total": 107.0}

Haskett started his career as a bush pilot flying in Canada´s Arctic. After a number of years flying commercially, he followed his entrepreneurial spirit and turned in his wings to become a full-time business owner. Over the past 3 decades he has established an extensive and varied sports and business background.  For many years he has also been a fan of horse racing, provided that a reasonable financial return can be earned in addition to the pleasure of seeing magnificent animals race. For almost as many years as a fan he has been able to keep his numbers in the black column. This current book details a complete mechanical system which can be easily put into practice by both neophytes and more experienced bettors. The author has personally bet at tracks in many countries, and now on the internet bets regularly at tracks in more than 18 countries. He is at work on a more specialized horseracing book for experienced bettors, under the working title \"Vegas Pro Secrets\". It should be ready for publication soon. In addition to his duties/pleasures with the ponies, the author has developed, owned and operated a number of successful companies, was a business consultant for small to mid-size businesses, published information books and  business documents ranging from web sites to extensive company operations manuals, and wrote (and marketed) a bestselling novel. Readers interested in free updates for this book or the “Make Money Enjoyably” series can send their name and email address to books@DurangoPublishing.com.

In less than two decades, it has transformed the world, changing the way that societies communicate, gather information, and buy and sell goods and services. From something as mundane as finding a long-lost high school classmate to something as momentous as overthrowing a brutal dictatorship, the Internet has fostered sweeping societal change. Its potential is endless.As an open, unregulated enterprise, the Internet has grown and continues to expand and change at an unprecedented pace, in large part, because it hasn’t been burdened by suffocating regulations or struggles for control. But its future robust growth is anything but assured. The Zelnicks are passionate proponents of letting the Internet thrive and evolve in the same unregulated manner as it has to become what it is today. They advocate that the Internet remain free of Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulations and that the free play of market forces remain the Internet’s modus operandi. The Zelnicks maintain that, if the US government begins imposing restrictions, the rest of the free world will follow its lead.The many forces currently at play could ruin the Internet as we know it, but the issue is complex. Highly visible individuals and groups from both the private and the public sectors and from both sides of the political ideological divide are advocating that the FCC bring the Internet under its regulatory wing. Supporters of an unregulated Internet are certain that the Internet needs to remain free of regulatory restraints so as to continue its remarkable evolution. In 2002, an FCC ruling stated that Internet access was an “information service” rather than a “telecommunications service” and thus not subject to FCC oversight. But outside an internal pressure is building to “rein the Internet in.” The authors offer a clear, compelling argument for why this must not happen.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A native Washingtonian, J.E Sturdivant has made a divine connection to Nigeria through his God-appointed relationship with his Father in the Lord, E.A Adeboye. Heralded by Newsweek as one of the 50 Most Powerful world leaders, Adeboye has fully received J.E Sturdivant as a special son and poured mightily into his life in immeasurable ways. Adeboye, with the care of a father, named J.E Sturdivant “Bamidele,” which is translated to mean follow me home.  Their relationship mirrors that of the prophet Elijah and his protégé, Elisha. As with these Biblical men of God, Bamidele has seen the ascension of Adeboye to greater heights in the Lord. In turn, the same mantle has fallen on him. Since their divine connection, Bamidele’s ministry has been marked by the miraculous. Countless testimonies of actual resurrections from the dead, healing from cancer and astounding breakthroughs on every level speak to the authenticity of God’s hand on his life and ministry.  He is a greatly esteemed and sought after teacher and evangelist who frequently ministers extensively throughout North America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, and Europe. J. E Bamidele and his wife, Pamela D, have been married for over 34 years and are the proud parents of four adult children.", "related": ["B00GKU7A0W"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He won the competition in the Financial Times to predict the value of the FTSE 100 over a 12 month period, coming within 0.5% of the final value. For Bloomberg TV he presented trading shows for three years. Alpesh has lectured on trading in Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore, Guatemala, Spain, Dubai and San Francisco. Alpesh's trading blog is available at www.alpeshpatel.com/blog. Past clients of Alpesh’s company for customer acquisition include Barclays, Goldman Sachs, American Express, Merrill Lynch, HSBC and all the major spread betting companies. Paresh Kiri has vast experience as a floor trader on the world's second largest derivatives exchange, LIFFE, and as a portfolio manager for 18 years. He is an FSA regulated Investment Manager. Starting his career on the LIFFE floor in 1993, Paresh was one of the first traders to embrace screen trading, through the LIFFE online trading platform APT - Automated Pit Trading. Making progress under the guidance of the legendary LIFFE trader David Kyte, he was one of the most consistent traders on the largest product on the floor - the Japanese Government Bond. After successfully completing the Investment Management Certificate in 1996 he was one of the founders of Kyte Securities. From trading financial futures and option products, Paresh had his first taste of trading shares. During the next three years he was instrumental in discovering bespoke strategies for trading equities globally. In 2000, Kyte Securities became Eden Financial - which is now one of the most respected wealth management companies in the City of London, and the strategies developed were then incorporated as the backbone to the Tomahawk hedge fund, run by Marble Bar Asset Management. Since leaving Eden Financial in 1999, Paresh has been managing private client and institutional money. He has also been developing an Index Options Desk, and seeking ways of bringing the strategies he developed to the wider public audience by structuring managed accounts services using online trading platforms. Paresh regularly coaches and holds private seminars on trading the markets.", "related": [], "rank": 2613988, "title": "How to Win at Spread Betting", "author": "Alpesh B.

And when two strange men show up\n at her door looking for her father's new bride she is faced with the\ndilemma of either handing over Drina (and dealing with the King's wrath)\n or taking care of it herself.With this illness quickly spreading throughout all of Kortis, the ring's\n residual effects and these meddlesome men's constant returning visits,\nQuartessa has to find a way to balance the problems, ping-ponging\nbetween realms in her efforts.

Not\nable to be in both worlds at the same time, and fearing for Kyle's\nsafety, she is forced to rely on the help of old acquaintances from her\nhuman life that makes her question just how \"normal\" the human world\nactually is.", "related": ["B00GXKOW96"], "rank": 3049170, "title": "Royal Duplicity (The Anti-Princess Saga Book 2) eBook", "author": "Jennifer A.

Twelftree reminds us that he was far more than a writer, and his religious world was not only philosophical but also experiential. Twelftree collects and examines occasions where the historical Paul mentions and experiences the miraculous. Perhaps most valuable of all, this book attempts to explain how one might integrate Paul's theology of weakness with his experience of the empowering Spirit. Well researched, fresh, engaging, and appropriately cautious about drawing tempered conclusions, this examination allows a neglected area of New Testament study to be brought into the forefront. While the reader may not agree with every part of Twelftree's historical reconstruction of Paul, it is nearly impossible to reject his main hypothesis that the miraculous played an important role in Paul's ministry and theology.\"--Nijay Gupta, assistant professor of New Testament, Northeastern Seminary, Roberts Wesleyan College\"Twelftree's new book is a welcome contribution to the growing momentum in the quest for the historical Paul. His focus on the miraculous locates Paul even closer to his Galilean master, and the often-assumed divide between Jesus and Paul is bridged from a rather unexpected angle. The book serves as a healthy reminder that 'transempirical realities' are an indispensable part of the experiential basis and theological fabric of the earliest followers of Jesus. It also shows how expectations and experiences of the miraculous formed a shared religious language across the Jewish and pagan contexts of early Christianity. That the miracle traditions are regularly ignored or downplayed has more to do with the potential embarrassment they might cause to the portrait of Paul as an intellectual master theologian than with pure exegesis. Twelftree succeeds in reminding us that 'the full range of the miraculous' did not disappear with Jesus but continued in an even more widely 'democratized' form as one of the results of the ministry of Paul.\"--Roland Deines, professor for New Testament studies, University of Nottingham", "related": [], "rank": 2294038, "title": "Paul and the Miraculous: A Historical Reconstruction", "author": "Graham H.

Then one day she sat down and started to write a book. She completed her first novel,In Search of Lucy,in February of 2011. Seven months later, Amazon Publishing contacted her about representing her novel. It has spent countless months as a top-ten drama on Kindle.Her second full-length novel,Vigil Annie, was released on Amazon in December of 2012. One reviewer called this thriller “suspenseful, well crafted, and fast paced.”Lia recently completed her first chick lit novel,Emma vs. the Tech Guy, now available on Amazon.Her other works include a mystery series (A Hint of Murder), a short, sweet romance (Special Delivery), and in a return to her debut genre, a contemporary fiction novel coming soon to Amazon.Lia was born and raised in Southern California, and holds a bachelor’s degree in journalism and a multiple-subject teaching credential.

She's tried her hand at being a paramedic, bank teller and medical sales representative, (not all necessarily in that order), but her love of writing keeps calling her back. She has a passion for all things supernatural, spiced up with a good dollop of romance - as long as they include strong characters, alpha males and capable females, and worlds which although make-believe are really quite believable in the end. There's nothing better than getting caught up in a compelling, intriguing and romantic book. When she's not writing or reading, she's out on her family boat at Lake Taupo, teaching her young boys to fish, showing them the beauty that surrounds them in nature and catching some delicious trout for dinner.

Kenan, Jr. Distinguished Professor, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\"This encyclopedic study explores Japan's multiple dietary transitions since the 19th century in a framework that ranges from food production, import, and consumption across the parameters of trade, income, environment, demography, technology, and geopolitics. Vaclav Smil and Kazuhiko Kobayashi rigorously locate Japan within global food transitions from the 1950s to the 1980s while highlighting such distinctive features as continuing preference for soy, rice and fish and the fact that this rich nation consumes on average 1000 fewer kcals per day than countries of comparable wealth. The study engages contemporary controversies including Japan's heavy international fishing (especially tuna), whaling disputes, the consequence of heavy reliance on food imports, and the nation's declining population and longevity.\"--Mark Selden, Cornell East Asia Program; Coordinator,The Asia-Pacific Journal", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has an M. A. in English Literature, from City University of New York and a B. A. in English from Hofstra University.  Formerly an adjunct English instructor in two suburban Philadelphia community colleges, he has written for trade and consumer magazines and for newspapers as an editor, reporter and columnist.  His creative work has been centered on poetry, having some 30 poems appearing in print, as well as doing numerous poetry readings.  In 1968 he wrote lyrics for the debut album of two progressive electronic rock musicians titled Silver Apples, and several of his lyrics are still sung today.   He previously has written three non-fiction works: a sexual memoir, Flowers Never Bend (published in 1998 online by SpiritVitrtualBooks); a first person work account about being an EMT in Detroit, The Meat Factory, self-published in 1999; and The Effects of War, annotated Civil War letters with supporting text, published in 2007 by the Warner New Hampshire Historical Society.  In the past decade he has turned to fiction writing, having two short stories published. “Pay the Price,” a fantasy work in Bored Again, and “The Death of Baby Hitler,” a science fiction story in Launch Pad, both “little press” magazines in Philadelphia.  The King’s Pawn, his first novel, appeared in 2012.  This year has already seen the appearance of Through Scattered Leaves: A Commonplace Book, an anthology of short quotations from some of our culture’s most brilliant thinkers.  The Great Mystery, also appeared early this year, is a collection of his philosophical aphorisms.  This was followed by Crossing Paths, an anthology of nine of his short stories.  In production are Gone to Grass, a memoir to appear later this summer, and Kill the Kaiser, a historical novel to appear this fall.  My Paris will appear in the spring of 2014.

He graduated from Central High School in Sanford, North Carolina and went on to earn a BA degree at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Bob spent 34 years in the Welding Supply business as a salesman. After marrying Helen Ligon, they had four children. Bob was a wonderful husband, father and grandfather. He also loved people. He thought everyone he ever knew was exceptional. His faith and church activities were very important part of his life. After retiring he did volunteer work and took several classes on writing at Central Piedmont Community College. Then for a number of years he participated in a Monday afternoon writing group led by Barbara Lawing. He wrote this book while attending Barbara’s group. Bob had many health problems the last few years of his life but still maintained his love of reading and of people. His interests were varied. He would have several books open on religion, history, philosophy and cowboy novels at the same time. Bob loved music too; his favorites were classical, church hymns and bluegrass. He passed away on February 23, 2011.", "related": ["B00GVDXCQO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He also spends a lot of time reading; fantasy and science fiction mostly, along with older role playing game manuals (Dark Sun and lots of GURPS sourcebooks) and the occasional bit of historical fiction.

Sterling drops the reader right smack dab in the middle of a murder investigation in this enthralling novella! Without ever telling the reader exactly what city or where, she draws a clear picture of a city large enough for the detectives to have to work to learn the people, yet small enough that the characters know each other in this contemporary murder mystery.  Readers familiar with architecture or construction might notice a small hiccup, but isn't quite enough to spoil the story.  The conﬂict that results from the love triangle between Carolyn, Jack and Evan is nicely detailed with believable motivation, although the love scene feels \"heavy\" in contrast to the rest of the writing.  A smooth, quick read!\" Review By Cheryl Schopen for Readers' Favorite- 4 Stars\"H.K. Sterling had me on the edge of my seat with A Taste for Killing. This short story had it all: suspense, murder, mystery, and even a love triangle. I found myself constantly guessing not only who the murderer was, but also who Carolyn would end up with. The plot was unpredictable, the characters were all equally intriguing, and the romance was both sizzling and heartwarming. Even though it was a little too fast-paced for me, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I will definitely be reading more of Sterling's stories. Although it was short, I was so immersed in this book and in the characters' lives that I was disappointed to see it come to an end, so I am really looking forward to the second book in this series.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The\nbalance of steamy sex scenes and violent gun fights kept your blood pumping\nthroughout.\"Deviant Divas\"While reading this book, I found myself amazed by how much ground the\nauthor managed to cover in less than two hundred pages. Camille's quest for\nlove, Aegis' pursuit for revenge, and Jaxon's hunt for his greatest desire were\nseamlessly intertwined among fast-paced action sequences and HAWT love scenes.\nThe scenes and sexual tension between the men and later with Camille\npractically burned up the screen of my reader.\"The Romance Studio", "related": ["B00JMUQJ5O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I am a proud wife and stay at home mom.  After my first child was born, I started to focus on the ingredients used in our everyday health and beauty products. The more and more research I did, the more nervous and upset I became towards companies and their lack of care towards consumers.  Fast forward two years, shortly after having my second child, I was diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer. During my fight against this disease, I began researching possible causes. I soon began to learn just how many harmful ingredients were not identified on product labels.  I vowed once I recovered to share my knowledge through my newly established company producing all natural products, that include soaps, balms, bath salts, etc etc.  My books are intended to not only educate, but also to share the knowledge and passion that I have gained through my struggles over the last few years.
