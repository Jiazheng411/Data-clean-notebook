The usual suspects (so to speak) are here: Johnnie Cochran's summation in O.J. Simpson's criminal trial, the prosecutors' opening statements in the cases of Adolf Eichmann and Timothy McVeigh. Seidemann, an assistant DA in New York City for over two decades, also offers three cases in which defendants represented themselves, including accused al-Qaeda conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, though these and other cases (Martha Stewart, Marv Albert) seem included more for their notoriety than for the quality of the prose or legal arguments. But then there is William Jennings Bryan's eloquent, if debatable summation in the Scopes trial, proclaiming the amorality, if not the immorality, of science. Seidemann does achieve his two goals: to entertain the reader with legal drama and to remind the reader of some important details—that O.J., for instance, won his criminal case but lost in the civil suit. Seidemann's greatest service is to provide brief but thorough annotations of the cases, in which he considers some of the reasons behind an argument's success or failure.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Drawing on Jewish reflection upon the Aqedah (the near-sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham in Genesis), as well as on other critical analyses of sacrifice in Scripture, the book shows that communion is not possible without the reconciliation attained by sacrificial self-giving love. Following the insights of St Thomas Aquinas, the author argues that all aspects of Eucharistic theology, including metaphysical doctrines such as transubstantiation, depend upon recognizing that communion cannot be separated from its sacrificial context. The book will stimulate discussion because of its controversial critique of the dominant paradigm for Eucharistic theology, its reclamation of St Thomas Aquinas's theology of the Eucharist, and its response to Pope John Paul II's Ecclesia de Eucharistia.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If you are going to be kind enough to give me one (a wedding dress), please let it be practical and dark so that I can put it on afterwards to go to the laboratory.\"—Marie CurieIt was a good thing Marie Curie was dead or her ears would have been ringing from all of the indignant protests when Rebecca read this quote to us years ago. The four of us—Marilee Davidson, Rebecca (Becca) Snyder, Lizabett MacDonald and me, Carly Winston—were sitting in a small room at the hospital with Rose, our counselor. Rose is the one who asked us to bring the quotes. It was almost Christmas and we were having our second meeting of the Sisterhood of the Dropped Stitches. Rose had been looking for a more cheerful place for us to meet, but we were content in that hospital room with its bad lighting, plastic chairs and the smell we could only hope was disinfectant. There weren't many regular places where we felt we belonged, not with our balding heads and our talk of chemo. That's why Becca brought us this quote. She said we were afraid to attract any attention to ourselves, just like Marie Curie had been on her wedding day.I'm sure Becca thought that I would be completely horrified that any woman would ask for such a go-nowhere wedding dress. But she was wrong. I might have been the only one sitting in that hospital room who had actually given the beauty queen wave to a crowd of people instead of just to her own mirror, but I absolutely knew there was more to life than clothes.Madame Curie's compelling research, like our cancer, stripped away most of the natural pleasantness of life until just one thing remained. For her that one thing was the cure; for us it was the disease. At times like that, pretty clothes weren't worth a moment's thought.I'm twenty-four, by the way, and I'm the second oldest member of the Sisterhood of the Dropped Stitches. On the surface, we're a knitting group. In reality, we started to meet as teenage cancer patients and that, more than the endless skeins of yarn, is what has kept us together for more than six years now.Being in the Sisterhood gave us great courage, and we're trying to use that courage to take back our lives. We all know cancer put us a step or two behind most people our age. But what the others in the Sisterhood don't know, and I'm just starting to realize, is that I'm not just a step or two behind; I'm walking backward down a whole different street. I need courage more than anyone else in the Sister-hood, because I haven't been open with anyone.I should have told the Sisterhood my family secret years ago. But secrets can be seductive things. A small secret, and it was a small secret at first, doesn't seem worth telling. Then it becomes a big secret and becomes too hard to tell. Now I wonder what they will think of me if they know I'm not the person they think I am.It was the end of November when the Sisterhood started to meet that first year. I remember when we introduced ourselves, and I said I lived in San Marino. If you know the area, you know it's very upscale. It takes lots of money to live there and, when I said I did, the others assumed I had it made with a trust fund and a servant or two. Which was cool, I let them think that. I didn't tell them that I only lived there as an unwelcome guest, along with my parents, in my uncle's house.My uncle is rich, but I'm blue-collar poor.My mother is ashamed that her brother is supporting us, and I never advertise the fact myself. None of my friends know that my parents and I are one careless word away from being homeless and have been for years now. My uncle is known for his temper, and I used to keep a small suitcase packed just in case someone said the wrong thing.Early on, my mother encouraged me to look like I belonged in San Marino. She probably thought my uncle might like having us around if we looked like the neighbors. Back then I saw it as camouflage. So I did the hair and the dress and the attitude. It seemed to make sense at the time, but I'm beginning to realize I've pretended so long that I don't know who I am anymore.I need to tell the rest of the Sisterhood about me, but I can't bring myself to do it just yet. I didn't realize what years of living a little lie would do. I guess I never expected the Sisterhood to become so important to me. Or that the things we said in those early meetings would have any significance beyond those days.Frankly, I never really thought we'd stay together long enough to make it out of that hospital room. And we might not have except, a couple of weeks after we started meeting, Marilee's uncle offered us the use of the back room at his diner in old-town Pasadena, California. He'd stored a damaged pool table in the room before he cleared it out and added French doors so we could see out into the main dining area. I know Rose thought we'd start talking to each other more when we had a nice room like that, and it made her even more determined to keep us together.In those days, we had no words for anyone. We were afraid for our lives. Marilee had breast cancer. I had Hodgkin's disease. Becca had a bone tumor. Lizabett had a tumor in the muscle of her leg.Looking back, I don't think any of us wanted to stay together. But we didn't have the energy to tell Rose so we just kept on meeting and meeting. Through the chemo, through the radiation, through the wigs. Through that Christmas and the next one. By the time we each had our five-year clearance from cancer, we had grown so tight nothing could pry us apart.It's the story of this struggle back to being normal that Marilee wants to tell in our journal. She started writing it several months ago, saying we need to show the world that our cancer didn't drain the very life out of us; that we kept our spirit and we survived.The journal is her little victory dance on behalf of us all and her joy in it warms me.You'd like Marilee. She's a cross between a Girl Scout leader and the girl next door. If she sees anyone in pain, she's right there with a Band-Aid or an aspirin or a kidney. Seriously, she's always looking out for the other guy—unless, of course, she's asking someone, like me, to write in the journal. Then she's Attila the Hun on a rampage.I might approve of the journal, but I don't want to write in it. Now that I'm more aware of my secrets, I'm afraid they will seep out onto the pages without my knowing it, even though we all clip pages back or tape them together when we want them to be private.When Marilee shoved the journal into my hands a little while ago, I was trapped. I like Marilee too much to disappoint her. Besides, she had already given me the equivalent of a kidney when she gave me her forever boyfriend. He's the man she had fantasized about through all the years when she had cancer and he's come back to work for a couple of weeks at her uncle's diner. So what did she do when she found this out? She decided I should date him instead of her.Which is why I couldn't say no to writing in the journal. Talk about guilt. Marilee gave up her dream for me. I'd rather disappoint my own mother than cause any grief to Marilee. So, of course, I politely told the guy \"no, thank you'' when he asked me out and tried to give him back to Marilee.I've been trying for several months now, but she won't take him back.We're sitting in a Sisterhood meeting right now and talking about the guy. We call him \"the grill guy\" because Marilee called him that for years. His name is Randy Parker and he's going to be working the grill at The Pews for the next two weeks. Marilee's uncle is finally going on vacation and Randy is filling in for him. It took Marilee's uncle, Lou, longer than anyone thought it would to organize everything, but he is flying to Venice, Italy tomorrow and Randy will be here at The Pews several hours every day working the grill. I think they are swapping time and that Randy will go on vacation next and Uncle Lou will help manage Randy's diner for him when he's gone.\"If you're both so busy, I could date him,\" Becca finally says after Marilee and I spend ten minutes telling each other why we are too involved with other things to go on a date with Randy.\"That's fine with me. I have Quinn,\" Marilee says. She is blushing and knitting a blue scarf for the new man in her life. Quinn is a firefighter that she met a few months ago. I think the scarf is her Christmas present to him, because when I offered her some red silk yarn that makes those new sparkly scarves, she said the yarn had to be blue to match the person's eyes.\"Besides, Randy is really more your type,\" Marilee says as she looks over at me.I freeze. \"What do you mean?\"Marilee shrugs. \"He's just got that San Marino look.\"Boom. Who knew my secret would lead to this? \"There is no San Marino look.\"\"Plea-ea-se,\" Marilee says as she rolls her eyes.\"Even if there were such a look, I wouldn't need a San Marino–look guy. I'm not as San Marino as you think.\"Marilee smiles. \"You may as well date him. I'm happy with Quinn.\"I must admit that Quinn is nice, but Marilee hasn't been dreaming about him for the past six years. Besides, Marilee would give me her last saltine cracker if we were stranded on a desert island and there wasn't another cracker in sight and she was feeling queasy, (Marilee always had saltine crackers with her to help settle her nausea when she was taking chemo). Not only would she give me the last cracker, she would insist that I needed it more than she did. That's Marilee.I wonder if Randy is a little like that cracker and that she thinks I need him more than she does so she's being noble.Not knowing what else to do, I am writing in the journal. Between the cracker theory and the San Marino–look comments, I'm beginning to realize that my lack of candor about my family might be affecting us all. If Marilee is thinking I should date Randy because he looks San Marino and I am San Marino, then we have a problem.I might live in San Marino, but I don't belong there.I can't just blurt out that I've let them believe a lie, however.

WhileThe Death of an Irish Tinkeris one of the more gruesome installments in the wonderful Peter McGarr mystery series, it is also one of the most powerful in its exploration of the sociopath and drug kingpin known as the Toddler.The story is revealed by a series of scenes framed in both the present and the past world of the novel. First, Gill shows the making of a killer as he traces the tortured young life of Desmond Bacon, a.k.a. the Toddler. Cutting ahead several years, Chief Superintendent McGarr discovers a dried, nearly mummified corpse high an enormous sequoia on the estate of Eithne Carruthers.  Moving back in time again, the reader watches a horrid night in the life of tinker Biddy Nevins.  Biddy is a street artist who perfectly reproduces pages from the Book of Kells on the Dublin sidewalks. But on this night her gifted memory becomes a curse; she witnesses the Toddler and his \"shades\" crush a man's skull under a bus.  Before she can fully process what she's seen, she becomes the target of the elusive drug lord who wants to wipe away all evidence of his crime.  Biddy flees Dublin, leaving behind her husband and child and the settled life she had begun to craft for herself.  But when Biddy's mother shows up in McGarr's office with her scattered version of Biddy's final night in the city, the detective and the young \"Rut'ie\" Bresnahan begin to weave a trap for the Toddler that leads to a bloody climax.Gill is a gifted writer who manages to bring a keen understanding of Irish culture to a classic police procedural.  Readers are sure to relish the prose and the Irish dialect alongside the chilling tale of a brutal killer.  Some other McGarr mysteries includeDeath of an Irish Sea Wolf,Death of an Ardent Bibliophile, andDeath of a Joyce Scholar.--Patrick O'Kelley", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Billings makes a persuasive case for the central importance of this motif in the Reformer's thought. This is an erudite yet very readable book.\" ----Don Compier, Graceland University\"I warmly recommend Billings's book as a serious piece of scholarly research that is not afraid to tackle some of the more popular theological schools of thought in a manner that is respectful, thoughtful, and analytically powerful. Billings is the first to systematically analyze Calvin's theology of participation. He manages to pull together a Calvinian doctrine of participation which can stand on its own strength and which presents a genuine, and in decisive ways original, contribution to Calvin research. Any further critique of Calvin's theology as based on coercion or violence will have to give an account of Billings's masterful scholarship.\" ----Hans Boersma, Regent College\"In the best sense, this is a work of deep theological recollection: with a view to rescuing Reformed theology from its Zwinglian captivity, it restores an appreciation for the catholicity of the Reformed tradition. In the course of defending Calvin against his radically orthodox despisers, Todd Billings carefully and persuasively articulates a vision of Calvin's theology as a source for contemporary constructive theology. And one could hope that the rich vision of sacramental participation he so deftly describes might trickle down into Reformed practice. Billings invites us to imagine how different our Reformed churches might be if they were actually 'Calvinist.'\" ----James K.A. Smith, Calvin College\"This fine study by Todd Billings gives us fresh ways of looking at a familiar figure. Lucidly written, meticulous, precise, and extremely well informed, Billings's discussion of participation, that ancient Pauline category, opens the door both to new historical and constructive insights. An indispensable study for students of Calvin, historians of Christian thought, and theologians of the Gift.\" ----Kevin Madigan, Harvard Divinity School\"This is a valuable study of what is an important thought much neglected theme of Calvin's. It should be read by all with an interst in Calvin's theology.\" ----Anthony N.S.

The girls have a hard time fitting in, in Southern California, working as delivery girls for their family's restaurant and acting as chauffeurs and translators for Granny and her friends. In chapters that read like short stories, varying in tone from darkly comedic to folktale-like, the twins stumble into adulthood. As a teenager, Mei Ling wakes up to discover her formerly slanted eyes are now round, causing her to feel glamorously Americanized and ashamed at the same time. Elsewhere, Granny asks a friend to pray the twins won't end up dancing at the Pink Pussycat. It turns out to be a valid prayer: Mei Ling relentlessly tries to bed customers, leaving responsible Moonie to keep her on a leash. Eventually, Moonie and Mei Ling graduate from the delivery truck and end up in top-notch medical schools, but even in success, their paths are comically divergent. Chin's provocative take on acculturation, immigrant life and family ties is a unique innovation.(Sept.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A deft balance of fevered pathos and dark humor link this memoir, in spirit and theme, toSafekeeping, Thomas's collected vignettes that memorialize her second husband. But Thomas also finds wellsprings of inspiration in her tragicomic interactions with Rich and in the self-reliance she's forced to develop, aided by her faithful dogs (the book's title adapts an aboriginal phrase, derived from the tradition of cuddling with dogs on frigid nights). Rich—himself reminiscent of a Stephen King eccentric—utters eerily prescient, absurdly poetic non sequiturs, probing the essence of time and love with ingenuous intuition, though his acute paranoia and confusion make these exchanges truly heartbreaking. Thomas's quick-cutting chronology and confessional narration subtly re-enacts the soupiness of her husband's mind, even as she quietly thanks him for the wisdom of living in the present.(Sept.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

London, 2009: Brigid Hayes, a devoted wife and mother, awaits the imminent birth of her second child, while across town Michael Stone, after innumerable attempts, finally gets a novel published and struggles to handle the sudden public exposure. Unknown location, 2153: prisoner 730004 stands trial for conspiring against the Protectors, leaders of a dystopian society in which all human activity, including procreation, is regulated for the preservation of the species. Kavenna's ambitious narrative architecture doesn't quite cohere, and some of her rhetorical devices are, well, labored. But on the whole her writing is sharp, her four narrative voices are nuanced and distinctive, and her emotional, intellectual and stylistic ranges are impressive.(Apr.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Blanning argues that, in many ways, the essence of modern man is that he is self-consciously dynamic. We are attracted to change--it captures the eye much more than stability. This excellent book reveals much about the things that have changed in Europe since 1789--and, just as importantly, the things that have remained constant. The eleven essays in this collection (written by some of the biggest names in the field of European history, such as Princeton's Harold James, U.C. Berkeley's Martin Jay, and Richard Overy of King's College, London) focus on various aspects of European society, from politics and economics to high culture and social structures, and analyze both the changes and the engines of those changes. In his standout essay on the changing nature of warfare, 1789-1918, Hew Strachan argues that this military modernization cannot simply be explained by new technology and that more emphasis must be placed on changing ideas. Strachan and the other authors for the most part eschew jargon and present an authoritative set of essays complemented by over 240 arresting color and black-and-white illustrations. Many of the chapters would be suitable readings for upper-division history courses, and the thorough index, detailed chronology, and suggestions for further reading would be a great help to students. This book is accessible to the general reader while remaining valuable to the scholar--and is immensely readable to boot.--C.B.

Written in the style of a mystery, this novel is devoid of figurative language that would slow the reader to contemplate the beauty of the words. It is action-filled and fast reading. Most of the story is set in eastern North Dakota in and around a city named Cheneau Valley, which is actually Valley City. Author Gary A. Friedly talked about Valley City in an interview after he completed the novel: \"During a trip through North Dakota, I was stopped by a high railroad bridge that passed over a river and town,\" he said. \"Valley City was the perfect setting for a story. I subscribed to the newspaper; I talked with the locals, listened to the radio, studied the landscape and watched the weather. I knew more about their town than my own. I couldn't hide my enthusiasm. I talked to state officials in Bismarck. I talked to folks in Fargo. When the town was evacuated and threatened by a flood, I didn't sleep at night until I learned the town survived. This story is about surviving. There are many characters spread out from Seattle to the Twin Cities. They all converge on Valley City.\" The novel contains 14 chapters, which are divided into several first-person narratives on the title's topic. In the beginning, I wasn't sold on the technique, but it didn't take me long to catch on. The main characters are young men who have just graduated from high school within the last year or week. Trevor Jensen grows up in an affluent family in Seattle. His parents are professionals, and he and his sisters are able to develop their talents in ballet and music. Trevor is expected to attend an Ivy League college, but he rejects his parents' wishes and signs on to work on \"an upscale passenger train\" for one year. As a member of the night crew, his assignments cover the area between Seattle and Minneapolis. Travis Olsen grows up on a farm near Cheneau Valley and graduates from high school in an eventful week. He signs to play basketball for the North Dakota State University Bison for the next school term. He and four of his friends were the starters for the last Class A state championship basketball team. He received two prestigious awards for his basketball skills: Mr. Basketball and the Coaches Trophy for outstanding senior athlete. The author skillfully builds our suspicions as to how these two young men from distant cities will meet, and we begin to dread what the outcome will be. Friedly's familiarity with the rural culture stood out to me. The reader is drawn into the Cheneau Valley community as it wraps its arms around its young people. It reminded me of my community and how protective we feel of our young people and how proud we are of their accomplishments. As I read, I admired the expertise the author showed in portraying the youthful characters he created. We are introduced to the strengths and character flaws of each young man. We meet their families and discover their unique circumstances and how they fit into the community. The rescue and aftershocks were so realistic that I would recommend all high school students spend time with this book. Often students have no idea what far-reaching effects their actions can have. This easy-to-read novel is a tragedy that could happen and does happen in any of our small rural communities. The novel is written using straightforward language. There is no sensationalism as far as vulgar language or sexuality. The story would be a good one for youth or just about anyone else. --By Rita Greff, Bismarck Tribune, April 13, 2010", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her plain language and frequent use of metaphor in explaining basic, but important, topics in chemistry seem like a winner. The format is straightforward: 12 short chapters, each devoted to one concept that is fundamental to understanding chemistry. She begins with some tips on studying and test taking, followed by discussions of the atom and the periodic table, scientific notation, calculator use, significant figures, the mole and molarity, units and conversions, acidity and basicity, the ideal-gas law, solubility, bonding, and chemical reactions.Each chapter is short and to the point, with a few simple illustrations. At the end of each are a few questions and space for answers, meant to focus again on the important take-away messages. All in all, the text is a good starting point and ongoing resource for high school and possibly some college students. It is about as unintimidating as any science text could be, which I consider a strength.Perhaps the best way for the book to help students of average ability and below is for copies to be in classrooms. The teacher can then either point to the various sections as topics are started during the school year or even assign chapters for extra credit (and maybe only for students whose grade is below some threshold). Overall, I applaud the author for trying to provide a path for more students to succeed in science. --Lee Katterman, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI --AAAS Science Books & Films (SB&F;) Review, October 2010", "related": ["B00KPZQSQK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His 1687 publication of the Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (usually called the Principia) is considered to be among the most influential books in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most of classical mechanics. In this work, Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation, thus removing the last doubts about heliocentrism and advancing the scientific revolution. In mechanics, Newton enunciated the conservation principles of momentum and angular momentum. In optics, he built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the many colours that form the visible spectrum. He also formulated an empirical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound. In mathematics, Newton shares the credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development of the differential and integral calculus. He also demonstrated the generalised binomial theorem, developed the so-called \"Newton's method\" for approximating the zeroes of a function, and contributed to the study of power series. Newton remains influential to scientists, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists and the general public in Britain's Royal Society asking who had the greater effect on the history of science, Newton or Albert Einstein. Newton was deemed to have made the greater overall contribution to science, although the two men were closer when it came to contributions to humanity. Newton was also highly religious, though an unorthodox Christian, writing more on Biblical hermeneutics than the natural science he is remembered for today.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her novels have been published by many different houses, both US and UK, and translated into German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian and Japanese. Best known for her writing for pioneering British erotica publisher Black Lace, her work has been praised for its powerful sensuality and vivid emotional characterization. She enjoys writing books with contemporary, paranormal and occasionally futuristic settings, but her new great love is historical erotic romance, set in the late Victorian era, which she has long found fascinating. Her favorite erotic sub-genres are sensual punishment, power exchange and edgy, boundary skirting pleasure games.Since the demise of Black Lace, Portia has found several new writing outlets. She now writes short erotica for Harlequin Spice Briefs and her titles there include the best selling CHANCE OF A LIFETIME and her Victorian series THE LADIES' SEWING CIRCLE. She's also writing erotic historical fiction for Harlequin Spice, and her first title, IN THE FLESH, is due out in January 2012. She's also penned FAR FROM PERFECT and A TOUCH OF HEAVEN for Samhain Publishing, and is shortly to be published by Carina Press - a red hot BDSM novella, EYES OF THE DEVIL.Portia's new creative passion is self publishing and she's recently released several titles: THE EFFICIENCY EXPERT - contemporary erotic romance short; GLINT - contemporary erotic romance short; WESLEY AND THE SEX ZOMBIES - erotic horror short; FORBIDDEN TREASURES - BDSM erotic romance novelette; POWER OF THREE - ménage erotic romance novella.Portia is a member of Romance Writers of America, the Romantic Novelists Association [UK] and the Society of Authors [UK]. Portia lives in the heart of West Yorkshire, UK, with her husband and her cats. When she's not writing she can be found reading, watching TV and movies, and hanging out on Twitter.

Cambridge Is Sinking! typifies his early writing, where young, menschy hippies reluctantly let go of their politics and community in the face of day-to-day struggles, ruminating on jobs, graduate degrees and rich uncles as they try to find direction. As Clayton's early characters turn away from their idealism, his later ones turn toward a larger search for meaning and often toward the divine. (In his author's preface, Clayton writes I hope for Jewish and non-Jewish readers; but I speak as a Jew.) In History Lessons Daniel Rose takes his young son to the neighborhood where he grew up, uncovering a considerable sense of loss (endemic to Clayton's stories) and a great divide between the father and son. Failed marriages, bitter children and terminal patients mark many of the tales: in The Contract, Max pores through holy books while his wife, Natalie, succumbs to cancer; the family finds comfort in the prayers' familiarity, but their meanings remain obscure. Clayton repeatedly explores a limited set of situations and emotions, but he is a master of his material.(Sept.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet each of them exists in an unreal world where everyone trades the same type of minor-key jazz-bop drollness—an attempt at humor that never quite catches on and instead feels like wandering affectations in search of a conductor.

Combining case histories with a discussion of key themes, John Marzillier has produced a book that is warmly written, very informative and a pleasure to read.”“I cannot recommend this book too highly. John Marzillier shares with his readers many intimate details of his life’s journey through clinical psychology and the various schools of behaviour therapy to dynamic psychotherapy, in each of which he trained. Throughout he was discovering the limitations of each school of therapy as well as the value of each, being careful not to be caught into the dogmatic position of any one of them. In his moves on, from one training to another, he was careful not to discard skills that had proved their value, integrating these with the fresh skills he learned with each new step of his journey. Learning from his patients as he went, and from his mistakes, Marzillier eventually came to recognize how important it is to work with deeper levels of the mind rather than symptoms alone, which he had seen as the main focus of attention in therapy and later in what came to be known as CBT. Marzillier writes in a way that is a pleasure to read, being open and personal, always accessible and frequently with humour. His book is full of telling clinical examples. This is a book from which anyone in the helping professions has much to learn.”“I found John Marzillier’s book so riveting, I could not put it down and read it in one sitting. From behaviour therapy to psychoanalysis, becoming an expert in CBT along the way, Marzillier describes his personal journey, revealing the human stories behind the ‘distilled’ science of psychotherapy. It will be an effective antidote to any tendency to idealise particular therapies, or to assume that any one approach has the answer, whilst also acknowledging the genuine contributions from many different lines of psychological enquiry. I strongly recommend it to all those training in clinical or counseling psychology—and, indeed, any form of psychotherapy.”“This is a remarkable memoir. It begins with a series of terse, moving sketched of some patients whom John Marzillier treated early in his career, and at the same time details his uncertainties and anxieties about his methods of treating them. With great honesty he does not simply recount his successes, and the result is an account of his therapy and experiences which is both finely judged and lucidly written. I strongly recommendThe Gossamer Thread.”", "related": [], "rank": 1845471, "title": "The Gossamer Thread: My Life as a Psychotherapist (The Karnac Library)", "author": "John Marzillier", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is the story of a father fighting for custody of his children from a despicable, unfaithful wife.

The dialogue is authentic, the main character's emotional upheaval feels real. After reading \"The Steps They Took\" I wanted to fly to Corpus Christi and have this brilliant, descriptive writer give me a personal tour of a magical city. It is indeed a real page turner! - Amazon.com reviewerThis was an excellent book about two individuals who experience turmoil, adversity, change and growth in their lives. The author's style of writing is very captivating and I found myself having difficulty putting the book down once I started reading. The ending was great and unexpected. I loved Mr. Williams descriptive style of writing and the history of the area in and around Corpus Christi, Texas. I would highly recommend this book and can't wait to read more by this debut author. -Amazon reviewer\"The Steps They Took\" brings together two despondent strangers who lean on each other for moral support. In the process of disentangling the messes their lives have become, each of them grows spiritually and emotionally into caring, mature individuals who can accept responsibility for their actions and forgive the people who wronged them. The characters are vivid and real. This novel is an enlightening read for anyone who thinks there is little hope left. - Cynthia Breeding, author", "related": [], "rank": 3269142, "title": "The Steps They Took eBook", "author": "Scott A.

This is the book that needed to be written. The dropout spiral begins in kindergarten. We need to reach out and grab a hold of those kids early! Many children are at risk before they ever walk into first grade. Teachers and parents of children, who may or may not be gifted, who just do not fit into that round hole, really need to read this book! (Eleanor Peirce, kindergarten teacher, Desert Sun Academy)I found the book to be extraordinarily powerful. In fact I found myself becoming quite emotional at points as I thought about children I've worked with over the last few years. I hope that it will be shared with and absorbed by those who are not yet 'like minded' as I believe it could be a very effective catalyst for change. Overall, a truly well written and thought provoking book that has had an impact on me personally. (Amy Levinton, special education teacher, Anthem K-8 - Florence Unified School District)This is excellent and thorough research reporting…This is fascinating information and is efficacious. The book, as it stands, is an excellent tool. (Vanessa Girard, former teacher, counselor, and administrator)I really enjoyed reading your work and I think it's a very timely topic! (Karalea Cox, higher education county administrator, Apache County, Arizona)Hickman and Heinrich's analyses of past failures in public education and the inability to reduce high school dropout rates are spot-on. Much can be gained from this retrospective study regarding the early differences between students who drop out of high school and their peers who graduate from high school. The problems that lead to a student dropping out of school is more about arriving at high school ill prepared to do high school level work, than what is or is not happening in the high school itself. Hickman and Heinrich, in their excellent study, took the time to elucidate the problem of why kids drop out of school, examine the human ecology of children, and explain how standardized testing undermines education. This is a must-read for parents, teachers, business leaders, community leaders, and political leaders to place real meaning in educational reform. (Marilyn K. Simon Ph.D, Richard W. Riley College of Education, Walden University)This is a MUST-READ ... for anyone who believes in tomorrow's future! (Christine Ybarra, principal, Franklin Fire & Police Academy)There was a time, and not that long ago, when the kindergarten classroom was a place for children to play and sing, hop and skip, dance and sing—a world of magic and imagination—mud-luscious and puddle-wonderful. Reading and math was second to fun and play. Today, life is different for five-year-olds. Letters, phonemes, blending, counting, and multiple assessments throughout the year to measure their progress toward meeting the standards. Yes, the pressure has siphoned down to kindergarten, and this is a recipe for stress, anxiety and drop out. (Bert Honigman, principal, Desert Sun Academy)After having worked in alternative education for 20 years, a book has finally been written that is relevant. Shocking, but interesting! The research has been done and brought together with viable options for solutions to this dropout dilemma. This book is pertinent reading for parents, educators, and administrators. (Justin DeMello, principal, Oasis Sierra Academy)We are so grateful for the time and effort Randy and Greg put into this book. Their research really put our challenges in keeping students in school in perspective. We see ourselves a little clearer. Their work has helped us become better at addressing the walls and obstacles we as school systems put in front of students. Great job! (Travis Udall, superintendent, Round Valley Schools)Finally a book that takes on the real reasons that students drop out of school…[and] has the potential to reshape our thinking about the 'when' and 'why' students disconnect from school... This book provides examples of problems and solutions that parents, educators, and administrators can easily implement. I found this remarkable book very interesting, but not shocking. As an educator for more than 20 years, I've seen many of these problems start in kindergarten and spiral out of control. I am excited to see a book that challenges all of us to make some changes toward reform. A must-read for everyone, but especially for the political leaders who sincerely want real reform in our schools. (Kathy Stopka, third grade/special education teacher, Franklin Park School District)Do Children Drop Out of School in Kindergarten? by Gregory Hickman and Randy Heinrich presents a systems-based approach to the long-standing dropout problem. The authors report a longitudinal research study on a population of children in rural Arizona and argue that dropouts begin to differentiate from nondropouts very early in their educational experience, in fact, as early as kindergarten. The focus on early childhood and elementary education is important because it is here, the authors suggest, that interventions are most likely to prove effective.Hickman and Heinrich do an excellent job in detailing the \"usual suspects\" of the dropout problem (family, behavior, and academic problems) and illustrate with many tables their basic premise that very important differences exist in the developmental pathways of high school graduates and high school dropouts. There is also an interesting discussion of how standardized testing can undermine real education and what the authors refer to as the human ecology of children. In the final and arguably most important chapter of the book, this ecology is discussed in terms of systems-based interventions that may prove effective in addressing the problem. This book is an important read for policy makers and educational leaders and may challenge them to make educational reform.(Dr. John Kellmayer, author of The Mouse in the Microwave, School Superintendent in New Jersey, and faculty for Nova Southeastern University)For this thick description of a longitudinal study, Hickman (Walden Univ.) and Heinrich (Argosy Univ. Online) examined various data (e.g., grades, achievement tests, and absenteeism) to determine the reasons students drop out of school. The authors' major findings include the following: dropouts and graduates are very different as early as kindergarten, dropouts are absent from school more often than graduates, and dropouts demonstrate lower levels of academic performance than graduates. These findings were well documented in prior research, but more detailed analyses of the results from this study yielded some new information. For example, the authors found that dropouts tended to perform better on standardized tests than they did in classrooms. Furthermore, they found that the gap between the performance of dropouts on standardized measures and classroom performance increased over time....Summing Up:Recommended.

Wisely, the author employs the same characters, themes and eastern Long Island setting that made Fell such a delicious read. Keats, Fell's neurotic blueblood ex-girlfriend, plays a pivotal role in this tale of a dead ventriloquist, his maniacal dummy and his missing best friend, the slightly bent heir to a major fortune. Fell's narrative is in counterpoint to that of \"The Mouth,\" which turns out to be the dummy belonging to Lenny Last, the ventriloquist who caused the death of Fell's school chum Deem in a suicidal car crash. Investigating Last's and Deem's deaths brings Fell back to his old haunts at Gardner prep school and the Hamptons, where Keats lives and Fell had a truncated love affair with mysterious Delia Tremble. Along the way the reader is treated to ventriloquists' lore plus the same sort of pithy social commentary and quirky characterizations that enlivened Fell . With a few threads left untied and the appearance of Delia's look-alike sister April at story's end, Kerr leaves the door wide open for Fell's return.

Edgar. As an infant he was adopted by George Freeman, a porter at Billingsgate fish market. Aged eleven, Wallace sold newspapers at Ludgate Circus and upon leaving school took a job with a printer. He later enlisted in the Royal West Kent Regiment, before transferring to the Medical Staff Corps, and was sent to South Africa.In 1898, he published a collection of poems called 'The Mission that Failed', and subsequently left the army to become correspondent for Reuters. South African war correspondent for 'The Daily Mail' followed and his articles were later published as 'Unofficial Dispatches'. His outspokenness infuriated Lord Kitchener, who removed his credentials. He then edited the 'Rand Daily Mail', but gambled disastrously on the South African Stock Market.Returning to England, Wallace at first reported on crimes and hanging trials, before becoming editor of 'The Evening News'. It was in 1905 that he founded the Tallis Press, publishing 'Smithy', a collection of soldier stories, and 'The Four Just Men'. The latter was published with the ending removed as an advertising stunt and he offered $500 to readers who could successfully guess the ending. Unfortunately, many did and he was almost bankrupted. At various times Wallace also worked as a journalist on 'The Standard', 'The Star', 'The Week-End Racing Supplement' and 'The Story Journal'.In 1917, he became a Special Constable at Lincoln's Inn and also a special interrogator for the War Office. The Daily Mail sent Wallace to investigate atrocities in the Belgian Congo, a trip that provided material for his 'Sanders of the River' books. In 1923, he became Chairman of the Press Club and in 1931 stood as a Liberal Parliamentary candidate for Blackpool.Wallace's first marriage in 1901 to Ivy Caldecott, daughter of a missionary, ended in divorce in 1918 and he later married his much younger secretary, Violet King.Along with countless articles, some 23 screenplays and many short stories, Wallace wrote more than 170 books, which have been translated into 28 languages and sales of which have exceeded 50 million copies. Over 160 films have been made from his books - more than any other author. In the 1920's one of Wallace's many publishers claimed that a quarter of all books read in England were written by him. His sales were exceeded only by 'The Bible'.He died in 1932 whilst working on the screenplay for 'King Kong', having moved to Hollywood after being offered a contract by RKO.", "related": ["B001FB5ST6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A natural storyteller, many of the anecdotes in BUSKER have been tested on live audiences for years. The author is also considered a pioneer in World Fusion music. He seeks the common ground between styles from all over the globe and creates an eclectic blend. His worldly travels as well as his early training as an actor add depth to his ability to reach audiences and has made his decades-long career as a busker effective and enjoyable. The author relishes multi-media readings where he intersperses stories with tunes played on his Celtic harp. David Michael holds an M.A. degree in Arts and Media Technology from Antioch University West and a B.A. from The Evergreen State College in Olympia. Since then, his focus has been on publishing and marketing original music CDs, so most of his writing skills before writing BUSKER have been devoted to press releases, liner notes, descriptions, reviews, advertisements and conducting interviews. Some of his travelogues have been published in small journals (International Folk Harp Journal, Victory Review and others). He s also written lyrics for hundreds of songs and worked as a singer/songwriter, although performing instrumental music, coupled with storytelling has taken him further. (He prides himself as being a better song writer than singer.) David Michael is a prolific composer, producer and multi-instrumentalist with over twenty CDs of original music published by his record label, PURNIMA PRODUCTIONS. His book BUSKER is published by PURNIMA PRESS a subsidiary of Purnima Productions. It was therefore only natural that he put together a compilation CD of his finest musical recordings as a bonus, inserted into a sleeve at the back of the book. David and his wife Dari also present a multi-media slide show called Castles and Cobblestones (about their busking adventures in Denmark in 2008) that has received rave reviews. They recently released a CD by the same name to display when they perform this show BUSKER is the author s first book.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was dragged south across the border by his parents when he was too young to protest and has lived in California the rest of his life.

His military work and forty-five years in various business management positions had him traveling to many parts of the world and he remembers well the beauty (as well as the poverty and unrest) of so many places. He retired early and moved from the city to his quiet country place in Twin Oaks, California. The loudest noises now are some howling coyotes, the wandering cattle and a million raucous birds. The rabbits and quail have come to recognize that Shiloh (the ranch) is a sanctuary for them, so they hang around every day looking for handouts. Jim just hangs around the ranch trying to be a hermit (at least that's what a lot of people think.) He does still manage to get shaved once in a while and can look half-way presentable when someone comes up the driveway (if given enough warning.) Jim's work now appears to be writing. SANCTION took about ten years to finish, as it was written in bits and pieces. Now THE LESSER EVIL and COP have joined the bookshelves, and more are on their way. Jim would love to hear from you.

Devlin Kirk (Suicide Season, etc.) is juggling several cases: surveillance of some personal-injury insurance frauds, protection for a playboy whose new Japanese wife's angry father has sworn to kill them both, and investigation of a drug ring in the Advantage Corporation. The protection case heats up with some surprising news about Roland Humphries, his wife Mitsuko, and her father; but it's the drug case that turns red-hot when Devlin's man inside Advantage, Chris Newman, is tortured and killed. While his partner Bunch Bunchcroft goes after the motorcycle man on the Humphrieses' tails, Kirk painstakingly squeezes the low-level sellers at Advantage to crack open a distribution ring that stretches to Pensacola--and to bring in Newman's sadistic killer. Burns sweats the details as much as Kirk in squeezing suspense from his unglamorous cases, and the few surprises are expertly timed. If you haven't discovered Kirk and Bunch yet, don't wait a minute longer. --Copyright ©1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Those Cubas are long gone, and those stories, however well written, reveal precious little about the way things are in 21st Century Cuba. By contrast,The Woman She Wasit is a story of modern middle-classed Cubans: what issues they face, how history influences their values, and what they hope for the future.  There is Celia, a 35-year-old Havana pediatrician, her 16-year-old niece Liliana, and two brothers who Liliana persist in calling \"Aunt Celia's two fiances.\" In fact, Celia is only engaged to the older brother Luis, a high-level official in the Cuban government. She was engaged to the younger one, Jose, a decade earlier when she was in medical school, but he split for the States so that was the end of that...until he returns. Deciding what she wants to do about these relationships is complicated by a secret mental aberration she has lately begun to suffer; that of imagining, for a few seconds at a time, that she is not herself, Dr. Celia Cantu, but has become her namesake, Celia Sanchez, Cuba's greatest revolutionary and, just incidentally, Fidel's lover. As if this sense of persona-merging is not disturbing enough, Celia learns that Liliana has been cutting school to hang out in resort areas for reasons she cannot bear to contemplate. Before she can discuss this shattering discovery with her niece, the girl disappears. Celia sets out across Cuba in search of her, a search which leads her not only to resorts where Liliana might have gone but into the Sierra Maestra and an experience that will cause Celia to doubt her sanity even more. As Celia's psyche grasps for straws of strength from her nation's history, she is faced with the reality that it's not what happened then but what happens now that will make or break her own future, Liliana's, and that of Cuba.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Educated by Jesuits, he was an excellent pupil but one quickly enraged by dogma. An early rift with his father—who wished him to study law—led to his choice of letters as a career. Insinuating himself into court circles, he became notorious for lampoons on leading notables and was twice imprisoned in the Bastille.By his mid-thirties his literary activities precipitated a four-year exile in England where he won the praise of Swift and Pope for his political tracts. His publication, three years later in France, ofLettres philosophiques sur les Anglais(1733)—an attack on French Church and State—forced him to flee again. For twenty years Voltaire lived chiefly away from Paris. In this, his most prolific period, he wrote such satirical tales as “Zadig” (1747) and “Candide” (1759). His old age at Ferney, outside Geneva, was made bright by his adopted daughter, “Belle et Bonne,” and marked by his intercessions in behalf of victims of political injustice.

Whenever I ran across [a Henty book] in our local library I quickly checked it out, rushed home, and read it usually without putting it down.George Alfred Henty wrote his first boys' adventure, Out of the Pampas, in 1868.  Its popularity spurred him to write some eighty more children's books.  Drawing on his own experiences fighting in the Crimean War and as a foreign correspondent in Europe and Africa, Henty fashioned stories for children that combined realism and what he called a manly tone, with admiration for British strength and courage. His novels encompass an array of times and places from the early days of Egypt to the mines of the California Gold Rush.George Alfred Henty was born in Trumpington, England, on December 8,1832.  He studied at Cambridge, but left without his degree so he could volunteer for service in the Crimean War.  After several failed attempts at careers, he decided in 1865 to become a writer, beginning as a correspondent for The Standard.  He also wrote adult novels of mysteries and adventure, but turned to children's stories after contributing with success to Union Jack magazine.In his World article, George Grant calls Mr. Henty a Victorian literary phenomenon whose 144 books and myriad short stories have long enthralled adults and children alike.  His fiercely accurate narratives range across the whole spectrum of human achievement, highlighting the greatest characters and the most decisive moments in history.George A. Henty died on November 16, 1902, leaving a literary legacy that Lost Classics Book Company is proud to help revive.", "related": ["B0084AMYGG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Son of an Anglican priest, he was educated at Harrow and received a scholarship for New College, Oxford. After short tenures at St David's University College and University College, Durham, Rashdall was made a Fellow of New College, Oxford, and dedicates his main work, The Theory of Good and Evil, to the memory of his teachers Thomas Hill Green and Henry Sidgwick. The dedication is appropriate, for the particular version of utilitarianism put forward by Rashdall owes elements to both Green and Sidgwick. Whereas he holds that the concepts of good and value are logically prior to that of right, he gives right a more than instrumental significance. His idea of good owes more to Green than to the hedonistic utilitarians. \"The ideal of human life is not the mere juxtaposition of distinct goods, but a whole in which each good is made different by the presence of others.\" Rashdall has been eclipsed as a moral philosopher by G. E. Moore, who advocated similar views in his earlier work Principia Ethica. His historical study, The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages, was described in the introduction to its recent reprinting as \"one of the first comparative works on the subject\" whose \"scope and breadth has assured its place as a key work in intellectual history.\" He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1904 to 1907, a member of the Christian Social Union from its inception in 1890, and was an influential Anglican modernist theologian of the time, being appointed to a canonry in 1909. Rashdall was also a Berkeleyan, believing in metaphysical idealism. He was Dean of Carlisle from 1917 to 1924.", "related": ["B0050YV1R2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They are so different they are mirror images of the other - Axel is grounded, wary, secure, slightly OCD, whereas Lexa is more chaotic, flighty, impulsive and this gets her in trouble big time as the book unfolds, several times, until you just want to tell her to stop!These siblings are not just normal people though, they are shapeshifters, able to shift into other people, even each other, but there are consequences for those actions, and is all the shifting leaving more permanent damage to their bodies, as well as their souls?The last couple of pages of the book drove me mad! What? That's it? When is book 2 out? Are they two people, or is it just one complicated person?? The writing is so good, it could easily be either. I recommend reading this book before book 2 comes out, you are in for a serious treat.

The Elk-dogs fracture when their young warriors exercise their blood lust in a successful attack against the Head Splitters, only to be reined in by their elders. The leader of the youngsters is a rowdy brave named Badger, who is banished when he accidentally kills the tribe's chief guide during a brief tussle. When Badger leaves, several of his followers go with him. This weakens the remaining ranks and forces the leader, Heads Off, to engage in a desperate series of maneuvers as the Elk-dogs are pinned down by the Head Splitters and winter approaches. Coldsmith (Raven Mocker; The Lost Band; etc.) is on familiar ground when it comes to portraying the minutiae of Native American life, although many of the details he musters are overly familiar. The background of Heads Off, at least, is intriguing-formerly known as Juan Garcia, the son of a Spanish nobleman, he became a tribal leader after being captured. The final face-off between the tribes is far too ordinary to make this book memorable, but the characters and the story line are well rendered, as Coldsmith does his usual solid job of bringing this historical culture to life.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

One way or another we’re all formed by it, and wherever I go, I’m taking the English Midlands with me. It’s like letting the world in on a secret.It has a population the same size as Scotland, but it doesn’t have a devolved government of its own. It has a strong identity, but also gets buried amidst the media’s attempts to make everywhere into London.In the Midlands factories got closed. Mines got filled. Generations lost their jobs and their futures. What happens when industry collapses in an industrial region?Many say there isn’t a gun culture in Britain. If you’ve lived in this area with your eyes open, you’ve seen things that the national press just doesn’t want to cover. There’s been an ongoing gang war in Birmingham for over 20 years. A real war with a real body count. And it's getting worse; where once it was a few gangs fighting to control the drug trade and nightclubs, now it's any number of young men with guns, fighting over streets and post codes.But you wouldn’t know any of this by picking up any of the nation’s newspapers. There’s nothing in anyone’s interest to report on people dying in the midlands. They’re the wrong class, the wrong colour and have the wrong accent.The IRA had a strong presence in the area during ‘the troubles,’ but what happened after that? More than once I’ve been in an Irish pub when the man came collecting for ‘the cause.’ The whole world knows the story of how freedom fighters became terrorists, but does anyone want to hear the next chapter?How about the Asian gangs who grew up in the eighties to defend their communities? Twenty years later they were sitting on top of drug empires and causing trouble for a fresh wave of immigrants. How did that happen? More stories; the pub bombings of the seventies, the race riots of the 80′s, the persecution of the Roma.I want to write about a place that matters to me and to hopefully make you laugh, make you reel and make you think- after I’ve entertained you.Faithless StreetandOld Goldare my attempts at a first person detective story of sorts. Pulp fiction, first and foremost, but they will sneak in some social fiction if you look the other way. It tells of a half-gypsy gangland detective. If you’re a businessman looking to find a statue of a falcon or a family looking for a missing toddler, you need not apply to Eoin Miller. If you’re a drug lord looking for a missing stash, or an illegal immigrant looking to stop a rapist, then he might be the man for you. He is very happy ignoring the world, his friends and his family. He’s doing a very nice job of learning to bury his conscience. He will take your money and find something you’ve lost, and then he will walk away.", "related": ["B007EW0GHY"], "rank": 264981, "title": "Faithless Street- The Old Gold Prequel", "author": "Jay Stringer", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The focus of Alex's writings is about noticing the ways in which we unenlighten ourselves, while recognizing what's already naturally present within. From childhood on, Keats happened to be obsessed with finding out what's real, who we really are and why we're here. Subsequently, this quest became his primary focus in life. Alex gets the most joy spreading the good news that self-realization and lasting happiness is open and available to absolutely everyone, regardless of faith, past experience or present circumstance. Having a series of awakenings in 2004, both sudden and gradual that ended suffering and restored true seeing and perception, Alex is inspired by encouraging others to look beyond appearances to the underlying essence. Reminding others of what we all are - Eternal Spirit having a temporary human experience - is the common thread that runs throughout his writings. Alex Keats is just your ordinary, middle-aged guy with an extraordinary passion for truth and well being.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A\nreal-world example was examined, which focused on the optimum price to buy\nshares, as well as advice on setting a stop loss price to minimize losses.\"-J. Chambers (Amazon Top 50 Reviewer) \"'He also defines `stop loss' and how to apply that\nconcept to keep your portfolio secure and balanced. And then of course he\nadvises us when to sell a stock (defining the `moving average'). In the process\nof these bits of intelligent advice he offers graphs to back up his data and\nconcepts - reassuring information. And last he reassures us that we can never\nknow everything as `outsiders', since the `insiders' have all the data before\nwe are privy to it anyway\"-G.

The author shows you, with examples, on how to find these\npotential stocks.

Elizabeth Burchard's story offers insight into her vulnerability, her manipulation into the world of the cult, the techniques used by the cult leader to control her, and the ways that Judy Carlone helped her to leave. By suggesting these insights, this book helps to dispel some of the common myths of cult membership.The first myth is that individuals who are involved in cults are less bright than most people. Elizabeth Burchard is clearly an intelligent person. She is a class valedictorian, a graduate of Swarthmore, and a successful businesswoman. Her involvement with George Sharkman and his group was not caused by her lack of intelligence, but by the manipulation of a malevolent man who took advantage of her at a time of vulnerability in her life.The second myth that this book helps to invalidate is the belief that individuals who join cults are always seekers by nature who look for someone to guide them. Although, in truth, the portrait she paints of her mother may suggest that the mother was looking for such a guru, Elizabeth was not. She was looking for relief from depression and overeating complaints that are not uncommon. Had she found a legitimate therapist to help her to overcome these problems, chances are that she would moved on with her life. Unfortunately she was introduced to George Sharkman, a cruel madman, who portrayed himself as a professional and who took advantage of her vulnerability.A legitimate helping professional helps his or her patients to recognize that they have the power within themselves to overcome their issues. The therapist helps the patients to develop and use their own resources. An unscrupulous or cultist therapist (or, in this case, pseudo-therapist) indicates that only he or she has the key to help the patient and attempts to make the patient feel less strong, less able and less independent. The beginning place is the same an individual who is in some kind of pain and who is looking for relief from that pain. It was Elizabeth's misfortune not her wish or her personality flaw that she encountered an individual who would use her desire to better herself against her and who would use manipulative techniques and interpretations to keep her dependent.Another myth that the general public believes about cult members is that most of them join a cult because the cult's bizarre belief system somehow makes sense to the cultist. Elizabeth Burchard is not a person who accepts irrational beliefs without question. The reader of this book will recognize that she often questioned, and sometimes challenged, the outlandish beliefs promulgated in her cult. That fact may cause some readers to wonder why Elizabeth stayed in the cult, even though she recognized the invalidity of some of the doctrines. One of this book's virtues is that it honestly portrays the simultaneous repulsion and appeal of the cult.In fact, most cult members do not adopt the belief system of the cult because it makes sense to them. Instead, they adopt it because the group seems to have something they want a sense of belonging, a certainty, a feeling of sameness of purpose. The cult leader's manipulation is aimed only partially at convincing the cult member to adopt a new belief system. Even more significantly, the manipulation is aimed at convincing them not to trust their instincts and their own knowledge. Sharkman refers to the \"old\" (i.e. healthy, reality-based) way of thinking as \"The Program.\" He interprets his followers' aversion to stealing, sense of loyalty to family or desire to decide for themselves with whom they wish to be intimate, as examples of their old, outmoded way of thinking. This tactic of denigrating pre-cult logical thinking is universal among cult leaders and is a necessary step in the process of destroying the cult member's sense of integrity and autonomy. Elizabeth never fully accepted the absurdities that Sharkman tried to get her to adopt. However, he was able to convince her to suspend her logic and beliefs just enough to accept the possibility that his world view may have merit. Once she accepted that possibility, she was able to rationalize her continued involvement with the guru.Finally, and perhaps most importantly to anyone who has a loved one in a cult, it is enlightening to examine the way that Judy Carlone coaxed Elizabeth out of the cult. The myth involved here is that simply by identifying the absurdity of the cult's beliefs and doctrines, the cult member will be persuaded to leave. The mistake made by many parents of cult members is simply to confront the cultist with facts: \"This is a cult You've been manipulated  You're being harmed by your membership.\" Pointing out the validity of these facts, by itself, is rarely enough to bring about the self-examination necessary for a cult member to leave. Usually, a more efficacious approach is the patient watchful waiting adopted by Judy. If she had pointed out every inconsistency and absurdity each time she recognized them, Elizabeth may have been scared off early in the relationship. Instead, Judy focused upon building her relationship with Elizabeth. Then, by asking well-timed questions and pointing out discrepancies in the doctrine, Judy helped Elizabeth to bring to consciousness the doubts and contradictions that Elizabeth had recognized, but had taught herself to ignore. There is a lesson in Judy's patience for individuals who have lost a loved one to a cult.This book is valuable for the honesty of its authors and for the insights it inspires, as well as for the story itself. It is a fascinating account of an individual's journey into an exploitive cult and the friendship that helped her, eventually, to find within herself the courage to leave.William Goldberg, ACSW,  May 2005", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Koon lives in Spring City, Tennessee, and works in a specialized form of security.  He is an ordained minister, husband to his lovely redhead Kay, his wife of 39 years, a father of three, and a grandfather of thirteen, a professional firearms instructor, a Hunter Safety Education Instructor, and an avid backpacker. Growing up as an Army brat, having someplace to call home, a real home, had always been a dream.  During the four years he attended high school at Alexandria-Monroe High School in Alexandria, Indiana, his father did two tours of duty in Viet Nam and one tour as an Army Recruiter so he could remain in one place during those critical high school years. Alexandria became the long sought after place to call home. Though he has been a Tennessee resident for the last 22 years, he still fondly remembers the old home place of his father, and his father’s grandparents in Summitville, Indiana. The woods across from their home were the setting of many a childhood adventure and mystery. The silo? It really existed and stood until a few years ago. Yes, he actually parked under it too, once. And yes, his great grandmother, Daisy Koon, was a spiritualist medium, well known in three states for her gifts.  It was life around her and that quaint but often mysterious farm that gave rise to this series. Oh, and one more thing, by her own testimony, Red Star was Daisy’s real spirit guide.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Across the country stations have been bulldozed and rails ripped up.  Once the heart of communities large and small, stations and tracks have left little more than a gaping hole in Canada's landscapes.  This book revisits the times when railways were the country's economic lifeline, and the station the social centre.  Here was where we worked, played, listened to political speeches, or simply said goodbye to loved ones never knowing when they would return. The landscapes which grew around the station are also explored and include such forgotten features as station hotels, restaurants, gardens and the once common railway YMCA. Railway companies often hired the world's leading architects to design grand station buildings which ranged in style from chateau-esque to art deco. Even small town stations and wayside shelters displayed an artistic flare and elegance.  Although most have vanished, the book celebrates the survival of that heritage in stations which have been saved or indeed remain in use.  The book will appeal to anyone who has links with our rail era, or who simply appreciates the value of Canada's built heritage.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There are still some minor typing errors. 2. Some points in the book are repeated in different paragraphs perhaps as a means of emphasizing them? 3. There are no page numbers and it becomes hard for some one reading to know where he has stopped.4. I wish you could use some pictorial illustrations in some chapters like design tips.

Previously he spent eight years at Columbus High School in Columbus, Georgia, where he was assistant baseball and football coach to Bobby Howard. He was also head coach for fast-pitch softball. Coach Oliver's teams have been state contenders many times and five of Columbus High's baseball teams were state champions while Coach Oliver was on the Howard staff. His 2000 fast-pitch softball team won the first state championship ever for the Harris County school system. Ed's passion for wildlife has been a lifelong affair. He is a conservationist first and foremost, and a longtime student of the white-tailed deer. Ed shot a huge buck in 1989 that appeared on the cover of Georgia Sportsman magazine. He has also been featured in several other wildlife publications. Having long been a pioneer for what he calls, \"Give the young one's a chance\" Ed was an early proponent of Quality Deer Management (QDM) \"I'm not a great hunter by any stretch of the imagination\" Ed says. \"Instead I'm a man who has a great appreciation and love for whitetails and for the great outdoors. The chase, the challenge, and the associations I've had with other hunters are the things that are most important to me\" Ed has been married for 43 years to Martha Jo Reese, of Cordele, Georgia. They have four children: Susan (deceased) Spence, Sim and Bess. The two boys have been very much a part of Ed's deer-hunting experiences and he declares, \"There is absolutely nothing more rewarding than hunting with your sons on a cold crisp morning. Sharing the peaceful solitude of daybreak and the world of nature coming alive around you, builds bonds that are difficult to equal\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book belongs on the shelves of every U.S. museum with archaeological collections, and on the reading list of every curator and collection manager who deal with those collections. And the reading lists of Federal and State agencies which oversee the care of old collections and production of new collections. (Museum Anthropology)Curating Archaeological Collections, by Lynne P.

From her experience in college as a peer counselor and her volunteer work with women's shelters, she was inspired to write contemporary romance with social issues for women, new adults, young adults, and teens. Having faced adversity, including battling stereotypes and bullying, Kailin Gow has become a well-known speaker and figure in media. Her adventurous bold spirit has taken her around the world, where she has ridden on top of elephants through jungles, hand-fed sting rays, studied kung fu from a Shaolin Temple monk, and learned cooking from a celebrity chef.Compelled to write her first fiction book because of 9/11, Kailin Gow now has over 100 fiction books published with a handful of non-fiction books.She has over 20 Series, written under Kailin Gow:***For 16 and up***The Frost SeriesThe Wolf Fey SeriesFairy Rose Chronicles - age 13 and up.The PULSE SeriesFADE SeriesDESIRE SeriesFire Wars SeriesAlchemists AcademyWordwick GamesWicked Woods SeriesSteampunk ScarlettThe Phantom DiariesStoker SistersBeyond Crystal River - 2014***For 18 and up (New Adult/Coming of Age)***Loving SummerThe Donovan BrothersSaving You Saving Me (You & Me Trilogy)Never KnightsRock Hard Musical - Coming in 2014Sawyer House Chronicles (Spin-off of You & Me Trilogy) - Coming in 2014For information on the series, new series and new book releases, contests, appearances, and more, sign up at theEDGEbooks.com.@kailingowfacebook.com/KailinGowBooks", "related": [], "rank": 682854, "title": "FADE OMNIBUS (Books 1 through 4) (FADE Series) eBook", "author": "Kailin Gow", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Zingers are planted like slalom poles on every page (e.g., \"The poor man was obviously suffering from acquired situational narcissism, an affliction one catches from always thinking he is the most important person in the room. There is no known cure, but the Alec Baldwin Foundation is raising research funds\"), and more than half are worth reading out loud. And even though the story—former Aspen resident Jake Holmes goes off to Los Angeles, makes millions writing for TV shows likeThe Rockford Files, spends all of it on booze and drugs, slinks home where the only work he can find is as a private detective looking for the missing daughter of a mega-wealthy woman—would probably never make it to pilot, Hasburgh gives Holmes enough colorful company (including a giant malamute named Winston) to ease readers down the slopes while hoping for a more original narrative next time.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Thayer's plodding narrative focuses on Sara's ritual temperature-taking and calendar-watching and her monthly disappointments. Her frustrationsjealousy of all child-bearing women and especially of Mary, Steve's bitchily fertile former girlfriendboil up into accusations against her hapless husband. Then Sara finds a fascinating story about a Kansas farm girl turned international temptress interpolated among the otherwise uninteresting pages of a novel she is editing, recognizes its enormous literary merit and autobiographical verisimilitude, forces her way into the writer's reclusive presence and sees the rewritten novel through to its prize-winning publication. Two further happy events ensue, which will not surprise readers of Thayer's (Stepping) romances. Here, the prose verges on the insipid and the characters resemble Barbie dolls.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
