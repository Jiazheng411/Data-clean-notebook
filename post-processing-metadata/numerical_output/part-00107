It's about the importance of linking rewards and appreciation to standards of excellence. It's about why encouragement is absolutely essential to sustaining people's commitment to organizations and outcomes. It's about the hard work it takes to get extraordinary things done in organizations, and it's about ways to enhance your own ability in--and comfort with--recognizing and celebrating the achievements of others.The book's opening section introduces their concept of the caring leader; the second outlines their \"seven essential principles\" for encouraging workers; the third explains how the process can be personalized and describes 150 additional suggestions for implementing it.--Howard Rothman", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Outraged, she escapes to Two Rivers, another Bookish Community, where she earns the enmity of Thomas, a conservative religious reformer. She meets and falls in love with Luke, who is forced to flee with his grandparents because of their philosophical disagreements with Thomas. She goes to the big bad City, where she finds her runaway brother leading a Dickensian gang of young cutthroats and part-time prostitutes. She gains an ally in Edge, a girl who defends herself with a knife, but seeing that life there is a dead end, Alis eventually returns home and meekly submits to marriage to Galen. She is relieved that he does not force her to sleep with him, and life continues apace until Edge shows up, is startled by Galen's sudden appearance, and fatally wounds him. Thomas soon accumulates enough circumstantial evidence to charge Alis with murder, setting up the climactic trial. The story may be compelling to the intended audience, but the plot winds back on itself overmuch, with many characters, some of whom are stereotyped as \"good\" or \"bad\" as much by their physical description as by their actions, dropped by the wayside. While sexual undercurrents, hypocrisy, and religious repression dominate the tale, in the end Alis and Luke ride off into exile a bit older and perhaps more worldly-wise, but little different, really, than if they'd done so 100 pages earlier.—Joel Shoemaker, Southeast Junior High School, Iowa City, IACopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1884 she married Charles Water Stetson. After giving birth, Charlotte sank into a deep depression. She entered a sanitarium in Philadelphia to undergo the 'rest cure', a controversial treatment, which forbade any type of physical activity or intellectual stimulation. 1892, she published the now-famous story 'The Yellow Wall-Paper'. In 1898, her most famous nonfiction book, Women and Economics, was published.  With its publication, and subsequent translation into seven languages, Gilman earned international acclaim. In 1900, she married her first cousin, George Houghton Gilman. Over the next thirty-five years, she wrote and published hundreds of stories and poems and more than a dozen books.      Denise D. Knight is a professor of English at the State University of New York at Courtland, where she specializes in nineteenth-century American Literature.

In Detective Laura McCallister's latest case, a husband and father missing only a few days is found drowned in his car, in the pond, at a city park. No clues at first, no reason for his death. Was it an accident, suicide, or worse? Soon McCallister, as she is known in the department, finds herself drenched in clues, too many to sort out clearly.The victim was a devoted, loving husband and father, but the investigation soon uncovers an Internet horror blog titled -Corpse Call- which sports fiction from the corpse's viewpoint. Or is it fiction? McCallister diligently follows the trail laid out by this mysterious killer, whose goal seems at first to taunt the police department, and soon seems deeper and more intent. What is the killer after, and why is he or she directing McCallister to victims killed seventeen years earlier?Laura McCallister is a tough-talking, hardened homicide investigator, with a spin. A lesbian in a committed, long- term relationship, she is determined not to let her career overpower her home life. She and partner Holly strive to keep an enviable balance between relationship and work. Their friends Kate and Claudia also portray a similar situation, as Kate is a journalist with a very unusual past which comes to light as McCallister decides to elicit Kate's assistance in the investigation. Ms. Wraight's characters are well-developed and as likely as our own friends and family. She superbly unravels the multiple subplots and delivers each new clue in her mystery with a punch. Readers will delight in this newest Detective Laura McCallister mystery, and like this reviewer, will rush to find the earlier novels in the series. Corpse Call is a re-reader for mystery fans, aficionados of character novels, and readers of excellent lesbian fiction.Reviewed by Rainbow Reviews", "related": [], "rank": 1629177, "title": "Corpse Call [A Detective Laura McCallister Lesbian Mystery]", "author": "Rosalyn Wraight", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Soon after finding the letter, Lara and Mark discover a secret room in Lara's house, but their plans for exploring the hidden space get pushed aside once Lara and Mark realize they both have very different views as to how Lara's home should be restored. It will take the jealous ghost of Geoffrey himself, who has been cursed to roam the earth as punishment for his own romantic sins, to bring these two feuding lovers together.

At the end of that trilogy (which includesThe Beauty Bride,The Rose Red BrideandThe Snow White Bride), Rosamunde was lost in the realm of the Fae. I was always fond of Rosamunde, the pirate queen,  and had intended to save her, but with the series brought to an end by the publisher, there was no way for me to do so.When I was invited to participate in theMammoth Book of Irish Romance, I realized that Rosamunde could have her story told there. It would have to be shorter to fit in the anthology, but at least it would be told. As it was, I maxed out the available word count, and the version of the story included in that anthology was cut for space constraints. The entire story is available in this digital-only edition. It is also included in the digitalJewels of Kinfairlie Boxed Set, and included as a bonus read in the new trade paperback edition ofThe Snow White Bridefor those who prefer their books in print.In 2012, I returned to Kinfairlie to continue the stories of the other siblings. This is a very exciting opportunity.The True Love Brides seriestakes us back to Kinfairlie after Alexander has declared that his younger siblings can marry for love. The portal to the realm of the Fae that always existed at Kinfairlie and Ravensmuir has also opened wider, partly due to Rosamunde's adventures. These books are medieval romances with paranormal elements. The new series begins withThe Renegade's Heart, which is Isabella's story, then continues withThe Highlander's Curse, which is Annelise's story. Next up will be Malcolm's story,The Frost Maiden's Kiss. (Rosamunde is past due for a cameo appearance, I think!) You will find a cast of characters in the back of theTrue Love Bridesbooks, whether you have the print or digital edition.If you are interested in the background of Kinfairlie and Ravensmuir, both of those fictional Scottish holdings were introduced in my medieval romance trilogy,The Rogues of Ravensmuir(The Rogue,The ScoundrelandThe Warrior). These three books are also available inThe Rogues of Ravensmuir Boxed Set, which makes it more economical to catch up. You do not have to read theRogues of Ravensmuirbefore you read theJewels of Kinfairlie, although you will see more connections between the characters if you do.I hope you enjoy the story of Rosamunde, my pirate queen, and that it tempts you to visit Kinfairlie and Ravensmuir again.All my best -Claire", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.6667, "rating_total": 22.0}

It will guide you to translate your daily tasks and those of your employees to the achievement of the dreams and aspirations of your business. To begin this process let s get a basic understanding of what you will be reading. The good, the bad and the troubled are employee assessment categories that are defined by an employee s performance related to the objective expectations written in the Primary Responsibilities Sheet. With these three categories Mr. Arroyo describes with remarkable clarity and brevity the methods to use them to develop your business towards the achievement of the company s vision and the employees towards maximizing their potential. The key is that the responsibilities that define the categories flow from an unbroken, objective chain through all levels of hierarchy and through the mission straight to the vision. Each goal at all levels is designed to advance the company towards the vision. Finally, what I particularly admire about Mr. Arroyo and his philosophy outlined in these pages is that he never loses sight of the importance of compassion while still emphasizing the need for firm, decisive and timely action focused on attaining results. Underneath it all we are talking about human relationships after all. Now, if you are anything like me your company has a vision and a mission but you would have a hard time clearly tying your and your employees job descriptions and goals to the achievement of them. At WorldNet our vision is to Transform the business world to one where financially successful companies are uncompromisingly living excellence, integrity, caring and teamwork. Yet, our goals, our daily activities and our evaluation process have not been targeted to achieving this. There has been no clear line linking our daily activities to the accomplishment of our vision. Our evaluation system was based primarily on different subjective criteria depending which department or group in which an employee works. We have done the best we can and are very conscientious about living the words of our vision but have found it a confusing and an insurmountable task as our company has grown to two hundred employees. And then we began work with Mr. Arroyo and have begun implementing the Primary Responsibilities Sheets and method of evaluation that goes with them outlined in this book. While it is too early in the implementation phase to see the results throughout all levels of the company, some remarkable things have already occurred. First, the overwhelm I felt at trying to implement our vision and mission has lifted like fog in the afternoon sun. Second, my energy and passion have increased as my focus has clarified and sharpened. Finally, my anticipation and anxiety have grown, as well as I can see plainly the dysfunction within my company, although very good as per traditional standards, relative to the extraordinary results that I see as possible. While this last observation may be frustrating it is also exciting to see the potential again. I must point out that Mr. Arroyo s method of using the Primary Responsibilities Sheet and assessments categories for your employees as a living instrument to guide, focus and control your company is not magic nor is it a quick fix. It is a well structured model for success synthesized from years of study and real world experience. If you are serious about achieving extraordinary results this is a powerful tool to use. It is very simple, but it is not easy. As I am, you will have to do the work to realize the results. But, the journey is much of the fun when the goal is the attainment of your vision! I hope you use this as I am...and keep your ears open to hear news about WorldNet s success. --David L.

Her love of reading and movies encouraged Ann to start writing at an early age but after starting a family and with a busy career writing was put on the back burner.  The character Sahara Driver was first conceived while Ann was living full time in Dubai and the concept for The Guardian’s Chronicles took root a short time later.  Once the idea was in place she wrote the first draft for A New Dawn in under 3 months and after a break of almost a year because of family commitments she completed A World Without Faith in around the same time period. The complete series is scheduled to be complete by mid 2012. Ann has traveled extensively and become familiar with many different cultures.

In defiance of a particularly horrible death, or, at the very least, severe lung injury, these untested Canadians fought almost continuously for four days, often hand-to-hand, as they clung stubbornly against overwhelming odds to a vital part of the Allied line after the French units on their left fled in panic. By doing so, they saved 50,000 troops in the Ypres salient from almost certain destruction, and, in addition, prevented the momentum of the war from tipping in favour of the Germans.In this new, deeply researched account, the distinguished military historian George H. Cassar skillfully blends into the history of the battle the graphic and moving words of the men on the front line. Illustrated with outstanding photographs and numerous maps, and drawing from diaries, letters, and documents from every level of planning,Hell in Flanders Fieldsis an authoritative, gripping drama of politics, strategy, and human courage.\"Cassars account is nonetheless extremely detailed and provides excellent insight into an otherwise confusing battle that was shrouded in poison gas.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Caught for eternity in compromising situations, some creatures, such as the gargoyle, wax melancholy. \"How can a beast fly/with stone wings?/I fly when the bells ring/and the hunchback is home.\" As inYellow Elephant: A Bright Bestiary(Harcourt, 2006), this bright compendium pairs each poem with a richly drawn and colored scene. An element from the painting is echoed in a decorative letter announcing the poem's title. Though brief, the selections sometimes carry sophisticated cultural references, making this title more relevant to an older audience than the earlier collection. Of the thunderbird, for instance, Larios writes, \"Cedar scented,/he carries the wind/in his bent beak./Rainmaker./Whale hunter./Great Tlingit chief.\" The final page carries a brief paragraph describing the area of origin and the behavior of each creature. It's all a quick and alluring peek at some of the best-known denizens of folklore. Storytellers and classroom teachers will find many uses for these poetic nuggets and the art, both of which will be savored by folklore and fantasy readers of all ages.—Margaret Bush, Simmons College, BostonCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He served in the Royal Engineers (popularly known as 'sappers') from 1907-19, being awarded the Military Cross during World War 1.He started writing in France, adopting a pen name because serving officers were not allowed to write under their own names. When his first stories, about life in the trenches, were published in 1915, they were an enormous success. But it was his first thriller, Bulldog Drummond (1920) that launched him as one of the most popular novelists of his generation. It had several amazingly successful sequels, including The Black Gang, The Third Round and The Final Count. Another great success was Jim Maitland (1923), featuring a footloose English sahib in foreign lands.Sapper published nearly thirty books in total, and a vast public mourned his death when he died in 1937, at the early age of forty-eight. So popular was his 'Bulldog Drummond' series that his friend, the late Gerard Fairlie, wrote several Bulldog Drummond stories after his death under the same pen name, which had by then become synonymous with fast-paced, intelligent thrillers and complex, vibrant characters.", "related": ["B00C1M1G3U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Two years later, while working in the Lynn shoe factories, he and about 30 friends from his neighborhood signed on to fight the Forgotten War in Korea. Ken spent three years and three months in the air force, his last year on a filthy, rat-infested Korean mountain top lacking basic refrigeration and sanitation facilities. Following his discharge in December of 1953, he spent the next three years battling tuberculosis, a nearly fatal condition that left him a disabled veteran. Ken went on to earn his GED and graduate from the Salem Commercial School with a business diploma in 1958. From there he entered the civil service, retiring after 30 years in the computer field. Ken is a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post # 507 in Lynn, MA, was post commander from 1993-1994, and marches proudly with his fellow veterans in the Memorial Day parade every May through the streets of Lynn.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fitzpatrick, US Review \"I have known the burden of incubating a creative spirit like a caterpillar blooms a butterfly, and felt its struggle to release into a strange new phase of life \" These poems follow a young woman's exploration of her inner landscape that inescapably melds with the outer landscape of nature. She wants to find stasis, security, and certainty with the right man, to fall in love. The pain of failure in this launches her into a search for meaning. The first section deals with her loss of her love and subsequent refuge in the sea, in roses, in butterflies. The butterfly farm she visits leads her to a dialogue with a man who tells her she is like a butterfly in love. He becomes \"Blue Morpho,\" a correspondent who she touches base with throughout. This metaphor of change, of morphogenesis, becomes a central symbol in the next three parts. Her search for love and the accompanying pain and confusion finds metaphoric solace in this symbol. This kind of poetry may be reminiscent of countless poems and novels in the romantic tradition. It avoids cliche by not taking refuge in wish fulfillment or fantasy. It is unabashedly honest and therefore brave, making the words shine with a brilliance that comes naturally with naked feeling. This kind of bare-handed slogging through the brambles and thorn bushes of emotion is almost at odds with artistry or artifice. That the author manages distancing through use of nature and its processes is instinctively right. It is only where the language becomes too precious, too poetic, that we feel she errs. But she errs very little. For the most part, the power of her language strikes up against the limits of speech. That is poetry. --US Review of Books", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His short stories are among the finest of the 19th century. He successfully experimented with several literary genres and was the first to employ Western settings in Gothic fiction. He joined the Union Army and actively fought in the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865. After resigning from the army, he wrote and edited various local journals including The San Francisco News Letter, The Argonaut, and The Wasp. He became West Coast's leading writer and critic. Bierce is renowned for his ghost and war stories, the latter being based on his own experiences. He also wrote poetry but his most famous work is The Devil's Dictionary. Originally a newspaper serial, it was published in book form in 1906 under the title The Cynic's Word Book. His other well-known writings include An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, A Little of Chickamauga, On a Mountain, Three and One are One, Two Military Executions, My Favourite Murder, and A Watcher by the Dead. Bierce's end is as intriguing as his books. In 1913, he went on a tour of old Civil War battlegrounds and after a letter to a friend written in December of the same year, vanished without a trace. His disappearance remains an unsolved mystery to this day.", "related": ["B009NNTUBA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I jotted a few down and wrote a diary for three characters. I thought about their personalities to give myself a clear picture in my head of who they were. Then I started to write. The more I wrote on paper, the more ideas I got.I never intended to write a book; it was just something to do when I wasn't out with my family and friends. When it was completed, I looked through it and that was that. From then on, I was on a mission to get this book published.When RoseDog Books accepted my manuscript, I was so happy.

All of my team experienced this passion and desire when they were starting out and it is what allowed them to develop into elite athletes and enjoy the success they have had. This book is a great read for all gymnasts and fans alike. It certainly brought back a lot of great memories for me. I highly endorse it. --Bill Ryden, Head Coach, University of Arizona Gymnastics\"I'm gonna land on my head,\" worries Morgan, the young female gymnast and storyteller in the bookGym Rats: Basic Training. Morgan loves gymnastics at the Gym Club and is working her way up to competition level along with her best friend, Madison. The two are so close that their coach, Deb, calls them \"Gym\" (Madison) and \"Rat\" (Morgan). The girls don't mind the teasing because they know it's all in fun. The first book in a series about the sport,Gym Ratsis written for children and pre-teens interested in gymnastics. While the story revolves around Morgan and Madison, who practice three and four days a week, encourage each other and fellow class members, and write notes to each other in the notebook the two \"gym rats\" share, author Mary Reiss also provides coaching tips and instructions to readers about one of the most demanding sports. In this story Morgan is afraid of doing a round-off back handspring without being spotted (helped) by the coach. As the book progresses, so does Morgan, as she conquers her fear. The story is followed by sections called \"Coaches Corner\" and \"Drills to Skills,\" helpful tips for understanding the sport, plus a glossary of gymnastics terms. For boys and girls in the elementary years who are already avid gymnasts or who would like to be, this book is bound to please. Written in simple, understandable language, this is a good resource for gymnastics centers and libraries as well. This is an uncomplicated book, with simple plot and characters. A third-grader gymnast who whipped right through the book offered equally uncomplicated praise: she pronounced it \"good.\" --ForeWord Reviews", "related": ["B00AR3NF66"], "rank": 1803847, "title": "Gym Rats", "author": "Mary Reiss", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was a sailor, an airman, a journalist, a travel courier, a cartoonist, and a history teacher. After turning to full-time writing, he wrote adventure stories, war novels, political thrillers, and also created a sequence of crime novels around the quirky French Chief Inspector Pel, centered primarily in Burgundy, but occasionally Paris and elsewhere. Harris was unusually versatile and wide ranging as an author. Epics such asChina Seasand the three trilogies written under the pseudonym Max Hennessy, along with African adventure novels, wide-ranging crime, mysteries, and historical fiction, all guarantee a library of diverse and entertaining reading full of dry wit and gripping prose.", "related": ["B00F2T2W46"], "rank": 1677637, "title": "The Challenging Heights", "author": "Max Hennessy", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I don't outline a story on paper because I don't want to ruin the finish for me. The few plots I've laid out ahead of time have never made it to print. I get bored because I know how the story is going to end ahead of time.I make notes as I go and \"fly by the seat of my pants\" from there. I have a basic mental idea of what I'm going to do but nothing is written in stone. My first book was an expansion of a short story I wrote many moons ago. (That short story is in my free book at Smashwords \"Strange Short Tales\" and titled \"Diary of a Grave Mistake.\" There's a stark contrast in how the short ends compared to the book.. but it's a good stand alone short story that will not ruin the ending of \"The Beginning. (Whispering Pines Book One.)\"My second book in the Whispering Pines series (The Revenge) was a pure spin off of the first.. but while writing Revenge, I started a sub plot that kept growing until it was distracting from the main plot. I ripped it out and that became my third book, \"Rebel Gold.\" While writing Rebel Gold, another sub plot grew too large and that became my fourth book, \"Cotton Tears.\" (etc etc on down to book six, \"The Garden Patch\" which started me down the yellow brick road to book seven that is under construction, tentatively titled \"Permuda Grass.\" (An intentional misspelling of Bermuda grass, but it's how southern children pronounce it.)As for my forte.. I've never been comfortable writing mystery/fiction.. or horror.. or humor.. although all three genres I've used in print with good success. If readers are looking for something under \"Wells Brand\" then it would be plain, rated PG, fun to read books and stories and a rather wide berth for genre.

I use a variety of methods. Some I drop from a great height, others I drown, but I've nothing against suffocation, poisoning or simply battering a person to death. As long as it grabs my reader's attention, I'm satisfied. I've written several novels and short stories. My first novel, 'Palm Trees in the Pyrenees' is set in a small town in France. It is published by Author Way Limited. Author Way has already published the next three novels in the series, 'Grass Grows in the Pyrenees,''Red Light in the Pyrenees' and 'Dead End in the Pyrenees.' It has also recently published my grittier crime novel set in Glasgow, 'The Unravelling of Thomas Malone'as well as a collaboration of short stories called 'Twists and Turns'. As I live in a small French town in the Eastern Pyrenees, I get inspiration from the way of life and the colourful characters I come across. I don't have to search very hard to find things to write about and living in the most prolific wine producing region in France makes the task so much more delightful. When I first arrived in this region I was lulled by the gentle pace of life, the friendliness of the people and the simple charm of the place. But dig below the surface and, like people and places the world over, the truth begins to emerge. Petty squabbles, prejudice, jealousy and greed are all there waiting to be discovered. Oh, and what joy in that discovery. So, as I sit in a café, or stroll by the riverside, or walk high into the mountains in the sunshine I greet everyone I meet with a smile and a 'Bonjour' and, being a friendly place, they return the greeting. I people watch as I sip my wine or when I go to buy my baguette. I discover quirkiness and quaintness around every corner. I try to imagine whether the subjects of my scrutiny are nice or nasty and, once I've decided, some of those unsuspecting people, a very select few, I kill. Perhaps you will visit my town one day. Perhaps you will sit near me in a café or return my smile as I walk past you in the street. Perhaps you will hold my interest for a while, and maybe, just maybe, you will be my next victim. But don't concern yourself too much, because, at least for the time being, I always manage to confine my murderous ways to paper. Read books from the 'Death in the Pyrenees' series, enter my small French town and meet some of the people who live there ----- and die there.", "related": ["B0096A5K9Q"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Thomas writes love stories involving professional athletes, taking both male and female readers into another side of the lives of ballplayers, their need for steady, real love. The fact that they are well-developed love stories appeals to female readers. The sports and in depth way Thomas handles the ball players and their private times in the locker rooms, before and after games, delights male readers as well as females who either have played sports, love sports or have a natural curiosity. Other authors have touched on pro athletes but none have the credentials to impress readers like Thomas Green. He has played all the sports he writes about, both competitively and for fun. He played semi-pro baseball and football in New York. Thomas has traveled across the country, and to the Caribbean, to play in baseball tournaments. Thomas was a sports reporter in New York, working for the New York Post, The Gannett Westchester Newspapers and The City Sun, a Black-owned weekly newspaper. He has covered all levels of sporting events, from high school to professional. He uses his many varied experiences in playing ball, covering athletes and trying to fall in love to weave readable, likable characters with strong storylines that readers relate to and enjoy.", "related": [], "rank": 4420225, "title": "When It Hurts so Bad", "author": "Thomas  Green Jr.", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Herald, The St. Petersburg Times, The Miami Herald, The (Allentown) Morning Call and The Warren (Ohio) Tribune.  He found his niche in journalism when he became publisher of a group of weekly newspapers in Connecticut and New York. This is where he honed his skills as an inventive leader while struggling on a weekly basis to increase revenues. After four years as publisher of The Housatonic Valley Publishing Co., the newspapers were recognized for their journalistic excellence. The lead newspaper, The New Milford Times, was named the best weekly in New England. During his 10 years with the company, he fine-tuned his belief that financial resources do not determine quality. Instead, inventive brainpower lies at the root of creative and, ultimately, financial success. These years honed and prepared him for traveling the world where he taught journalists, who generally perform their work with minimal resources, how to achieve journalistic excellence.", "related": ["B008B8XG18"], "rank": 2857055, "title": "Now, We Begin eBook", "author": "Robert S.

In third grade she was diagnosed with dyslexia which made reading and writing difficult. It wasn’t until she reached her senior year of high school when her English teacher took the time to show and explain the rules of writing that she caught the bug to write. Her friends had always told her she was creative in story telling, but it wasn’t until then she believed them. During her freshman year in college another professor helped open her eyes to writing fiction but it wasn’t until her twenties that she decided to write a novel. After an attempt at a short story her friends encouraged her to continue the story and a few years later ( after many late nights of writing) Remember Me was finished. Harlee never had any of intention of making the story a series until several years later an idea for the sequel came to her out of the blue. After a quick six months of writing Forget Me Not was finished. Again she swore there would be no more to the story but as luck would have it, there was more to the story and the third and final installment to the series is now being written. When she isn't writing Harlee is busy being a mother of her four kids. She has a few other ideas for story series that could follow this story in the future, but for now she has plenty to do.", "related": ["B00BTK56G8"], "rank": 3846867, "title": "Remember Me", "author": "Harlee Mills", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Morris began her career in politics and then moved to the private sector. She has more than twenty-five years' experience across all areas of communications in a wide range of industries, including chemical, financial services, health care, insurance, technology, pharmaceutical, energy, and maritime. Her specialty is leadership communications-the strategy; messaging; storytelling; executive writing, speech writing, coaching, and counsel; issues management; and creative initiatives that get people's attention, capture their imaginations, and help them align themselves inside the company (employee engagement) and out. Her focus is on communications as a strategic business tool to persuade and motivate people to align with the long-term objectives of the business. Michelle consults with executives at large, medium, and small companies to help them build and get where they wish to go faster and more effectively. She lives in southeastern Connecticut with her family. Torin M. Lee has had several incarnations within her more-than-fifteen-year career, including campaign field worker, health educator, public relations officer, and employee engagement consultant. Both inside and outside corporate walls, her main focus has been to find creative solutions to make a difference to her target stakeholders as well as the people for whom she works. With a self-professed short attention span, Torin understands the modern worker, what they are interested in, and how they want to get their information-all within the context of a fast-paced world of sound bites that compete for attention in and out of the workplace. Her execution of compelling initiatives that persuade and influence is highly targeted and focused. She enjoys motivating frontline employees and proving how the power of the people really can and does work in any environment. Torin lives in eastern Connecticut with her husband.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Grade 6-9 - This adult author's hilarious, dark Northern Irish wit, penchant for action-packed mayhem, sense of irony, and snappy dialogue are all evident in this first of a planned trilogy for children. Eddie Malone, 12, and his mother have just moved to the roughest, toughest part of Belfast, a housing project \"run\" by a gang of street urchins who call themselves the Reservoir Pups. Eddie unintentionally gets mixed up with them and rashly agrees to break into the hospital where his mother works and steal the security codes. In the process, he overhears a kidnapping plot. After some misunderstandings, he realizes that the scheme involves stealing a dozen babies from the hospital. The pace of the plot is frenetic as Eddie hooks up with Mo, a girl from the rival gang. The story takes a deliciously gruesome turn as the two of them find the babies inside a hollowed out mountain where a team of underground scientists conduct experiments all aimed at keeping Ireland's richest woman young. After a madcap chase and narrow misses, the infants are rescued and Eddie and Mo are national heroes. It is no surprise that Bateman is a scriptwriter for television and movies as this outrageously comic caper reads like a film, rapidly moving from cliff-hanger to cliff-hanger. Readers will get caught up in the swiftness of the action and in the intriguing turns of the baby-napping plot and the sci-fi twist. But mostly they will identify with the appealing Eddie, whose intentions are good but who bungles everything yet still lands on his feet.- Connie Tyrrell Burns, Mahoney Middle School, South Portland, MECopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, Christians need to know that they are seated in the heavenly realms in Christ (Ephesians 1) and share in his spiritual authority over all the thrones, powers, rulers and authorities of the angelic and demonic realms. Thus, we overcome Satan by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of our testimony that Jesus Christ is Lord as stated in Revelation 12:11.I describe the means by which demons deceived me into receiving them into my body and the means by which I resisted and overcame them when I finally recognized their deception. The book also describes other ploys demons use to deceive and occupy both Christians and Pagans. In addition, I tell how to discern demonic affliction when it is suspected and how to deal with it when confirmed.When it comes to demonic affliction, never forget the Word of the Lord through the prophet Isaiah: \"So do not fear for I am with you; do not be dismayed for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand\" (41:10).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her book provides a searing indictment of the former Soviet authorities for what she perceives as cover-up and lies following the accident. . . . She outlines how the true impact of the accident—the victims, the radiation fallout, the dangers to civilians, the evacuations, and the clean-up work—was systematically concealed from the public. . . . The reader can only admire Yaroshinskaya’s courage and fortitude. . . . Plainly, Yaroshinskaya has vast knowledge about Chernobyl. . . must has been forgotten, and the author of this book is ideally placed to remind the public of its enormity.”—David R. Marples,The Russian Review“Russian journalist Yaroshinskaya has prepared an extensive, thorough account of the tragedy at Chernobyl. She documents a series of misinformation campaigns by the Soviet government to avoid responsibility and deny any wrongdoing in the disaster. The book, translated from the original Russian, is a wealth of personal stories and information on official meetings and conference proceedings that offer insight into Soviet-era politics and decision making. Another strength is that it continues the story into the 21st century and documents the tragedy of government inaction in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Belarus. Millions of people over decades have been lobbying for justice, compensation, and recognition for the people who have suffered as a result of Chernobyl. The disaster still poisons the region. The book serves as both a condemnation of nuclear power and an exposé of government duplicity. It is an invaluable resource for researchers, graduate students, and faculty interested in nuclear power policy, an anatomy of a disaster, or Soviet-era decision making. Summing Up: Highly  recommended. Graduate students and above; general readers.”—D. Ostergren,Choice“Alla A. Yaroshinskaya's CHERNOBYL: CRIME WITHOUT PUNISHMENT remedies a long-standing lack in the literature by reprinting original papers from Russian scientists describing the aftermath of the event, and is a 'must' for any collection strong in nuclear disaster analysis. It gathers firsthand accounts from those who lived through the disaster, and comes from a reporter who defied the Soviet bureaucracy to get this information out to the rest of the world. From the nuclear lobby inside and outside the former Soviet Union to government attempts to handle its aftermath, this is a powerful survey for any social issues or nuclear studies collection.”—The Bookwatch“Chernobyl 25 Years Later: Crime Without Punishmentis a pick for any college-level collection strong in environmental conservation and Russian studies, and synthesizes the few professional papers translated from Russian into English, going beyond the prior lack of detail to include discussions based on original sources published in Russian. The human effects of the disaster are charted, from accounts by those who lied through it to reporters who defied the Soviet bureaucracy to provide reports. Actions after the disaster chart ongoing snafus and dangers in a title that reviews the latest medical data on Chernobyl people's health and the lasting impact of Chernobyl on the modern world.”—CaliforniaBookwatch“[T]his book is a writer’s journey through the labyrinthine catastrophes of the Chernobyl nuclear plant meltdown. It explores not only the disaster itself, but the bureaucratic response to it and the difficulty of getting information out to the public.”—Natural Hazards Observer \"In this powerful condemnation of injustices suffered by Chernobyl victims for the past quarter century, the author provides volumes of the evidence about their suffering – and it is the only kind of evidence we should really need; that is, the stories of the victims and witnesses that reveal the health effects of the world’s worst radiological catastrophe.\"—Fukushima Update“With admirable courage and heroic persistence, the author overcomes strong barriers of government secrecy, lies, and cover-ups to bring to light a story of official arrogance and incompetence, resulting in tragic suffering and death from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.  A brilliant book and an essential read for anyone who cares about humanity’s future.”—David Krieger, president, Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, Santa Barbara, CA“We all know what to do in case of a volcano, earthquake, fire or flood! We’ve had eons of negative experiences to help us! But, surviving a nuclear disaster? Alla Yaroshinskaya has given a human face to Chernobyl, not a dry scientific, political, engineering or legalistic text. She is a skilled investigative reporter and front line victim of the disaster. I would rate this book as a must for survival in the nuclear age.

It is written somewhat humorous in areas and I think my dry sense of witty humour can be seen throughout the book.  More importantly are the people I have met along the road of my writing experience.  They have helped me to stay motivated and allowed me to believe that it aint over till the fat lady sings.

Her father worked within the oil industry and she spent much of her younger years travelling, finishing in Canada, where she attended, and graduated from St John High school in New Brunswick. Her love of the English language was due partly to the inspiration of her English Tutor. An Oxford Don, he despaired of the American/English idioms, and as she was the only English student in the school, found her a delight to teach. Spending another year in working in Canada, life then returned her to England and on to the remote Shetland Isles for three years. Following her return to the UK, she threw herself into Floristry for fifteen years, and her artistic talents took another turn when she picked up a pen for the first time to write her first dragon fantasy novel. It took another ten years and the passing of her artistic father, to discover her talent for painting. Setting out on a new path, she now paints celebrity portraits to raise money for charities. Through Face book in 2010 she met a friend who encouraged her to take up writing again, shortly after this inspiration which rekindled her spiritual beliefs, she met her (writing collaborator and co-conspirator) Keith David. They now combine their sensual words drawn from the depths of their souls, to captivate the imagination, and entice the reader to discover their innermost desires. Virginia, now residing on Madeira Island, Portugal, soon intends a final move to a small town in Texas where inspiration for the Heaven Scent trilogy originated.", "related": [], "rank": 1955938, "title": "Heaven Scent", "author": "Virginia Alison", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was ship's cook and in charge of provisioning (planning, buying, repackaging, cooking, freezing and stowing food for 28 days with emergency supplies for another 10). After sailing to Antigua, Neroli set off for the Azores but was forced into Bermuda by a generator fault. The opportunity to re-provision was welcomed and fully exploited. The Atlantic crossing was then completed in good order and with excellent food. Before and during the voyage, the author also had the task of maintaining Neroli's blog, excerpts from which (especially those related to life in the galley) are included in the book.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It`s followed by another novella, A Bunker Christmas, that changes tack completely as an old school SF post-apocalyptic tale unfolds, that gives more than a passing nod to War of the Worlds but with a modern twist that makes its compelling, human and in the end quite affecting.The collection is rounded off by another short that we find at the end of the book is a taster for one of his full length books, which I'll certainly be moving onto, and just goes to prove it's worth taking a kindle chance now and then, because you can find a gem :)Just to finish off on a couple of points- I found the info on Amazon.co.uk a bit sparse and I had for example to look on amazon.com for author information. Your work is good enough to shout about Mr McDonald, get yourself a website and plenty of self-promoting Amazon copy!! Also there were a few minor punctuation problems. Another go at editing would quickly sort them out though.So all n'all what a great little book. The author may be in his sixties and come late to writing, but thank goodness he did.

Relying on several earlier translations from Chinese, Dale lovingly renders the 81 sections into verse rather than prose. Accompanied by Cleare's evocative black-and-white nature photographs, each poem is titled and stands alone. Included are Dale's informed commentaries for each verse that present the meaning of Lao Tzu's words for life today. For example Verse 30, \"Defense and Aggression,\" is interpreted as permitting defense against violence, but never taking revenge or attempting to conquer others through the use of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. One meaning of Verse 49, \"Wisdom,\" is that each human, no matter how compromised and corrupted, has an innate humanity in his or her core. Dale uses the last verse, \"The Paradoxes of Life,\" to summarize the meanings in the first 80. He contends that despite the evil uses that technology has been put to, such as the development of weapons of mass destruction, it is possible to transform this technological knowledge into a mutually dependent system of economy and communications that may be used to meet the needs of people worldwide. This transformation is a way for the modern world to live within Lao Tzu's Great Integrity, a life of harmony with one another.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B006YQXXT4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The genre is solid without even a hint of paranormal, fantasy, or Christian.There were two reasons for me to make a change with this series. First, I was ready to explore new challenges creatively. Grave Bound absolutely satisfied that need. Second, as soon as I got into these character's lives and their minds, I knew there was no way to do justice to Emily's story - the inequalities, the passions, the betrayals she endured - without removing the boundaries associated with the young adult genre.Without limitations, this story unfolded easily and every one of its characters instantly became multi-dimensional... layered in a way that made the characters more real (endearing, hateful, desperate, etc.) than they would have been if I'd have stopped the progression of the scenes or filtered the discussions in order to avoid offending. As soon as you begin reading Grave Bound, you will find there are no filters on this story, and I did not play it safe. It and its characters are frank, open, and real, and I hope the risky scenes are, at minimum, viewed as tasteful.The Warrior Series will always hold a special place in my heart, but The Secrets Series is fast approaching my favorite. I began it for NaNoWriMo 2012, and successfully wrote >50k words in the month of November. Over the course of the next two months, I've made some significant changes, added voices, and finished the first part of Emily's story.Everything about Grave Bound and its characters were a test in what I could do. 1) How fast can I write a novel? (Answer: 3 months while working a full time job, commuting, and being a mother.) 2) Can I write intimate scenes that don't feel rehearsed or sterile, taking the character's interactions with each other to a level that allows the reader to understand - maybe even feel - exactly how the character feels? (Answer: Of course, the verdict is still out on this, but I gave it the old college try, making sure to ignore my comfort zone and push through so the readers could see... truly... see what Emily was dealing with.) 3) Can I write a story that is not Allison La Crosse's? (Answer: Thankfully, I can. For me, Emily's story is as powerful as Allison's, but the two characters have different hurdles to cross and outcomes to maneuver. Regretfully, Grave Bound took me away from Dark Angels of the Cross, but I'll go back and finish that story. I promise.)Now, let me talk about the characters. Emily is quietly desperate, determined, loyal, strong, and holds her feelings and opinions in until they can't be ignored another minute.  Levi is Emily's knight and shining armor. Levi and Emily's attraction is immediate, and their passion is SUPER-HOT! Tope is strong, silent, and fiercely loyal. He loves Levi enough to give his life for him, and he hates the world Emily lives in enough to go against the grain and fight for what's right. Lorenzo is sick, twisted, and perverted. He's Emily's fiancé as determined by her father and brothers and without her input. Emily's need to get away from the commune has as much to do with getting away from him, as it has to do with anything.I can honestly say that I love Grave Bound, its characters, and the chain of events we follow. I hope others feel the same.  In fact, it is all I can do not to begin writing Underground, today. I want to see where Emily's fate takes her and how she's going to handle her next challenge.T.R.

Under his ever-watchful eyes, she pulled her tank top over her head and unbuttoned her jeans. They slid to the floor in a small heap. \"Your bra and panties too.\"He slid a pen under her bra strap and pulled it off her shoulder. Even though she only felt the cold, hard plastic of the pen, a thrill shot through her body as if he was running his hands over her breasts. She let the other strap slip from her shoulders and reached behind her back to unclasp the bra. Her breasts bounced as the bra slid from her arms. Then she bent slightly to unstick her panties from her body. She was damp between her legs and was afraid that he would notice. \"Very nice.\" Her face burned as Dr. Marshall's warm hands suddenly cupped her breasts and bounced them slightly as if weighing them. The warmth of them disappeared as he made notes on a chart and gestured towards the scale. Clarissa felt hot in the face as he took her height and weight. Had she gained weight? Would he perhaps find her unsuitable? But the doctor said nothing as he took her by the arm and brought her to the examination table. He made her lay down on the paper and slipped a blood pressure cuff around her arm. Dr. Marshall took her blood pressure and heart rate while he set a table with a number of frightening instruments. \"What is that for?\" she asked, looking at very sharp needle filled with a clear liquid. \"It's not your place to ask questions,\" he snapped. \"You've been a very disobedient employee. You need to be quiet while I work.\"Her cheeks burned as if he had slapped her. She fell silent as he listened to her heart and lungs, the cold metal burning her skin.\"Well, patient has healthy vitals.\"The doctor moved down the table and tapped her legs. \"I need you to bend your knees and open them.\"Of course, the OB/GYN doctor would want to know if her womb was healthy. Clarissa pulled up her knees awkwardly and exposed herself to the doctor. She saw his head between her legs and felt a hot flush in her neck. She felt his hands on either side of her pussy, pushing and poking.

She's also had poetry published in the Poetry Institute of Africa's Anthology: Soulfully Seeking and has won awards in two English Olympiads.She sorely regrets that she can't actually study anything like sorcery, telepathy or levitation, but settled for an Honours degree in Behavioural Genetics instead. It left her with an understanding of how to control her literary characters (which love misbehaving) and a desire to fulfil her original dream of becoming a fantasy author. She's worked as a waitress, an admin clerk, a secretary, a saleswoman, a barmaid and, most recently, a single mother. She enjoys long walks on the beaches of her imagination. She also likes to swear. A lot. All of this contributes to her novel,The Harbinger,and it's sequels.

She wants to work with a renowned model but it isn't because she craves celebrity association or celeb status. The model, Veve, is an admirable woman.I dislike celebrity news and gossip and yet living in Los Angeles I'm surrounded by the talk and chatter. This story gave me a chance to explore Jessie's appreciation for beauty and her love for fashion. I bring her convictions to light.This is an erotic romance and when she took a deeper look at her sexuality, her boyfriend Raymond did not follow along. Her career and her sexual nature became a wedge in their relationship as it is with many couples.Jessie was befriended by the bisexual assistant and lover to the model's manager and this gave me a peek into this man's thoughts as well.I enjoy New York City and setting the conflict in Manhattan and Brooklyn let me re-discover places I had seen on different trips I've taken to the Big Apple.I'm working on Arrival, Book 3 of The Jessie Carter Fashion Series and hope you will stay tuned for the next step in her personal life and career.", "related": ["B00H9S7UJU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After having surmounted the challenges of being in a bi-racial marriage in the newly democratic South Africa, she now attributes her marital bliss to purposefully added spice and passionately resolved differences.

Aneesa completed her internship in counseling psychology and went on to work first as a therapist and then in Corporate Finance in on projects and in organizational change. This diversity in experience, coupled with her understanding of the human psyche, is translated into her writing through the creation of believable, flawed characters with the innate ability to overcome adversity. She writes to give her readers the gift of experiencing the new and fascinating, something she strives for herself when she explores new places, reads, cooks with her kids or goes picking for antiques with her husband.

Pratt is the second book in the\n trilogy of Eno the Thracian. We join Eno as he sets out on an adventure\n of a more personal nature. Hoping to question his mother about his\npast, he encounters an exotic Egyptian beauty named Naunet (and) three\nhideous hags intent on having them both for lunch...(Apollo) tells Eno that Pan is angry with him, and suggests he stay in much\nmore civilized areas of the world until Pan's anger cools. Having to\nabandon his visit with his mother, Eno and Naunet set out for Egypt, but\n that has its own problems.I had high expectations from The Stone Gods, and C.B. Pratt did not\ndisappoint. Once again, I find myself walking along with Eno as he\nnarrates his intentions, and what's going on in the world around him. (Eno) finds himself\n confronted with several mysteries to solve, humans turning to stone, and an\n errant Pharaoh to help... Nicely\n paced and engrossing, with plenty of action and mythical creatures,\nthis story is well written, with nicely painted descriptions that are\nnot overdone. I highly recommend The Stone Gods, and I definitely look\nforward to reading the next book, Dark Mountain!", "related": ["B00H8XOI1O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 4.6667, "rating_total": 42.0}

I attended a small high school, in a coal mining community, which housed grades 7-12, with a total of 201 students the year I graduated.  My graduating class size was 31!!!  I can truly say I'm thankful I was lucky enough to attend a small school because we were \"one big happy family\"!  After high school, I attended a couple of semesters of college, but not knowing what I wanted to do when I grew up, I decided to save my money until I did.  Not too long after becoming a college drop out, I decided I would give the military a shot, and I joined the United States Navy as a Sonar Technician. (Notice there is no mention of writing.)  I spent several years after my military stint working in automotive at a supplier to the Big 3.  I experienced a lot of good things and met a lot of great people along the way!  I moved to central Virginia with my husband and children in 2009, and that is when I began experimenting with writing.  I started a blog on blogger.com as a way to relax.  I found then that I really enjoyed writing.  After I finished the first fiction blog, I did a second one.  I was proud that I had accomplished that because I had never been a person who enjoyed writing.  After I finished my second, I decided that I would try publishing my stories (both were well over 70k words).  I had checked out Smashwords, and was interested.  When I looked for my stories on my computer, both were gone!  I had just tried reformatting my computer and thought I had saved them to a flash drive, but I was mistaken.  The stories were lost forever because I had already deleted my blog entries, too!  I gave up writing for a couple of years, moved to Georgia, where I now reside with my husband and children!  I've finally decided that writing is a good stress reliever for me (I also have tons of ideas floating around in my head), and I've recently started writing again!", "related": ["B00LBQ34SC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 21, "rating_average": 3.7143, "rating_total": 78.0}

Yarbrough born in Cleveland but raised in Bristol Connecticut has survived some horrific life storms that almost caused her destruction. Instead she used her gifts to tell a story. Through her lyrical gifts, Yarbrough has astounded Cleveland with her phenomenal stage productions entitled Choices We Make which showed in Cleveland twice and her most recent A Father’s Love.  She has also written, produced and directed Stage Productions for Warner Girls Leadership Academy.  Yarbrough also contributes to various scholarship foundations and community sponsorships through monetary and creative endeavors.  Yarbrough a survivor of abuse strives to bring more light to walking in destiny, having a voice,  and educating women and men on how to love each other.  Yarbrough admits that her gates were clogged with what she wanted her life to be but it took for her to lose everything to realize that her journey was designed by GOD not by her.   She would like to take this opportunity to encourage more of you to realize before it is too late that you are bigger and better than your current circumstance.  Your past does not mean that you have to be a statistical mistake of what your parents did not give you in love, time, finances, and or security.  You can be what GOD designed you to be, but it only comes when you remove the mask and allow the REAL you to be seen and for you to see life as it really is.  There are happy endings, but it doesn't mean that you will have it when you want it.  It simply means that you have to be aligned with the original plan for your life.  Grab a hold of YOUR destiny!  Believe in your blueprint!  Do not allow yourself to break into pieces before you find out that you have always been the amazing creature that you were ordained to be.  Remove toxic people from your life who posess no sense of drive and are consistently negative.  Surround yourself with people who believe in you and your purpose as well as believe in their own.  You do not have control over who or how you will be hurt, BUT you do have control over how you respond to it.  No one ever said life will be easy But someone did say that they will be there to comfort you through your pains.  I am a testimony of what happens after you have lost everything....You rebuild into something bigger and better than before.  Thank you supporting the movement!

Some of his adventures included living in the wilds of northern Angola, hunting for wild game, and traveling across many poorly charted areas of Africa. He first visited Zimbabwe at age 12 when his parents drove across Africa with their four children to attend a missionary Conference. He graduated from the Indiana University School of Medicine with his MD degree in 1962. Earning the Master of Public Health degree at Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health in 1967, he became an Assistant Professor at the Public Health College in Gondar, Ethiopia for two years. When he returned to the United States, much of his career was spent in Florida, where he directed a local health department for a few years and was a family physician for many years. He also served as Courtesy Clinical Associate Professor in the Department of Community Health and Family Medicine at the University of Florida. After retiring in 1996, Dr. Dodge made numerous Volunteer-in-Mission trips to Zimbabwe. In 2010, he was appointed Visiting Adjunct Professor at Africa University in Zimbabwe. He has taught in the Master of Public Health program for one semester each year since then. His years of experience in clinical and public health in Africa and the USA have given him a broad perspective of health challenges in both the developing and the developed world. Through his experiences, he grew to understand the great value of embracing the whole person, body, mind and spirit.  Dr. Dodge has three children and ten grandchildren. He and his wife live in San Antonio, Texas when he is not doing volunteer work or teaching in Africa.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Both can have happy endings, and both can have fatal endings. What happens if you are both, or know someone who is both? Would you stop taking risks for the chance at love, or vice versa? Dancing in the White Room by Ute Carbone is a story involving extreme skiing, the skiing lifestyle, friendship, love, betrayal, self-doubt, risk-taking, and forgiveness. Mallory Prescott, a patrolwoman at White Face Mountain in Lake Placid, New York, is dating one of the best extreme skiers known in the industry, P.D. Bell. At first his fearlessness was what attracted her the most; that and his eyes. As he pushed the limits further and further and decided to take on the highest mountain in North America, the West Rib of Denali, and then nearly got himself killed, Mallory's attraction to the fearlessness began fading. So was her patience when, after 5 years, he decided he wanted to attempt it all again. P.D. will be gone for 6 weeks, leaving Mallory and their daughter alone. Will Mallory be able to shut off her subconscious thoughts that keep attacking her relationship with him? Will she be able to forgive him for pursing a dream and being thousands of miles away when their daughter has a terrible accident and she is left to take care of it all herself? Ute Carbone has skillfully written a highly enjoyable story filled with realistic circumstances and emotions, making it appealing to many different types of readers. The story itself has a transitional tone to it, popping from past to present, making it intriguing and entertaining, making the reader eager to read more.", "related": ["B00K0MBEWG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However, when PF (Power Failure) Day\ncomes, the power grids are completely wiped out by an electromagnetic surge\nfrom the sun forcing everyone to realize just what it is like to live without\nelectricity... In the wake of utter despair a glimmer\na light comes into Ben's life as he meets Sara, a young woman who has also lost\nboth of her parents... However, with the\nincreased crime, panic, and desperation of everyone around them will they really\nbe able to survive?As soon as I started this book there\nwas absolutely no way I was going to put it down until I reached the very last\npage! Each chapter had me hanging on the edge of my seat wondering if Ben and\nSara could truly survive after everything that had happened. It is wonderful to\nread a book that truly makes a reader think about what would happen if that\nsituation was true. This book definitely had me thinking with every page I read\nand really showed the essence of human emotion when everything but the vital\ncomponents of survival are all that is left. In addition, seeing this story\nfrom the viewpoint of two teenagers was intriguing as many times it is\nteenagers who get caught up in all of the material things of life instead of\nthe small essential things. I applaud Julie L. Casey for creating a story that\nshows the renewed joy in finding a purpose in life even in the aftermath of\ndestruction.", "related": ["B00J39NO9S"], "rank": 1450758, "title": "Time Lost", "author": "Julie L.

After facing a most difficult divorce, Nicole relocated her family to Athens, Georgia, where she found work at the nearby University of Georgia and soon after became a student.  Life as a single parent to two daughters was a struggle in extremes.  Nicole worked non-stop to provide for the family and keep up her studies, but something had to give, and she was forced to discontinue her educational pursuits.  Since there was little money to seek professional therapy to help her cope with her divorce and her failures, Nicole channeled her emotions into writing stories.  Those stories became a form of self-therapy for her, and before long, the stories turned into entire novels.  Butterflies are Free? (The Butterfly Stories) was the first in a series of novels, and was followed by Butterflies in the Storm.  These novels are based on a very vivid dream which was nearly a premonition of things to come. When Butterflies are Free? was nearly completed, Nicole’s writing skills were attacked with a serious case of meningitis that left her completely unable to imagine or write.  It took several years for her brain to heal and for her imagination to return.  She hopes her writing will help others to remember the importance of perseverance.  She firmly believes living is not just about surviving, but also about flying and obtaining those dreams and goals, even through insurmountable odds.  Nicole currently lives in the quaint city of Commerce, GA and works as an academic advisor at the University of Georgia.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Some writers have the ability to make every character, even the most minor background player, come alive, adding a visceral level to the reading experience. In The Witch Narratives Reincarnation, Belinda Vasquez Garcia breathes life into the people of Madrid, New Mexico, in the 1920s and '30s, in the days before the mine shut down, when members of the Penitente brotherhood held sway over public opinion and policy and witches were a dark force to be feared by even the most devout Catholic.Santa Fe New Mexican NewspaperReincarnation brings history & magic to life.Albuquerque the Magazine August issueGarcia fascinates readers with her literary magic.Las Cruces BulletinA fabulous story that explores the positive and damning effects of extreme faith in a way that feels both fresh and authentic. With supernatural folklore that feels  grounded in reality, Garcia's title is fluid and well-paced, never taking the audience's attention for granted. The world the author creates is rich and lush; supernatural fans will appreciate the copious worldbuilding that went into this novel.Kirkus ReviewsCritics' PickA powerful story of friendship, love & toxic family ties in a town affected by clashes between Hispanic & Native American witchcraft & a Catholic Secret Society.

But when Vanessa’s father unexpectedly quit his job and changes began creeping up in his attitude and behavior, she watched helplessly as the father she loved disappeared and never came back. She, too, changed, and from the denial of love she’d always been given, Vanessa morphed into a spiteful, sad, depressed young woman.
