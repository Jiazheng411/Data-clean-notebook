He says his greatest hope is to write books, screenplays and ballads he will enjoy reading in his Golden Years, plus playing with games that teach. Bill lives and works in Seattle with his wife, Lynda; his two daughters and their husbands live nearby—the younger who helps Bill with his projects.

Melody Thompson dropped her suitcase, stifled a scream and stumbled backward.The stranger turned around, his handsome features registering surprise. \"Wait…it's okay,\" he exclaimed as he scrambled to his feet. \"I won't hurt you.\"He was clad in only a pair of navy athletic shorts that rode low on his lean hips. And his hips were the only lean thing about him. His shoulders were broad, his chest tautly muscled, and his long legs had the athletic appearance of a man who probably jogged.These first impressions flew through Melody's head as her body tensed with fight-or-flight energy. \"Who are you?\" she demanded as she backed down the hallway toward the front door.He followed her at a nonthreatening distance as he wiped his hands on a towel. \"I'm Hank Tyler.\" He reached into his pocket and withdrew a key ring with a single key dangling from it. \"I live in the town house next door. Lainie and I were good friends. She gave me a key a couple of months ago.\"The fear that had momentarily gripped her eased a bit. He did have a key and it was obvious by the fit of his jogging shorts that he was carrying no weapon.\"What are you doing in here?\" she demanded. It was easy for her to translategood friends.Lainie didn't have male friends, but she'd always had plenty of lovers. There was no way she'd have been able to pass up this dark-haired, blue-eyed model of masculinity.\"I knew the sheriff released this place this morning and eventually somebody from the family would come in. I thought it would be easier if the…uh…mess was cleaned up.\"The mess. It didn't take a rocket scientist to understand what he was talking about. The mess was her sister's blood. A wave of grief struck her, nearly buckling her knees.\"You're Melody, aren't you?\" He didn't wait for her reply. \"Lainie talks about you all the time.\" He frowned, as if aware that he'd used present tense for somebody whose words would now forever be past tense. \"Did you just get in from Chicago?\" he asked.\"No, I've been here since Tuesday. I've been staying with my mother since then.\"He took a step back from her. \"Look, if you'll give me just a minute or two, I'll finish up and get out of your hair.\"Before she could reply, he turned and disappeared back into the bathroom. Melody stared at the air where he'd stood, trying to decide if she felt threatened by his presence in the town house or not. She decided she didn't, at least not for the moment, and sank down on the sofa.Over the past four days, since the police had shown up at the school where she taught in Chicago to tell her that her sister had been murdered, her life had taken on a bizarre quality that hadn't ended. The fact that an unfamiliar, attractive man was scrubbing her sister's bathroom floor was as crazy as it got.The sheriff had called her mother that morning to let her know he was releasing the condo and that the investigation into Lainie's death had so far yielded no substantive clues.Melody wasn't surprised. Sheriff Jim Ramsey was a lazy, judgmental man who had probably decided that the investigation into Lainie's death wasn't worth any real effort. Melody hadn't even bothered checking in with him when she'd arrived in town.What she knew about her sister's murder she'd learned from her mother. Rita Thompson had told Melody that Lainie had been killed in her bathroom sometime between the hours of eleven at night and two in the morning.There had been no signs of forced entry and she'd been beaten to death with an unknown object.A maid who came in once a week had found her body. Nothing had been stolen, so robbery had been ruled out as a motive.If I'd just answered the phone, Melody thought. The evening of the murder, Lainie had called Melody. But Melody had been tired, not in the mood to talk, so she'd let her answering machine pick up the call.She couldn't help but think that if she'd just answered her phone, the events of that horrible night might have turned out differently. She closed her eyes and the sound of Lainie's message played in her head.\"Hi, sis. Just wanted to check in. Are you there? Well, anyway, I'm really excited. I've got a date with a new guy tonight and who knows, he might just be the one.\" Lainie had sounded upbeat and happy, and how Melody wished she'd answered that call. She hadn't known that it would be the last time she'd hear her sister's voice.She jumped to her feet as Hank came back into the room, an empty pail in his hand and the scent of pine cleaner in the air. \"I think I got up all the fingerprint dust and everything else,\" he finished with a touch of awkwardness.\"You didn't have to do that for us,\" she said. Yet, as she thought of the horrible task he'd just completed, a wave of gratefulness swept over her.\"I did it for Lainie. She wouldn't have wanted you to have to face that.\" He walked toward the door. \"I guess I'll see you this afternoon at the funeral.\" His blue eyes darkened. \"I'm sorry for your loss.\"The words should have sounded like the empty platitude spoken at funerals by sympathetic strangers or distant relatives. But, as he spoke, his startling blue eyes filled with darkness and she sensed the true emotion behind the words. He didn't wait for her to reply. With a small nod of his head, he walked out.She closed the door after him and locked it, then once again slumped on the sofa. She still hadn't processed that her wild, crazy older sister was truly gone.The real grief had yet to strike, but the guilt that gripped her was nearly paralyzing. She closed her eyes and leaned her head back, remembering the last time she'd seen her sister.\"Don't go,\" Lainie had said, her lower lip in the infamous pout that had so often gotten her whatever she wanted.The two were in Melody's bedroom at their mother's home, where Melody had spent most of the day packing up boxes to take with her to Chicago. \"I have to go,\" Melody had replied. \"It's a great opportunity and there aren't any teaching jobs available here in Cotter Creek right now.\"\"You just want to get away from me,\" Lainie had exclaimed. She'd scooted across the bed and grabbed Melody's hand. \"I know you're tired of cleaning up my messes. I know that I'm an emotional vampire, but I promise I'll do better. I swear I'm going to get it together. Melody, what am I going to do when night falls and I get scared? You can't go.\"But Melody had left, and now somebody had murdered Lainie. And she couldn't help but feel that if she hadn't left town her sister would still be alive.She swallowed against the thick emotion that was like a granite weight in her chest. Glancing at her wristwatch, she realized that the funeral was a mere two hours away.Wearily, she pulled herself up from the sofa. Lainie had bought the town house five months ago, finally moving out of their mother's home where she'd lived on and off again whenever she was between boyfriends. This building had originally been an old five-story apartment building that had been updated and renovated into town homes for sale.Lainie had been proud to be a homeowner, although twice in the last four months Melody had sent her sister money to help pay the mortgage and Melody suspected her mother had made at least that many payments and helped with utilities. Lainie had gone through money like she'd gone through men.The living room was a reflection of Lainie's personality, an explosion of colors and whimsical knickknacks that had probably all been impulse buys. Melody frowned slightly as she gazed at one wall where wild, crazy flowers had been hand-painted. The wall would have to be repainted before the condo was put up for resale.The slightly chaotic flavor of the living room spilled into the master bedroom, so evocative of Lainie that it brought tears to Melody's eyes.The spare bedroom held only a bare double bed and a dresser. It was here that Melody placed her suitcase. It took her just minutes to make up the bed with clean linens she found in the hall closet.After making the bed she hung the clothes from her suitcase, put her nightclothes and underwear in a dresser drawer and her toiletries on top of the dresser.Her mother had been appalled when Melody had announced her intention to stay in the condo. Her mother saw it as nothing but a place of death, but to Melody it was also the place filled with Lainie's life.Besides, she'd been sleeping on the sofa at her mother's place. All the spare bedrooms were taken up with relatives who'd come into town for the funeral. It might have seemed morbid to some people, but Melody just felt like she needed to be here.She had to pack up Lainie's things and get the place ready to put back on the market—and she was hoping that someplace within these walls would be the answer to who might have killed Lainie and why.And that was the other reason Melody wanted to stay there. Her mother would be upset if she knew Melody intended to do a little investigating on her own.To most of the people in the small town of Cotter Creek, Lainie had been a throwaway, a wild, bad girl whom everyone expected to come to a bad end.But to Melody, Lainie had been the sister who had taught her how to laugh, who had introduced her to a world that others didn't see. Lainie had been five years older than Melody, but she'd had the exuberance of a child and a child's fear of the dark. She'd been incredibly dependent on Melody for as long as Melody could remember. The roles of older sister/younger sister had been reversed long ago.Yes, Lainie had made bad choices. She'd been impulsive and immature, but she'd also been loving and bright and hadn't deserved to die at the young age of thirty.Melody had spent most of her life taking care of her sister and she wasn't about to stop now. Instinctively she knew that the powers that be in this small town wouldn't knock themselves out to solve the murder of a woman like Lainie. But she would.She thought of the handsome man who had cleaned up the bathroom and she wondered how close her sister ha...", "related": ["B003U89S70"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Of course he knew better. But knowing better hadn't kept him from recently making the biggest mistake of his life. Neither did it negate the fact that he'd found many an answer to an intriguing question when his nose—or his blood alcohol level—was where it didn't belong.Even when he was sober, his intuition rivaled that of the female population of Baltimore—the city he called his base of operations rather than home,homebeing a word with too much emotional resonance and Caleb not being a feelings kind of guy.And that sixth sense had shifted into high gear the minute the lounge singer had taken the stage.Unfortunately, the Scotch he'd downed had left him with a slippery grip on the instincts insisting he was sitting on top of a big fat scoop—one that might be as big and as fat as the exclusive he'd come here at Ravyn Black's invitation to get.Whether or not that was the case, one thing was certain.Club Crimson lived up to its vivid name.The Inn at Snow Falls' nightclub was a kaleidoscope of reds, from the carpet splashed with sherry, claret and port-wine hues, to the padded bar and stools of scarlet, to the plush sofas and matching wing chairs in patterns of ruby and rose.The decorative color scheme was not what Caleb found objectionable. After all, he'd yet to meet an Italian or Chinese restaurant he didn't like. Hell, his favorite baseball team had red in its name and wore the color proudly when taking the field at Fenway.But when the design of a club was calculated to evoke a romantic, sexy mood, and that evocation lacked even a hint of the subtle finesse that made sexysexy,and the entire setup was set up in a town called Mistletoe, well…Never let it be said that Caleb McGregor didn't embrace his cynicism wholeheartedly.And then, as if the ornamental bloodbath wasn't enough, Club Crimson had gone so over the top in their efforts to promote romance as to hire a red-haired chanteuse and call her Candy Cane.A textbook case of adding insult to injury. Or it would've been had she not manipulated the schmaltzy lyrics into telling a story with the skill of Scheherazade— and done so with a husky R & B style, and in a voice he swore he'd heard before but couldn't for the drunken life of him place.He was falling for it all—the words that seduced him, the costume that tempted him, the act as a whole that had him mentally panting like a randy teen. Or a full-grown man with more alcohol than reasoning skills at his disposal.Considering the number of drinks he'd downed, the only part of this that came as a surprise was the fact that he was able to recognize the folly of his ways.At least he'd had the good sense at the beginning of the evening to claim a back corner booth. He was out of the way, and in the perfect position to watch. And watch he did, closely, enjoying himself more than was wise.She was a looker, Ms. Cane, though considering the pretense of the rest of this place, he doubted her assets were genuine. That didn't stop him from having a good time ogling the plunging front of her cherry-colored gown.He wasn't sure how women did it—kept their tits from falling out of flesh-baring tops cut from their throats to their navels. Some, he knew, had little to fear, but not in this case. Whether Mother Nature or manufactured, she had a lot.She was curvy, too, her cinched-in waist flaring into real hips instead of not flaring at all. He liked hips. He liked a woman with an ass. If he ran the world, women would be required by law to be more than a pair of breasts on an androgynous body.He'd amend the Constitution if he had to, put a picture of Candy Cane next to one of Ravyn Black, the practically hermaphroditic singer for the emo band Evermore he'd come to Mistletoe to see, to illustrate the difference between ass and no ass.Yeah, that would be the perfect way to make his point. His point being… did he have a point?Had he ever had a point? Was that the point his crossed eyes were seeing at the end of his nose? Or had his point become all soft and squishy and not pointy at all when he'd upended his glass and swallowed the last of his drink?O…kay.It was quitting time, heading-to-bed time. Time to just say no.Or it would be if he wasn't stuck.The pianist was playing the introductory notes to the singer's final song, and the crowd that had quieted when she walked onstage, that had done no more than whisper as she sang Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald and Harry Connick, Jr., had grown deathly still, pin-droppingly silent.If Caleb got up now, he was likely to be shot.Candy pulled the microphone from the stand she'd made love to during her previous song, and began to croon the opening lines of her last. Her hips swaying, she crossed the small corner stage and descended the steps into the mesmerized crowd drunk on whiskey, wine and love.Her hair that he was sure was a wig—long, wavy, strawberry-blond—picked up and reflected the flashes of red thrown by the spinning disco ball, as did the sequins in the dress molded to her curves. So molded, in fact, that if it weren't for the peekaboo slit running up one thigh, he doubted she'd be able to walk.He watched her wind her way through the gathered listeners, smiling, fingering one man's tie, brushing another's hair from his forehead, cupping a shoulder or stroking her finger along a forearm of their female companions. An equal-opportunity seductress, Caleb mused, finding his eyelids drifting lazily as he, too, fell prey to her spell.A siren, she moved from table to table, the sultry sweep of her lashes, the alluring touch of her tongue to her lips, making men's knees weak, their palms sweaty, their blood run hot, the front of their pants—once flat against their abdomens—rise like pitched tents. He knew that's what was happening around the room because it was happening to him.It didn't matter that he was the only person in the room sitting by himself. His reaction would've been the same had he been in the company of his mother, a date or a priest. He wasn't hard because he was alone, or because he was lonely. He was hard because Candy Cane had made him that way.But the fact that this was a group erection cheapened what he felt—or so he tried to convince himself, since he didn't want to feel anything.And then something else happened. She turned just so, moved to the perfect spot, leaned against the back of a sofa at the ideal angle with the lights exactly right. The moment didn't last longer than a blink before it was gone, and she'd bowed her body toward another sap in the crowd.But it stuck with him, wouldn't let him go, and he studied her instead of looking away, stared at her instead of chalking up what he thought he was seeing to too much Scotch on a stomach empty of anything else.What he thought he was seeing was a familiar face. A familiar face to go with the voice he could've sworn he recognized at the beginning of her set. A recognition he'd then dismissed because of how many times the server had replaced the single malt in his snifter.Now he really did need a drink, and he needed it to be hot, black and fully caffeinated so he could make sense of the psychedelic swirls and splatters of reds Club Crimson had painted in his mind.His job depended on rumors. He listened, he verified, he discarded. He'd been doing it for ten years, writing a celebrity gossip column that had started out small and gone into national syndication twenty-four months after launch. It was so popular, it was featured during what one TV network called their \"celebrity beat,\" and had its own Web site to boot.Caleb McGregor was Max Savage, the notorious \"Snoop with the Scoop,\" loved, lauded and feared far and wide by politicians, society players and celebrities alike for his sarcastic riffs on what his audience demanded and deemed newsworthy about those in the public eye.Not that anyone at the inn knew who he was, or that he was here by invitation for an exclusive—the very private wedding of Ravyn Black and Teddy Eagleton. Over the next few days, he'd be covering the preparations leading up to the big event. But as always, he was posing as a member of Max Savage's street team. Not even Ravyn knew he was Max.The only people who knew his identity, who would ever know or have need to, were his agent, his attorney and his editor. When he'd set off down tabloid road ten years ago, he'd made sure his only connection was to the Max Savage machine, not to the alter ego itself.It was a decision that had turned out to be a sanity-saver, keeping his personal business out of the limelight. And it was going to make it a whole lot easier to transition to life after Max—a retirement that would have him hanging up his gear as soon as he finished this gig.Yes, he found the energy of chasing down nonstop leads more intoxicating than the boredom of waiting for a big story to break. But he'd never thought he'd end up stooping to the level he had, reporting on celebutantes flashing their bare crotches or finding fame through night-vision sex tapes.Neither had he thought himself capable of betraying a confidence, so wrapped up in the thrill that he hadn't realized he'd gone too far until it was too late. Until he'd ruined a career by telling the truth. Until he'd lost a lifelong friend because he'd been drunk on the rush of the scoop.He'd give anything to take back the last month, to think before revealing what his best friend Del, a music star in his own right, had shared in confidence about his Christian pop star fiancée's drug problem… but life didn't work that way.Caleb couldn't ...", "related": ["B00BGPK6NY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Combining Rath's story (including the predictable dissolution of his marriage) with that of Homeland Security agent Les Diaz, Rotter, in his first novel, weaves a semisuspenseful tale of (possible) international terrorism and, uh, water parks. Parading from a Colorado Springs, Colo., Hilton all the way to the Prospector's Bend theme park outside of Denver, Rath and Diaz engage in a battle of something like wits; Diaz thinks Rath is a jihadist, while Rath—at best a dreamer, at worst a psychopath—thinks Diaz is a merman from an imaginary underwater city. While Rotter makes a solid effort, the fantasy element of the book remains half-baked and, despite the timely and biting humor throughout, the thrill of the goofy 320-page chase isn't quite enough.(Mar.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book does not focus on accounting and auditing rules and is not intended to teach accounting to future accountants—nor does it assume any prior knowledge of accounting jargon or double-entry accounting. Instead, it focuses on a intuitive understanding of the accounting process and standard accounting reports through an extended example of a new company being created.As the example company is built and grows, new kinds of activities require accountants to record a widening variety of business transactions. It starts with a limited accounting system that does not include many key features of modern accounting, and then features—such as accrual accounting, which can make accounting numbers more useful for business decisions—are successively added, so that you can gain an understanding of how they work and why they are used.All accounting concepts are introduced along with the language accountants use to describe the process. The name of a particular account is written in upper case (such as ASSETS or CASH) to make it clear when the text describes that account. The book reinforces the new language by gradually adopting accounting vocabulary. In this way, you will learn about accounting without having to have a grounding in the topic—and will then get to rehearse the language used by accountants. Questions at the end of each chapter revisit key concepts by reviewing how accountants handle common business transactions.For all non-accountants who need to master the fundamentals of accounting language and concepts,Mastering Financial Accounting Essentialswill prove to be a vital hands-on guide.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The ending is satisfactory, and during the children's shenanigans, readers learn several facts about insects. The format of this transitional chapter book is open, and humorous black-and-white line drawings appear frequently.

Robert Parker fans who have yet to discover Boyle will be pleasantly surprised by his suspenseful ninth crime novel set in Maine featuring former New York Times reporter Jack McMorrow (after 2004's Home Body). Jack, his social worker wife, Roxanne, and their young daughter, Sophie, become the target of deranged satanist Harland Wilton after Roxanne's inquiry into child abuse leads to the removal of Harland's two boys from his custody. Meanwhile, McMorrow pursues a story involving an enigmatic woman named Mandi, whose ad in the local paper offers companionship for hire. The journalist becomes increasingly curious about her, and having traced where she lives, he finds that she's been assaulted and unable to fend for herself. McMorrow arranges a safe haven for Mandi with a neighbor, even as Roxanne's qualms grow about his blurring his professional and personal lives. Boyle has succeeded in creating a likable lead whose sense of responsibility is reminiscent of Spenser as well as supporting characters with depth.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this heavily footnoted and prodigiously researched study, Wayne State University law professor Friedman posits that Bradwell's achievements have been overlooked because her disagreements with feminist Susan B. Anthony led Anthony to exclude Bradwell from her definitive History of Woman Suffrage. Using her journal as a forum, Bradwell successfully agitated for judicial reform and women's rights, particularly the right of married women to enter the professions. She and her husband James, an attorney, obtained the release of Mary Todd Lincoln, who had been committed to an insane asylum by her son. Although Friedman celebrates Bradwell's legal skill and tenacity, she also acknowledges her frequent lapses into duplicity and anti-Semitism in this objective portrait.

The theoretical position he defends is fresh and original and will lead many readers to reconsider conventional ways of thinking about global justice. It will also encourage them to engage more deeply with the literatures of world politics and global political economy, which inform the argument throughout. No other recent book on Miller's subject displays a similar combination of philosophical imagination and deep engagement in the realities of global political and economic life.\"--Charles Beitz, Princeton University\"In his attempt to discover what obligations citizens of rich countries have to those in the developing world, Miller breaks a new path between radical cosmopolitanism and fair bargaining. Filled with concrete historical detail as well as philosophizing, this book is a superb example of applied ethics. Its recommendations cannot be ignored by those of us who are critical of American foreign policy, but do not know exactly what alternative to advocate. The global-warming discussion is particularly enlightening.\"--John Roemer, Yale University\"Miller'sGlobalizing Justiceis an important contribution to thought about transnational justice.

After Ennis, the son of a white civil rights hero, serves a 10-year prison sentence for drug dealing, High C, a former meth king who now peddles books likeThe Hit Man Handbookon the Web, asks Ennis to locate his missing, mentally challenged 19-year-old daughter, Dixie, whose mother was the now deceased Faye. Adding heat is the Montgomery mayoral race between white incumbent Amory Justice and African-American Walk Compson, who may have a link to Dixie. The author sensitively explores still simmering racial tensions in the South and inserts a lovely tribute to Zelda Fitzgerald, but a murky ending and an unconvincing twist to do with Dixie dissatisfy.

Grant and Babhru have known each other since forever, their families were friends and the kids grew up together. When Grant started his first sexual fantasies, Babhru was in them; they had almost a mutual understanding, to not talk of that. Grant knows deep inside of himself that Babhru is gay like him, but he has never done anything to follow his feeling. At 21 years old, and recently orphaned, Grant is feeling helplessly alone, he lost any certainty he had, and the only true thing he still has is his love for Babhru.And so Grant carefully plans a seduction; money is not a problem, his parents passing left him with more than enough. The idea is to bring Babhru on a ski lodge and to seduce him. How tender Grant is, planning the seduction with hot chocolate and small gifts. 21 years old is not so young, but really nor Grant or Babhru have seen much of the world, and I hope they will remain like that.Even their first sexual encounter it's not as you see in the movie; maybe due to inexperience, or the rush that seems to be always there with youth, but actually it's not important. Yes, I hope that, with time, they will learn how to do it properly, but maybe, if they remain a bit innocent like that, their story will be better.One Fire, One Ice after all is a sweet and tender romance, but there is an undertone of sadness. Grant in the end obtains what he most desires, but it's like even that is not enough to dispel the sadness that ices his heart. There is a nice contraposition play in Grant and Babhru's characters,", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

S. Hubbert and his octogenarian Auntie Lil battle the indifference of most New Yorkers, including some cops, toward the plight of the poor and lonely. While serving lunch for the homeless in a church near the theater district, Lil and Hubbert watch helplessly as an elderly actress dies, apparently of a heart attack. Despite being warned off the case by testy, publicity-seeking NYPD Lt. Manny Abromowitz, Lil dragoons T.S. into investigating. With old friends, including well-connected widow Lilah Cheswick, T.S.'s secret love, they trace the last days of the dead woman--known only by her stage name, Emily Toujours. A sinister theater impresario, a cynical but good-hearted cop, male prostitutes and another murder make for a soup kitchen recipe more lethal than most. With a fond eye for the eccentric, the pseudonymous Gray gives the streets of Hell's Kitchen--depicted as a neighborhood of tightly knit denizens, law-abiding and not--the air of a gritty English village.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00JERUXHK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Complications during the surgery caused him to slip into a coma. To the outside world he lay motionless for a month, but Greener’s experience of that month was as graphic and tense as his novels. In his mind, he was furiously living out his days as a hostage of radical extremists or as a fugitive on the run from a ruthless, rifle-toting Dick Cheney. On awakening from the coma, things got impossibly more strange. In this fascinating and suspenseful personal essay, the author grapples with the reality of not quite knowing what is or was real. All the while this piece pushes forward another theme: that of learning to live with someone else’s heart. This deeply satisfying read combines suspense and existentialism with an Oliver Sacks-like inquiry into neurological curiosities. --Paul Diamond", "related": [], "rank": 855698, "title": "Trapped (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Richard Greener", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He and his wife and two daughters live in Herndon, Virginia.   He is President and Co-Owner of DMT (Detection Monitoring Technologies).    DMT builds hi-tech radar and sensor systems very much like those in this book.   His company also integrates security solutions, and specialty vehicles and boats like the ones in the book as well.   DMT's technology is sold around the world -- from Iowa to Norway to the Middle East.   This background in techology and world travel finds its way into Eddie's books.     Eddie also loves the ocean, fishing, kayaking, SCUBA, and outdoor sports.  Eddie can be often found paddling his kayak along the many small islands and coastal zones around the Gulf Coast of Florida.  The love of the outdoors and the sea also finds it way into his novels.    Eddie has BS degrees in both Physics (Lynchburg College, Virginia) and Mathematics (University of Hawaii).  While in Hawaii, he also obtained his Certificate of Completion in the Marine Option Program (MOP), for which he published his first technical paper.    He also took up SCUBA, spearfishing, and even tried surfing.   So it is not surprising that there is significant effort in making sure the fantastic technology is real and effectively used to enhance the storylines.  The outdoor scenes of the tropic climates are vibrant and descriptive. Eddie has other works available and the list of these can be found on the publisher's website at www.deepseapublishing.com.", "related": [], "rank": 2729398, "title": "The Bryant Family Chronicles: Death and Gold in Zara Zote", "author": "Eddie Hughes", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a boomerang, according to a new book of 8,000 interesting and obscure words called The English Wordsmith: A Lexical Eclecsis (The Great Wordsmith LLP, £12.99). And what is an eclecsis? Why, it is a compilation from various sources. The author, David Andrews, was an avid collector of words who completed the work just before his death in 2010, and who said: \"Taking information from one source is plagiarism. Taking it from many is original research.\" Other words in the eclecsis, which runs from aa to zymurgy (heads up, Scrabble fans), include sesquipedalian (given to using long words) and forswonk (overworked). We'd guess that there are still not words to describe how the Poetry Book Society and its ilk feel about the pigging bankers and the coalition shysters, however. --The Independent on Sunday. 29/05/2011As two new fascinating books illustrate, language obsessives have been with us since the 16th century Tweet 7 Share gu.com/p/2pa9v/tw on Twitter The URL gu.com/p/2pa9v/tw has been shared 7 times.View these Tweets. Share Comments (1) Robert McCrum The Observer, Sunday 29 May 2011 Article history David Andrews s book of words and phrases may well become an indispensable weapon in the armoury of the Scrabbler . Photograph: Alamy Do you get a secret thrill from knowing that eclecsis means \"a compilation from various sources\", or feel a twinge of superiority in the precise use of \"hone\" not \"home\"? And were you pleased to hear President Obama, last week, saying \"orient\" where many people would say \"orientate\"? If you are not a professional subeditor and paid to fret about such matters, and your answer to any of the above is stronger than a definite maybe, then you are what Lynne Truss calls a \"stickler\" and the late David Foster Wallace a \"snoot\" (for Syntax Nudniks Of Our Time). You will also be interested in two books that recently landed on my desk, The English Wordsmith by David W Andrews and Crooked Talk by Jonathon Green. For as long as there has been a recognisable language, the colour, texture and everyday use of English has inspired the kind of devotion that lies north of obsession but south of idolatry. As early as 1531, some logomane (I just made that up) published a glossary of criminal slang entitled Hye-Way to the Spittel House. The Elizabethan writer Robert Greene, who may have been the model for Falstaff, a \"man of fire-new words\", launched A Notable Discovery of Coosnage, his \"coney-catching pamphlet\" in 1591. The prototype for an English dictionary, compiled by Robert Cawdrey, appeared in 1604 entitled A Table Alphabeticall \"...of hard usual English words... for the benefit & help of ladies, gentlewomen, or any other unskilful persons\". Dr Johnson's lexicographical milestone was still about 150 years away, but the rising bourgeoisie was developing its well-known anxiety, in a class society, about proper English, the right word in the right context. David Andrews was a lawyer who knew \"who\" from \"whom\", and \"less\" from \"fewer\". Before his untimely death in 2010, he devoted all his leisure hours to collecting \"important, relevant, obscure, difficult, unusual words and phrases\" in celebration of the richness and versatility of the language. His friends have now published his \"Lexical Eclecsis\" in a strangely appealing amateur volume (The English Wordsmith) that may well become an indispensable weapon in the armoury of the Scrabbler, quiz or crossword buff: from Aa (Hawaiian, \"lava\"); to udal (\"freehold land in Orkney\"); and zikr (\"dervishes' circular dance\").Andrews was a snoot, “an extreme usage fanatic,” defined as somebody who knows what dysphemism means and does not mind letting you know it.The Guardian. Steven Poole June 11th. The English Wordsmith: A Lexical Eclecsis, by David W Andrews (The Great Wordsmith LLP, £12.99) Logomanes might enjoy this hefty alphabetical collection of words that one man found interesting. A fair few are rather straightforward (\"lunge\", \"puma\", \"immigrate\"), and some definitions debatable (I don't think a \"gloss\" is necessarily \"a misleading explanation\"). Pleasing obscurities abound, however: new to this reader were \" aduncous\" (\"hooked, curved inward\"), \"eident\" (\"busy; diligent\"), \"nutant\" (\"nodding\") and \"zoilism\" (\"fierce criticism\"), which might come in handy. The book also works as a kind of aleatory encyclopedia, with advice on the ingredients of haggis, the names of Furies, useful French and German terms for strange feelings and people, and the fact that Old World monkeys are \"more closely related to anthropoid apes than are New World monkeys\". (The late author appeared to have had a fondness for animals, or at least the words for them.) A subtle humour occasionally makes itself felt, as when \"cacoethes: an urge to do something unwise\" is followed by \"cacoethes scribendi: an urge to write\". Tell me about it. --The Guardian. 11/06/11The Spectator, 11 June 2011MIND YOUR LANGUAGEFloccinaucininihilipilificationA labour of love of the strangest kind, published posthumously, came to me this week. It is The English Wordsmith, by David Andrews (12.99), which is nothing but 8,000 important, relevant, obscure, difficult, unusual words and phrases. He doesnt list Shakespeare’s honorificabilitudinitatibus, but he does include floccinaucininihilipilification, presumably because of its unusual length, defining it as the action of contemptuously dismissing something, or treating it, as worthless. I wanted to know more. The OED notes that its earliest know use is by William Shenstone (whom I have never read) in a letter from 1741, and that it derives from a well-known rule of the Eton Latin Grammar...

Amy and Todd are twins, and they get on--but they are as opposite as can be in almost every way. Amy is the bookworm and poet, totally disorganized. Todd is the competent technocrat, superorganized. Everyone is sure what the twins' roles will be for the fifth-grade Mini-Society class project. But the kids change, especially when trouble comes, and so do their parents and some of the friends they thought they knew. At home everything is \"horribly different\" since Dad lost his job. Dad and Mom quarrel all the time, and Todd is heartbroken that the family's beloved old dog is sick. The message that \"people surprise you\" is occasionally too clearly spelled out, but turnarounds at home and in the classroom, told in the third person from the twins' alternating viewpoints, grow naturally from beautifully drawn characters--especially the twins, who must accept both failure and change.Hazel RochmanCopyright © American Library Association.

Using his experience as a U.S. Naval officer, and his extensive experience in the aerospace industry, he began his first novel in 1976 with a story about an attempt by North Korean special forces to hijack a U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier. Fifteen years later Raid On Truman was published in hardbound and paperback and was translated into Japanese for hardbound and paperback sales in Japan. That was the fulfillment of a dream to become a published novelist. He sold a second novel on the heels of the first. COBRA DANE was published in paperback in 1995. A third novel, Sub Zero, quickly followed and was published in 1996 along with publication in Japan. John has written four more novels, Vauclain’s Shield, Hidden Sun, These Final Hours, and The Telekinetic Man and a screenplay derived from The Telekinetic Man and is in the process of trying to sell them.  Another book was published in 2003 just before the Iraqi War. Desert War was a nonfiction look at how the war might be conducted, weapons systems, intelligence gathering, and forces on both sides. While John was the author, his daughter, Christine researched the work.  Influenced initially by the works of Ian Fleming and his brand of no-holds-barred action and intrigue, John has tried to bring to readers that same action elements, but with a large dose of sobering reality. Violence has profound consequences and the characters within John's novels feel all the passion and agony of real people. Raid On Truman, COBRA DANE, Sub Zero, Vauclain's Shield, These Final Hours, The Telekinetic Man, and Hidden Sun are available on Amazon's Kindle Store. Note that COBRA DANE has for its cover image a picture of the actual COBRA DANE radar on the island of Shemya in the Aleutians. Vauclain's Shield's cover image has a photo of actual reentry vehicles passing through the atmosphere over Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific, and Raid On Truman has a real picture of the USS Harry Truman taken by the author.         A collection of fourteen sci-fi/horror/paranormal short stories, A Case of the Vapors was added to the Kindle store in August 2013. These stories run the gamut from the humorous A Case of the Vapors to the somber, but hopeful, The Iron Sergeant.

It is heavily loaded with irony; she writes about fidelity and cheats, they are broke, despite a likely 6 figure income and yet they own an Escalade, drink Starbucks and spend money in other foolish ways. Intentional or not, it works well. With it's strong writing, this is a novel worthy of continuing to another round. --Amazon Top ReviewerIn this charming novel set in the South, a famous, reclusive 87-year-old romance novelist, Mrs. Helen Van Buren, agrees to be interviewed for her long-awaited biography while the journalist interviewing her is having romance-novel-worthy entanglements of her own. Julia Parks writes a family column, but her own family is threatening to fall apart. Van Buren's house on the Florida island of South Captiva provides a lush tropical setting with banyan trees where mysteries will reveal themselves and secrets will unfold. The book's theme, that nothing makes us so lonely as our secrets, liberates Julia as she discovers the unknown in her own family's past and learns to love again. The novel starts with a bang, though the device of two parallel lives becomes tiresome, taking the wind out of the book at the halfway point. Still, it's a likeable debut. --manuscript review by Publishers Weekly, an independent organizationOkay, I must admit that the subject material wasn't what I would normally read. Although I did get caught up in the plight of the wife due to the effective writing style of the author. The writing flowed very well and didn't have any little bumps or hurdles in it to distract you from the story. Not an easy feat, as any author will tell you. The life of the wife really seemed believable and that was part of why I got momentarily wrapped up in the story. Now to be perfectly honest I don't believe that I would ever buy this book because the story line is not one that interests me, however, having said that, if this storyline is one that you like, then you would definitely like this book. --Amazon Top Reviewer", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Patel was born in the British colony of India. As a child, he witnessed the independence struggle, and later, land reforms and maturing of democracy in India. He studied high school and undergraduate engineering in India. He got married after finishing his studies and came to the United States, in 1960, for post-graduate studies in engineering at the University of Michigan. Throughout his life, as a student, and later, as leader of Patel clan, the author faced many challenges. He overcame the hurdles and learned from it. During their fifty-one years in America, Patel and his wife have received many acts of kindness from individual Americans, Christian churches and educational institutions. The author considers himself blessed and fortunate for witnessing two of the greatest peacefull revolutions of the human history, the indepndence struggle of India and the Civil Rights struggle of the United States. He was the first person from his family to get high school education. His farmer parents could not afford to educate all of their children. However, his parents expected him to help his siblings, and his nieces and nephews. This is when the Marshall Plan of the Patel Family was devised. For nearly a quarter of a century, the legal migration of Patel family was carried out under this plan. By 2011, the family had a dozen physicians, many engineers, pharmacists, RNs, and business owners. Patel practiced engineering in Charlotte, NC for over forty years and retired in 2011. He was active in liberal Democratic Party politics in 1960s and 1970s. Later in life, he became more fiscally conservative. He also actively participated in Asian Indian organizations and Patel groups from his home states of Gujarat, India. \"Marshall Plan versus the Great Society\" is his first book, in which he demonstrates, by many examples, how he and his wife used incentive based method and ruled out free money, to help dozens of their family members. Patel and his wife, Shobhna, live their retired life in North Carolina. His hobbies include reading, writing, and Bridge games. Her hobby is gardening. Both also travel, socialize and spend lots of time with their four grand-children. They have a daughter and a son, both married and practicing physicians in North Carolina.", "related": [], "rank": 2297037, "title": "Marshall Plan versus The Great Society eBook", "author": "Vithaldas H.

My family immigrated to the states in the late 60's and I've lived here since.

I started by publishing a small anthology of some of my poems or stories here at Amazon, as well as a sci-fi novel that is the first in a series. The second part was just released. Right now I'm working on the third part. I'm a massage therapist and have been practising for the past 17 years and one day I'll get it right! 8) I live 30 minutes south of Houston in League City TX with my 3 indoor cats and outside I have possums racoons and lots of squirrels for company. I enjoy kayaking, (Lots of places for that around here. It's known as the Bayou city...) riding sport bikes, the occasional windsurfing, and never ending battle of the bulge and trying to get in shape. I used to be a bodybuilder back in the 80's and it kind of fizzled from there...8)  I have worked in a lot of different fields ranging from pizza delivery driver to cook, to teaching English as a foreign language, teaching Greek, Interpeter, selling ladie's shoes, private security, bodyguard, delivery driver, etc.... Something about working for someone else though has never agreed with me. I guess you can't fire yourself, that why I like to work for myself. 8) I speak fluent Greek, a bit of Spanish which I learned from ex wife's family, a little German, and you can catch my accent when I mispronounce words like sheets and sheep.... I'll let you guess what sheet sounds like when I pronounce it...8) In my line of work (massage therapy) I've learned to replace sheets with linens. Cuts down on stunned looks. 8) I also dabble in the arts...Martial that is.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So, it’s probably no surprise that his writing includes elements of those interests.

But Scott is also a Civil War reenactor and that interest brought him face-to-face with the fact that battles are fought by people, not robots. Those people have hopes and dreams and emotions of their own. This comes out clearly in what Scott writes and the readers will find themselves fully involved with the characters and situations. Scott’s full-time job is as an architectural designer, he loves to build things. This also comes through clearly in his writings. The worlds and galaxies he sets his stories in are all constructed with solid architecture and engineering. They won’t fall down when put under stress. On a personal level, Scott lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and works at Temple University.

Her work in schools, however, is unsurpassed in providing educators with a wealth of knowledge about why and how zero tolerance policies are counterproductive. Most importantly, she is unsurpassed in giving school professionals new tools and showing them how to use them. --Gordon Bazemore, author of Restorative Juvenile JusticeFor over a decade, Nancy Reistenberg continues to be an innovative visionary of harm reduction, violence prevention, and youth development through restorative measures in schools.  Circle in the Square offers an insightful and practical guide to the development of restorative measures in schools in Minnesota. I can hear Nancy s calm and reassuring voice in every page, in every story. True to the values and practice of restorative justice, Nancy also includes the voices and stories of her many colleagues in Minnesota, and beyond. In doing so, Circle in the Square offers Minnesota s rich and diverse experience with restorative measures to be told. It has truly been a story of collaboration and capacity building. Of particular significance, Minnesota s collaborative journey illustrates how the use of Circles, as a restorative measure, has shifted from a disciplinary response to a pedagogical foundation. This book offers a rich treasure of stories, insights and guidelines for practice, written with wit, wisdom and integrity. Circle in the Square will touch the lives of many people, and guide us in restoring safe, healthy and wise education systems, for all children. --Brenda Morrison, author of Restoring Safe School Communities", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sue coordinated the Victims and the Media Program at Michigan State University's School of Journalism, and I then succeeded her in the job.Sue had researched the media coverage of the Bath case, where in 1927 a disgruntled school treasurer set off a bomb that killed 38 elementary school children, as well as seven adults, including the bomber himself. The resulting media circus demonstrated how difficult it can be for the press to cover such horrors without re-victimizing the victims,survivors and witnesses, as well as their family and friends.Even today, rookie reporters with little or no training are often assigned to the crime beat, which requires interviewing people in trauma on what are arguably the worst days of their lives. As media consumers, we wince when we see a reporter shove a microphone in a grieving mother's face to ask, \"How do you feel?\" But do we turn the channel? Do we take the time to complain?One of my responsibilities with the program was to help my students learn how to report on victims of violence and catastrophe with the sensitivity, compassion and dignity they deserve.Those experiences persuaded me that conducting \"media autopsies\" of famous crime cases could help us identify best and worst practices.Is the press today more or less sensational than in the past? Can crime coverage contribute to solving or preventing crime? Can it help victims heal? What can we learn about our culture by exploring how reporters cover these human tragedies?The more I began to look at cases such as the Fatty Arbuckle murder trial, the rape and murder of Kitty Genovese and the slaughter of the Clutter family that Truman Capote captured in \"In Cold Blood,\" the more I realized that we learn a lot about ourselves and our society by analyzing how such horrific crimes are reported. I often think of the motto of Parents of Murdered Children (POMC) - murder is NOT entertainment.

Seth splits his time in the scenic Columbia River Gorge communities of Camas and Skamania in Washington with his son Hayden.

He was born in London, the son of architect James Thomas Knowles and himself trained in architecture at University College and in Italy. He designed, amongst other buildings, three churches in Clapham, Lord Tennyson's house at Aldworth, the Thatched House Club, the Leicester Square garden (as restored at the expense of Baron Albert Grant), and Albert Mansions, Victoria Street, Westminster.[1] However, his preferences led him simultaneously into a literary career. In 1860 he published The Story of King Arthur. In 1866 he was introduced to Alfred Lord Tennyson and later agreed to design his new house, Aldworth, on condition there was no fee; this led to a close friendship, Knowles assisting Tennyson in business matters and, among other things, helping to design scenery for The Cup when Henry Irving produced that play in 1880. Knowles became intimate with a number of the most interesting men of the day, and in 1869, with Tennyson's cooperation, he founded the Metaphysical Society, the object of which was to attempt some intellectual rapprochement between religion and science by getting the leading representatives of faith and unfaith to meet and exchange views. Members included Tennyson, Gladstone, W.K.Clifford, W. G. Ward, John Morley, Cardinal Manning, Archbishop Thomson, T. H. Huxley, Arthur Balfour, Leslie Stephen, and Sir William Gull.[1] The society formed the nucleus of the distinguished list of contributors who supported Knowles in his capacity as an editor. In 1870 he succeeded Dean Alford as editor of the Contemporary Review, but left it in 1877 owing to the objection of the proprietors to the insertion of articles (by W.K.Clifford notably) attacking Theism and founded the Nineteenth Century (to the title of which, in 1901, were added the words And After). Both periodicals became very influential under him, and formed the type of the new sort of monthly review which came to occupy the place formerly held by the quarterlies. Inter alia it was prominent in checking the Channel Tunnel project, by publishing a protest signed by many distinguished men in 1882. In 1904 he received the honour of knighthood. He was a considerable collector of works of art. He was married twice,  in 1860 to Jane Borradaile,  in 1865 to Isabel Hewlett. He died at Brighton and was buried at the Brighton Extra Mural Cemetery.", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 29, "rating_average": 3.7586, "rating_total": 109.0}

The Second Sphere, a volume of human-occupied interstellar space far from Earth, was established millennia ago by highly advanced aliens for largely inscrutable reasons and has been the home of several different human species, not to mention sentient dinosaurs and giant squid (aka krakens), ever since. Indeed, humanity has had to adjust to being the bottom species on the totem pole, since the saurs and krakens are technologically more sophisticated than us and control all interstellar travel. Even more overwhelming are the space-dwelling intelligences known only as the Gods. Now, however, a group of renegade cosmonauts with their own improvised starship has upset the balance of this complex society. In addition, the Multipliers, an alien race who've been interfering in the lives of Earth's species since prehistoric times, have returned to human space, offering a peculiar form of immortality and challenging the Gods for control. MacLeod (Dark Light) includes several of his trademark political debates and these are as engaging as always. The Multipliers, eight-legged creatures whose appendages subdivide to the point where they can manipulate matter on the atomic level, are fascinating and very alien indeed. The novel doesn't stand well on its own, but should please fans of the series as well as readers who appreciate hard SF with a political bent.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From 1871 to 1873 Nordhoff traveled in California and visited Hawaii. He then became Washington correspondent of the New York Herald. His most widely known books are Communistic Societies of The United States, and California for Health, Pleasure and Residence. He was a New York journalist for many years. The town of Ojai, California was named for him originally. It was changed due to anti-German sentiment of WWI era. Nordhoff died in California in July, 1901. He was the father of Walter Nordhoff, author of The Journey of the Flame penned under the name \"Antonio de Fierro Blanco\". He was the grandfather of Charles Bernard Nordhoff, co-author of Mutiny on the Bounty.

By 1974, I developed a strong interest in, and an aversion to aging. Sure, I was still young, fit and \"invincible,\" but I saw my grandparents declining rapidly, and my parents, aunts and uncles were visibly aging and slowing down as well. I figured if I could live to 100, medical technology would have figured out how to \"cure\" aging. Fast forward to today, and it looks like my guess was uncanningly accurate... if not conservative. It may have been wishful thinking then, but now it's supported by many world-class researchers who are on the cutting-edge of emerging world-changing biomedical breakthroughs. Going back to 1978, my invincibility turned out to be a bit overblown. I suffered a paralyzing spinal cord injury which turned my life upside down to say the least. After a long period of readjustment, I realized just how fragile we meat bags are. We can be brought to our knees... or even terminated in a blink of an eye. Most are luckier than that. But we all eventually deteriorate over time, no matter how we try to stem the tide. Currently, life is a game you can NOT ultimately win if survival and reaching your full potential are goals. Sooner or later it ends, either comfortably at a ripe old age (for the minority who are \"lucky\") or with prolonged deterioration and suffering! One day in your life will be the last time you do something you cherish. Life will turn upside down. For the first time, you will not be able to do what you could easily have done just a few days, weeks or months earlier. I can tell you from experience this is a tough pill to swallow. You try over-and-over. I did, really HARD. But then you finally realize, you just can't anymore... you're TOO OLD! We all know how true this is, don't we? But we wouldn't have much to look forward to if it were our focus. So we do the best we can, ignoring that inevitable reality. It's always been that way. But recently, something happened that changes the whole model. (I explain that \"something\" in the pages ofSmart, Strong and Sexy at 100?) What if, after thousands of years of dreaming of perpetual youth, humanity finally avoids suffering, disease and all the negative side effects of aging? What if we could actually enjoy open-ended youthful lifespans? These questions drove me to...search out the best minds in all the disparate fields related to aginggather as much of their knowledge as possibleconnect the dotsform a dream team of researchers and...merge all their information with that special something I mentioned two paragraphs ago.Some people say my half a lifetime of research and experience in the field of wellness and longevity qualifies me as an authority on the subject. I don't know about that, but I do know lots of people come to me for advice. So rather than trying to answer questions one-on-one to an ever-expanding audience, I decided to write a simple yet comprehensive book anyone can understand. It describes in lay terms how and why many of us will actually achieve open-ended vitality and independence. It also shows you how you can improve your odds of being one of that lucky group by applying what we know today. So whether you want to simply avoid sickness and disease and live your life to the max... or whether you're ready to take a leap into an exciting open-ended future,Smart, Strong and Sexy at 100is your key. More life,Dave", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She is widely traveled and has a particular interest in both Greece and Russia. Her first novel was published in 1957, but it was not until 1970 that she turned her hand to crime writing.

Philpott skillfully interweaves his articulation of this ethic for dealing with past injustice with careful attention to the objections that might be lodged against it.  What makes his discussion especially compelling, however, is that it does not remain at the theoretical level but is enriched by wide-ranging references to how states and other political entities, over the past fifty years, have in fact tried to deal with past injustices and to move forward to a just and peaceful society.\"--Nicholas Wolterstorff, author ofJustice: Rights and Wrongs\"provocative and innovative....Philpott makes a compelling case for placing reconciliation at the core of our thinking about justice and for theorizing justice in a more comprehensive manner.\"  --Ethics", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As they inch toward high school, when Marco will take off for a private school, a new weight is placed on their friendship. When Marco proposes an elaborate plan to sneak into the high-school prom and proclaim his love for British student Benji, a rocker who is heading back to London in a matter of days, it seems the perfect way to have one last adventure before the boys go their separate ways. An imperfect plan and some tense and very real confrontations with a school bully bring out issues in the boys' friendship that have been simmering below the surface. The knock-'em-out resolution, in which the good guy not only defeats the bully, but also wins a kiss from his dream boy, will make readers pump their fists with excitement, and the strain in Stephen and Marco's friendship exemplifies the growing pains that many will be able to relate to. Moskowitz's novel, which plays out in a matter of two days, successfully portrays the world of middle school both as it is and as it might be-one in which parents are faulty, but the boy gets the boy and the school bully gets it square in the nose.-Joanna Sondheim, Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School, New York Cityα(c) Copyright 2011.

It can bring you a lifetime of joy, yet for some it is more of a nightmare that they hope to awake from. The key to a happy marriage is to understand and acknowledge that it is a living and breathing thing, and therefore it must receive attention in order to grow and thrive. Unfortunately, in today's world, time is a precious commodity. People have to work harder and longer to make ends meet, and find themselves with less and less time for themselves, much less someone else. Fortunately, investing just a few minutes during key moments in your day can provide your marriage the stimuli to grow and blossom. 10 Minutes A Day To A Better Marriage addresses those critical moments in your day that make the most impact in your relationship. When you take a look deep inside many marital issues, time and attention are typically the underlying culprit. When someone does not feel appreciated, desired, or wanted, they tend to look for those feelings elsewhere, or they just shut down. Many a cold bedroom could be different with just a few minutes of undivided focused attention. 10 Minutes A Day To A Better Marriage outlines the most critical moments in your day where just 10 minutes of your time will make the biggest impact. You will understand why those moments are important, and why even a couple of minutes here and there mean so much to your marriage. Take a look inside, and uncover the best 10 minutes you ever spent, and enjoy all of the benefits the rest of your life.", "related": ["B009SZYBZ8"], "rank": 1790048, "title": "10 Minutes A Day To A Better Marriage", "author": "Guy Russell", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I immigrated to Africa with my parents when I was 5, completed my studies and graduated as a Mechanical Engineer in the University of Lagos.I got married to my University sweetheart and returned to the United Kingdom in 1986 to complete my postgraduate training at Goldsmith University.For the next 13 years I taught Electronics and Design & Technology; after which I established Dynamic Words Discipleship College (a training institute for Christians who want to deepen their walk with God. My wife and I presently lead The King's House - (aka London's Alive Church).I have written several inspirational books, manuals and training materials, and continue to give my services as a marriage counsellor and motivational coach.How long have you been writing? I wrote and published my first book in 1985 after my wife and I had a traumatic experience at the birth of our first child. So I think it is fair to say that I started writing seriously in 1985.Tell us about your book. 'How to Rescue Your Marriage from Breaking up' will show people how to identify and avoid ten major relationship 'killers' that strangle relationships and destroy marriages. I believe that if a couple can understand the key points I discuss in this concise e-book, they would be well on their way to building a rock solid marriage.What made you write this book? My wife and I had a turbulent relationship when we first got together, but have since both learnt to slow down, grow up and draw closer. Now, we have an awesome marriage and a desire to help other experience what we have. That's why I have been writing books onmarriage and relationshipfor years.  Some of my other books include:HOW TO BUILD A ROCK SOLID MARRIAGE, TEN KEYS TO EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION IN MARRIAGE, HOW TO RESCUE YOUR MARRIAGE FROM BREAKING UP, UNDERSTAND YOUR MARRIAGE VOWS, MAXIMISING YOUR SEASON OF SINGLENESS, and SAY GOODBYE TO DATING.Was it easy for you to write or did you ever get writers block? I find it fairly easy to write from my heart. And, I've learnt to take a break and find something else to do when I experience writers block.What age is your target for this book? I'd say the book is targeting anyone in a serious relationship - from 16 and upward.Have you always seen yourself as becoming a writer? No. I studied Engineering precisely because I preferred figures and making things instead of writing or reading long prose. But I love teaching, and one way to get my message across is to write.Do you write full-time or do you have another job as well? I have a full time job as a minister - shepherding people. I am the principle of a Dynamic Words Discipleship College. And, I teach & lecture in my spare time.How long did it take you to finish this book? Not very long! I don't like fat padded books myself. So when I write, I like to keep it simple, precise and to the point. When I need to use stories, I keep them to a minimum. I leave the waffle to language majors.Do you have a Facebook fan page or Twitter account for your fans to follow you on?You can find me on face book:facebook.com/apeters60", "related": [], "rank": 3007037, "title": "HOW TO RESCUE YOUR MARRIAGE FROM BREAKING UP: Avoiding The Ten Major Relationship Killers.

Barton is the author of several fast-paced mystery and thriller series, featuring lively characters and lots of action. \"Miz Scarlet\" (Scarlet Wilson Mystery series) is a teacher-turned-innkeeper, who throws herself into danger with a feisty determination to make things right, relying on cohorts like \"Captain Peacock\" and \"Colonel Grey Poupon\" to help her solve the clues. Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans. It's the perfect human storm.\"", "related": ["B00D0IPCCK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Specifically, the author lucidly analyzes the evolving conceptions of citizenship as legal status, as rights, and as identity. She persuasively illustrates how the early optimism that a new India could be fashioned out of a deeply hierarchical and unequal society led to a formally inclusive legal membership and group-differentiated citizenship. Unfortunately, in recent years these progressive civic ideals embodied in the constitution have been fast losing support in a climate of growing intolerance, widening economic inequality, and weak and fragmented civic solidarity. This provocative book makes an important contribution to the understanding of one of the core challenges facing contemporary India, including a theoretically rich and informed discussion on issues pertaining to democracy, citizenship, and governance in the world's largest democracy.(S. D. SharmaChoice2013-09-01)A contribution to our understanding of citizenship and democracy in India that is empirically rich and theoretically sophisticated. (Amrita Basu, Amherst College)The idea of citizenship in India promised inclusive community, but the country's enlivened politics have transformed that promise into a more fragmentary, divisive reality. In this magisterial analytic history,Niraja Gopal Jayalmaps for the first time the concept's vicissitudes, and makes an essential contribution to our understanding of contemporary India and of political theory.

It grabbed my interest from the beginning and then took me on an emotional ride that kept drawing me back to the story when I really should have been doing other things! Some tough emotional parts, but I liked that... it was an honest story, told from the heart.

Ms. Ingram seems to have an amazing talent for making her characters come alive and the events she portrays have the reader believing that this could really happen.

But that doesn't mean I didn't have any. My newly gained freedom is totally responsible for my direct, \"no-holds barred\" approach to writing fiction with a realistic touch. As a reader I appreciated authors who have their stuff in order and who have thoroughly researched their work. Thus, I will not subject my readers to wild scenarios and implausible results. The author who does not respect the reader's intelligence is condemned to failure. \"Insurrection: Appalachian Command\" is the first of a series of extremely realistic - and graphic - war adventures featuring former Army Ranger Jude Winthrop. It sets the series' background of our America collapsing under an Al Qaeda terror attack. Jude is a superb soldier, with great military skills; but he is also plagued with many human flaws, accentuated with the loss of his wife and unborn child at the hands of the terrorists. Exhibiting complex contradictions of character, he is incredibly good at waging war, yet finds it difficult to commit to a new love after Angie's death. A writer by trade, it all began at college newspapers, and moved subsequently to military and diplomatic professional publications. In the final phase of my professional duality it was easy: writing is the staple of the Foreign Service. That being said, Foreign Service writing has a large component of secret stuff. Consequently, I have to clear all my books through the State Department and other government agencies; which presents a timeliness and stylistic challenge. This first episode of the series was cleared by the government in May, 2013. Writing is a lot of fun; especially when the author's objective is to entertain the reader with fast paced, realistic and inspiring adventures. Also, keeping in touch with the reader keeps the author in touch with reality. So, I welcome your emails at dsjr@outlook.com. I willl do my best to answer your comments and concerns fully and promptly.", "related": [], "rank": 1713306, "title": "Insurrection: Appalachian Command", "author": "Dan Santos", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After graduating from law school he fell victim to the psychological pitfalls of the bar exam. In searching for a solution he found a scarcity of material addressing the mental facets of standardized test performance. As a result, he developed his own strategy to turn his mind into his greatest performance asset. He discovered that the techniques he applied to the bar exam were applicable to all high stakes standardized tests. Mind over SAT can turn you mind into a performance asset.

He had sent a message\ntelling her that he would like a word and she hoped that he would tell her that\nthe horrible nightmare was over. The front door squeaked as it opened and\nAmelia jumped to her feet. Henry walked into the room and right away reached to\nembrace her but she stood with her arms crossed. She was still angry at him for\nwhat he was putting her through, but glancing at his concerned eyes made her\nwonder how long she could stay upset with him. \"What is it you want to talk\nabout?\" She questioned as her arms dropped and began to play with the trim on\nher apron.\"You've been quiet,\" Henry stated. He knew that\nshe was upset about his decision but figured that she was over it. \"Is there\nsomething wrong?\"She cocked her head and looked at him while he\ntook a seat in the arm chair. He was a man who healed the ill but perhaps he\nwas maddening himself, she thought. He couldn't have forgotten the torture he\nwas putting her through. \"Yes, this whole engagement is wrong. I can't believe\nI have to tell you that.\"Henry placed his forehead in his hand. He\ncould feel the heat from inside his body rush to the surface of his face. It\nwas foolish to think that she wasn't going to continue fighting for her\nfreedom. He was desperate to give it to her but it would cost him his if he\ndid. Again he made himself act as if he was behind the Samuels and Van Martin\nunion. \"Amelia, we aren't going to get into that again. Are we? Don't you\nrealize that I'm trying to do what is best for you?\"Appalled, Amelia answered, \"Best for me? You\ncan't possibly think that Thomas is best for me.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Employed at China Criminal Police University as a teacher of criminal psychology, he has a clear insight into all sorts of criminal behavior. Early in 2007, with the publishing of the Psychological Criminals series (which, along with the prequel The Seven Readers, has been called the Fang Mu series by readers), this book's performance was no more than mediocre at first in a Chinese marketplace that had grown accustomed to European and American crime novels. Still, a small number of readers became deeply fascinated by it.  Before they were formally published, the second book, Skinner's Box, and the third book, Blade of Silence, had already gained 600,000 fans by word of mouth alone. By December 2012, City Lights, the fourth book in the Psychological Criminals series, was hot off the press and had climbed straight to fifth place in Amazon China's new release rankings list in the suspense category. In this series of novels, you will read about an unprecedented new master sleuth. Fang Mu. He is sensitive, fragile, and deeply afraid of death, but has been blessed with innate skill and an intuition that allows him to solve crimes with almost miraculous proficiency. His instinctual process of elimination causes him to be drawn inexorably down into a cruel whirlpool of murder cases, and during a constant battle of wits with the killers, Fang Mu begins to discover that he has his own dark side, deep within his psyche. He seems to be no different from them; his blood flows with all sorts of insane but somehow superlative criminal thoughts. At the same time that he uncovers the identity of a killer, he also reveals his own indecisiveness and loss of self-control.  Using a deft pen planted firmly in the foundations of realism, a heavy flavor of the aesthetics of crime, trains of thought and reasoning that are totally different from what ordinary people might be used to, and reflections on ethics that are truly thought-provoking, the author has provided readers with a new perspective from which to understand a realistic version of China society.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The author stocks it with vibrant, sharply etched characters--especially Cecile, a feminist and agnostic whose hard-boiled humanism falters when it comes to her daughter. Emma is an appealing heroine cut from the Bridget Jones cloth, so charmingly imperfect and insecure that readers can't help rooting for her.Entertaining chick lit that's just what the doctor ordered.", "related": ["B005CM1R30"], "rank": 2531805, "title": "The Valeditztorian eBook", "author": "Alli Curran", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has been married to her best friend for ten years, and together they have two of the most beautiful children in the world. She and her husband are Junior High Sweethearts, a couple who are truly meant to be together. One day, their love story might make it into a book.  Isabel is the middle name of the author, and Lucero is her maiden name. Together they create her pen name. She was born in a small town in New Mexico, and was more than happy to move far, far away.  She is a collector of high heels and tattoos, and is highly obsessed with both. She owns a crazy, little Miniature Pinscher who thinks he’s a Doberman. His name is Tyson.  Isabel has always been an avid reader, able to devour books in a day or two. With her now focusing on writing, the reading has slowed, but her love for reading is still there.  Something noteworthy is that Isabel loves to hear from her readers. Never hesitate to get in touch. She’s always willing and ready to talk about anything. If you enjoy this book, she encourages you to not only let her know, but let the world know. Goodreads, Amazon, book blogs, groups, etc. She understands that word of mouth is the best form of promotion.

You are always welcome to contact me at: abby@type-writer.net I'm thirty-two years old and live in a small town in beautiful Ontario with my two dogs. I was born and raised here. I went to school in Montreal and Ottawa. I studied French, Women's Studies and Literature but wasn't the most focused student. I took creative writing classes in school but it wasn't till I got back to my hometown and was working as a waitress that I really started writing. I'm an only child and both my parents passed away when I was quite young. I do feel a bit alone in the world. I like to write about strong, adventurous women. They are the kinds of women I like to imagine I am, or at least would be if I had the courage. The protagonist usually has a difficult past or family life and is up against the world in some way. My stories are fairly graphic and erotic, but I also include a good story, strong character development, and a genuinely full and engaging reading experience. The sexual themes I write about all come from my own, private fantasies. They are the kinds of things I imagine happening to me, even though I know they are unlikely in real life. They're not realistic in the sense that they reflect life, but they are absolutely honest in the sense that they reflect my own deeply held thoughts and desires.", "related": ["B00LNM8EXE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 46, "rating_average": 4.0652, "rating_total": 187.0}
