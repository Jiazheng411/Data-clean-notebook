Don't worry, \"Out of Whack\" by Jeff Strand, author of \"How to Rescue a Dead Princess,\" will definitely appeal to your Hoot Island sensibilities. Yes, it's about a young man growing up and achieving his dreams, but fortunately those dreams are to get laid and to become a comedian, not necessarily in that order, and you may actually find yourself in physical pain from laughing about both.This isn't, strictly speaking, an \"adult\" book, but after you've read about the disastrous double date, The Burger Bordello, and the painful-to-read first sex scene, you'll be giggling too hard too care.--Hoot Island.com Reviews", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I. Warshawski, Elizabeth I, must as usual take on a murder case or two in Harper's fifth well-researched, intrigue-filled historical (after 2002's The Queene's Cure). The royal sleuth is surprised by a deadly assault in the Hampton Court maze one night after making an appointment to meet old flame Robin Dudley. Did the attacker mean to kill her, or was she mistaken for someone else? Disturbing clues suggest that someone near to the queen wants her dead. A confrontation in a highly unusual maze makes for a thrilling conclusion. Harper's portrait of the Virgin Queen as sleuth is illuminating, but readers familiar with Elizabethan history will spot the villain much too soon.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

First meeting the mountain gorillas in Rwanda, the author treks up into Dian Fossey’s mountainous habitat and discusses her life, the Rwandan genocide, and gorilla behavior. He then moves on to East Africa and the region’s chimpanzees, telling of his dismay at the differences between gorilla society and that of chimpanzees, whom he calls “thugs.” The bonobos offer the bigger contrast to chimpanzees as these apes use sex instead of violence to resolve disputes. When locating western lowland gorillas Raffaele is charged by an enraged silverback male protecting his offspring. Finally, when observing orangutans at a feeding station he discovers that they understand trade—after he moved a bucket of fruit away from a female she took his camera bag, only returning it when he returned the fruit.

It may be unfair to criticize a first novel too much. Mendelson has undoubted writing talent, but it is as if Anita Brookner were trying to write a younger version of Bridget Jones; a lot of navel-gazing interspersed with annoying introspective listmaking, while what plot there is crawls towards a less than startling denouement. I found it hard to believe that someone of 22, with three years of university behind her, could be quite so gauche and unaware. There are tantalizing glimpses of a better novel waiting to be developed. What sort of family has produced Anna's younger drug-taking sister, and why has Anna cut her arms? What exactly has been the relationship between Magda and Stella? There is some fertile ground here, scattered with promising seeds, but they fail to germinate satisfactorily.

He knows nothing of himself that could possibly account for the sudden surging rage, the overpowering urge to destroy.He is certain of only one thing. He must discover what triggered his actions else face a grim, unpredictable future. Doctors can not help. The answer lies within himself. And he must find it.

In this journey, lies the tale, a journey many of us take in one way or another.Tony looks without. And within. But in the latter there is none of the psycho-drivel that seems so common. Instead, he examines all about him with total honesty, then seeks to attune his inner being to what he discovers.Who has not asked right out loud, \"What made me do that?\" Nick Taddeo seeks to answer this question for all of us in \"August In the Mind.\" While there is no attempt here to provide definitive answers, what Tony discovers may also relate to you, your concerns, and your fears.This story will haunt you into the foreseeable future. Bits and pieces will linger indefinitely. And some may help you find a better way.Nick Taddeo personally is tightly bound to his Italian heritage. He has walked the streets of which he speaks. He knows how they came to be. And he has examined each with care.

Given the assignment of learning more about the movie-making business by his businessman boss, Hap Wiseman, who just acquired a production company, Burns discovers colorful characters and a murder mystery. With a quick pace and enough twists to keep the reader guessing nearly until the last paragraph, the book is easily accessible and engaging. Each of the characters gets a moment to shine, and Stevens doesn't waste time on complicated subplots or (too many) romantic rendezvous. With rotating points of view, the book shows a thorough grasp of Hollywood moviemaking and the strange types that inhabit that world. . .

It is among the most subtle historical treatments available of the struggle for local control over decisions that affect urban communities.

With the availability of disabling drugs such as \"ecstasy,\" the phrase \"slipped a Mickey Finn\" has taken on new meaning, not only for the victim but also for the investigative team. This multiauthored book describes the fundamental differences between sexual assault and drug-facilitated sexual assault and points out the difficulties drugs pose in forensic studies. According to this book, drug-facilitated sexual assault can be \"the perfect crime in a pill.\" The victim, out at a social event, meets and mingles with a respectable-looking person, who secretly slips (gamma)-hydroxybutyric acid or ecstasy into the victim's drink. The victim, totally unaware, becomes incapacitated and is then taken by the perpetrator to an apartment or private site where she is raped, sodomized, and photographed while unconscious. She later awakes and is unaware of what has happened, save for the bruises or the lethargic aftermath of the drug. She may only realize 24 to 48 hours later that she has been sexually assaulted, at a time when diagnostic studies may be too late. Although the book focuses on forensic issues, it covers the various experiences, symptoms, and memories of victims and the characteristics of assailants, and it describes settings where drug-facilitated sexual assault commonly occurs. There are major differences between the perpetrators of drug-facilitated sexual assault and perpetrators of forcible or coercive rape. There is rarely violence during drug-facilitated sexual assault, and rarely do the attackers display remorse. These assailants use drugs that are available to them: some may use their own barbiturate or benzodiazepine prescription, and those employed in health care may use various hypnotics or sedatives in their possession. Most of the book deals with the various classes of drugs used in this type of assault and their availability, metabolism, and biologic activity in the victim's specimens. Although alcohol is the drug most commonly used in drug-facilitated sexual assault (accounting for one third of cases), marijuana and lysergic acid diethylamide are used in 18 percent of cases and cocaine in 8 percent, and (gamma)-hydroxybutyrate and flunitrazepam (a benzodiazepine) are becoming ever more popular and readily obtainable. The authors note that (gamma)-hydroxybutyric acid can be made in a kitchen from industrial solvents and paint remover. There are simple instructions on the Internet for making these products. The book targets as its audience clinicians, laboratory-services staff, police officers, district attorneys, the staff of hospital emergency departments and urgent-care settings, and even college administrators, all of whom may confront the issue of \"date rape.\" All the contributors recommend the use of teamwork in working with victims of drug-facilitated sexual assault and in solving the cases. The team consists of the victim, the sexual-assault nurse examiner (or the equivalent), the sexual-assault response team (or the emergency-department equivalent), the prosecutor and his or her staff, the laboratory analysts, and expert witnesses, all of whom understand the ramifications of drug-facilitated sexual assault. The sexual-assault nurse examiner and sexual-assault response team play an extremely important part but are not routinely available. As with any multiauthored book, there is a great deal of repetition. Each chapter could stand alone as a separate article. However, the message is worth the repetitive reading. This book is definitely timely.David S. Rosenthal, M.D.Copyright © 2002 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.

Her work as a phone sex operator and erotic stories author, gives her the opportunity to stimulate both her readers and callers. Giving pleasure is her top priority and one she relishes doing.

She has already written a fictional story for young adults called Mindy's Favorite Room. Ask Elaine is yet another book that is a departure from erotica. It is one she hopes will make a difference in someone's life, when making certain decisions. What means the most personally to Elaine is her book Skippy, a fictional children's story written with the love she feels for her dog who died in 1988. He is forever in her heart.

While I had no formal training in fine arts I did study commercial art for a couple of semesters in college. I was never really interested in a learned artistic ability because I was not creating for anyone other than myself and I was the best judge of whether it was appealing to me or not. For years I have been creating stories on my childhood and some of the wonderful experiences I had as a child. I wanted to be able to share that with my children so that they and their children could see a different side of life than they live today. I guess I really wanted them to know that life is not just material things but emotional things with respect being one of the most important things I have always tried to teach them. One day I picked up one of my grandchildren’s water color sets and started creating some of the Illustrations you see in my current book and video. I feel that the stories can be brought to life by showing them what it was like in order to draw them into the story. I want them to see that there are other things in life to appreciate and how fortunate our family is to be surrounded by loving parents, grand parents, aunts and uncles and lots of cousins. One of the side affects of creating the stories was that not only did my immediate family gain a lot from the book but others who had shared some of those years with me when I was young were touched by the stories and illustrations as well. I realized that this is something which many people are hungry for in trying to hold on to their own roots. It has been a very rewarding experience for myself and my wife as while putting it all together we found ourselves being transported back in time and found warm and wonderful thoughts from long ago when as young newly weds we would lay on our living room floor and play Italian Opera’s which I would translate into English as she wrote them down. We still have those hand scribbled notes today as treasured memories of a simpler life.

After the British border patrol in Saudi Arabia discovers an infected man near death and an Iraqi doctoral candidate commits suicide in Edinburgh, Dewar connects the two incidents and deduces that the Iraqis are resurrecting the smallpox virus in order to engage in biological warfare. After that, it can only be expected, as in any thriller, that the worst will happen and it does. At times, the story is predictable and anticlimactic. What makes the story interesting, however, is the tension of the smallpox virus, which breaks out in a rowdy, drug-infested neighborhood, and Dewar's own compassion. Although the language could have easily dipped into medical and scientific mumbo-jumbo, layman's terms are primarily used so that anyone can understand the discussions. The smallpox virus may now be extinct, but good stories about it still thrive.Ellie Barta-Moran", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 21.0}

Februar 1842 in Hohenstein-Ernstthal geboren und starb am 30. März 1912 in Radebeul bei Dresden. Sohn eines armen Webers, war bis zum 5. Lebensjahr blind. Als junger Volksschullehrer wurde er wegen Diebstahls entlassen; er verbrachte im ganzen 7 1/2 Jahre wegen Eigentumsvergehen und Betrügereien aus finanzieller Notlage im Gefängnis. Erste schriftstellerische Arbeiten sind erzgebirgische Dorfgeschichten und Humoresken für Zeitschriften in Dresden, ferner Kolportageromane, die später gegen seinen Willen unter seinem Namen neu herausgebracht wurden und seinem Ruf sehr schadeten. Rasch bekannt wurde er durch seine Reiseerzählungen, die hauptsächlich unter den Indianerstämmen Nordamerikas oder im Nahen Orient spielen. Er wählte später die Ich-Form, wodurch der Anschein des Selbsterlebten hervorgerufen wird (Idealgestalt Old Shatterhand, Kara Ben Nemsi). Möglicherweise hat May schon früh die Reise nach orientalischen Ländern unternommen, kaum aber nach Nordamerika; später mehrere Weltreisen. Der Einfluß von Mays Abenteuerbüchern auf die Jugend wird verschieden, heute meist gedämpft positiv beurteilt.", "related": [], "rank": 55800, "title": "Die Sklavenkarawane (German Edition) eBook", "author": "Karl May", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In September 1103, Geoffrey and his friend, Sir Roger of Durham, both former crusader knights, must try to solve two murders after surviving a shipwreck off England's south coast. A fellow passenger aboard the Patrick, Philippa, claims that she saw Juhel, a Breton, throw a Norman named Paisnel overboard. Another shipmate, the elderly Vitalis, winds up on the English shore strangled to death. While trying to identify the killer or killers, Geoffrey and Roger find themselves on the run from the Patrick's crew, who turn out to be pirates. Keeping characters and motives straight is more challenging than it should be, especially as one of two former academics sharing the Beaufort pseudonym has written numerous intricate, more coherent puzzles under the name Susanna Gregory.

Previously a journalist and lecturer in Creative and Imaginative Practice at University College Dublin (WERRC), Orna has,  since 2008, been a fulltime writer. Having enjoyed publication by Attic Press (nonfiction) and Penguin (fiction), she now mostly publishes her own work and she is founder and director of The Alliance of Independent Authors.~~~~~~~~~~~~ORNA SAYS:\"My NOVELS usually take the form of family-based dramas. Often they are historical fiction and usually there's a murder mystery or other buried secret from the past causing chaos in the present. I like to write emotional twists and surprises and I also like to pay attention to language which is, I think, why my books get described as literary fiction. My style is not at all flowery or ornate but I do take pains. How a sentence is written is as important to me as what it says. Or to be more accurate, the two are completely bound up in each other. And I write about big themes. Identity, family loyalty, truth, sex and death, the struggle between freedom and belonging.  But that doesn't mean I neglect story. If it came to a choice between story and style,  (it doesn't), story would win. For me, story is supreme.My POEMS, similarly, are accessible and tend towards the inspirational. I think everyone should read a poem a day (keep a poetry book in the bathroom is my advice).My NONFICTION is all about applying the creative process not just to writing and art but to everything in life. We've all been educated to neglect our creative capacities -- a big mistake, as the creative age overtakes the information age. Thankfully, like any other muscle, our creative ability is ignited and revitalised just by being used and this leads to greater happiness, freedom and self-expression. The 'Go Creative!' books point the way.", "related": ["B00KCOUOQ4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is with this in mind that thecontributors to Theology and Practice of Mission address some of the most compelling, practical, and crucial issues facing the global church today, issues such as justice, discipleship, community, and unreached people groups.Faithfully addressing a comprehensive understanding of mission through the lens of those most directly involved and engaged—God, the church, and the nations—the contributors don’t just establish the need for theory and practice to cooperate. They walk the reader, whether student, scholar, or practioner, through how that can be done to the glory of God no matter the context.It is enormously encouraging to read a book on mission that consistently puts God and God’s mission first, that applies the grand biblical framework of creation, fall, redemption and new creation thoroughly and repeatedly across almost every issue it addresses, and which tackles some very controversial areas with grace, wisdom, and biblical thoroughness.

It has been said to be, \"a finely-crafted tale of social interactions, of love and of finding yourself, all tied up into small-town life,\" (Goodreads review, Sept. 2011). \"There were several scenes at which I laughed out loud ... folks who enjoy literary fiction and/or romantic fiction should enjoy it,\" (4 star review, March 2012). 'Brizecombe Hall' is a novelette set in England in the late Regency / early Victorian period. \"Plenty of atmosphere. Shades of Jane Eyre. A good escapist story that you can lose yourself in,\" (4 star review). The historical novelettes, 'Danburgh Castle' and 'Rhiannon' are both Medieval romances. \"The plot was tight and kept me engaged; good characterisation meant I truly cared about what was happening,\" (4 star review of Danburgh Castle). Novelette, 'The Hangar Dance,' is a romance set in rural England during the Second World War. 'The Ramblers' is a contemporary short story. All of Catherine's publications are available as e-books.  Some are also available in print. Catherine values feedback from readers and would like to thank all those who have taken the time to read, rate, review and comment on her fiction.", "related": [], "rank": 3529870, "title": "Elizabeth Clansham eBook", "author": "Catherine E.

Posteriormente, trabajó en el Diario de Caracas, un periódico alternativo que intentó llegar a la clase de jóvenes profesionales venezolanos. Allí, Rodríguez trabajó como reportera de sucesos políticos, escribiendo sobre los hechos más sobresalientes del último segundo mandato de Carlos Andrés Pérez, a principios de los 90. En el 2000, Rodríguez fue contratada por el Nuevo Herald de Miami, para trabajar como reportera de inmigración, pero luego se dedicó por varios años, a escribir sobre las escuelas  públicas de Miami Dade, los rejuegos de la politica y su influencia en el presupuesto educativo, y la difusion de logros de maestros y estudiantes por encima de las diferencias culturales y economicas.

It was a blast growing up there! I spent my early years working behind the scenes for stage companies. I started writing when I was in high school and continued writing when I went to film school. That was a wonderful experience for me and pumping out my first 120 page manuscript didn’t hurt either. All the while I was writing screenplays, though, I secretly wanted to write books. But I seriously doubted my ability to do so. Thus, it took me nearly thirty-five years to finally convince myself to give it a shot. My influences while growing up were the arts and the entertainment world. I studied art in Claremont California where I grew up, and received my BFA in film-making at BYU. I pretty much grew up dabbling in the world of Hollywood--mostly on the outskirts. I had family there and they would invite me to come out and spend time around the movie sets. So I caught the bug and worked for nearly twenty-five years in the entertainment industry. I also spent ten years working with troubled teens. I now live in Utah where my wife and I raised six children, lots of cats, a couple of dogs and a whole lot of chickens. We visit the L.A. area often and still consider it home.  An interesting anecdote from life: When I was sixteen I snuck onto the set of one of the first mini-series, being filmed in my home town--Rich Man Poor Man. Surprisingly, they didn’t kick me out. The sound man spoke with the director and they agreed to let me stay. So I got to spend the day watching Robert Reed (Father of the television series, The Brady Bunch) and Peter Strauss act—a lot of fun for a kid.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There's not a wasted word or a single misstep in his story of a middle-aged muckraking journalist determined to expose New York City corruption. John Wells is a credibly complex character, a true believer in justice who nonetheless isn't naive enough to expect justice to be done without a struggle. Wells teeters uneasily between the roles of crusader and cynic as he tries to clear himself of a murder charge pinned on him by a crooked cop who bears a grudge. Peterson's punchy style and deft manipulation of telling detail give the story an almost cinematic vividness; a spare account of Wells being chased through a speeding subway train is particularly exciting. The mystery remains a genuine cliffhanger virtually until the novel's last paragraph.

Taking\na strong position against a cult figure like Ayn Rand incurs predictable\nemotional attacks from her supporters. One reviewer, who must still be in high\nschool, has attacked me because Atlas doesn't appear in my critique as if he is\na main character inAtlas Shrugged. I question whether this person has even\nread the book.   Atlas Shruggedisfictional fantasy with a death-ray machine thrown in\nfor effect. John Galt is Rand's imaginary hero, complete with impeccable\nideological business ethics that simply do not exist in the real world. Galt is\nRand's romantic idealized version of the man she wanted for a mate. He is her\nAtlas! The economic model she offers is also a castle in the sky. Still, it\ndoesn't trouble true believers one iota that there has never been an economy on\nthis planet like the one Rand advocates with the ability to sustain and\nmaintain a strong middle class. Never! But the cult is not deterred. To be told\nthat Objectivism is a utopian daydream viscerally based on a celebration of\nnarcissism fazes them not. Facts about human psychology roll off of\nObjectivists like rain off ducks. Objectivists are impervious to the reason\nthey worship because of their very own emotion, which prevents reasonable\narguments from registering.I'm frequently accused of\nbeing biased, and I am indeed, as lots of critics are. We are biased against\nabsurdist fantasies concocted by someone who didn't come close to walking her\nown talk--someone who, to the detriment of this country, continues to influence\nundeveloped minds with extremely flawed adolescent ideas about economics and\nhuman behavior. Rand based her whole ideology on the premise that human beings\nare first and foremost reasoning creatures. To the contrary, we are primarily\nemotional creatures to a fault, and altruism--far from being an evil, as Rand\nmaintained--is a fundamental part of our nature. We are greedy and generous,\nselfish and selfless. Claiming that selfishness is the only genuine virtue is\nas ridiculous as making the same claim for selflessness and arguing that anyone\nwho has anything should give all of it to the poor. Moreover, when it comes to\nindividual motivation, research has confirmed that financial incentives are\nless effective than the intrinsic rewards of autonomy, mastery, and purpose. The survival-of-the-fittest\nnotion that every creature is locked into competition with every other\nindividual of the same species has been rendered absurd by the evidence that\nmutual aid and cooperation are by far more common in the natural world than\novert competition. True, there are instances of hierarchy and pecking order in\nthe animal kingdom, but these function more as sorting devices than competitive\nforces; otherwise the result would be species extinction.  Our reasoning skills are\nembodied in emotion. We make important decisions constantly because of influences\nwe don't even consider relevant and very often are not even aware of. Those who\nare versed in the latest developments in psychology and neuroscience know this.\nBut Objectivists habitually live on opinion borrowed from Rand, and the\ninterest they pay on the loan is contempt for people who don't share the\ndelusion.Believing that one's narcissistic\nlongings represent a special kind of virtue that the rest of us are missing is\nseductive. Once internalized, it's hard to overwrite with contrary evidence, no\nmatter how compelling it is. So, my advice to true believers is to stop\nfocusing on what Rand said and learn to think for yourselves.", "related": ["B0050YV1R2"], "rank": 1492749, "title": "Atlas Begs To Differ", "author": "Charles D.

After creating a series of short fantasy pieces for a class assignment that were received with praise, he was hooked on writing fiction for the entertainment of others. Now Brandon writes supernatural horror as well as fantasy, science fiction, and other genres. His short fiction is available online in various formats. Brandon still lives on the family farm in northwestern North Carolina with his wife and family. Taking inspiration from his homeland, he brings southern sensibilities and a modern flair to these classic genre themes.

He bought a VW bus for $100, moved into it and set out on a journey to show the world that it was possible to live life on your own terms. That journey took him from waking up under icy blankets in the Pacific Northwest to waking up under palm tress in Southeast Asia. Three years later, his first book, Rough Living: Tips and Tales of a Vagabond was published. After an Anthropology Honors Degree from the University of Hawaii (with undeclared minors in film and surf) he hit the road again in 2008. Since that time,he's lived primarily in Morocco and Turkey, married a Moroccan girl he couchsurfed with, and become a proud father. He's been to more than 40 countries, founded a successful online travel magazine, and still doesn't have a boss.

And they’ve done it with the help of the liberal retreat on ideals of seeking to socialize public goods and achieve social equality for others besides white males. Self contrasts breadwinner liberalism of the 1960s, which relied on government programs to assist families, and more recent breadwinner conservatism, which promises to keep the government out of the lives of families. In examining social and political trends since the 1960s, Self traces how liberalism morphed from an ideal of an economic helping hand into constituting a threat to the nation’s morals and how conservatism came to be seen as a defender of the family and protector against the sexual revolution and coarsening of American culture. As Self analyzes the major social movements since the 1960s, from civil rights to feminism to gay rights, he explores distinctions between private and public life, the tension between liberty and equality, and the challenge of identity politics to developing national policies. --Vanessa Bush", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hale (aka Tony Hale) began his career in stand-up comedy. Touring professionally as a comic for nearly a decade, he never envisioned that he would one day teach the world how to sleep, poop, and even lose weight. On Valentine's Day, 2004, Tony lost his voice and it never came back. After twenty-three doctors couldn't figure out the problem, Tony decided it was time to dig for his own answers. Eight years later, not only did Tony figure out his own issues, he also happened upon hidden information about how to improve countless other health problems. Though Tony likes to boast about the fact that he holds no legitimate credentials (nor does he believe that we need any more \"experts\" from the same pool of knowledge already failing so many with health issues), he is greatly respected by his peers in the natural health industry. The biggest manufacturers in the health, fitness and organic products industries send Tony their products every year in hopes of winning one of his GearAwards. Beyond working with many celebrity clients, Tony is on the executive board of The Coalition For Health Education, a nonprofit association that helps professionals and their clients learn about health through nutrition. Additionally, Tony teaches monthly webinars about nutrition to doctors, nutritionists and other health care professionals from more than thirty-five countries. You can also find Tony producing documentaries like, WHY AM I SO FAT? A film that teaches the truth about weight loss while showcasing Tony's client, Gabe Evans, who lost 200 pounds in 9 ½ months by treating Tony's word as gospel.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She wanted to\nself-publish her book. Being a smart woman, she did some research and found\nthat there was a lot more to the process than she had initially thought. After\nwe had talked, I realized just how much I did know about being a published\nauthor.I started\nwriting in 2001, but did not get my first book published until 2008. I joined\nwriter's groups, (national and local) and studied my craft. I wrote romance,\nfantasy, and children's books. I wrote anything I thought would sell.Once I\nentered the publishing world, I learned quickly it takes more than good writing\nto be a published author. Signing on with a small e-book publisher became an\neducation in itself. The new world of e-publishing requires a different editing\nprocess. Files needed to be formatted properly so they could be converted to the\ndifferent file types which are required for the e-book readers and computers.\nOnce published, I needed to learn how to promote, not only myself, but my book.\nMore importantly, I needed to learn how to sell and entice people to read my\nbook.This little\npamphlet is a reference guide coming from my own personal experiences and my\nsincere attempt to help other people publish their work. Whether you're a new writer\nor a seasoned author, it's my hope you'll find information to advance your\nproject. If you need more information,\nI've listed searches available on the Internet that can aid you in achieving\nyour objective.Every person,\nwho reads this guide, has a different purpose in mind for their writing. Some\nwill use all the information, others only a select handful. Just remember this\nis an individual journey. You chose the roads you want to travel and you decide\nwhat works best for your specific project.I wish you\nthe best of success and hope, in some small way, I have made the path a little\neasier to travel.Tina Gayletinagayle.net/", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It'll\nruin all your fun if you do.Finally, Elyne has her own story. Surrender takes\nplace at the same time as Ruthless. Ranald's little sister isn't so little any\nmore. In the previous books, he often warned her that spying on men who bathed\nat the well would lead her to trouble.I had a lot of fun using her paranormal gift of\nlucid dreams. In the previous novels, I referred to them as more of a curse\nthan a gift. She was more than likely to misinterpret them than to recognize\ntheir true warning.She'd awake in strange places. Sometimes sitting in\nthe muck of a pigsty, in a horse stall or atop the tallest wall. Being beneath\nthe apple tree was one of her most harmless places until Graemme's footsteps\nalerted her. Of course, where else could she go but up?  She couldn't very well balance on the branch with\nher hands over her eyes, so she really wasn't spying on him, was she? And it\nwas only natural that he thought the lass watching his, er, performance was a\nserving girl waiting to have a warm toss between the sheets.Of course, everything had to go wrong. Poor wet, nekid\nGraemme. He didn't know when he pulled the trim ankle that a beautiful, near\nnekid lass would fall and send him to the ground with her atop him. Screaming.\nWhen Chief Broccin's very large feet appeared to near cradle Graemme's head,\ntheir fate was sealed.They were both too hardheaded to give in easily. It\nwas tremendous fun to write their sparring with each other, each determined to\nwin. And Squat added to the fun.Did you notice Chief Broccin really had a fondness\nfor the little misshapen dog? You didn't? Pfft! Read the book again, this time\nbetween the lines!He could have kicked Squat across the great hall\nwhen he peed on his boots, but he didn't. He could have had it thrown outside\nthe outer gates to fend for itself. Nope. Instead, he tossed food to the dog.\nMaybe he was gruff because he didn't want anyone to know he had a soft spot?\nHeck, when he said if Elyne didn't take the dog with her, he'd toss it to the\nwoodland creatures, I believe he was being gruff to hide the fact he'd miss the\ndog's antics when he was gone.I knew Elyne couldn't cave in and marry Graemme\nwithout a fight. She was deathly afraid of him. She believed he was the Scotsman pursuing Muriele across the country after having branded and beaten her. Elyne was determined to get rid of him when the old crone didn't scare him\noff. But he wasn't about to let Elyne escape him. After all, if the handsome\nwarrior didn't marry her, the Chief promised to, er, take his knife to\nGraemme's most treasured secret parts and display them as warning to all. Even with\nthe threat to his marvelous anatomy, he had a hard time keeping them secret\nwhen they sprang to life every time he thought of her.The predicament that Graemme and Elyne were in\ntickled my funny bone. I couldn't help but have fun with their arguments.\nThere's a serious side to the story, too. Graemme is ashonorableas Magnus,\nand hevowedhe'd marry Elyne. She was spoiled goods. Chief Broccin knew no rich Scotsman, not even an old geezer, would marry her after the news got out that they found her \"swiving\" for all to see. Graemme had to overcome obstacles that would make a\nlesser man run for his life!Oh, and I hope you liked the ending.Let me know what you thought about this intensely\nsensual tale.", "related": ["B00KY0YURU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There are many figures which support theories, both pure mathematics and mathematical finance. Among numerous tables, the comparison tables of financial models are especially helpful. … it is a pure joy to read the current edition … as a textbook and a quick reference guide to financial engineering. …—Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2011aThe author presents in his book powerful tools and methods, such as differential geometry, spectral decomposition, super symmetry, and others that can be also applied to practical problems in mathematical finance.—Adriana Hornikova,Technometrics, August 2010This is an extraordinary monograph, one of the few not to be missed by anybody deeply interested in stochastic financial modeling. It demonstrates in a rather striking manner how concepts and techniques of modern theoretical physics … may be applied to mathematical finance and option pricing theory. … it also presents original ideas never before published by researchers in finance. The monograph builds an original bridge to connect analysis, geometry, and probability together with stochastic finance, a bridge supported by both very advanced mathematics and imagination.Mathematicaand C++ are used for numerical implementation and many end-of-chapter problems lead the reader to recently published papers.—EMS Newsletter, September 2009The book by Pierre Henry-Labordère is a quite atour de force—Advanced Methods in Option Pricingmight appear to some as an understatement. One finds in this opus many gems from theoretical physics (non-Euclidean geometry, super-symmetric quantum mechanics, path integrals, and functional derivatives) applied to financial time series modeling and option pricing theory. Some of them are in fact known in the financial literature under different names; one of the most useful aspects of this book is a precise dictionary that should allow different communities to interact more easily. The advanced methods proposed by Pierre Henry-Labordère are beautiful and fascinating and will probably help to attract still a larger number of brilliant minds to financial mathematics, both in academic circles and in trading rooms.—Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Chairman, CFM Professor, École Polytechnique, and Editor-in-Chief,Quantitative FinanceWhen facing complex problems that arise in the real world, one should always remember that real answers to real questions may require imagination.

The book is clearly written, well referenced, and in a balanced and considered way avoids the temptations to privilege either theology or experience over science, or to reduce observed phenomena to material explanations. The author instead encourages conversation among scientists and religious practitioners with a view toward future collaborative exploration. I found the project original, credible and compelling. (Dr. John R. Peteet, Associate Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School)Readers interested in the relationship between religion and medicine will find that this book sets a new standard. (A.

One of six children of an Air Force Colonel, Dirgo grew up on air bases in the United States and England before finally settling in Colorado. A part-time job washing and waxing classic cars led to meeting Clive Cussler, acclaimed author and founder of NUMA National Underwater and Marine Agency, a non-profit historical research foundation. When an opportunity arose to co-author a book about NUMA, Cussler asked Dirgo to take on the task. The result was the New York Times best seller, The Sea Hunters. This was followed by Clive Cussler and Dirk Pitt Revealed and The Sea Hunters II. While working with Cussler, Dirgo also began writing on his own and soon thereafter published his first John Taft adventure, The Einstein Papers. Taking some time away from ocean adventures and writing, Dirgo formed several small businesses, moved back to the mountains he loves and concentrated on skiing and hiking. In 2010-11, he skied 115 days thus achieving a lifelong goal of skiing more than 100 days in a season. In 2012 Dirgo published his first eBook novel, Gunnison Grit, a work of historical fiction set in Gunnison County, Colorado. He followed this work with re-issues in electronic format of The Einstein Papers and The Tesla Documents (originally published in paperback under the title Tremor.) Dirgo has several new projects on the drawing board, including a new John Taft action/adventure. Dirgo lives in The Rocky Mountains of Colorado.

The result is a disjointed two-part narrative that fails to cohere. With its scheming relatives and promised inheritances, part one amounts to an old-fashioned whodunit, whereas part two offers suspense with sentimental overtones. The 1950 Christmas holiday is a gloomy one for Patience Smith, as the Oxford student learns that she's used up her trust fund and is in debt. She travels to Featherstone Hall, where she's to be a paid companion to her manipulative, mean-spirited great aunt. Patience soon learns that the matriarch keeps her unhappy brood tightly tethered by the purse strings. Furthermore, the old woman taunts her children and grandchildren by capriciously changing her will to leave her fortune to Patience. When she dies of an overdose of sleeping pills, the family gangs up to frame Patience for murder. Part one ends abruptly on a cliffhanger, which is never fully explained. Part two picks up 48 years later, with Patience, still bitter and haunted by that Christmas, suddenly finding herself bedeviled by an accusing young waif and by her cousinsAone of whom has made an attempt on her life. Characters who reappear in part two don't seem to have evolved logically from their earlier roles. What suspense there is falls flat; the mystery of the old woman's death is revisited in conversation, leading to a conjectural and unsatisfying resolution.

The authormanages to ingeniously transmit his own long experience of analyses with children and adults with the same conviction as that of the artist when his work succeeds in fully reflecting the truthfulessence of his vision.\"“This book contains the seeds of all Meltzer's further thinking. The Kleinian concepts of projective identification and the internal world are expanded by the Meltzerian view of the 'natural history' of an analysis, progressing in a sequence of phases that follows the development of primitive object relations. Once the analytic situation has been established, it is possible to sort out geographical and zonal confusions of the infant self in relation to internal objects, to work through depressive anxieties on the threshold of the depressive position and to integrate split off aspects of the self in the weaning process. The reprint of this book ensures it will continue to be a reference text in clinical, technical and psychopathology seminars, as well as a travel companion for those who practice psychoanalysis as a 'human activity'.””...an amazing book: clear in its structure, very deep and complex in what it transmits. The formula on one level appears simple: gathering the transference, putting geographical and zonal confusions in order, negotiating the threshold of the depressive position and weaning, applicable to both children and adults and seen in the context of both the individual session and the psychoanalytical process as a whole. However, once immersed in the detail of this book, one discovers in it a truly never-ending source of rich, stimulating suggestions.””...a seminal masterpiece. The evolution of the transference-countertransference becomes the crux of the analytic method, and the whole of Meltzer's ensuing work is a further enrichment of this fundamental concept.””It is clear without being dogmatic; a guide by the man who always encouraged us to think for ourselves.””In this keen and lively work Meltzer describes what he liked to call the 'natural history' of the analytical process, described in a language as close as possible to the concreteness of the internal world of the child. I now see this first book as the kicking-off point for his historic discovery of the 'aesthetic conflict' as formulated twenty years later in his impassioned workThe Apprehension of Beauty.'”", "related": ["B008X2L4B6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I began reading when I was four. I wrote my first story at five years old and my first poem at seven. Since then, I've written plays, tutorials, marketing brochures, software specifications, self-help books, press releases, a five-hundred page dissertation, and of course, erotica. I'm the author of four erotic novels and two short story collections. I also edited the ground breaking anthology SACRED EXCHANGE, which explores the spiritual aspects of BDSM relationships, and the massive collection CREAM: THE BEST OF THE EROTIC READERS AND WRITERS ASSOCIATION. My short stories have appeared in more than two dozen print collections edited by erotica luminaries such as M. Christian, Maxim Jakubowski, Mitzi Szereto, Rachel Kramer Bussel, and Alison Tyler. In my so-called spare time, I also review books and films for the Erotica Readers and Writers Association and Erotica Revealed, and feature as a Celebrity Author at Custom Erotica Source. My lifelong interests in sex and the written word became serenditipitously entwined about a decade ago when I read my first Black Lace book by Portia da Costa. Her work inspired me to take my fantasies out of the closet (and the private email files) and expose them to the world. The rest, as they say, is history (although granted, no more than a minor footnote!) I've always loved traveling; my husband seduced me in a Burmese restaurant by telling me tales of his foreign adventures. Since then I have visited every continent except Australia, although I still have a long travel wish list. Currently I live with him and our two exceptional felines in Southeast Asia, where I pursue an alternative career that is completely unrelated to my creative writing.", "related": [], "rank": 3141500, "title": "Quarantine", "author": "Lisabet Sarai", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When Owl and Goose raise the alarm, Mother Hen says “QUICK QUICK QUICK!” and her five chicks scurry inside the chicken hut while she goes “CLICK CLACK CLICK” out the door to have a good look around. Vibrant panels and sunny full-bleed pages render each animal’s body movements as they hop, swoop, cheep, and strut across the page. Dramatic full-page spreads show close-ups of the green-eyed fox with his vivid-orange head squeezed through the door, grinning and snapping his jaws wide in toothy anticipation. In a comical denouement, the clever chicks figure out a way to outsmart the fox. A satisfying head count at the end means all is well as the sixth bright-yellow chick cracks his way out of his egg.

My tutor who was also trying to get a children's book published said I'd get there before him. He was a great tutor.Now , having spent time working in children's homes and with disenfranchised and special needs children I love telling the stories which will inspire children to read. First with and adult's encouragement and eventually by themselves. I think children love dialogue, playful and expressive characters and vibrant colours. They also have an acute eye for details and when I worked in schools were the first to spot if I lost an earing despite my long hair. I have tried to incorporate all these factors in my books plus a positive caring attitude towards other people which most children share automatically but a few need reminding of now and then.Children are my worst critics but also my most devoted ones and I will continue to write books for their enjoyment, since their delight is the greatest motivation any writer can have.Yours Viv", "related": ["B003UHVVBC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I have been a frustrated gadfly, constantly annoyed at the continuous and ever growing intrusion of government in every area of life.Now, as a father, grandfather and great grandfather, I wanted to leave my perspective on the legacy of freedom in written form for my progeny. I remember holding my great grand daughter for the first time and\nthinking, you poor child; only months old and you are fifty thousand\ndollars in debt. It made me sick to contemplate it.If by some weird happenstance this book can serve a greater purpose, so be it. In the end, if we cannot change the course of our country, I wanted proof that my grandchildren can hold that the joyless bondage that has been imposed upon them by out of control government did not go unopposed by those who came before them.I have spent years reading thousands of books; from history, to biographies, philosophy, all so that I might have a deeper understanding of who I am, what I believe and why I believe it. It seemed to me that so many people seemed to function in a programmed mindset that was inimical to knowledge of self, truth, and ultimately, freedom. I include myself in that group. This book and  two additional volumes which I have begun are meant to explore what it means to be a Sovereign Being Under God. What are the thoughts, pitfalls, and actions that all of this implies?

Sherwin has been writing since she was too young to hold a pen. Her first stories were dictated to her mother who wrote them down to preserve for posterity. As time went by, Sherwin moved on to write amusing short stories. In middle school, she wanted to tackle her first epic novel. Things kept getting more involved and, though she still has all the notes from this novel, Sherwin put it aside to pursue other story ideas. In college, she started work on a manuscript she intended to finish. After marrying her high school and college sweetheart, her husband encouraged her to pursue her life-long dreams of becoming an author. She started writing an hour a day. After a year, she had written four manuscripts—three novels and one novella. The first manuscript became Night Bells, the first Tale from Niflheim. She plans on publishing another Tale from Niflheim in early 2013.", "related": ["B00BY85TA8"], "rank": 622892, "title": "Silent Shades (Tales from Niflheim Book 2) eBook", "author": "L.M.

Combined with the critical eye of his wife and a BA Hons in History and English, David's dedication leads him to his goal of inspiring readers through heartfelt stories and characters. Although David is inspired primarily by fantasy fiction, he also finds his muse in the form of anime, world cinema, history, and biographies. His own books, Fezariu's Epiphany and A World Apart, and the in-progress Ansel's Remorse and The Stars Beneath the Parapets combine aspects from worlds both old and new into compelling tales of a world not soon forgotten.

David Hailey shocks the folks of Canadian, Tex., by adding a disturbing figure to his church's life-sized, outdoor nativity scene: Amanda, his flirtatious 19-year-old wife, dressed as the Virgin Mary and dead of a head wound from a blunt instrument. Doing this in full view of the church's budget committee is incriminating enough--Amanda was alive and well earlier in the evening--but one churchgoer, Canadian DA Glen Williams, says that after the meeting he saw Hailey pick up a rock and head straight for the parsonage. Williams, as a witness, relinquishes prosecuting duties to Amarillo DA Cleetus \"Maximum\" Miller, while Hailey is championed by the brilliant, dapper defense attorney John Lloyd Branson and his volatile aide and significant other, Lydia Ann Fairchild. Hailey refuses to discuss his wife's death. As the murder trial progresses, Lydia is astonished to realize that \"the Panhandle's would-be Perry Mason\" seems to be bungling the defense. Meredith ( Murder by Reference ) effectively makes the courtroom a stage on which tragedy and farce play simultaneously. And if the irascible Lydia wears thin at times, there's always hope she'll grow up before her next appearance.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cheeky young Cinnabaran Lt. Cassian Daniels has quarreled with his powerful and merciless father, who has tossed him out and left him to his own slim devices. Spunky young librarian Adele Mundy is the sole survivor of her Cinnabar clan, which was wiped out in a conspiracy led by the elder Daniels. After some colorful initial posturing, Cassian and Adele pool their familial pride and anti-totalitarian views in Cassian's impromptu first command, a scratch crew trapped ashore in an Alliance coup. Together they outwit (Cassian's doing) and outshoot (Adele's forte) the bad guys. Updating dashing Horatio Hornblower tactics and vintage John Wayne heroics with crisply delineated space-age equipment, a convincing extraterrestrial setting and formidably battle-hardened female NCOs, Drake gives a familiar plot a full measure of appealing derring-do. This surely shouldn't, and probably won't, be Cassian and Adele's last adventure together.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After Sophie recovers from her ordeal, she heads to Paris, followed by Jourdan. About a month later in Paris, Martin Lorson, a professional stand-in for a variety of workers in need of a break, is serving one night as a watchman at the La Villette meat market, where, to his horror, he witnesses a man strangle a masked woman. The crime attracts the interest of bookseller and sleuth Legris, who's tantalized by the one clue left behind by the killer: a medallion with an engraving of a unicorn.

His church elders saw the potential in this young man, so they sponsored him with a full scholarship to Harding University's School of Biblical Studies, where he excelled and graduated in 1985. Since that time, he has preached for numerous churches. David has always had a love for the lost and has been very active with missions work in the U.S. and abroad. He believes in first-century Christianity and takes a strong undenominational stance. His passion and love for the Lord has led him to this latest work, The Story, An Interwoven Gospel. He has an unquenchable desire for the Word of God and wants to get it into as many hands as possible.

While many stereotypes are false,this one is often true. It was true for my first book, a self-improvement book on wisdom and common sense, and it's true for this book.I was born in 1954 and there was little information and no support for LGB people. I'm bisexual and knew it at age 17, but society forced me to stay hidden. I'm glad it's better with each passing year.Writing this book helped me release long-held concerns, fears, and pressures, but I hope it encourages a few readers (oh heck, I hope it encourages thousands) to know we came from the factory the way we are: straight, gay, bi, lesbian, etc. When a straight person asks me when I decided to be bisexual, I ask that person when he/she decided to be straight. The usual response is 'I've always been that way.'I've had up to 20 published books, but my main publisher closed due to illness and I was set adrift along with many others. I'm grateful to Grants Art Publishing for taking me on. It is a small company; the publisher and I welcome feedback from readers, including what you didn't like about stories. It's wonderful to have readers say what stories are desired, or kinks, etc. Feel free; make your comments under reviews.", "related": ["B00IZR0FI2"], "rank": 2576331, "title": "Long, Deep and Hard!

He joined the British Army as an Infantry Junior Leader in 1972 at the tender age of 15, serving in the Coldstream Guards on ceremonial duties at the Royal Palaces, flying the flag in Africa, and on operations in both Ulster and on the UK mainland. In 1981 Andy swapped his green suit for a blue one with the Metropolitan Police. With volunteer reservist service in both the Wessex Regiment and 253 Provost Company, Royal Military Police (V) he spent twenty four years in front line policing, both in uniform and plain clothes. The final six years as a police officer were served in a London inner city borough and wearing two hats, those of an operation planner, and liaison officer with the television and film industry. His first literary work to be published was that of a poem about life as a soldier in Ulster, sold with all rights to a now defunct writers monthly in Dublin for the princely sum of £11 (less the price of the stamp on the envelope that the cheque arrived in.) The 'Armageddon's Song' trilogy began as a mental exercise to pass the mornings whilst engaged on a surveillance operation on a drug dealer who never got out of bed until the mid afternoon. On retirement he emigrated with his wife to the Philippines.", "related": ["B00LDCER4E"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 42.0}

Barton is the author of several fast-paced mystery and thriller series, featuring lively characters and lots of action. \"Miz Scarlet\" (Scarlet Wilson Mystery series) is a teacher-turned-innkeeper, who throws herself into danger with a feisty determination to make things right, relying on cohorts like \"Captain Peacock\" and \"Colonel Grey Poupon\" to help her solve the clues. Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans. It's the perfect human storm.\"", "related": ["B00JERUXHK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All rights reserved.Things had changed dramatically since the mansion. I had softened. I could be easily pleased by one man now, and I largely allowed him to direct our sex, because that was what he liked. He had certain restrictions when it came to his body that stemmed from his childhood abusers. He couldn't stand it when I approached him from behind. He'd been struck from this direction during his punishments; the coward hadn't wanted Cameron to look him in the face.  He hadn't yet overcome his sense of the unknown, and felt that what was happening was beyond his control. So I made sure he heard me when I entered a room. And I was extremely careful about where I placed my hands and lips; I didn't want those to trigger anything, either. I was still learning his other quirks, and I was allowing him to lead. While Cee may have permitted herself to be dominated, letting someone else take the reins during sex was new for Charlie. And instead of creating art as my heart and emotions called me to, I was creating pieces of art for specific clients, tailored to their tastes and not mine.  I was taking orders directly from them. Teachers dictated my assignments, creditors dipped into my finances. Lilly's evil voice appeared in my head whenever it wanted to.It didn't feel like I dominated anything in my life anymore.But the desire for that was still present. It pulsed, throbbed, thrashed because it wasn't getting attention.I was burying it in the world that Cameron was creating for me.But Chet had reminded me of what I missed. He'd shown me a glimpse of what a part of me wanted back, what it felt I truly was and what it yearned to be again. I had done everything I could to curb Cee, to distance myself from the mansion, and to draw myself closer to Cameron.What if I couldn't any longer?What if I needed a place where she could come alive?What if Cee was really the soul of me, and Charlie was just another mask I wore?", "related": ["B00L82ZVYE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 38, "rating_average": 4.7105, "rating_total": 179.0}

It is mainly about the years I owned Starfish Insurance in Gulf Shores, Alabama, and how a few crooked people can decimate people's lives.

From New Orleans, Louisiana, Jesse is anointed by God with a unique preaching ministry that melts even the hardest heart with hilarious illustrations and strong biblical preaching. Having been in full-time evangelistic ministry since 1978, Jesse's primary goal is to spread the Gospel. He has become a popular guest speaker at church meetings, conventions, seminars, Bible colleges and Christian television programs across America. His anointed sermons point sinners to Calvary and motivate Christians to exercise their authority over the devil by realizing their position in Christ. Jesse believes that Christianity is not just something you talk about on Sunday; it is a day-to-day fellowship with the Lord Jesus. It is this close fellowship with Jesus that makes the impossible suddenly possible. Today, Jesse's entire life is devoted to reaching the lost as well as strengthening the Christian in their daily walk with Christ. Jesse's weekly thirty-minute television program has touched millions of lives through secular and Christian television with the Gospel of Jesus. His program can be seen weekly on Trinity Broadcasting Network and other stations worldwide. Through anointed biblical preaching, Jesse is bringing God's message of hope to our generation. A message that cuts through all denominational barriers, transcends human hypocrisy and frailty, and reaches the heart of mankind.", "related": ["B00EUQTTLG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Books are typically the first exposure to learning and art that children get which urges one to make the very best books possible. He understands how important books were to his childhood. With them, he feels as if transported to some parallel universe, a world of grace and wonder.   Lionel said, “The boys want more than just picture books they also want to learn things they can tell their friends about.  Jack in particular loves learning new things.  He was sick of story books and wanted something a bit more challenging”. As the author of a few heavy historical novels he started writing children’s books for the boys not long after  Will was born.  Being boys they wanted adventure and scary dragons.  But after  Jack and  Thomas arrived Jack wanted to read ‘real’ books about ‘real’ things, not pretend stuff.  Not being able to find suitable books written to the capacity of a 4 or 5 year old, he started making little flip books on his computer and using pictures from magazines and photographs in his collection.   He sent one of these books to his publisher who thought this a great idea and has since commissioned a series of books for this age group.  With the help of the boys he is currently working on several picture books about our land and sea animals.   Lionel lives with his family, Billy the bitser, cats Ghost and Patch and assorted lizards and insects in Ho-Ho-Kus, a suburb of New York (Northern New Jersey-Long Island).", "related": ["B00A6J6DVA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 18, "rating_average": 4.7778, "rating_total": 86.0}

Mix those two qualities together, add a fascinating career as a caring and gentle doctor, and what you get are tales of the unexpected, told with humour and wisdom, around the joys and headaches that women go through in their reproductive lives.' Marcus Setchell, CVO, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Surgeon-Gynaecologist to HM The Queen, 1990 - 2014  'An extraordinary selection of poignant stories collected over forty years of frontline experience by a man whose admiration and empathy for women and their ability to cope with life, love and loss during pregnancy and childbirth, shines through. The complex medical and human dilemmas in these moving stories are explained with warmth and humour, making them easily understandable and accessible. You will be inspired by this book.' Lesley Regan, author of Your Pregnancy Week by Week  'This is the honest and engaging account of the life's work of a kind, thinking and skilled obstetrician. Jim Dornan is a doctor who has given so much to women and their families, whilst in return, he has taken time  -  as all of us engaged in childbirth must  -  to learn much from them.' Dame Lorna Muirhead, past President of the Royal College of Midwives  'This is a beautiful book  -  heartwarming, heartbreaking and bursting with humanity and tenderness. The women in this book are real women like you or me but their stories inspire us and remind that, however universal or fundamental, the birth of a baby is extraordinary. Wit, wisdom and a great deal of compassion allied with years of obstetric practice have allowed us this wonderful perspective on childbirth today.'  Dr Rhona Mahony, Master of the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin   'Jim Dornan's working life has been dedicated to ensuring that the arrival of a new baby is the joy it should be, and his commitment as one of our country's leading obstetricians has been to avoid the tragedy of maternal death once so commonplace. His real-life stories from the delivery room frontline are moving and inspiring, and show just what a gift each healthy baby  -  and mum  -  is.'

Fleeing an unhappy love affair and unforgiving parents, Anna Jenson arrives in California to begin her new job as a teacher. As it happens, sp ok/pk Nicolas Gaspard, son of an Indian woman and a white man, needs a schoolteacher and kidnaps Anna. Nicolas is used to swiping people: known as \"the Marauder,\" he rescues Indian children from local whites who use them as slaves, and he has created a secret haven for his wards. Once Anna overcomes her annoyance at being abducted and sees how good Nicolas is with the children, she becomes not only a willing contributor to the community but Nicolas's lover (though since Nicolas sometimes acts like an insensitive jerk, this takes a little longer). Then illness sweeps through the small band, and when Nicolas returns Anna to the white community, she is scorned for her involvement with the Indians and finds herself under the roof of the man most determined to track down and destroy the Marauder--his own half brother.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00ERBW21S"], "rank": 1126857, "title": "Secrets of a Midnight Moon: The Moon Trilogy - Book One", "author": "Jane Bonander", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ken is a people person and has always loved to talk. His kindergarten teacher affectionately told his mother, “Someone has listened to Ken a lot.” His enthusiastic conversational skills have been encouraged and honed by many years of church socials and by a long line of surrogate church grandmas, not to mention his aunts, parents and grandparents.  His penchant for the verbose is paled only by his vivid imagination which runs virtually nonstop. He is always working with new ideas and looking for ways to improve. When preparing to demolish a wall or rearrange a room in their home, he playfully states to his wife, “I always have to have a project.”  Ken has realized his wordiness and creativity can be an asset when channeled into writing. He has found great satisfaction in the development of his characters and their story lines and enjoys the unfettered creativity afforded by pen and paper (i.e. computer and word processing program).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Gifted with languages, Hall sought a career in Foreign Service in 1930s Europe, but a physical handicap (she had one wooden leg), her gender and her outspoken political views stymied her diplomatic ambitions. She escaped to London shortly after Germany's 1940 invasion of France and came to the attention of a secret British intelligence group that trained her in non-traditional sabotage techniques, cryptology and radio communication. As a newly minted secret agent, she returned to France, where she passed on information about German positions, transported downed Allied pilots and escaped prisoners to safety, oversaw the retrieval of supply drops and organized resistance fighters. Hall's espionage career ended with the allied victory and the dawn of the cold war, for which the CIA wanted a different breed of agent. Though commendable for its portrayal of Hall's unflagging courage and energy in dangerous and desperate conditions, the story is told in bland prose that fails to live up to the exceptional times it chronicles.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
