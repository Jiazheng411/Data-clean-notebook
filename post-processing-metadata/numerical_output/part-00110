Eastern religion bookshelves these days are crowded with Zen primers and collections of sermons by eminent monks or nuns, but Sheng-yen's work stands out, bridging the two genres in a way that has been much needed. Buddhist sermons by Asian masters, when transplanted to American soil, can be misinterpreted by an audience lacking the cultural context for deeper understanding, leading to disillusionment with the institutional practice of Chan/Zen Buddhism. Sheng-yen, having taught in America for many years, is well aware of this and places Chan meditation in the larger Buddhist picture, showing its basis in history and morality. He explains the relationship between actual practice and the ideals expressed in sermons and in the paradoxical stories of early masters in such a way that a beginning student of Chan/Zen can then read the sermons with a deeper understanding of their relevance to his or her life. Aided by a masterful introduction by well-known scholar Dan Stevenson, this work brings introductory books on Chan/Zen to a new level of sophistication, accuracy and relevance to both the more advanced and the novice American practitioner.

Colby, the lawyer for Nancy Cruzan, whose 1988 case was one of the first to raise such questions, writes elegantly about these issues. He reminds us that the right to die is a new subject because the technology that allows us to keep patients alive is recent. Cardiac defibrillators, as he points out, were first used to resuscitate patients in 1959. The term \"persistent vegetative state\" was defined only in 1972, as a result of the Cruzan case. Colby discusses briefly the major issues in three high-profile right-to-die cases—Cruzan, Schiavo and the first, that of Karen Ann Quinlan in 1976—to highlight the difficult medical and legal questions surrounding the end of life, including the advantages and disadvantages of a living will, appointing a legal guardian and \"do not resuscitate\" orders. He takes no ethical position regarding the removal of feeding tubes or respirators but urges us to talk to our families about our wishes in this regard. Although many other books have covered these topics, few possess Colby's engaging style and judicious insights.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this poetic, heartrending memoir, UK journalist and first time author Wyn relates seven years of personal struggle and small victories trying to raise and heal a son with severe cerebral palsy. Diagnosed in his first year with the most extreme form of the disability, Joe was born blind, without any hope of ever walking or communicating: \"He won't even know you,\" the neurologist tells them. Joe's seemingly hopeless condition quickly takes over Wyn's world: \"It is like death.\" Desperate for a cure (\"Impossible,\" her doctor says), Wyn pursues every possible therapy-from faith healers and prayer to physical patterning and swimming-losing both her marriage and career as she falls deeper into Joe's world. Along the way she discovers the fate of other babies with cerebral palsy, given up to foster care or institutionalized as wards of the state by parents unable to cope. This difficult-to-face story is carried along effortlessly by Wyn's elegant, fractured prose and hard-won moments of triumph: \"Today,/ for the very first time,/ I saw the way he seemed to prefer/ to lift his face to the wind.\" Any parent is sure to be enthralled, encouraged, and deeply touched.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I highly recommend this story.\"--Matthew, Rainbow Reviews\"4 Angels!...Readers who love a good horror story are going to find Whiskey Tango Foxtrot by Selah March to be a custom fit. This is a spine-chilling novella that puts its characters through a wringer and doesn't let up on them for the duration of the story...As the story progresses, the tension mounts to almost the point of combustion. Ms. March has portrayed evil very well, and this reader stayed glued to the story in horrified fascination until the very end. Well done!\"--Whitney, Fallen Angel Reviews\"4 Blue Ribbons!...Selah March has a well-written story that is sensual, exciting and chilling all at the same time. There were times when I was truly scared...The haunted house takes on a life of its own. The sexual chemistry between Leo and Tom is exciting and very hot and I also enjoyed following the development of their relationship as they grow closer. This story had me on the edge of my seat until the end.\"--Christina, Romance Junkies", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tetlow, SJ, reveals how the ordinary person in modern times can embrace and live the extraordinary theology of St. Ignatius of Loyola and the Jesuits. In the process, Tetlow explains, the individual deepens and enriches his or her relationship with God.Written in a warm and wise fashion, this book contains forty concise meditations exploring what Ignatian spirituality is and isn’t; what it means to live by it; Ignatius’s legacy to all who practice the spirituality; and its important concepts and experiences, most notably the Spiritual Exercises. This “field guide” to living Ignatian spirituality is an ideal resource to be used before or during a retreat with the Exercises, but it is also designed for the layperson who is curious about the “Jesuit mystique.”Tetlow, who worldwide has overseen the efforts of more than two hundred Jesuit retreat houses and centers for spirituality, is uniquely equipped to describe how Ignatian spirituality is being interpreted and lived around the globe today—and how it helps us all to seek and find the active God at work in our lives.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book opens with an overview of the post-Civil War treatment of people who violated societal norms of gender or sexuality. In this section, Eskridge emphasizes the dubious nature of statements claiming that the equality for sexual minorities would endanger majority values. Part 2 stresses why the legal perpetuation of \"apartheid of the closet\" demands re-evaluation. A prominent goal of the author's work is to develop a political and legal response to the judiciary's rejection of full rights of privacy, equality, and free speech under constitutional guidelines. Eskridge closes by vehemently arguing for the recognition of gays in families, employment, and religion. Copious appendixes detailing state and municipal regulations, statistics, and notes, bolster the research value of this volume. Highly recommended.AMichael A.

Fergus, a longtime military operative with a checkered past, and Danny, his 18-year-old grandson, who has a penchant for allowing emotion to cause him to deviate from standard operating procedure, are recruited to locate the melt labs and destroy them. This novel, the final one in the series, moves quickly, winding through Danny's training, bouncing disjointedly between various viewpoints to cover all angles of the operation. Set in the United Kingdom, the story is loaded with military acronyms. Though there is a glossary, the narrative employs far more terms than are included, and the frequent flipping back and forth is awkward. What the tale lacks in literary merit, it makes up for in raw action, espionage, and violence; blood spraying from victims' heads as they are \"double tapped\" by the hero and trucks exploding in a ball of fire are par for the course.

Most are defined chiefly by their relation to Luke: the sympathetic coach; the \"win at all costs\" coach; his loyal friends and family. Fehler's straightforward story may appeal to die-hard sports fans, but Scott Johnson'sSafe at Second(Philomel, 1999) and Carl Deuker'sHigh Heat(Houghton, 2003), two novels that also deal with sports accidents and their aftermath, offer both compelling story lines and memorable characters.—Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CACopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her characterizations bring an edgy realism to Morrissey's rugged cast. When Sally finds her perfect man, Hood is all fuzzy coquettishness, and when he turns out to be not so perfect, her voice drips with disillusionment. Hood's expressive interpretation adds substance to Morrissey's romantic adventure.

It is a true reflection of the heart of a loving wife and mother, a genuine keeper of the home.

They are quite hospitable folks too!  Mental, spiritual, and physical health reign paramount in her book. Not only is it full of wonderful and nutritious recipes, but explanations of how and why certain techniques and ingredients are used, lists for stocking the pantry, cooking tips, nutrition, and stories are included. Gardening and homemade soap are also discussed. Recipes for Life and The Art of Life chapters are probably the most important in the book. She even includes simple and interesting ideas for every month of the year. Words to songs that the Swans sing about family life are interwoven with the text.  I love the spirit in which Hearth and Home is written; it is joyful and inspiring, simple and kind. May you be blessed as you read it, use it, and 'snuggle in' with it.  Tina Farewell", "related": ["B00ICMYRES"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the first of many coincidences, Zaliukas's widow, Regine, whose decampment to France might have led the dead man to kill himself, places Skinner's daughter, Alexis, a newly made partner in her law firm, in charge of Zaliukas's companies, which include a string of massage parlors. Meanwhile, professional thieves are targeting golf courses.

Sananda signing in for this\nportion.Soothsayers of the past have long proclaimed the glory of\nthe coming of the Lord, have they not? Well then, take this for example: The\nvery cloud covering surrounding your planet's sphere has been made up of some\nrather toxic gases. If this comes as much a surprise to you as it does to many\nwho read this, then let me remind you that the day the Earth was formed a\ncritical stage was planned to remove the very firmament from its skies. The\nremoval of this firmament subjected the planet's escape from carbon monoxide\ndrifts of tetonious gases into the atmosphere which then reduced greatly the\nprotective covering surrounding the planet's surface. And why am I telling you this? Simply because\nthe acclaiment, that \"my father's ships,\" which will come in a covering of\nglory from within the \"heavens,\" ought not to have been seen if the firmament\nwalls had remained intact!Now to close on this subject, for a short period of time\nwill place us within a sort of \"space\" or \"sanctuary\" of exactly who is telling\nthe truth of these matters and who is not!Undistinguished truth form requires a semblance of\nequitable charge toward the furnishing design of mediocre scrutiny. In other\nwords here, little ones, it was I, even before my \"father,\" so to speak, who\nguided the fleet of starships into your atmosphere for full displayal before\nthe world! Have you ever seen so many\nlights of such a brilliant arcade? Naught in the least, I would surmise! Now,\nlook ye now toward the conduct of the \"Last Days,\" and what do you expect to\nfind? Will gravitation fill its grip with folly and detonate the each one of\nyou up into the cloud covered sky - and one at a time, for that matter? Or will\nyou wait for that time where the naked eye will behold all \"MY GLORY\" - for the\nskies will be filled with such luxury as has been ne'er contemplated for\ncenturies! Didyourforefathers see\nthis glory? Indeed! And remember poor Moses traipsing up that steep\nmountainside? Did he remember the effect speaking to the Source or Brotherhood\nhad uponhisconsciousness? Indeed!\nNot a day he would forget in a long time! Let me now inform ye all as to how it\nwill be forecast in the \"Last Days\" of man, then:A pictorial form will you see, as craft dart to and fro\nthroughout the heavenly palaces - a place of each one of ye, if you so desire.\nIndeed, it will be a gift offered in my presence, which few will care to\nreceive. Did you honestly think I would evaporate you, dear ones, into cloud\nformation and haul you up into God knows where, with as little as a\nproclamation? So \"the heavens reign their trumpets with a loud blast!\" I see.\nSo is this where you have misunderstood yet again my words of the past? \"The\nheavens declare all the fragrance of God himself,\" does it not, in the very\nplacement of ships to the planets themselves?Well, then, hear me once again, when I say:\"I will naught come for the one of ye\nwithout the other one knowing my name, for all of the Earth will receive the\nsame display throughout the heavens! For every eye will proclaim to the brain,\nthat the 'coming of the Lord' is here!\"There are many of you this day, who will open up his or\nher minds into a grand knowing of that of which I now speak. You have heard it\nbefore those eons ago and yet you will hear it once again, for not one of my\npeople will I leave unattended! All that glitters is surely not gold, little\nones, but then gold has hardly taken the place of the finest the world has to\noffer, namely, the scribing from the pens of my workers! Indeed, I say unto you\nones for the fourth or fifth time this year, that, which I spoke centuries ago:\nNOT ONE PERSON FROM THAT GENERATION WILL PASS AWAY BEFORE THEY HAVE SEEN THE\nGLORY OF THE LORD COME IN THE CLOUDS!Remember my words? How could you! You were born notthatlong ago..! Think again! And how could the any of ye\ndevise plans which outlay the Lord's? Are you gods then? But you say you are\nnot! Well, in any case, until you make up your minds as to justwhoyou are, andwhatyou know, let us continue this epic, for the foreclosing of\nall truth will be prominently displayed like cattle over the countryside. Soon\nyou will make heads or tails out of it. And for your sakes, we hope that will\nbe soon. SANANDA SPEAKS You, and you alone, dear ones, must learn to credit\nyourselves with the speech program of the newest of your age to date. In other\nwords, learn the radical equipping of oneself to one's nameplate of disguise,\nfor in effect the each of ye do wear somewhat of a disguise, do you not? You\nindeed do! Each incarnation of bodily cases indulge and house your beingness of\nintricate bright form- instituting a barrier from harm toward the glowing\nessence of your eternal being. So rather than smother the flame of who you\nappear to be, join in with the countless nations, who in all their eras of\nthinking have made it to the \"finish line\" to graciously implore the each of ye\ninto the realization that you have form and that form is God's.YE ARE ALL GODS, and I have unwittingly\ntold of ye this truthe many of the times before, but did you ever understand my\nwords?Apparently many of ye did not! Nevertheless, more intricate thoughts\nof study are now upon you, and lest you forget one more time of the pleasure of\nbeing just you, think upon this last thought for the day:YOU HAVE ALL BEEN\nFORMED OUT OF THE CREATOR'S OWN LIFEBLOOD - OF ALL HE/SHE IS, SO ARE YOU!\nCONDEMN YOURSELF TO FALSEHOOD AND YOU CONDEMN THE GOD CREATOR FROM WHENCE YE\nDID COME! MANUFACTURE SELF-DOUBT AS TO YOUR ROYALTY AND YOUDOUBT ALSO THE ONE\nCREATOR WHO DOTH RESIDE WITHIN HIS/HER OWN CREATION. YOU INTRICATELY ARE A PART\nOF THAT MANIFESTED CREATION, SO ART YOU NO BETTER THAN THE FISH IN THE SEA? ARE\nYOU IN FACT OF THE POSSESSING OF THE LIBERTIES CREATED THROUGH THE PROCESS OF\nLOVE TOWARD ALL LIVING THINGS AS THOUGHT OF ANDBROUGHT DOWN INTO MANIFESTED BEING THROUGH THE THOUGHT FORMS OF THE\nCREATOR? INDEED!YOU MUST NOW DECIDE\nFOR YOURSELVES WHICH MEMORANDUM OF CONTEXT YOU WILL LIBERALIZE YOURSELF WITHIN,\nWHICH DILEMMA INDEED WILL BE YOUR HELPMEET BACK TO THE SURFACE OF A MORE\nNON-DESTRUCTIVE SOUL WRACKING EXPERIENCE! ONLY YOU, DEAR CHELAS, HAVE THE\nABILITY TO DETERMINE FOR YOURSELVES, WHICH SELECTIVE PATH YOU WILL TAKE TO MEET\nTHE FINISH LINE! I GIVE TO YOU MY GRACIOUS UNDIVIDED ATTENTION UNTIL THE END OF\nTHIS GLORIOUS AGE WHEREUPON WE WILL MEET AGAIN IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER. ADIEU. Scribe, please sign off this book and retain all conscious\nendeavours, for I will shortly be of the grateful spirit to proceed liberally\nwith a third and fourth.

Better watch it with the current crop of same, though, since the coroner marks Simone's arrival by announcing that crabby next-door neighbor Hannah Mixon was helped to the grave by a hearty dose of arsenic. When he finds out that Hannah's left the lion's share of her piddling estate--250 acres' worth--to Candi Covington (though she's never exchanged a word with Mama), Hannah's son Nat storms over to accuse Mama of stealing his inheritance. You'd think the police would get suspicious of Mama, especially after Nat also gets himself a bellyful of arsenic. But they don't; instead, Mama gets poisoned, too. There'll be still more carnage in this low- pressure whodunit--every new suspect who acts suspicious, it seems, gets vindicated by death--before Mama, whose detective work consists of debriefing her gossipy old friends in greater and greater detail about the Mixon family tree, finally unmasks the killer. (Don't blink or you'll miss this nefarious culprit.) Guileless Mama, a veteran of two paperback mysteries, doesn't seem quite ready for hardcover--or prime time. --Copyright ©1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The subject is well chosen and provocatively explored.\"--New Yorker\"The book is the outcome of a remarkable archival discovery, of the kind of which every historian dreams. . . . The nature of her ambition is revealed by her title,The Inner Life of Empires. She wants to show us how the opening of the world to a family like the Johnstones affected their thoughts, sentiments, and behavior, and is anxious to recapture the day-to-day responses of people who had no idea, any more than we ourselves have, of how the story in which they found themselves caught up would end. Would the new republic of the United States survive? Nobody knew for certain. The range of sources she has consulted, the extraordinary wealth of detail she has unearthed about even the most obscure individuals, and the quite unexpected connections between them that she has uncovered fully support her claim. It is wonderfully appropriate that a book that gives us so many new and surprising insights into the new 'information society' of the eighteenth century should itself depend so heavily on new information technology, drawing, as Rothschild puts it, on 'a world of searchable databases and digitized archive catalogues.' In doing so, it presents what I suspect is a foretaste of a kind of history that will become increasingly common in the years to come, even if, as I fear, not all its practitioners will bring to it the historical imagination and sensitivity of Emma Rothschild.\"--New York Review of Books\"Ms. Rothschild'sThe Inner Life of Empiresoffers us a fascinating tour of Scottish society during the age of empire, and it does so from a unique perspective. Ms. Rothschild has written a \"micro-history,\" a mode of scholarship that attempts to elucidate large historical themes by closely narrating the small history of a particular individual. Her micro-history is not about an individual but a family. The book is unusually well-researched and wide-ranging. . . . Ms. Rothschild has corralled this voluminous and scattered archival record with diligence and skill. She presents the Johnstones' family history as a portrait of their age. Books of this kind work by accumulating telling detail and so defy summary. Still, several themes emerge. Ms. Rothschild beautifully reveals, for instance, how fundamentally the imperial and military exploits of states can remake the imaginative and aspirational worlds of their subjects. The Johnstones could plan a career in the Caribbean, or gossip about the politics of the Mughal court in Delhi, in a manner that would have staggered their near forebears.The Inner Life of Empiresreminds us that the experience of globalism long predates the age of the Internet. . . . More admirable still is Ms. Rothschild's meticulous and elegant account of the family. She offers us a captivating glimpse of what it must have been like to live in, profit from and command the British Empire during its heyday.\"--Jeffrey Collins,Wall Street Journal\"This original and remarkable book . . . is the story of the Johnstones, 11 Scottish siblings whose lives spanned the entire 18th-century British Empire--from Britain to Africa and the Americas. By extraordinary perseverance, Rothschild (a Harvard historian) has excavated the tiniest tidbits about them from a vast array of repositories and collections, and used these shards of evidence to broaden and deepen our understanding of the Enlightenment, commerce, empires, revolutions, nation states, sentiments, family relations, and slavery. Her tale often holds the mysteries of a fictional account, especially about a key slave whose life after shipment to the American colonies is lost in the mists of time. . . . While this is a scholarly work and the very model of the contemporary historian's craft, it's also deeply illuminating, humane, at times moving, and altogether captivating.\"--Publishers Weekly\"[An] elegantly crafted narrative. . . .The Inner Life of Empires. . . is a tour-de-force of archival sleuthing. It is also a triumph of historical ventriloquism. Speaking through the Johnstones, Rothschild delivers a wise, original reflection on the shifting boundaries between home and abroad, private and public, at the dawn of the modern age.\"--Maya Jasanoff,New Republic\"Emma Rothschild is an historian of the mind, of characteristic ways of thinking and feeling. She aims to blindfold hindsight and to recover not just external events but the way people perceived them at the time. The difficulty is evidence. Most people leave no trace. Even the eminent, she says, show little sign of the inner consequences of outward affairs. As if in answer, her absorbing new book, \"The Inner Life of Empires\", overflows with evidence--so finely detailed and from such scattered sources as to be scarcely imaginable before the development of digitized, searchable catalogues and archives.\"--The Economist\"This is a meticulous study, based on an immense amount of research, including a large cache of family correspondence, court records and much more. . . . There is much to admire about this book. It skillfully links the \"microhistory\" of the Johnson siblings with the \"macrohistory\" of Britain and its empire, giving us an intimate glimpse into the way one family pursued the material opportunities and confronted the moral challenges that arose with Britain's late-18th-century advance around the globe.\"--Dane Kennedy,Washington Independent Review of Books\"Here Emma Rothschild offers a truly transnational family history set in an age of turbulence, war and imperial growth; a moment in time where dramas were many. Rothschild's story of Empire, however, comes with a new spin, offering as it does a micro-historical account of one family's interconnections with the empires, politics and ideologies of the age. Drawing on many intensively mined sources from an array of archives, including a rich collection of family letters, she furnishes a richly detailed, highly readable account of the Johnstones, four sisters and seven brothers born into middling circumstances in Dumfries in the 1720s and 1730s. . . . The strength of this book lies in its focus on the family as a collective, for it is here that we see how Empire and individuals came together.\"--Donald MacRaild,Times Higher Education\"This is . . . a brave and able book.\"--Gillian Tindall,Literary Review(UK)\"Emma Rothschild's magnificently researched and lucidly written book reveals the many connections and layers of empire without in any way undermining the less edifying aspects of empire.\"--Rudrangshu Mukherjee,The Telegraph(Calcutta, India)\"[A] wealth of insight into early capitalism and . . . the moral foundations of the global economy.\"--Diane C.,Enlightened Economist\"Rothschild presents a fascinating combination of micro- and macro-history that sheds light on 18th century empires throughout the world. She does so by relying upon primary source documents of one family, the Johnstones, a relatively nonprosperous family of the Scottish country gentry. . . . [T]he approach provides a window on both personal and worldwide history that would be impossible otherwise.\"--Choice\"There is much wisdom and compassion in this gracefully written book.\"--Keith M. Baker,Law and History Review\"Rothschild is an accomplished scholar and a fluent writer. And her subject--teasing a broad study from a history of a single family--is both cleverly conceived and persuasively-argued. It is a tribute to indefatigable research, and it reflects the author's intellectual excitement about what she has unearthed.\"--James Walvin,Figurehead Historian\"[T]his work is an apt corrective to overly simplistic views of what eighteenth-century imperial Britons believed and felt.\"--Robert A. McLain,Historian\"The micro-history of the Johnstones . . . is a fascinating and informative account. . . . [S]ome of the best pages of this book illuminate the connections between principles, personal interests, and ideas in the political thought and in the politics of members of this family. Rothschild's sensitivity to these conflicts and tensions is admirable.\"--K. Steven Vincent,European Legacy\"The Inner Life of Empiresis an excellent micro-history of one family's globe-spanning existence. . . . Rothschild illuminates a tumultuous period that created the modern economy, the British Empire, and the philosophical Enlightenment and will be an indispensible tool for contextualizing discussions of present-day globalization.\"--World Book Industry", "related": ["B006J9DFVC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

To chronicle the adventures with her children, Julia turned her classroom website into a personal blog which began with a baby announcement and continued as daily postings for nearly four years. Life by all appearances was grand. Within one year of Lehman Brothers' collapse, the recession touched her personally when three family members found themselves suddenly and unexpectedly unemployed when entire departments were laid off in company downsizing. They and other friends struggled to find employment, and small retail shops and restaurants went out of business. In 2009, Julia launched a new mommy blog that expanded readership beyond just family and friends. The mission was two-fold mission. Help Austin area families find local forms of entertainment. Help area businesses in bringing families to them. The idea was to keep Austin vital by encouraging others to eat local, play local. Julia took what she understood most, parenting her children in Austin and blogging, and turned that into the mommy blog Little Austinite.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

By her high school years, she had amassed a portfolio of illustrations, poetry, and short stories. Jada's passion for words and images led to the publishing of her first chapter book for young readers ~ Touched By An Angel. Released in 2008, Touched By An Angel received much acclaim and led to the young author's first literary award; The Aida Ford Scholar award. The honor is presented by the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World at their annual conference to recognize authors in the field of Christian Education. At 16, Jada was the youngest author (to date) to ever receive the award. Jada's inspiration for the Touched By An Angel series came from her spirited involvement at Greater Morning Star Apostolic Ministries in Upper Marlboro, MD under the leadership of Bishop Charles E. Johnson. Jada is a faithful member in the Youth Choir, Sunday school, and several other youth activities. She is currently a student at George Washington University where she is double majoring in Education and Creative Writing.

With its eye-caching, outlandish and utterly unique front cover that cannot fail to attract any reader's eye, to the brilliant blurb and storyline this is a book that i am waiting in excitemnt & anticipation to read.This novel was completely gripping, intense and full of suspense that left you wondering. Anyone who is facinated by crime and the workings of criminal minds against the law would certainly without a doubt be captivated by this tale; this tale with a very origional and unusual twist. Gore and bloodthirsty this book took me right to the heart of other works such as those by Joe Abercrombie or Sam Sykes and also many great crime writers as well (Sam Bourne, Ewart Hutton and Stuart Macbride), who's characters are no less wanting for the taste of human flesh. Creepy, shocking and full of twists and turns i thoroughly enjoyed every single moment of this tale from the begining to the very end, that was dark and creepily captivating. A really great read and another novel that will definately be going to the top of my bookshelf, and i intend to read more of Lee Cushing's work in the future.

Curt Smith has produced a compelling anecdotal history of the national pastime through the lens of its announcers.

Who knew that Fenway Park’s rough-and-ready fans would serenade Oklahoma-born Joe Simpson with the title song from the Broadway musical that bears his home state’s name? Curt Smith did, and now you will, too.”—Phil Mushnick,New York Post\"Curt Smith has authored classic books likeVoices of the Game, forged ESPN TV and Smithsonian Institution programs, and written more speeches than anyone for President George H. W. Bush. His latest work includes more Voices than in any sports book, ever. Amazing.”—Bruce DuMont, president, National Radio Hall of Fame\"We’ve listened to announcers as they’ve brought baseball to life on the air. Now we get to revel in the stories we’ve often never heard them tell—until now. Curt Smith has knocked it out of the park again.\"—Christine Brennan,USA Today\"Baseball is a game of stories. This book includes hundreds of baseball tales from dozens of well-known broadcasters. Your favorite players are all in here. This book will delight all those who cherish our game. You will laugh, smile, grimace, and even groan. But you will be sad only when it ends.\"—Fay Vincent, former Major League Baseball commissioner\"Curt Smith has gone deep again—over the wall into the game’s broadcasting essence—telling stories. With a ball in play as little as eight minutes in a three-hour game, filling dead spots with anecdotes is essential. With our nomadic lifestyle, these terrific stories involve happenings on and off the field.\"—Joe Castiglione, Boston Red Sox radio announcer\"The author’s newest work is a pure, unadulterated pleasure: an adult gift for that kid in so many of us who grew up glued to the words that wafted from baseball’s broadcast booth. It amounts to an epic of oral history.\"—Paul Dickson, author ofThe Presidents’ Game\"Curt Smith has added to his bundle of superb books on baseball broadcasting. Baseball is perfect for storytelling: there’s always plenty of time to say what you want in the course of a game. These stories will make you marvel.

The first two titles, Murder Will Speak and Murder and Misdeeds were released in 1997. The Berkeley Brigade, are leaders of the young ton.  As the book opens Corinne, the Countess de Coventry, Reginald Prance, and Coffen Prattle, Corinne's cousin, are inspecting a painting for sale by Lady Yavonne Chamaude, a French Comtesse.  Both Reginald and Coffen are enamoured of the well-preserved Yavonne, mistress of the Marquis of Yarrow.  Coffen buys the painting against Corinne's warnings.  She doesn't trust the Comtesse.     Then Luten, Corinne's fiancé finds that The Armaments Committee is about to award a contract for rockets to an inferior manufacturer.  He suspects Lord Yarrow is involved and his suspicions are increased when one of the committee members, who had information on the inferior rockets, is shot to death outside of his home. When the painting is delivered to Coffen, a strange burglary takes place leading the four to believe the Comtesse is into art forgery.  Luten suspects a connection between Yavonne, Yarrow and the contract.  He launches an investigation, causing poor Corinne anguish because she believes Luten is having an affair with Yavonne.  Luten and Corinne visit the painter suspected of the forgeries, but before they can prove anything he's murdered. I think I might have enjoyed this book more if I had read the first two books in the series.  Although it can and does stand alone, I felt that some of the characterization alluded to in this book was probably more thoroughly explored in the other titles.  I did get peeved at Luten for not telling Corinne exactly what he was up to, and irritated at Corinne for suspecting Luten of infidelity at every turn.  Trust is a marvelous thing.  Still the mystery was well done, and kept me guessing throughout the book. \"Joan Smith's writing sparkles with Regency humor and wit! She captures the essence of a bygone era  \"The Berkeley Brigade set about solving mysteries in their unique and entertaining manner.Phoebe Imel  --Copyright © 1998 Literary Times, Inc.

In this work, one of France's most inventive contemporary philosophers, Catherine Malabou, undertakes such a reading, arguing that behind Heidegger's question of being lies another, one not yet addressed in continental philosophy: change. Treating under this deceptively simple heading the themes of exchange, substitution, migration, and metamorphosis, Malabou argues that Heidegger's thought offers a radical theory of \"ontico-ontological\" transformability not found in any other thinker, and sketches its implications for a whole range of issues--capitalism, the gift, ethics, suffering, the biological, technology, imagination, and time--of central concern to the humanities.A major step in the series of texts in which Malabou elaborates a body of theory that starts from certain consequences of the philosophies of difference in order to go beyond them,The Heidegger Changeis also an audacious work of theory for an age at risk of forgetting what it might take to do theory. A piece of writing in its own right, the text invents its own terminological and metaphoric lexicon while addressing its reader directly and urgently, and thus recalls the inventiveness and style of the classic theoretical texts of previous decades even as it stakes a route toward novel conceptual possibilities.", "related": ["B008D30SW6"], "rank": 407366, "title": "The Heidegger Change: On the Fantastic in Philosophy (SUNY series in Contemporary French Thought)", "author": "Catherine Malabou", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Natalie Rothman. . . . Just as the First Crusade benefited the Byzantine Empire and set up what were called for a couple of centuries crusader states, so trade with the East through Venice, chiefly, rearranged political realities and relationships between people.\"—Bibliothèque d'Humanisme et Renaissance(2012)\"[Rothman's] work wonderfully illustrates a point that ethnographers and historians of race have come to understand in general terms, but that has a much wider significance and deserves a much broader audience.... Whether ancestral, religious, gendered, or ethnic, categories of difference are political constructs that those who do the categorising create and those who are categorised ultimately undermine. Therein lies the potentially liberating relationship between structure and human agency. Natalie Rothman's important and erudite book is a salutary reminder of that potential.\"—Sally McKee,English Historical Review(December 2013)\"E.

It represents a rare breakthrough in conception and research. E. Natalie Rothman reveals how early modern Venetian and Ottoman territories and spheres of influence were constantly shaped and reshaped through interactions among people and institutions.\"—Edward Muir,  Northwestern University\"Brokering Empireargues compellingly that 'trans-imperial subjects,' as E. Natalie Rothman terms them, were critical in shaping the ways Venetians and Ottomans came to view each other. Commercial agents, converts, and professional translators all created boundaries as they negotiated across them, in the languages of commerce, law, religion, and diplomacy. This book is deeply original and beautifully written.\"—Leslie Peirce, Silver Professor of History, Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies, New York University", "related": [], "rank": 1092106, "title": "Brokering Empire: Trans-Imperial Subjects between Venice and Istanbul (Lera Research Volume)", "author": "E.

They reside in Utah with their six amazing children.  She loves spending quality time with her family by either following them on their various sports activities or dragging them along on vacations.  As a young girl, Vicena was captivated with the enchanting stories that wove a spell of endearing love. After receiving her bachelor’s degree in elementary education from Utah State University and the countless hours spent reading to her little ones, she desired to write a children’s story. Being a busy mom, her dream of being a writer got pushed aside. Growing along side of her children, she began to read thicker and more sophisticated books. Brushing off the dust of her dream, Vicena decided to set her goals higher and rather than being an author of an illustrated story, write a novel instead. She loves to create anything from scrapbooks and crafts to delightful tales of romance. It is not uncommon for her husband to wake up during the night to the sound of keys frantically tapping on the computer as the characters and stories in her mind spill out the   ends of her fingertips as she types the next chapter. Early in the morning, during the day, in the car, and just about anywhere else, the creativity flows from her mind onto the pages.

Unable to conceive of a way to make a living from writing fiction, he decided to fund his dreams of being an author by working as an illustrator (yes, he was that naive).Setting up as a freelance illustrator/artist, he then took up a position at Fred Wolf Films, working on the animated series of Zorro. After completing his contract, he decided to expand his horizons and left for London to seek his fortune. Following three and a half years of working in advertising he became increasingly concerned for his immortal soul. He returned to Ireland much as he had left - with no job, no home and some meagre savings. Ever the optimist, he now works once more as a freelance illustrator and mercenary artist by day and escapist writer by night. He hopes one day to have a decent job, with a pension, a health plan and paid annual holidays.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After the first couple of pages I was totally sucked in and could not put the book down. Having said that it is only right and fair to say that 'Historical' is not a genre that I would choose to read, in fact, I avoid it at all costs! Yet this book is not what I expected - not at all. It's a story that is set in the earlier part of Australia's history and although the formality is there, with people addressing each other as 'Miss Morland' or 'Mr Cavanagh' the story is totally absorbing. Kate Loveday writes beautifully, in a free-flowing, easy to read style. Her writing is pleasantly descriptive and the reader can see the setting of each scene as easily as if they were in the book themselves. The characters are real and it is easy for the reader to develop a fondness for some and at the same time, a dislike for others. The end of this book leaves me begging for more - what better way to leave your audience?I cannot wait for the next book in the trilogy! If you missed 'Inheritance' - the debut novel by Kate Loveday then go find it! It was a wonderful read, also beautifully done and I am pleased to see that Kate has continued to develop her fantastic style. With writing like this Kate Loveday's future looks great! Once again, I have pleasure in awarding Kate Loveday the maximum '5 Inkwells' for her latest book, 'An Independent Woman.' Sarah Cook, Reviewer & Freelance Editor Author of Australian Fictionsarahcookauthor.com", "related": ["B00HHCFV5S"], "rank": 1737375, "title": "An Independent Woman:Redwoods Trilogy: Book 1", "author": "Kate Loveday", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Halpern reviews the relevant science to determine whether sex differences in cognitive abilities exist, and, if they do, what causes them. She presents this information in cogent, accessible prose.

From New Orleans, Louisiana, Jesse is anointed by God with a unique preaching ministry that melts even the hardest heart with hilarious illustrations and strong biblical preaching. Having been in full-time evangelistic ministry since 1978, Jesse's primary goal is to spread the Gospel. He has become a popular guest speaker at church meetings, conventions, seminars, Bible colleges and Christian television programs across America. His anointed sermons point sinners to Calvary and motivate Christians to exercise their authority over the devil by realizing their position in Christ. Jesse believes that Christianity is not just something you talk about on Sunday; it is a day-to-day fellowship with the Lord Jesus. It is this close fellowship with Jesus that makes the impossible suddenly possible. Today, Jesse's entire life is devoted to reaching the lost as well as strengthening the Christian in their daily walk with Christ. Jesse's weekly thirty-minute television program has touched millions of lives through secular and Christian television with the Gospel of Jesus. His program can be seen weekly on Trinity Broadcasting Network and other stations worldwide. Through anointed biblical preaching, Jesse is bringing God's message of hope to our generation. A message that cuts through all denominational barriers, transcends human hypocrisy and frailty, and reaches the heart of mankind.", "related": ["B00EUQTTLG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 1953 he received his Master of Theology from Northern Baptist Theological Seminary in Chicago. He was pastor of eight churches in Iowa and one in California. While serving in these churches, pastor Kinrade has seen many changes in all denominations to make worship more meaningful, inspirational, and appealing to everyone. Are these attempts and changes working? Having large thriving congregations may not mean it is working! Only God can judge His Church. This is why humility before God is of prime importance, along with a diligent study of the Scripture! When computers came into being, pastor Kinrade saw the need to develop a computer program that would help students in his confirmation classes enjoy learning the Bible, along with our Methodist heritage and polity. He called his computer program \"Fun Learning the Bible\" which covered the basics of Biblical truths for all ages. Though Mr. Kinrade does not claim to be a Biblical scholar . . . he strongly feels a practical, humble, and realistic approach to the Word of God is necessary! My wife Joan and I, have two sons, and 5 grandchildren. We are now living in a townhouse at Wesley Park Centre, in Newton (one of 7 such facilities in Iowa).

Amongst his writings are several \"lost\" manuscripts, some of which no doubt led to his execution. His theories went beyond Copernicus' model, suggesting the universe contained an infinite number of inhabited worlds populated by other intelligent beings.Having been allowed to examine several of Bruno's printed books in the British Library, combined with a lifetime of puzzle solving and videogame playing (don't mention classics like Asteroids or Tempest),Book of the Deadwas the culmination of a number of Dean's interests.

Narrator James O'Connor, a young Republican Senator in heavily Democratic Massachusetts, has a month to go in his reelection campaign when he finds the body of ex-mistress Amanda in her Back Bay Boston apartment. The plot tracks O'Connor's attempts to find the killer, avert scandal and win the election, but the real story concerns the Senator's relations with his family: a privacy-craving wife, a precocious daughter, a widowed father and a ne'er-do-well older brother born the same year as he, his \"Irish twin.\" Almost as important are his trials with friends and foes, including a campaign worker in love with him, a manager with White House dreams, a slavishly devoted driver, the archenemy Boston D.A. and the Governor trying for his seat. All these characters come alive, most notably an emotionally restrained, proud, puckish father, who laments: \"Two sons . . . one a lush, the other a Republican. Where did I go wrong?\" Though the political setting rings wonderfully true, we don't quite see the rather stiff-necked narrator as a natural politician, much less as a lover of the glamorous Amanda.

Looking at pictures of Japanese factories and reading about how differently the Japanese count their money, Tom became so fanatical about lean that he left his comfortable position as a professor of business at the University of Vermont to start his own lean consulting company—in Malaysia! There, he learned that the powerful techniques of lean enterprise— JIT, SMED, TPM, and kanban—were only half of the story of Toyota’s great success. The other half of the story washoshin kanri(a.k.a. the \"balanced scorecard\") and a revolution in the structure of modern business organization.In 2005, Tom started applying Toyota’s operational and management methods in healthcare in a small rural clinic in Seward, Alaska. In 2008, Tom decided to trade his Levi’s Dockers for a pair of black scrubs and joined Mike Rona, former president of Seattle’s Virginia Mason Medical Center, as a partner in the Rona Consulting Group, where he and Mike are \"transforming healthcare and pursuing perfection.\" In 2007, Tom was awarded a Shingo Prize for his book,Hoshin Kanri for the Lean Enterprise.

She has been a successful business entrepreneur and consultant for more than 25 years. She takes great pride in celebrating her healing process with others. In fact, she considers it her life purpose and passion. A creative and analytical approach to her healing path during the past twenty years included research and participation in the holistic healing field. After years of seeking help from the traditional psychological health field, Lori was unsuccessful at maintaining long-term emotional stability. She knew (had faith) that there had to be a more effective way to emotional and spiritual stability. Lori found that the most effective assistance, allowing her own healing to accelerate, was the research and application of ancient healing modalities that are resurfacing in our society today, integrated with traditional medicine. Lori studied hundreds of books, experienced private healing sessions, and attended various seminars and classes throughout the United States, internationally, and on the Internet. She focused attention on her own unique inner connection to God and used the spiritual self-help field to heal successfully. This approach, and use of these tools, accelerated her healing process at an amazing pace. She looks forward to teaching these tools to other survivors, assisting them in stepping into a healthy and happy lifestyle.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His thinking was shaped largely by his older brother Roy, a Special Forces medic who was killed in Vietnam in the 1968 Tet offensive. Roy taught John the meaning of love, and John applied those lessons as he understood them; paradoxically, following his brother's advice led him to become a conscientious objector. He was one of the founders of the Prolife Nonviolent Action Project, which promoted, inspired, and sometimes led sit-ins at abortion clinics across the country and in Europe, South America, Asia and Australia. These actions saved the lives of thousands of children and protected the dignity of thousands of parents. (See \"Wrath of Angels\" by Jim Risen and Judy Thomas, chapter 3: \"John O'Keefe, Father of Rescue.\") He worked with Juli Loesch in Prolifers for Survival, a pro-life pro-peace organization, bringing together activists from movements that quoted the same Scripture, spoke with the same fervor, dreamed similar impossible dreams -- but generally butted heads with each other. This bridge-building labor was later embraced by the Catholic bishops in America. He fought coercive population control, and worked to bring together activists who were generally on opposite sides of a bitter divide -- activists who identified themselves as pro-life and activists who identified themselves as pro-choice. This was not quite as quixotic as it sounds: pro-lifers and pro-choicers did find common ground fighting forced abortion and forced sterilization, and did work in an ad hoc coalition to oppose population control in developing nations. Inside the United States, common ground work was frustrating: the two sides each identified their own \"common ground.\" Pro-lifers offered to cooperate on pregnancy aid, opposing forced abortion, and opposing pornography. Pro-choicers offered to cooperate on sex education, birth control, and funding child care. Ah, well. He opposed eugenics -- the ideology of arrogance, the pursuit of a new and improved human race (see \"The Roots of Racism and Abortion,\" on Kindle). One aspect of eugenics is population control, backed up by immigration control. He is a Maryland native, and focused sharply on immigration in 2011-12 when opponents of Maryland's Dream Act appealed a mild new law, a small gesture of hospitality, to referendum. He was appalled to see that many of the leaders of Maryland's opposition identified themselves as devout Christians. Hence this book.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Their welcome was quite mixed, but in the end, acceptance was grudgingly given in most nations, though the road to equality is long and paved with treachery.On the other hand are the gargoyles. Gargoyles came out to the world, also, based on what they viewed as the relative success for the vampires. They were almost universally loathed. Great hunting parties were created to search them out and destroy them. Weapons manufacturers got into the game, also, creating machines that could overcome the gargoyles' natural ability to avoid human detection.Their plea for assistance in overcoming their infertility was met with horror, outrage, and ultimately, what could only be called wholesale slaughter. Now the few remaining gargoyles teeter on the brink of extinction and hide from humanity once more.In A Wolf's Song, there is the first introduction of the Gargoyles and their interaction with their fellow Supernaturals. In this book, you will learn even more about the origins of these gentle giants.This book is not part of the Supernaturals Now trilogy. It is a supplemental book which stands on its own. If you haven't read any other of the books, you will still enjoy the book--provided you do, of course. If you have read A Wolf's Song, you will find this book to be a deeper exposition of what is to come in the later books, and will add depth to the history shown in A Wolf's Song.In closing, I hope that you greatly enjoy Guardian of the Abyss.Good reading to you,~ Shannon", "related": ["B00K94J2OW"], "rank": 2253870, "title": "Guardian of the Abyss [Supernatural Singles]", "author": "Shannon Phoenix", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.5455, "rating_total": 50.0}

It interprets its subject within a rich medical, cultural, historical, and political context. I highly recommend it to anyone even casually interested in medical education.(Kenneth M. Ludmerer, Washington University School of Medicine)Johnson’s and Chaudhry’s timely and readable account of the history of the Federation of State Medical Boards from its inception in 1912 to the present goes far beyond what one might expect from a commemorative, centennial edition. In relating the Federation’s role in the evolution of medical regulation, Johnson and Chaudhry provide detailed evidence to challenge the claims and perceptions of policy-makers, analysts, researchers, and commentators that state medical boards have been largely ineffective in protecting the public from incompetent and unscrupulous physicians.(Carl F. Ameringer, Virginia Commonwealth University)I enjoyed this well documented and well written success story. Men and women who dedicated time and talent to medical licensing boards will appreciate this unique fragment of medical history.(Bryant L. Galusha M.D., former chief executive officer, Federation of State Medical Boards)A highly valuable contribution to the literature on American medical licensure and regulation. Johnson and Chaudhry have painted a comprehensive historical portrait of the Federation—warts and all. A remarkable achievement.(Norman Gevitz, New York Institute of Technology)InMedical Licensing and Discipline in America, Chaudhry and Johnson have comprehensively captured the rich history and ongoing evolution of physician licensure in the United States. This volume will serve as a valuable resource both to the medical licensing community and to leaders within the profession itself.(Steven J. Stack, Chair, American Medical Association Board of Trustees)This compelling story—how the medical profession has supported and encouraged the state to regulate it, moving from a focus on quacks and frauds to today’s focus on accountability for continuous professional development and improvement—provides a remarkable example of a profession committed to self-regulation bolstered by legally mandated accountability to the public. Comprehensive and authoritative, it follows the development of medical licensure from its 19th-century roots to today’s broad system of professional accountability. I found it enjoyably readable, an important contributor to understanding the fabric of professional regulation in the United States.(Donald E.

He has always been known as a fighter or, more accurately, a determined person.  A son to hardworking parents from the Caribbean (A Jamaican father and a Trinidadian mother), he later on applied this characteristic to his health and fitness routines.  As a young boy, he was very mischievous and was often disciplined.  It was not only until he attended Tae-Kwon-Do classes at age 7 that he learned about discipline, persistence, and self-control, which has served him well up until this point in his life.   He was deemed a slow learner and put into special education classes, and was not fully integrated into regular classes until Grade 8.  Despite this setback in his life, Travis fought back and finished high school with honours and went on to graduate from Ryerson University with an Electrical Engineering Degree.    Throughout his life, Travis has seemed to stand out in one area, which is athletics.  From an early age, he was involved in soccer and later basketball.  At age 16, he began to teach in recreation where he taught children all the way up to youth in sports and life skills.   Unfulfilled at age 22, after university, he began searching for something he was passionate about and even though he started his own Real Estate Business at age 23, he still felt something was missing.  It wasn’t until people asked what he was doing to look the way he did that he took interest in teaching people his secrets in exercising and dieting. For several years now, Travis has been extremely concerned with how unhealthy society is becoming, especially with the lack of exercise and poor diet.

Simon and Beth have a deep love that is true and lasting. When Simon stumbles across a journal among the books on Beth’s shelf, he begins to read the story of a horrible crime, the person who committed it and the victim. As he continues to read, he is filled with numerous changing emotions. Interrupting his reading are mysterious phone calls and the discovery of a bank book with large sums being withdrawn every few months. He wonders if Beth has gotten herself into something. As he continues reading, he begins to put the pieces together. Will his discoveries destroy their love? Will he be able to help Beth escape the problems that she is facing?\n\nThe depth of this love story is brought to light in a very subtle, but genuine manner. Kiss on Her Wings contrasts the depths of evil with the heights of genuine love. Wendy Gibbins has subtly created a masterpiece in this novella, touching both worlds in a very real way. The patience, endurance, and honesty of genuine love, even at the risk of losing it all, is expertly demonstrated by Simon’s quiet commitment to Beth. Genuine, intriguing and inspiring, Kiss on Her Wings will raise your spirits as well and restore your confidence in the existence and power of true love.", "related": ["B00CGIEP00"], "rank": 4190676, "title": "Kiss on Her Wings", "author": "Wendy Anne Gibbins-Lekkou", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Later on, at the urging of his parents, P.J. studied business, and still operates two companies of his own.At the ripe old age of thirty-five Owen made a decision to return to writing, and sat down to pen the story he had been playing in his mind all those years before, the stories that would eventually become the serialized middle-grade fantasy series, Seeking Daylight.Owen continues to live in upstate New York, with his wife on their small horse farm, soaking in todays books, movies, and pop-culture.

Unfortunately, the manuscript has not survived. Hardly surprising, since I chose to hide it under the bathroom lino, and it was only unearthed when we were moving house and my father was tiling the floor! Still, it was a start, I suppose.I have a brother and a sister. She's the cute and artistic one, and he's the tall and musical one. I'm the one who sat in the bedroom all through my teens writing an endless diary and listening to Motorhead records. I can only thank God that the net and blogs weren't invented till I was old enough to have a life. Otherwise, I might have been the first person to be surgically removed from BEBO.Chasing Shadows is my first book. I wrote it over a year ago and worked like a demon to finish it. Its based around people I might have known and theres a bit of me in there too. (Though I ain't saying where). The music we listened to and the places we went to are central to the plot and I think people who lived the scene back then will like the story.I am currently halfway through the sequel entitled \"Rain\" and I hope to be able to publish that in 2009, work, kids and moggies permitting.", "related": [], "rank": 3483830, "title": "Chasing Shadows", "author": "Sharon Collins", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The various essays inspire wisdom and hope, even as they challenge readers to new depths of commitment. (Mary C. Boys, Skinner & McAlpin Professor of Practical Theology, Union Theological Seminary)Grounded in the transformative vision of the Second Vatican Council, this volume offers a holistic perspective on the core issues confronting lay ecclesial leaders in the US Catholic church today. As experienced leaders and seasoned scholars, the contributors use life stories and practical cases to bring theory to life. Hopeful and helpful, this book honors the pioneering work of the church's current lay leaders and encourages the next generation in this expansion of ecclesial ministry. It will be a valuable resource for use in programs of initial and ongoing leadership development. Questions at the end of each chapter provoke reflection and will provide focus for fruitful group discussion. (Evelyn Eaton Whitehead and James D. Whitehead, Institute of Pastoral Studies at Loyola University Chicago, authors of Method in Ministry)Though relatively short, this is a rich book, both in breadth and depth…I hope lay leaders in Catholic education, health care, and other institutions will get hold of this book and use it. (Rose ZuzworskyAmerica)This book belongs in the personal library of any professional heading a Catholic institution as well as in libraries of colleges that train lay leaders. (Paul Pojman)In spite of evidence to the contrary—scandals and crises—there is a new Pentecost breaking out in the church as lay people claim the rights and responsibilities of their baptism. But if lay leaders are to stay the course, they must ground themselves in a life-giving spirituality, one that draws from the deep waters of the Catholic treasury.Called and Chosenwill be an invaluable resource to this good end.

Author Clarence Jones knows what he’s writing about.  As a legendary investigative reporter for 30 years in both newspapers and TV, he said he wrote this book \"to teach people like you how to cope with SOBs like me.\" Then he left reporting to become a nationally-recognized news media consultant, crisis manager, on-camera coach. Nobody in America has comparable experience, insight, and know-how. He began as a full-time reporter for the Florida Times-Union while he was earning his journalism degree at the University of Florida. Nine years later, as one of the nation’s most promising young journalists, he was granted a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University. He wound up his 16-year newspaper career as Washington correspondent for The Miami Herald. Then he went to WHAS-TV in Louisville, Kentucky to work under cover, investigating law enforcement corruption there. Eight months of street surveillance and smuggling a lunchbox camera into illegal bookie joints for his daily visits led to two documentaries that gained immediate national attention. After two years in Louisville, he returned to Miami as investigative reporter for WPLG-TV, specializing in organized crime and government corruption. His work there earned three duPont-Columbia Awards (television’s equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize). No other reporter for a local TV station has ever won the award three times. His work in Miami also won four Emmys and the prestigious Robert F. Kennedy Award.  While he was still reporting, he also taught broadcast journalism for five years as an adjunct professor at the University of Miami. He published his memoirs in 2013 - They're Gonna Murder You – War Stories From My Life At The News Front. Reviewers of that book say it reads like a murder mystery or spy novel.  His other books include Sailboat Projects – Clever Ideas and How to Make Them – For a Pittance, Webcam Savvy, and Shortcuts for Windows PCs. He frequently publishes magazine articles showing how to make modifications he invented for his sailboat.", "related": [], "rank": 1566684, "title": "ebook,Clarence Jones,Winning with the News Media: A Self-Defense Manual When You're the Story,Winning News Media, Inc.,SOCIAL SCIENCE / Media Studies,TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING / Telecommunications\" />", "author": "Clarence Jones", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After his first semester, financial issues caused him to drop out of college and pursue a career in the US Army as a Cryptologic Linguist. When he graduated basic training and attended the Defense Language Institute for Korean, his writing hiatus came to an end, and his first novel When Chelsea Smiled was finally completed within his first month of DLI.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The effect of this is as powerful as it is poignant: the reader not only observes lovers within these two traditions desperately seeking their divine beloved, but the reader is drawn ever more into this new community of divine mystery and secretiveness that Clooney so eloquently creates in his work. The reader is drawn into the theopoetics and theodrama that brings out a desperate and intense longing that lovers of God from both traditions share. Clooney's work contributes to a religious 'pluralism' that reveals something of a newer theological moment, a spark of revelational power that enters into fresh understandings of the intimate depths of divinity.\"—Graham M.

In order to do so, he examines four historical cases—Truman, Nixon, Reagan, and Bush—and draws a number of timely lessons from them regarding the perennial nature of the subject. The book concludes with these lessons. Brands suggests that even at the best of times, the making of grand strategy is an immensely complicated, messy, and difficult process, characterized by surprises, pushback, infighting, and incremental changes. Overall, this is simply one of the best and most useful books on grand strategy that I have seen.\"—Colin Dueck, George Mason University, author ofHard Line: The Republican Party and U.S. Foreign Policy since World War II", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
