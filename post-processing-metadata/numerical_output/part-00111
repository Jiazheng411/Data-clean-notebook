The story also has a dark intensity and undertone that I totally enjoy and love. Emma Wildes grabs the attention of her readers from the very first page with her descriptive writing and the emotions that jump off the pages of the story. The characters relate well together and I found myself falling in love with them. The plot is a basic good fighting evil but with a unique twist and romantic undertone. With a flow that is easy to follow, Mortal Melody was a story that was a pleasure to read and filled me with pleasure and excitement.\"—Lisa,Fallen Angel Reviews4.5 Stars:\"Emma Wildes begins a series about dangerous women with this book. This story is filled with action, suspense, and lots of hot sex between Susanna and Dare. The ultimate battle of good and evil unfolds as Susanna's stalker is revealed. Will Susanna and Dare be able to defeat the supernatural powers that are thrown against them?\"—Candy,Ecataromance4 Stars, 2006 Reviewers' Choice Award Nominee:\"Mortal Melodyis the kind of story that really gets you right from the beginning. Although there are things that are unexplained (i.e. Dare's unusual powers), this fast-paced story still makes you want more. You'll be glued to your screen just waiting to discover what will happen next. Although Susanna is young and doesn't realize it herself, she's strong. She willingly faces her fears in order to complete her father's last wishes. Perhaps because of her dire circumstances and the fact that Dare is so charismatic, she willingly submits to his seduction. With a few strange characters and one or two twists, Ms. Wildes will keep your attention right until the end.\"—Trang,Ecataromance", "related": ["B001E70ROM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A little over a year later, she did it again: had another boy. To say the male influence in my life has been tremendous is an understatement. Outnumbered but not outsmarted, all I wanted was a second bathroom!A Charles Dickens' novel describes my life: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times....\" Living a block away from the main library made my natural quest for knowledge a reality of great expectations. Grinding poverty could have made for a bleak house, but the love of our family helped overcome much adversity.Through a series of serendipitous experiences, I came to the realization that there is a Divine Being, with a sense of humor, guiding my life. Born in Ohio, but living in various states, such as New York, Arizona, California, Florida, and Hawaii, I have an appreciation for the beauty and diversity of the landscape and the people of North America. As an older \"Baby Boomer\" with a husband who's been my mate for nearly 40 years and 2 grown children, a girl and a boy, it's been quite an adventure.But my daughter giving birth to my one and only grandchild, a boy named Kevie Keanu, added a new color to the rainbow of my life.

Cooper) is solved as promised, author Jack (Red Herrings and White Elephants: The Origins of the Phrases We Use Every Day) does a remarkable job explaining a great many strange phenomena in this compulsive read. Tackling more than 30 mysteries big (the Bermuda Triangle) and small (a flat, straight stretch of autobahn that causes crashes), Jack gets right to the crux of the matter, exposing a great many hoaxes. That grainy, infamous video footage of Bigfoot? Fake. The equally grainy snapshot of a surfacing Loch Ness Monster? Most likely a bathing circus elephant. Crop circles? Less a hoax than an art form. Not everything can be traced to mischievous individuals with time to kill: the disappearance of big band leader Glenn Miller is now credited to friendly fire; the rational explanation for the disappearance of the Mary Celeste crew is just as satisfying as the numerous supernatural theories posited. Conspiracy theorists may be disappointed, but skeptics and armchair explorers will find this engrossing and witty, though probably all too short.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In honor of the occasion, Scarecrow has released this “Commemorative Edition” of Brackney’s historical dictionary. In the process, the 1999 original was revised and expanded by an additional 170 pages. The expansion makes this volume one of the largest in the Historical Dictionaries of Religions, Philosophies, and Movements series. The author is one of the most distinguished authorities on the Baptists, having taught religion at distinguished Baptist schools and having written several significant books on Baptist history and doctrine.   Brackney leaves few stones unturned in his approach, particularly with Baptist personalities. More than 70 percent of the entries are devoted to biography, covering notables like Billy Graham and Jimmy Carter alongside hundreds of lesser-known ministers, leaders, educators, and so on. In most cases, the biographical entries are limited to one paragraph. Another strength is the geographical focus, which includes regions large (Mexico) and small (Malta). Entries like these typically include a small dose of historical background along with 2006 statistics regarding congregations and membership.   Doctrinal entries (e.g., Church, Baptist doctrine of; Holy Spirit, Baptist understanding of) are present but will leave some readers wanting more because of the conciseness of the coverage. Filling in the rest of the A–Z portion are Baptist organizations, associations, and various divisions within the larger Baptist family.   The volume begins with an introductory essay and an 8-page chronology, giving readers an at-a-glance look at 400 years of Baptist highlights. And although dictionary entries lack further-reading suggestions, the volume concludes with a 38-page bibliography with more than 20 helpful subdivisions. The overall feel of the volume is not overly academic, making it a good fit for public as well as academic libraries. --Wade Osburn", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This story may be one good way to see that. --Amazon Top ReviewerIt's the 1970s-- Vietnam is recent history, Farah Fawcett's a pin-up girl, O.J. Simpson's still playing football and hippie Kevin Patrick is a recent college graduate who takes a position teaching inmates at Attica Correctional Facility. It's a long drive from Buffalo and a short leap into the unknown as Patrick learns just how tough it is on the \"inside\" of a prison about to explode. Some of the inmates are terrifying. Other prisoners are inspiring like Richie and Reggie --who's determined to go straight and do right by his girlfriend Jameka. The author depicts Attica's inmates and the facility's staff with considerable skill during an era of turmoil and change. The author touches upon the nefarious C-block problems, shady activities and also includes a bloodcurdling account regarding the murder of a cafeteria worker and one inmate's ill-fated decision to try to escape Attica. \"Life is all about fear. Some people live in fear and others use it to their advantage,\" notes one character as a disobedient inmate is enroute to \"the box,\" a terrifying punishment tool in use at that time.

Mom and Dad gently reject popular nicknames like Turkey Day, then describe the first Thanksgiving to their children: \"The Native Americans brought five deer. And everyone feasted together for three whole days,\" says Dad; \"How cool is that?\" adds Mom. As the kids decorate the windows, Dad works in Moses (\"Too bad we don't have a Moses decal. He's part of Thanksgiving, too\") as well as the story of Jesus and the 10 lepers, before \"foster kids\" arrive to celebrate the meal. The tale winds up obscuring the holiday's nondenominational appeal.

The kitty quantifying begins when elderly Nana Quimby spies a single black-and-white cat atop a leafy, lichen-green tree. Nana calls the firehouse for assistance, but the dispatcher informs her, \"Sorry... we do not catch cats up a tree anymore. Call back if that cat starts playing with matches.\" Dismayed, she looks out the window again and sees five cats, then 10, up the tree. Yet she can't rouse a rescuer from the police (\"Call back if the cats rob a bank\") or city hall (\"Call back if you need a sign that says Danger! Look up for Falling Cats\"). But Nana gets her chance for a subtle rebuke when the town is overrun with mice, and the purring denizens stay at her side. The husband-and-wife team enumerate the crowd of cats while poking fun at public affairs. The authors' feather-light felines could prove difficult to differentiate for beginning readers. They stand in tight formation, as slender and ethereal as mayflies (each is about two inches long, including a long, curlicue tail) and they're painted in dreamy shades of gray-green, pale blue, creamy yellow and white. Nevertheless, the Hassetts' gentle humor and equally light brushwork possess a delicate charm, and the careful Nana ensures that every cat leaves its lofty perch.

Into this world comes Little, a down-on-her-luck runaway. Captivated by the splendor of her new home, Little is glad to forget her old life. But when Sub Rosa is threatened by a rebellious Glory, Little, who longs to prove herself, must embark on a quest into the Dark, a threatening realm just beyond Sub Rosa where Glories are first trained. There, Little encounters Jellyfish, a former Glory who poses profound and terrifying questions, which force Little to decide whether happy oblivion is worth the price of her freedom to remember and to be herself. The transgressive–fairy tale aspect grows tiresome long before the predictable moral of the story is revealed. Meanwhile, the internal logic of Sub Rosa becomes increasingly strained, its mythology difficult to sustain, its inhabitants difficult to care about.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ms. Schubert's yet to write fiction during retirement is precipitated by her daughter's observation, \"I have no idea who you were before you were Mom.\"  The author specializes in fiction appealing to contemporary women from Baby Boomers to Thirty-Somethings. \"Puffin Island\" attempts to relate how the historical events and social issues of the Sixties shaped the author and still reverberate in her children's lives today.  \"Celtic Compass, Part I,\" applies her experience in a \"blended family\" of the Sixties--before that term was coined--to present-day realities.  \"Celtic Compass, Part II\", explores the challenge of divided loyalties faced by members of a blended family in a time of crises. In addition to her three novels, Ms. Schubert is a contributing author to the short story anthology, \"Hauntings from the Snake River Plain.\"  Sherry continues to live and write on the family farm.

All rights reserved.It was Stephanie's first time in Las Vegas. She had no interest in seeing the city, yet she had no choice but to agree to the trip since it was her best friend's bachelorette party, and Stephanie was the maid of honor. The only good thing about the trip was that it was free, since Amanda's fiancé had graciously offered to cover all the expenses. Amanda was marrying a hedge fund manager. Not only was her fiancé rich successful, he was six feet tall and looked like one of those advertisements for Abercrombie & Fitch, but if one knew Amanda, one would know that this was only to be expected. Weddings required so much work. During the past two years, Stephanie had been in five weddings. This was the sixth. It seemed that overnight all of her friends had gotten married. One day they were all single, rejoicing in their freedom, assuring one another of the uselessness of marriage, and the next, those same women who had so vehemently claimed that they would not squander their lives on being some guy's maid were happily sporting giant sparklers on their ring fingers and discussing house prices in the suburbs.", "related": ["B00GQ0O54A"], "rank": 1078143, "title": "A Dress in a Window", "author": "Marie Astor", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They've been looking for a way to get close to their subject for a while, and soon, it's Ryan Hadley, a policeman with the squad, who is chosen as their undercover officer for the case. Undercover operations are nerve-racking to begin with, but Ryan's being sent in to charm the crime lord's gay brother, Jason.As much as Ryan tries to deny it, there's something about Jason that he just can't shake. The man gets to him in ways he's never expected and Ryan soon finds himself at odds with his duties undercover and his feelings for Jason.Undercover Blues is a well written, wonderfully crafted story that manages to give you plot, romance, and action all at the same time. The dialogue is witty and smooth, with bits of humor spread throughout the story. I found myself laughing out loud at times, which was a nice tension breaker. The cast of characters was as diverse as could be, but each and every character was genuine and real. No doubt about it, the sex is hot, and the chemistry between Ryan and Jason is screen-melting. This is the first I've read by Laney Cairo, but I can guarantee that I'll be reading everything of hers I can get my greedy hands on.", "related": [], "rank": 2278877, "title": "Undercover Blues", "author": "Laney Cairo", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He devised incredibly convoluted plots involving ethnic characters (who speak in outrageous dialect), pop culture of the 30s and 40s, and his favorite MacGuffin: skulls. Modern-day writers have their DNA evidence; Harry preferred skulls. Once you read a Keeler, you're never quite the same, and now -- thanks to Ramble House -- you can read all you want. And more!

Lowry may be a portly 60-year-old with colitis, but his affair 15 years earlier with chef Gabriella Wade remains a bright and warming memory. After Gaby asks him to look into the background of her new fiance, Lowry uses all his skills to find out the truth about slick Roy Emerson, whose business is vaguely described as making deals and bringing people together, and to whom the PI takes an instinctive dislike. Meanwhile, someone is trying to buy out the businesspeople and homeowners on Lowry's block to make room for yet another shopping mall. After the Cuban grocery next door is torched by an arsonist and the house Lowry has lived in for 30 years is damaged, he also starts looking for treacherous real estate schemers. Leslie juggles his subplots adroitly, neatly bringing them together in a satisfying conclusion to this tale of rampant tourism and corruption in Key West. Although less frenetic and flamboyant than the Florida noir of Carl Hiaasen, James W. Hall or Elmore Leonard, Leslie's latest delivers an atmospheric, thoughtful South Florida mystery.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Publish a novel. And now TWO novels!  Wayne W. Whicher can't count how many people have spoken to him, while congratulating him on his accomplishment, with shared stories of their own desires to publish a book. It is truly amazing how many people out there have that inner, burning desire to publish a literary work.Wayne lives in NH with his gorgeous wife Amy, their lovable chocolate lab Marley (named after Bob Marley, not the movie, not that we've answered that question a million times), and they have a very vigorous eight month old. Wayne has travelled to the island of Bermuda about a dozen times and the mystery novel, set in Bermuda, was very enjoyable for him to write given the locale. As Wayne pulled his characters through their scenes in the novel, the local settings unfolded in his minds' eye. It was almost as if the writing process transported him back to the wonderful teal waters and fabulous coastlines of the island. The novel follows detective Scott Mathias around the island throughout a myraid of cases.  The book was a labor of love and after sending it out to many publishing companies, Wayne ended up self-publishing it. The book will soon be carried in a variey of local bookstores.  Buy A KINDLE!!! Most people find access to the book online to be easier than journeying to the bookstore anyways.", "related": ["B005I044L8"], "rank": 2236649, "title": "Sunset over the Hermes", "author": "Wayne Whicher", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Self-regulation of learning is a hallmark of students' ability to remain goal-oriented while pursuing academic-specific intentions in postsecondary education. Protecting such long-term and temporally distant goals requires that college and university students be proactive in directing their learning experiences, guide their own behavior, seek help from appropriate sources, sustain motivation, and delay gratification. The authors suggest how college students can control their cognition and behavior to attain academic goals, select appropriate learning strategies, and monitor and evaluate their academic progress.This volume calls the attention of students and educators to the vital role that self-regulation plays in every aspect of postsecondary education. The contributors provide compelling evidence supporting the notion that self-regulation is related to positive academic outcomes, such as delay of gratification, self-efficacy beliefs, and use of cognitive strategies, and that it is important for the training of teachers and school psychologists. The authors offer diverse vantage points from which students, teachers, administrators, and policy makers can orchestrate their efforts to empower students with self-regulatory learning strategies, appropriate motivational beliefs, and academic knowledge and skills.", "related": [], "rank": 3301481, "title": "Self-Regulated Learning", "author": "Hfer Bembenutty", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The government says at first it's gas-mains knowing its another German weapon they are powerless to defend themselves against - the V2 rocket that dives without warning from space at more than 3,000 miles per hour.This first rate story tells of the attempt by Dutch resistance, British intelligence and commando forces to disable a V2 launch site on the Dutch coast, of the boffins and military tasked by Hitler to launch the missiles and the civilians caught in between. As the allied armies slice through Holland the launch crew and local population are cut off from supplies and reinforcements, the resistence are emboldened to attack, the SS crack down mercilessly and the situation gets critical.The author handles his large cast adroitly, painting believable characters in terrible times.This is a first rate yarn that really delivers, and it's large so you can really lose yourself in the twists and turns.

I launched my publishing company in 1994 by gathering writers, editors, and illustrators to produce poetry and books for children.   The first book produced was “Diving Into Music Without Actually Drowning”.   In 1998, the book “The Doll House” resulted in the author becoming an award winner in the Boston area.   Many others books have served as a voyage of great experience in publishing. In 1998, I found ways to support self-published authors and the independent publishing industry by founding The New England Publishers Association.  Part of my role was to conduct a year long speaking tour in all six New England states to support authors and their efforts to reach out to their reading audience. At the studios of WORC 1310 AM & WGFP 940 AM my talk show “Author of The Week” began my journey as a talk show host supporting authors that continues to this very day.  My book “Become A Talk Show Host” demonstrates my passion In 2004, writers started to become authors in my college class “Publish Your Book - Guaranteed”.  I’ve been at eleven universities and colleges in four states.  My book, “Let’s Make It Simple”, is now in it’s third edition..   Both the class and book have been successful even during the toughest economic times since the Great Depression. Now my latest venture EPN supports the success of authors and publishing industry experts to reach their audience.   I’m excited to pull my experience together and work toward your success.   I get a rush from hearing success stories from people I’ve helped in the publishing world.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I’m an author, teacher, and writing coach who just absolutely loves what I do!  Let me show you the way through!  I run a literary spa and boutique that is the perfect place for you to virtual visit if you want to know more about writing, teaching, and self-publishing. Remember my motto: Read, Write and Relax! Check me out at www.lylu.co!  Since 1999 I've been exploring writing in all kinds of different genres: romance, sci-fi, chick lit, urban lit, creative nonfiction, and a bit of nonfiction, because I’d always written nonfiction anyway, a sort of business/legal oriented nonfiction, (employment handbooks, training manuals, legal policies, legal directives, legal memos, executive briefings.) During that time of exploration, I outlined over thirty-books! Through trial and error, I learned a lot about writing and more importantly I stumbled upon my passion and life purpose.  Finding My Life Purpose in the Memoir I found my purpose in a genre I least suspected: the memoir. My memoir, The Way Through Lessons Learned on Love, Life and the Journey is probably the most powerful and significant writing I’ve ever done in my life!  I discovered this purpose through sharing this writing from my memoir with my students at Northern Virginia Community College. Writing my memoir, completely changed my life. Sharing my memoir allowed me to encourage my students to completely change their lives; and so many of them did. It was all for the better. It was almost a magical experience for me to not only take that powerful inner journey, but to allow and inspire others to take that journey as well. So based on those experiences, I developed this mission statement: It is my intention, my passion and my purpose to write powerful and  healing books about life, love and the journey. It is my intention to connect with, inspire, and motivate others with this work and to live well! Well...enough about me. Check me out, maybe buy my book, and then please...begin writing about YOU!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The portrayal of Kirkpatrick's developing insight into his motivation and his growing realisation of the importance of life outside climbing make this a climbing autobiography on a par with Steve House's Beyond the Mountain, only with more jokes about poo and Johnny Depp.\" (John Chivall, TGO Magazine). \"Brilliantly written, painfully thoughtful and yet still an incredibly easy and gripping read.

Each story is intriguing like a complex piece of machinery where you can see everything even if you don't understand how it works.” –Tessa Hadley, author ofMarried LoveandThe London Train“Stamm finds variety in setting and with characters of differing ages and social classes, and by writing in first, second, and third person in both past and present tense. More significantly, he connects so closely to the psyches of these individuals that his style becomes mutable, variously suggesting the eerie claustrophobia of Shirley Jackson, the brittle edge of Raymond Carver, and even the warmth of Lorrie Moore.” –Publishers Weekly(starred review)“Many of Stamm’s characters seem perplexed about what life is, yet what life might be about or how to live it are questions they would never think to ask. The slightest indispositions overwhelm them. Stamm builds these half-lives in declarative sentences, and Hofmann’s translation has a terse exactness. A [character] offers this: 'A feeling has no nose, no cheeks, no mouth. You can’t trust your feelings, they’re too inexact.' Stamm’s great gift is to let feelings remain unspoken.” –Booklist“The 22 stories in Swiss writer Peter Stamm’sWe’re Flyingintimately explore the peaks and valleys of his characters’ often solitary passions and obsessions.” –Elle “ Beneath the surface placidity of Swiss life, undercurrents of spiritual turmoil and existential despair charge this powerful collection of provocative stories...Renowned in European literary circles, Switzerland’s Stamm didn’t achieve his stateside critical breakthrough until his last novel(Seven Years, 2011, etc.). This story collection is even better, with pieces that read like the Zurich equivalent of Camus or Kafka, occasionally laced with a bit of Ibsen or Ingmar Bergman…For those who have an affinity for metaphysical fiction written with a surgeon’s precision, this collection will spur readers to seek out everything else by its author.” –Kirkus(starred review)“These tautly constructed stories, with echoes of such disparate authors as Patricia Highsmith and Anton Chekhov, take root in the psyche and will not let you go” –Library Journal\"The achievement of this collection...is not a small one. The style evokes absurdity, but the stories themselves are saved from being absurd. It is not always courageous to simply tour through life’s moments of futility and failure. Stamm examines these moments with the riskier project of exploring the messy humanity exposed therein. He invites us to recognize ourselves there—and to do so without shame.\" –The Rumpus\"So, so good. I heartily recommend this book, Stamm is a master at work and the collection will delight and startle in equal measure.\" –Alex in Leeds\"We’re Flyingis eerily readable—perhaps due to how much of ourselves we recognize in his characters. In a varied and colorful array of stories, Stamm manages to portray human life as the emotional mishmash that it really is, full of misery and beauty, full of fallingandflying.\" –Three Percent\"I think [Stamm] is one of those rare writers whose words haunt his readers long after you put his books down.\"–Yiyun Li,Wall Street Journal(Asia)\"It is difficult not to find yourself in many of these stories...The result is an effortless accumulation of small gestures that furnish the spaces in which the understanding of ourselves and others becomes possible...\" –Full Stop\"Stamm is a true artist here, and his stories require the reader to really listen. He asks you to see and hear his characters deeply...He has a knack for effortless symbolism, but he dodges any sense of intentional drama or sentimentality. Walk through these places, and delight in Stamm’s sure and unabated guidance.\"  –Propeller", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Read a certain way, this previously unpublished novella provides something of a primer to many of the themes that would emerge in the half-century of work that followed it. Here especially is the deeply lived morality, coupled with a bone-deep mistrust of his fellow man. In this arresting, violent, and largely domestic tale, teenage pianist Haley Brandon heads up a cast of seemingly wistful characters, their lives bandied about by vague circumstance and a hard-headed, power-addicted tyrant. In true Vonnegut style, the milquetoast often turns out to be the determinant agent in a world dominated by the willful (to put it nicely), and in this, longtime Vonnegut fans will find much that's familiarly satisfying. Passing fans of absurdist fiction, lovers of the novella in all its welcome restraint, and avid readers of Kindle Singles should all hail the arrival of the late, great Kurt Vonnegut to these ranks. --Jason Kirk", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 3.9167, "rating_total": 47.0}

This\ndesire, varying in strength for each individual, should and deserves to\nbe fed with an understanding of God's Word. How strong is your desire? I\n believe you have a strong desire simply because you are reading this\nletter.However as a result of various circumstances, some people\ncannot or do not invest the time to read a lengthy book written on\ntheological subjects. Some people will resort to exclusive listening of\naudio podcasts and video teachings in an attempt to replace reading.\nWhile both audio and video are useful and needed, they do not replace\nreading. Studies have shown that reading exercises the mind in a way\nthat listening and watching cannot do. Reading forces the use of\nimagination. This benefits readers in the way that they are more apt to\nbe able to solve problems with creative solutions in everyday life.\nActive reading will guide your mind and teach you how to become a better\n thinker.Even with the benefits of reading, some still are not\nconvinced of the purpose. Some are not willing to put in the hours\nrequired to become a stellar reader. That is where this book comes into\nplay. The style and length of this book was designed for everyone in\nmind. There is the rich and in depth background material one must\nunderstand to better comprehend the book of Romans. On the other hand,\nthe book length was kept to a minimum, enabling those who have a\ndifficult time reading a long book an opportunity to complete the task -\n to feel the sense of accomplishment that results from exploring a book\nthrough its entirety.The book of Romans is referred to as the most\nsystematic teaching on the Gospel of Christ. Many topics are covered\nthroughout the book - many aspects of Christianity discussed. The book\ndoes not cover each and every important topic of the book of Romans.\nThis book looks at the letter as a whole, and attempts to follow its\nprimary topics. This book was designed to follow the flow of Paul's\nwriting.There is no in depth examination of the inherent destitution\n of fallen man. There is little comparison of the passages of Scripture\nin the book of Romans to other selections of Scripture, except for\ninstances where prior understanding of a topic is required in order to\nfully grasp and comprehend what Paul was communicating to the Romans.There\n is an in depth look at what the Righteousness of God actually is. Then\nis an examination of what Salvation in Christ truly means. Following is a\n brief consideration of the necessity of the Holy Spirit in one's life\nand a look at God's grand plan of salvation since the beginning. Ending\nwill be a discussion on how to apply the concepts covered to your\npersonal life.There is a lot in this book for everybody, and for\neveryone there is something to be learned from this book. I hope you\nenjoy our journey through the book of Romans and I look forward to\nseeing your review on the book. I also am excited to see your comments\non how this book has helped you or increased your understanding of\nChrist.

Using the visually irresistible printing techniques popularized by the \"Eyewitness\" series, these two books, when prominently displayed, will probably attract more impulse readers than some of the dustier editions. But do they accomplish their stated aim? Direct textual illustration is plentiful, lively, and useful. The reproductions of prints, photographs, and maps that pepper each page and are intended to enhance readers' grasp of the times, however, are a mixed success. There is a sameness to them and an arbitrary feel to their use. Pirate buffs will find Treasure Island's variety of ship drawings, details of sailing minutiae, and photographs of pieces of eight or guns and swords quite satisfying. Verne's work is less enhanced by its graphics. This episodic travelogue would be best served by lots of clear maps with the route well marked. But the few maps shown are so small that the legends are unreadable and country and city names are blurred. Limitations aside, the initial appeal of this fresh approach may serve to attract some new readers to these enduring stories that have managed without any help for this long.?Sally Margolis, formerly at Deerfield Public Library, ILCopyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 32, "rating_average": 4.1875, "rating_total": 134.0}

He does business with his cousin Derek ,in New Orleans, who operates that end of the Sinclair Coffee Company with the assistance of the able Miss Caroline Marshall.  At first, Jason's communications with his cousin were strictly business, Derek would reply and Miss Marshall would post the letter.  As Derek became more busy, he depended on Caroline to answer Jason's letters, and he would proof the reply, sign it and then she would post it.  The letters from Jason became more personal, and Caroline began to answer his letters on her own.  Jason, beleiving he had been communicating with his cousin, pours out his heart and soul, opening up his innermost thoughts and feelings.  And then he asks Derek to find a wife for him and to send her to Brazil.  He is very specific about the requirements, and type of woman he wants, and Caroline decides that she is the woman for Jason.  They are married by proxy, and Caroline Marshall Sinclair leaves New Orleans to travel across the ocean and up the wild river and through the jungle of Brazil to meet and live with her husband, Jason Sinclair.  Caroline's arrival commences the turmoil, the frustrations, the desires, the anger and the love that will be with them, and between them, from the moment she steps foot on the dock at his plantation.  Jason  fights with his inner, personal demons, and with Caroline, who has come as his salvation, to love him.  But his struggle with himself is overpowering and he sees the only way to survive is to send her away.  Caroline is stong, intelligent and determined.  She will fight him, fight for him, fight the jungle, the pestilence and disease, defy the heat and defy Jason Sinclair.  Caroline fell in love with this sensitive man, through his letters, and she loves him now.  And despite all his efforts to discourage her, Caroline loses many of their battles, but in the end, sheknows she must win the war, or loose her husband forever.From This Day Forward is an exceptional book by Deborah Cox.

A seeming break for the Post comes when two of its reporters, the down-and-out Gideon McCarthy and Prentice \"News\" LaFontaine, stumble onto the biggest story of their careers: the discovery of the body of a high-priced prostitute in the desert shortly after she has testified at a grand jury looking into police corruption. Snooping down various leads, the reporters uncover a shady real-estate development and an orgy masquerading as a political benefit, as well as a string of crooked cops and scared streetwalkers. The story line, which generates both suspense and steam, takes a grim turn when a major character is bludgeoned to death, then a disappointing one with a deus-ex-machina climax that undermines narrative credibility. Throughout, Sullivan's Post newsroom pulsates with captivating weirdness. If the chief political reporter isn't bawling about his infertility, the obit writer is practicing karate on a magnolia tree; if one assistant managing editor isn't howling like a dog, the other is heading for a motel room to act out scenes from romance novels. Sullivan (The Fall Line), a former investigative reporter in San Diego, has created some memorable characters here-though it's difficult to believe that so many of his villains fall for the old hidden microphone trick.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When she began writing novels after retiring from teaching, she decided to follow her own advice to her students: \"Write what you know.\"  Before writing the first of the Grisholm County Chronicles, Eileen cut her teeth - metaphorically speaking - writing ADRIANNA, which she published in 2006 as a gift and to honor one of her mother's fondest dreams - that her \"baby girl\" would become a published author. \"Where do you get all that stuff?\" her mother asked when Eileen read passages from ADRIANNA to her. She had no answer for her mother, though, and still doesn't know where she \"gets all that stuff.\" Now that the first three books of the Grisholm County Chronicles are finally into print as well as ebook, Eileen will be starting on Book IV, Swamp Fever, soon. Before she wrote the first word of Book I, she had sat at her computer and outlined the vague plotlines for eight stories and created a map of the imaginary county that would be the setting for all eight books. With each book she brings forth from that sketchy beginning, she knows she must have a muse...or someone who helps her along. When Eileen isn't writing or working on websites, she may be out walking her two little fur babies, Jett and Toto. She's the proud mother of four children who have blessed her with a total of ten grandkids and three greatgrandkids (so far). They're scattered from Florida to Georgia to Texas, and even as far away as Japan, but by the magic of the internet, she's able to hear how they're doing when they can't make it home to visit. Meanwhile, she enjoys her somewhat quiet existence in West Central Florida and plans to keep on writing far beyond the eight books of the Grisholm County Chronicles.", "related": ["B00GW39FA0"], "rank": 2239201, "title": "Sylvan Creek (Grisholm County Chronicles Book 2)", "author": "Eileen Register", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 1951 Thomas married his former high school teacher and was divorced after a four year childless marriage.   His checkered background includes being a cocktail pianist in New Orleans French Quarter, serving a year of combat in the Air Force during the Korean War, being a photographer, a journalist, a feature/documentary cinematographer, a screen writer, an industrial film producer, a public relations executive, and a book author.   He has worked for and with such notables as Frank Sinatra, the Rat Pack, Lenny Bruce, Shecky Green, Sally Marr, Frank Ray Perelli, Dale Ireland, Basil Bradbury, and others with whom he signed confidentiality agreements.   In the course of various assignments, Thomas has lived or worked in Oxford England, Paris France, Japan, Korea, Jamaica, Mexico, Canada, and most of the United States. Thomas' books include a memoir of his ten year collaboration with the most controversial comedian of the twentieth century titled “Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Prophet.”  His memoir of his childhood in a Gulf Coast town where Hurricane Katrine made landfall in 2005, is titled “The Genteel Poor.”  His novel based on his wartime experiences in Korea is titled “The Josan And The Jee.” His novel, “Cleo,” is based on his media experiences in Los Angeles during the turbulent civil rights era of the 1950's and 1960's. His anthology of twelve short stories titled “Hollywood Tales From The Outer Fringe” reveals the relationship that arise between ‘A’ list celebrities and the armies of little people who work for them.  His latest, “A Place For Us,” is the biography of a charismatic woman and her inspiring life as a polio survivor.  His latest novel, “The Piano Man,” is about a colorful collection of hedonists in New Orleans French Quarter during the 1950.  His upcoming science fiction trilogy, Immortal, involves three alien archeologists a millennium in the future who try how and why humans self destructed themselves and their planet, in the process reviewing the evolution of humanity and the turn points of human civilization.   William Karl Thomas currently lives in Tucson, Arizona, where he occasionally teaches writing and film production at a local community college, and continues work on a variety of book, film, and media projects.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Next is the wry \"Up the Line\" (1969), wherein a highly trained Time Courier falls in love in ancient Byzantium. Despite a slow opening, the novel effectively captures the decadence of both past and present, as well as the wrench of responsibilities that tug in both directions. 1987's \"Project Pendulum\" pushes Einstein's twin paradox to the breaking point and is the tightest, most sophisticated, and darkest of the three. These novels showcase not only the astounding challenges of time travel but the growth of a talented writer whose ideas and characters continue to entertain. (Apr.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

The view is an alarming expanse of Tour de France cyclists doping, using performance enhancing drugs, taking steroids, and conspiring to cover it up. And those riders not using don't stand a chance for a top place finish. Cyclists, then, have a choice: win and remain relevant but become wedded to scandal and fraud, or stay clean and drop from the world stage. It was this stark choice that Lance Armstrong faced during his cycling career.New York Timessportswriter Jere Longman creates a gripping narrative of Armstrong's alleged drug use--why he used them, what he used, and the cunning he and his teammates employed to avoid being caught by the numerous unannounced World Anti-Doping Agency blood and urine tests. As an avid cycling fan and editor of a cycling book, I deeply enjoyed Longman's in-depth reporting. He delivers a powerful fact and testimony-based story that lacks opinion, political leanings, or moral caution--those delights are left to the reader.--Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00I33PQBE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Still, even with the additions the story stays true to its main focus of a loving married couple that regardless of the extreme sexcapades they may find themselves in, their hearts and eyes are always ultimately on each other. This is adult erotica with adult characters and its this focus on their love that fuels such great reader response. My feedback has been incredible and these characters already have fans that are eager to see where they go next. Allie, Allen, and the new characters of Jake, Natalie, and Dana that will be reappearing in future tales are firing up peoples imaginations. Will you be next?

Every day that vision becomes more of a reality through Kenneth Copeland Ministries daily and weekly television broadcasts, monthly magazine, books, teaching tapes, gospel music recordings, meetings and conventions.

It takes place in\nFlorence, Italy, and the author sprinkles in just enough Italian dialect\n to give the story an authentic feel. The cast of characters, comprised\nof the Mantoni family, are totally off the wall. Eccentric seems almost a\n tame way to describe them! Ms. Boeker creates quirky characters whose\npersonalities just jump off the pages! Carlina's action concerning\nNico's body had me wondering about her, but once I met the rest of her\nfamily I realized that she might just be the most normal one in the\nbunch! Most of the family lived in separate apartments in\nthe same house which made for a very interesting setting. Beate Boeker\ndoes a fabulous job of describing this unique living situation, allowing\n me to easily visualize the various apartments, and the way the family\nwas always around! Stefano Garini, the detective assigned to investigate\n the case, finds himself tossed into the midst of this odd family. The\nverbal sparring between Stefano and Carlina is often funny, and the\nelectric undercurrent indicating attraction is certainly there. As\nStefano interviews the various family members, family secrets are\nspilled and more than a few people are found to have had the motive to\nwant grandpa dead. Several twists make this a great who-dun-it murder\nmystery, and the quirky members of the Mantoni family provide several\nlaughs which makes Delayed Death a page turning cozy\n mystery that left me wanting to read more from this author.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 42.0}

(CHOICE)In this positive, practical, and inclusive book, Rosemary Callard-Szulgit distinguishes between the pursuit of excellence, which is healthy and productive, and perfectionism, which she defines as negative and problematic. She writes about the ways highly capable learners can feel so pushed to meet their goals that they can’t acknowledge their limitations, the ways they become incapacitated by anything less than perfection, and therefore learn to avoid challenge and risk. Acknowledging her own lifelong battle with perfectionism, she writes, ‘Perfectionism hurts! It not only hurts physically and emotionally, it can interfere with relationships.’Based on decades of experience with gifted learners, Dr. Callard-Szulgit provides proven strategies for helping young people (and their parents!) rework perfectionism into the pursuit of excellence, and reassures parents that ‘with proper counseling, perfectionists can be helped to lead a more balanced and realistic lifestyle.’(Dona Matthews, author, \"Being Smart about Gifted Children\")Dr. Rosemary Callard-Szulgit has succeeded in creating a resource that is rich with anecdotes and true-to-life experiences while also informed by research and theory. Rosemary acknowledges the often-debilitating stresses and challenges of perfectionism but more importantly guides readers in constructive directions that can lead to effective problem solving and the pursuit of excellence.(Donald J.

In the latest escapade, Mariner’s wife, Robin, competes in a race to raise awareness of the deadly effects of ocean pollution. The object of the race is to recover a winning lottery ticket placed in a bottle that’s been launched in Tokyo and swept into a sea that is being polluted by plastic and garbage. Robin’s opponent in the race is Liberty Greenbaum, whose father, Nic, is a friendly rival of the Mariner shipping empire. But the race to raise awareness quickly turns into a race of deadly terror when Professor Satang Sittart, Robin and Richard’s archenemy, gets involved and resolves to get the ticket-in-a-bottle, now worth more than $110 million, no matter who or what stands in his way. Although there’s perhaps a bit too much sailing and shipping detail, fast-paced action more than makes up for it.

This book is useful for classes in political science, sociology, anthropology, religious studies, law and in other disciplines where the major influence of the religious right is now being discussed.\" - Daniel C. Maguire, Professor of Religious Studies, Marquette University\"Militant Christianity is a remarkable guide to understanding the origins and contemporary consequences of the worldview that the militant Christian right uses to legitimize its actions and through which it reproduces itself. Alice Kehoe skillfully blends historical and cultural analyses in an exceptionally compelling and accessible narrative. Militant Christianity is a must read for anyone interested in better understanding the myriad ways that the model of the warrior culture embraced by militant Christianity penetrates American politics and jeopardizes peace and security, and in finding constructive paths forward.\" - Robert A. Rubinstein, Professor of Anthropology and International Relations, The Maxwell School of Syracuse University\"Commentators in the West are fond of labeling non-Judeo-Christian religious traditions as 'militant', 'violent', or 'uncivilized'. Alice Kehoe in this well written work shows that Christianity has a long history of violence and militancy as well. This thought-provoking work takes the reader from the earliest days of Christianity down to the present, showing that aggression in the name of extremist ideology is alive and well among extremist Christian groups today. Professor Kehoe, an expert on American Indian culture, is especially powerful in her description of the damage done by Christian missionaries to North American indigenous peoples in the name of religion.

He writes in several genres under different pseudonyms, but his mainstay is crime and mystery. He published several novels with different publishers until, in 2011, he turned to self-publishing on the Kindle, putting out 15 titles. In January 2012 Crooked Cat Publishing picked up the first of his popular Sanford 3rd Age Club Mysteries, The Filey Connection. More titles in the series are due in the near future. He also produces darker, edgier thrillers, such as The Handshaker and Voices; titles which are aimed exclusively at an adult audience and which question the perceptions of reality. In a more light-hearted mood again, he turns out the occasional sci-fi or paranormal adventure and he has also published some non-fiction. As at March, 2012, he is working on more of the Sanford 3rd Age Club Mysteries and a sequel to The Handshaker.

While still a teenager, William joined the army and was soon recruited in to the parachute regiment. By the time peace had been declared in Europe in May 1945, he had been \"dropped\" in to a number of key battles and become a much decorated soldier. He was still only 19 years old. Following the war, William served in Palestine until 1948. He has always believed passionately that education leads to opportunity. He has studied part time for both a Bachelor of Science and a Bachelor of Arts degree and was one of the first students to enrol with The Open University. William has six children. As they were growing up, he was working and studying in shifts as a merchant seaman and an engineer, working his way from factory shop floor to management. In his mid fifties, he decided to work full time as a lab technician at his Alma Mater, The Open University and remained there until his retirement. It was during his retirement that he decided to set himself the challenge of writing a novel.The Cypress Branchesis the result.

He is the oldest of seven siblings. He spent his high school summers driving wheat trucks and combines during harvest, earning cash to support his first love, the love of flight. He was an avid private pilot in his teens. Ironically, for all his love of aviation, Mr. Lavanway’s fourteen years in the United States Air Force never landed him a flight crew assignment. Nope. He was kicking it subterranean school in a capsule beneath the North Dakota plains as an ICBM launch officer for his first four years of service, followed by a year of really uninteresting work in a vault, on base. His next two years took him up near the Canadian border, to the giant, phased array early warning radar site outside Cavalier, North Dakota. Then, he was off to California. Academic assignments filled the final seven years of his military service. By the time he left active duty, Mr. Lavanway had discovered his passion for writing. Since life has thrown him a few curves that make it impractical for him to return to flying airplanes, Mr. Lavanway has poured his heart into writing. His education includes a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and a master’s degree in space studies. Mr. Lavanway’s aptitudes for aviation and sciences show in some of his writing.

Marshall is a romantic story set\nagainst the backdrop of India. Asyra, a British girl, lives in India\nwith her father after the death of her mother. The story deals with the\nromance of Asyra and Braddock, how they meet each for the first time and\n fall in love despite having totally different tastes and interests.The book is intensely romantic. It is not easy to handle a romantic\ntheme because most of them end up in a cliched manner, making it boring.\n This book,though short, is powerful and the love shared between Asyra\nand Braddock is expressed very subtly. It's not the usual cliched\nromance. Her journey with Braddock to meet his brother (with whom her\ngrandmother has fixed an arranged marriage) and then suddenly falling in\n love with Braddock is unexpected. The theme of the story shifts\ncompletely at that point.A Heart's Home, A Novella has also multiple messages to the reader. It\nspeaks about how a foreigner feels like an outsider in a different\ncountry, a woman's belief in God and the path He chooses for her and an\ninnocent love that blooms between the two characters, making it a\npoignant love story.The author Laura J.Marshall has added a kind of longing and passion in\nthis short book through her words. Her handling of the two characters is\n done with depth and finesse. The cultures of India and England blend\nwell with the theme.Reviewed by Mamta Madhavan for Readers' Favorite", "related": ["B00KG252XM"], "rank": 646142, "title": "A Heart's Home", "author": "Laura J.

Her work as an author began after the death of Professor Julius Stone, whose biographer she became. She has written several other books, all non-fiction, choosing a wide variety of subjects according to her current interests. While undertaking research for the Stone biography she stumbled upon material about England’s ethnic cleaning of the Jews. Her own Jewish heritage and previous ignorance of this fascinating story prompted her interest in medieval Anglo-Jewish history.  Leonie was born in England but has lived in Australia since she was a child. She is based in Sydney and has two daughters, both of whom live overseas, necessitating frequent travel to the United States and England.

So now it's fun and feels familiar to read the\nsmart-mouth Fire Elemental's story.The evil Fallen Angels in this book just get more and more devious. The plot twists are believable and still spooky.Way to go, Elaine Calloway!! This is another great read!- Carol FosterI loved this book! Phoenix, the main character, is someone I identified with easily. He's hot tempered, quick witted and he is quick to react to situations. This book also had heavy suspense, intense scenes particularly as we get toward the end and the fight scenes. I also liked Phoenix and Abby's relationship; that was a draw for me to read this book as well. I enjoyed watching Phoenix grow and mature throughout the book. He began to be more aware of human feelings and emotions, which was interesting to read about. .-A Post", "related": ["B00H2ZKQX2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.6, "rating_total": 23.0}

For students of political and economic theory, it will serve as a factual, well-composed dissection of an extremely important topic.  A handy guide to the uses and abuses of capitalism. -Kirkus Indie ReviewIn America today unregulated capitalism has captured the country, while respect and equality for the people continues to be diminished.We are currently being run by a minority of the wealthy, with the division of the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots\" growing stronger daily. The majority of the people are \"working class\" but even the mostly working class lifestyles are being gobbled up: of, by, and for the rich. The author has exposed the many ways this happens and offers solutions to turn things around so that everyone has an equal opportunity in the economy.We need new leadership that really believes that democracy can work, get the \"working class\" registered to vote and vote for what is right for the people not just the unregulated capitalists. Edmund Burke summed it up very well when he said, \"All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.\" With that comes the responsibility to vote for statesman-like persons who provide vision and leadership for the people. The economy, in turn, would become one of Social Capitalism, where the wealthy, the working class and the government are equal partners in providing a decent living wage for all. Sound impossible? Then dig into this carefully researched book, and find some real answers to address the dilemmas of modern America's democracy and economy.            Virginia E.

When I was a child, my mother would create bedtime stories that I always looked forward to. In early school, they would give a topic and tell us to write something about it on big block paper. In high school, I wrote short stories to share with my friends, and even wrote a few novels. And in college, I was thrilled when a few poems and a short story I wrote were published by the Tyler Literary Review. Suffice it to say, writing has always been a part of me. From years of reading fantasy and romance novels, an idea came to me while on a car trip with my family. The thought of a girl unsuccessfully finding love, until one day she hears a voice say, \"What if you were never destined to marry a man from Earth? Maybe your love will be found among the stars.\" I then wondered what would happen if such a man from another world did exist, surprising the girl to be the love she'd only dreamed of. And so the Dragons and Dreamphasers series was born.  The story of Dominick and Julianna begins with \"The Knight of Her Dreams,\" which takes place both on Earth and a hidden world of magic on the other side of the sun. They are two people from very different worlds who can only meet unconventionally, wishing to find a way to be brought together in reality. If only that was the only obstacle in the way. Their story continues in the sequel \"From Dream to Reality.\" Both \"The Knight of Her Dreams\" and \"From Dream to Reality\" are available for download, as well as in paperback now, with samples for reading on the Amazon site. Feel free to visit the website at www.jenrobyn.com, and the Facebook page \"Dragons and Dreamphasers By Jen Robyn.\" Happy reading!", "related": [], "rank": 2897645, "title": "From Dream to Reality (Dragons and Dreamphasers, Book 2) eBook", "author": "Jen Robyn", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I graduated from Baptist College of Florida with an AA degree in Divinity at the age of forty-five. During the last several years, I have experienced many wonderful things. I feel like God and I are riding in the front seat of the car, driving here and there, on a mission. I have seen God do so many spectacular things, and answer so many prayers. I finally figured out after all these years; Jesus is where joy and happiness are located. Those two things my friend, are more valuable than precious silver, more weighty than gold. Some day when I am standing before the throne and Jesus is standing there looking at me, I hope to hear Him say, “Well done, good and faithful servant.”", "related": [], "rank": 3020624, "title": "The Fruit Wars 2", "author": "Jeanette Duby", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was later able to add a nice piece of brass-and-glass that had been manufactured by Canon during the post-war occupation. That 100 mm telephoto was every bit as sharp and capable as the Leica lenses.

I am a 56 year old ex-Royal Engineer Commando and Technician of Blairgowrie High School – and am now the Secretary of the council and intend to put a spring in the step and smile on the face of locals. I felt I had to do my bit, I believe that if you want to live in a good community, you have to get involved. You see, too often, youths staying in the houses not interacting with their community which can’t be healthy. I would like to offer youngsters more opportunities, such as opening a boxing gym in the town. I want to see Coupar Angus clean, tidy and residents happy. I think we have to get all the groups in the town amalgamated so we have a better chance of getting ideas off the ground, Harvesting a culture of kindness also sits highly on my list. I have lived in Coupar Angus for 23 years and I would like to get the community to care about each other. We saw from the fantastic fundraising efforts for Wiktoria Mucha what can be done when a town comes together and I’d like to see more of that. Perhaps there is a tendency for people to hide behind doors and only look after their own. Well, I want to be an open, accessible and friendly secretary where people can feel they can come to me with any issue and I will do my best to make sure something is done. If I can’t do anything, I will make sure I know someone who can. The team of Community Councillors for Coupar Angus has impressed me. We have Councillors who think out of the box which is great, Every one of them cares about the town and can bring different qualities to the table.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But again when Tees is alone in his bedroom he indulges in the pleasure of \"real\" life, a glass of red wine and easel, brush and colors to paint: how strange it's to see an old-fashioned visual media like painting in a futuristic world... again the author plays with contrast. Another thing that Tees takes hidden in his bedroom are his feeling for Toren, another officer. Toren has a strange relationship with another man, and other than that, Tees has never had an homosexual relationship, and so, for now, he only dreams of the man. But then a sudden event frees Toren of his bonds, and Tees is finally free to love him. Since Toren is more experience than Tees, you would expect from him to take the lead on their relationship, but, in a way, the military hierarchy are respected also inside the bedroom, and Toren unveils to be a gentle and submissive lover. Both couple, Jack and Edge, and Tees and Toren, are nicely developed, and their personal story is well balanced with the futuristic plot; there is a rebellion to bring on, and a war to fight, and the book doesn't underestimate it... don't blame me if I'm more interested on the personal side of the plot, enough to say that who likes more the other side, will not be disappointed by the novel.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For cash-strapped researchers, he could be right.'Open-Source Lab' is written for a wide audience, from novices to those who are \"at one with the force of open source,\" who can skip the introductory material and get right to work printing their own equipment.\"--Nanowerk.com, November 18, 2013\"3dhacker is truly impressed by the amount of work Dr. Pearce has put into Open-Source Lab. It's immediately clear how a teacher or researcher in any institution around the world can reduce their laboratory equipment costs by 60-90%. Additionally Dr. Pearce illustrates the benefits of open source hardware and how it's a must if the world wants to move at the fastest pace for scientific development!\"--3D Hacker! online, November 18, 2013\"We are developing a whole range of different kinds of inexpensive high-end 3D printable scientific tools. I documented both our work and dozens of examples from the community in a book: Open-source Lab, which should be published next month. The idea of open-sourcing scientific equipment is catching on and it is really exciting to see what is going on with groups all over the world like at Tekla Labs.\"--3DPrintingIndustry.com,October 18, 2013", "related": [], "rank": 1631463, "title": "Open-Source Lab: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs", "author": "Joshua M.

Writings from Mother are tucked in at the beginning to illuminate what happened to Bobbi Branson's life before her imprisonment, a period of five miserable years of painful relationship, and how her family reached to God for intervention on her behalf. I have included a few letters Bobbi received from other prisoners.The letters have come into my possession with permission to compile them into book form. The family's hope and mine is that the reader will experience first-hand the emotion of a life behind bars, the huge losses of life experience that come along with serving time, and perhaps, glimpses of how the 'down' time can be used in productive ways.Because this book deals with actual life events, I have protected names, places, and times of occurrence. I offer my apologies to the reader for any confusion this protective writing might cause.The name Bobbi Branson is fictional, created by the compiler and does not refer to any person, known or unknown, by that name.I have used three different fonts in the text to identify the sources of the letters included in the story, and separate the comments inserted by the compiler. Bobbi Branson's letters (and others written from inside prison walls) are printed in standard text. Comments by the compiler are in italics. Letters and other materials written by Bobbi's mother (and others) are in a third font and within quotation marks.Thank you for sharing this turbulent time in the lives of Bobbi and her family.

The blessing of her 21 year romance with her husband and her faith find their way into the lives of her characters and their relationships. How does Brigette categorize her writing?  She writes Contemporary Christian Romantic Fiction about African American as well as mixed race couples.  Christian Romantic Suspense also intrigues Brigette, and she has penned one novel in this category, Against His Will.  She is working on a sequel to that in what has become The Banning Island Books. Writing for Brigette is fun.  True, translating ideas to screen isn't always a walk in the park and editing can be a chore.  But Brigette has found her passion in romance writing and doing it full time is her goal. How her books were born... By popular demand, Mahogany and Daniel, heroine and hero from Brigette's first published title, A Man Apart, found their way into a second novel, Forever With You.   From Passion to Pleasure (James's story), Once in This Lifetime (John's story), and Someone Like You (Nate's story) have become a part of what Brigette now calls The Five Brothers Books.  Stories for the final two brothers, Peter and Bart, are simmering in Brigette's head.  She hopes to translate those thoughts to screen/paper in the final hours of 2013 and into the New Year. A Fall for Grace and Brigette's newest novel, A Price Too High, belong to a group of books entitled, The Seneca Mountain Romances.

He has been writing poetry over the past 17 years and never imagined of publishing any book, but after the loss of his older brother, Marcus, to a kidney transplant; that was the catalyst that made it all possible. His latest book entitled “The definition of a man” released in April 2012 and has been well received by those that have supported him in his latest project. His second book, “In my own words”, reveals a more personal tone of how his words breed life into finding balance with life and falling in love. I dedicate this book too all of those that still believe in love. May she wander along your path and follow you home, where she may dwell forever. In addition to his love of writing, fashion is another love of his ever since he was a young boy. So he decided to launch his own brand, while embarking on his own style, patterns and colors. Having searched the globe to find some of the most unique silk brocades to include Dupioni, and Habotai silk fabrics; from such places as Vietnam, Hong Kong, UK, and India just to name a few. Today (he) is happy to announce to the world TaylordBlu Clothing Brand; his line consist of custom bow ties/ neck ties, pocket square’s, suspenders, and his recent launch of his own silk lapel flowers. His philosophy is a successful man will always dress in ways that reflect his own personal style, that's why his tagline is \"Custom made, individually inspired.\" I hope reading his poetry will help you to understand and appreciate his metaphorical vernacular. One thing is true, words are powerful, they can build or destroy one's hopes and dreams. I hope this book will inspire those to follow their dreams, bare their soul to the world, and provoke thought as we navigate through the mountains and valleys of life.

As they build a life in the big city, they\nalso travel throughout the United States and take in the sun-dappled orchards\nof California, the rush of the Colorado River, the Cajun jazz of the bayou, and\nthe heat of the desert.    However, the Everydreams worry that their\ndaughter, also on Earth, will be taken from them, apparently to help bring life\nback to their home world. So, in a rather vague plot, the couple turns to the\norchids that thrive on Earth in the hope that these flowers will revitalize the\npeople of Tome.   As she takes the struggle to succeed in\nAmerica and applies it to sci-fi, Pilibosian showcases her talent for creating\nswirls of surreal imagery.

In later life, I was called to the Bar of England & Wales, in July 2010. I am a Christian, and I found Christ as my own personal Saviour a number of years ago, just before my eighteenth birthday. Many years of experience have prepared me to write down the things I have learnt, through the adventures I have experienced on my journey with Jesus. Part of my life has also been spent sharing my life and testimony, at after dinner gospel meetings.       Years of preaching experience have gained me a good reputation, among my peers, as being someone who will not depart from the truth of God's word. I can remember how someone came to me, not long after my conversion, bearing a scripture in their hands. They hoped that it would prove helpful in my developmental years as a Christian. That scripture was found in, 2 Timothy 2:15-16 KJV, \"Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that need not to be ashamed, one rightly dividing the word of truth\". This scripture has remained with me for all my Christian life, and it forms the basis of everything that I write. This is so that readers might be blessed, and trust that my writing will not turn them away from God, through error.        I hope that you enjoy reading my books. And, I hope that they will provide you with the help that you need along your journey, as you walk deeper and closer with God each day.", "related": [], "rank": 600152, "title": "Rapture", "author": "Christopher Roberts", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So, whether you enjoy your series one installment at a time, or you like to read a longer work, we have you covered.The Monday Collection, Volume OnecontainsManic Monday, A Month of Mondays,andThank God it's Monday. All these installments are also available to purchase separately if you wish.The Monday Collection, Volume Twowill be released in the fourth quarter of 2014 and will include the final four parts of the Jake Monday saga:Rainy Days and Monday,Can't Wait for Monday,Mad Mad Monday(July 2014), andMonday Bloody Monday(September 2014).I get the question from time-to-time:what inspired you to write this story?\n With Jake Monday, my inspiration came from a multitude of sources.\nAuthors like Ludlum, LeCarre, Fleming, and Follet come to mind. Also, I\nenjoy watching series on television: \"Alias,\" \"Heroes,\" \"Lost,\"\n\"Supernatural,\" \"The X-Files,\" and \"Hannibal.\" All of these have\nelements that influenced my writing.The\n Jake Monday Chroniclesbegan in 2003 when I wrote a short story about an\nassassin named Jake Monday. I had no plans, really, but I had a sentence\n running through my head. The sentence that launched this series began:\n\"Jake Monday hated Mondays more than any other day of the week.\"The\n idea that a high-profile assassin would be unhappy, unsatisfied, and\nstruggling with his past and future, is not unique. I wanted to explore new\n areas of this theme. I thought of family, of a past hidden, of the\nmoral challenge of an individual that finds himself caught in a massive\nglobal conspiracy while grappling with the choices he has made,\nwillingly or not.So, Jake Monday is my Jason Bourne. Hallie is\nmy Sidney Bristow (from Alias). My villains...well, they are all my own.\n I love to draw villains who are deep, believable, and scary. Not\nbecause they always represent the antithesis of the hero, but just the\nopposite: my villains are not much different than all of us. I do not\nbelieve in \"grey areas,\" but I do believe the line between good and evil\n can be narrow. One wrong move and even someone like Jake Monday can be\nheading in the wrong direction.", "related": ["B00BMR0GJK"], "rank": 1866824, "title": "Rainy Days and Monday: Jake Monday Chronicles #4", "author": "Robert Michael", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ford and Goodwin combine rigorous yet accessible statistical analysis of UKIP's supporters with unprecedented access to party activists and leaders. They paint a detailed portrait of the social forces driving UKIP's emergence and how the party itself has developed to mobilise a new mass electorate. This book is essential reading for anyone looking to understand this fascinating, and potentially disruptive, new force in British politics. Anthony Heath, Emeritus Professor of Sociology, University of Oxford, and Professor of Sociology, University of ManchesterFord and Goodwin haven’t just talked to everyone who counts and crunched all the data that’s out there. They’ve produced a really approachable book on a party which, by providing disoriented and disillusioned voters with the alternative they’ve been looking for, may well make a big impact at the next election and beyond. Tim Bale, Professor of Politics, Queen Mary University of London, author ofThe Conservative Party: From Thatcher to CameronRevolt on the Rightis not just a timely and fascinating book; it is also an important one: the first detailed study of one of the most significant developments in modern British politics – the rise of UKIP, which not only taps into popular discontent with the European Union, but has emerged as Britain’s first major non-toxic party to the right of the Conservatives. Peter Kellner, President of YouGov.An essential analysis of the phenomenon that is UKIP in the run up to the 2015 General Election. Vital for anyone studying modern British politics seriously. Ben Page, Chief Executive of Ipsos MORI.As the first serious study of the biggest challenge to the political status quo in 30 years, Revolt on the Right will be hard to better. It is both a garish picture of what the British right looks like when it has had one beer too many, and a sympathetic and occasionally touching account of the frustrations of the white working class voters progressive culture and conservative economics have decided they can do without. Nick Cohen, The Observer.A forensic insight into the explosive rise of Britain's radical right, packed full of compelling research and first-rate analysis. A must-read for all those interested in the state of modern Britain. Owen Jones, columnist forThe Independentand author of CHAVS: The Demonization of the Working Class.This is an outstanding contribution to understanding contemporary politics: a rigorous assessment of the attitudes and demographics of UKIP voters as well as a brilliant story of the people and feuds behind the disorderly rise of a popular movement.John Rentoul, Chief politicial commentator, The Independent on SundayUKIP – a quixotic project to transform UK politics or the catalyst for partisan realignment?  Read Ford and Goodwin’s comprehensive and expert analysis before trying to resolve the question. Professor Michael Thrasher, The Elections Centre, Plymouth University, UK.\"This book presents an insightful and highly informative analysis of the most significant independent challenge to the existing party system in England. It is a must read for anyone interested in the future of British politics.\" John Curtice, Professor of politics at Strathclyde University and a research consultant for ScotCen Social Research. \"The book is rich in analytical data and contains the occasional anecdotal gem.\" Kiran Stacey, Financial Times Political Correspondent\"Revolt on the Rightis a must-read book for all politicians of the main parties as well as the political commentariat.\" - Keith Simpson, Conservative MP for Broadland and PPS to the Foreign Secretary", "related": [], "rank": 1474607, "title": "Revolt on the Right: Explaining Support for the Radical Right in Britain (Extremism and Democracy)", "author": "Robert Ford", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He believes that successful relationships are acts of doing, not having, and can therefore be taught.  Marko believes that every person has a choice, and that everyone can change. From personal experience, he believes that most couples don’t need marriage counseling,  but just some education and guidance, and most of all, determination and a lot of practice.Married for more than fifteen years to a beautiful woman who has a successful career of her own,  Marko writes for modern women and men of the twenty-first century who struggle balancing their professional  work with home and raising kids while trying to be good partners to their life mates.Although Marko has managed to transform his own marriage into a fulfilling and healthy one, he didn’t  learn how to save a marriage in college. In fact, from his background, he holds a master’s degrees in engineering and economy.  It was only later in his life when he found passion in applied psychology in which he is now licensed,  studying how profoundly thoughts and feelings can affect human behavior.He believes seemingly overwhelming problems can and should be broken down into simple,  actionable steps that anyone can start implementing immediately.  In that spirit, he strives for all of his work to be practical and down-to-earth,  teaching only things that work and pass the test of common sense.Marko is also the father of two boys. He would like to consider himself to be a kickass husband and father,  but he still screws up every now and then. When this happens, he says to himself, “Tomorrow, I’ll do better,” and sees those everyday family challenges as inspiration for his own work. He starts his day early and believes that hope is not a plan.", "related": [], "rank": 742612, "title": "Feel Good Marriage: 7 Steps To A Rock Solid Relationship Without Counseling", "author": "Marko Petkovic", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
