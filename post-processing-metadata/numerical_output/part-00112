When she picked it up, her life tilted sideways and spilled into another realm entirely.But at 11:23 she'd stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the converted warehouse that contained the empire she'd built and wondered why she didn't feel more satisfied. From where she stood, she could see a hallway of studios—large and small—with old redbrick walls and green plants thriving in the sunlight cascading down from skylights placed at intervals throughout the building to allow natural light to heat and illuminate the space below. There was a café, the Ganesha Room, sprawling in one corner, with large windows overlooking the downtown Denver street beyond.This was Yogariffic, the megastudio grown from a tiny storefront seed Kyra and her college roommate, Africa, had planted the day after their college graduation. Africa, who was not, as people often imagined, a willowy black woman with hair cut close to her head and cheekbones to die for, but a willowy white one with flowing hair down to her tiny bottom and lips like Angelina Jolie's. Her real name was Amanda, which was much too soft a name for a woman like that, a crusader and—well, it had to be said—sometimes a flake. Someone in college nicknamed her Africa when she was raising funds for some crisis or another in that war-and famine-torn place. It stuck.Below, in the warehouse, the day was cranking up to full speed. Businesswomen on their lunch hours hurried in to take one of the seven varieties of yoga they offered—hatha and vinyasa, kundalini and Iyengar, among others—or belly dancing or hula or Nia. College students came in to curl up and study in the all-organic, all-vegetarian café. Yogariffic employed an acupuncturist, two massage therapists, an Ayurvedic practitioner and an herbalist who consulted in a tiny bricked room.Kyra was the vision and brains behind it. Africa was the face and personality—at least when she was around. At the moment, Africa was extremely pregnant and living in Wales with her husband until the baby was born, when she promised to be back.Kyra somehow doubted it. For the first time, Africa was deeply in love. She'd met her Welshman, Thomas Rhys, on a business trip to London, and the pair had fallen wildly, instantly in love. After carrying on a long-distance love affair for a few months, they'd eloped, then commuted between Denver, London—where Africa supervised a new Yogariffic being established—and the tiny village in southern Wales where Thomas was born.Africa's defection left Kyra wondering what in the world she was doing with her own life. How was it possible that she was thirty-eight years old with no husband or children, no family at all? And the business into which she'd poured all her energies sometimes seemed out of control, a thing separate from her.Looking through the floor-to-ceiling windows, she felt absolutely nothing. It was highly profitable and green and honorable enough, she supposed, but where was yoga in all of this, that balancing, quieting practice? In her seventy-hour weeks and the ordering of yoga mats in thirteen colors (some with paisleys, some with stripes) and the extremely expensive teas they sold in extremely expensive tins and the glossy magazines that touted new products to make you more lithe and flexible and have better sex and look great—where was the yoga? Africa loved all the extras and insisted that they would turn a profit with them. It turned out they were doing much better than just making a profit—they were getting quite wealthy—but sometimes Kyra wondered where the original vision was. Buried in the café beneath the yerba maté in earth-friendly mugs?When she picked up the telephone that rang at 11:26, a male voice with a thick, rolling accent said, \"May I speak to Kyra Tierney?\"\"This is she.\"\"My name is Dylan Jones.\" The voice moved right through her like the perfect opening cords of a song she wanted to learn to sing. \"I'm afraid I'm calling with some bad news, Kyra. It's about Africa.\"\"What?\" Kyra sat down, air leaking out of her as if she were a punctured balloon. \"Is she all right?\"\"I'm afraid she's not,\" the man said. Obviously the accent was Welsh. It was somewhere between Irish and Scottish. Sort of.\"What is it?\"The man said simply, \"She and Thomas were in a car accident. I'm so sorry to tell you they were both killed.\"Kyra heard him, but the words might well have been spoken in some other language. Swahili, say. Or Japanese. \"Pardon me?\" she asked. \"Killed? Both of them?\" Her lungs were empty and she tried to bring air back into them.\"When?\"\"Thursday last. We didn't know to phone you till the will was read after the funerals.\"The will Kyra had insisted Africa write and keep with her. \"I see.\" Though she didn't. \"How did it happen, the accident?\"\"A bad road.\" His lilting, dark voice was laced with regret. \"The locals have been on the council to straighten that turn for years.\"\"The baby,\" Kyra said. \"What about the baby?\"\"Now, there is some good news. She's fine. She was with a sitter. Which is why I am calling. You're the child's guardian, are you not?\"\"A girl?\"\"She is. Poor little orphan. She's a beauty, though, I can tell you that.\"\"An orphan.\" Kyra felt disoriented, as if she'd walked into a movie that was about someone else. It had been at her own insistence that Africa had made provision for her child-tobe; she had no living relatives, and the baby's grandmother was too old to properly parent an infant. Sensible Kyra insisted Africa make a will and she had agreed to take over parenting rights if anything ever happened.If anything ever happened—that never-never land. \"Are you all right?\" the man asked. \"I'm sorry,\" Kyra said. \"I'm just…stunned.\"\"Quite understandable. Would you like to ring me back when you've had a chance to think it over? There are arrangements to make and details to decide. All that.\"Kyra peered at the bustling hallways below, thinking of a baby without her mother. \"I'll come right away, of course. Let me make my arrangements and I'll give you a call.\"\"I'll fetch you from the airport. Fly into Cardiff.\" She wrote down the telephone number he gave her. \"That's my mobile,\" he said. \"I always have it with me.\"\"Thank you, Mr.—\"\"Jones.\"\"Right. Mr. Jones. I'll make arrangements right away.\"DYLAN HUNG UP THE phone and sat with it in his palm, the woman's voice, squashed flat in shock, lingering along the nape of his neck. In the background, a clock tick-tocked on his mother's wall, a noise that always sounded lonely and hollow to him—this is your life, ticking away. Tonight, in the gloomy rain, it seemed even more oppressive than usual.Trying to dislodge the renewed sense of loss the phone call had given him, Dylan stood up and crossed the room. In a hastily acquired cradle, the infant slept, toes peeking out from beneath her blanket like a string of pink pearls. He reached over and covered them. Dear little thing. His mother would return from the market soon, and he could go get some sleep. Tomorrow would be a busy day. He had a project to get started for a local architectural firm and the visit to poor, addled Mrs. Rhys, his best friend Thomas's mother and the babe's grandmother. She'd been infirm for a time now, and the death of her only son had sent her over the edge. Even if she had wished to adopt the baby, it would not have been possible.Now he'd have to fetch Africa's chosen surrogate from the airport in Cardiff and make sure she had a place to stay. He was as demolished as a man could be over the accident that had taken his best friend and didn't know where he'd find the energy for it all.And yet there was no one else. He'd felt a bit sorry for the woman on the phone, the airlessness in her voice. What a sorry tale it was, the ill-fated union of Thomas Rhys and Africa Fletcher, who met by chance and fell in love and both got themselves promptly killed, leaving their child to the same fates that had been so careless with them.The baby mewled softly in her sleep, a fist bobbing drunkenly in the air. He stood up to look at her, but she settled again, all luminous pinkness—ears and mouth and rosy cheeks—beneath the thatch of black hair she'd inherited from her father. God, who'd ever realized infants had so much perfectness about them?He'd been bemused by this magical little creature since her arrival in the world. He'd spent plenty of time with babies, here and there. One did in a small village like this.But this one stirred something in him. Fierceness. Protectiveness. Love, maybe.His phone rang. When he answered, Kyra Tierney—a good Celtic name, that—said in her carefully guarded voice, \"Mr. Jones, this is Kyra. I'll be arriving at Cardiff tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. Will that be all right?\"\"Fine.\" He brushed his index finger over the baby's tiny big toe. Her little mouth twitched, sucked in, went back out.\"How will I know you?\"\"Um…I  don't  know.  I  guess  I  can  wear…uh…a turquoise-colored blouse?\"\"Dark hair? Blond hair? Tall? Short?\"\"Dark hair, a lot of it. Tallish. Skinny.\"\"That's what too much yoga will do to you,\" he said lightly.\"I'm afraid I was just born a scarecrow.\"Her tone was so forlorn he chuckled. \"Surely a blessing in today's world?\"\"I suppose. How is the baby, Mr. Jones?\"\"Dylan.\"\"All right—Dylan. How is the baby?\"He softened, looking at the tiny nose, her mouth smaller than a penny. \"She's beautiful. Healthy and strong.\"\"Good. Give her a kiss for me, will you?\"\"Consider it done.\"\"Tomorrow, then.\"He pressed the phone close to his ear. \"Tomorrow.\"AS THE PLANE CIRCLED Cardiff, on the southern coast of Wales, Kyra peered out the airplane window. They had flown above the clouds from London and now came out of them again, shaking suddenly free of the muffling cotton to see a world as mystical-looking as a fairy tale.

Mead was the right person in the right place at the right time in a newly emerging discipline, and she spent her life shaping the field. At 24, fresh from her studies with Franz Boas, Mead traveled alone to Samoa and emerged a year later with the landmark coming-of-age study that would bring her fame. Mark begins this title with a frank discussion of her subject's childhood and those who influenced her. Anecdotes and Mead's personal letters and writings ensure that her personality and dedication to her work come through. The author recounts several adventurous research trips, a lifetime of lectures and writing, and a decidedly unconventional personal life. Mead's opinions and life style, including her three marriages, are discussed as is the controversy over the conclusions she formulated from her research. Although little is directly documented, the book is well researched, lively, and provocative. An insert explains the four subfields of anthropology and plenty of photographs, maps, and facsimile documents provide background information. An extensive list for further reading suggests material by and about Mead for those who wish to learn more about one of the most influential women of this century.Jeanette Larson, Texas State Library, AustinCopyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 2276667, "title": "Margaret Mead", "author": "Joan Mark", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A novel as grim as it is extraordinary, MacKenzie's debut tells the story of two estranged brothers at odds on how to view their Nazi-sympathizer father. Paul Metzger has troubles: a struggling writer with a dying father and an intense longing for his recently ex-wife, he's also estranged from his much older brother. In what ends up being more than a random act of violence, Paul is pummeled while trying to stop two men from assaulting a boy outside his Brooklyn apartment. Shortly after, Paul's father, Frank—an early Nazi sympathizer who retains some notoriety decades later—dies, and Paul receives a lucrative offer to write a book about his father. Meanwhile, Paul's hedge fund brother, Ben, under investigation for insider trading, faces prison time, and one of the goons who beat Paul pursues him across the city. All of this leads to unexpected turns that shed light on the major characters. MacKenzie sets up a New York rampant with alienation and misunderstanding, and his visceral narrative, powered by taut prose and braced with sturdy philosophical and psychological underpinnings, is a winner.(July)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In a boy-who-cries-wolf scenario, his teammates and coach refuse to believe his truthful account of how he witnessed someone photograph their playbook. The boy proves his story by exposing the spy, and learns a lesson about honesty along the way. This is one of Christopher's weaker efforts, delivering more of a second-rate mystery than his typical, fast-paced sports story. The foreshadowing and development of the far-fetched plot take away from any semblance of characterization beyond the protagonist's and limit the amount of game description. Further, few 12-year-olds would think of offering money to an opposing player, much less provide him with a miniature camera for photographing a playbook. A little syrup is added when the perpetrator says he took and sold the pictures because his father was recently laid off. While the legions of Christopher's fans will undoubtedly read this one, they will also hope his next book offers more. --Tom S.

January is time to take control, and the authors provide step-by-step instructions on preparing for tax season and retooling spending habits while laying the groundwork for protecting long-term assets. Savings and retirement vehicles are discussed at an extremely macro level—but the extensive resource section compensates for the oversight. By devoting the entire month of November to getting ready for end-of-year holidays, the authors drive home how planning ahead can alleviate the pain of unforeseen expenses.

After I ordered it I read it and I knew he could learn a lot and benefit from it if he would apply what was in it. I played in college, am a Level 5 USA Hockey Coach and have taught the Level 1-3 clinics as well so I know a good resource when I read one. He and I liked your book because it is so practical and applicable to what a player can do immediately...not a lot of psychological or confusing mumbo jumbo I've read elsewhere.Thanks for a great book! It should be required reading for anyone trying to improve his or her game and get to the next level. It's very easy to read and apply. Since reading it my son has changed what he eats (truly a miracle in itself), how he keeps hydrated, his pre-game preparation routine(especially visualization) and he has also developed a routine after letting in a goal in order to clear his mind and get ready for the next shot. He finally realizes that there is so much more for him to do before he even hits the ice in order for him to be able to compete to the best of his ability. --Paul Murray, Hockey Dad and Level 5 USA Hockey CoachSeven Pre-Game Habits of Pro Hockey Players is an insider s look at how to prepare to be your best.

Sadly, only a fraction of that scholarship has found its way to church members in the pews. That's why this study text for adults was written.What did Paulreallythink about his Jewish roots?

Its author, an English physician, has a special\ninterest in aging and the elderly. A first edition was published in 5\nlanguages. This updated edition appears in English, French,\nJapanese, and Chinese. Many concerns about the problems and opportunities of aging\nare discussed. The style is clear and readable. Many amusing illustrations by\nPeter Davies highlight the various topics. An original aspect of the book is its division into three\nparts: Preparing for later life and retirement; Coping with problems; and\nCaring for an elderly person.Helpful advice covers\nmany areas, including fitness and exercise, nutrition, relationships, and\navoiding accidents. The book mentions dentists who specialize in dental care of\nthe elderly; it would be helpful to see such a specialty develop. Screening for bowel\ncancer is recommended for people over 50 at increased risk. Screening for\nbreast cancer is also mentioned; hopefully it will be discussed more fully in a\nfuture edition, in view of recent controversy over the use of mammography. Alzheimer's disease, a major and growing health problem\namong the elderly, is discussed in some detail. The final chapter deals, in a\nsensitive manner, with the difficult topic of dying. Finally, a list of\norganizations concerned with aging, with their websites, provides a valuable\nsource of further information and advice.  Thisbook is highly\nrecommended for the mature reader who wishes to make the most of the later\nyears of life and to prevent, or cope with, problems of\naging.                                        Sev S.

A great airplane read, it also avoids the 'well, duh' statements that infect so many management books. I highly recommend it. http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2007/01/three_new_books.html World Bank and IFC Private Sector Development Blog, 5 January 2007, Based on economic theory and good business practice, this easy-to-read account outlines the incentives for multinational leaders to do business with poor people in developing countries. In doing so, it revives the debate regarding the definition of corporate social responsibility, with the co-authors claiming multinational companies' engagement in lesser developed countries cannot be classed as CSR. Follow-up questions and further reading suggestions will stimulate wider discussion on whether to support their case for making poverty business, long after you put this book down. Corporate Citizenship Briefing, January 2007 Rarely can the saying \"You can't judge a book by its cover\" have been as true as in this case: the cover is dreadful! Which makes it all the more extraordinary when you dip in to find that the Wilsons - no relation, they explain - have produced a book packed with insight on one of the defining issues of the 21st century: the eradication of poverty. Their style is disarming and charming. \"When thinking about poverty,\" they say, \"we've tried to think like carbon-based life forms rather than economists.\" Whereas the typical business blockbuster these days offers to reveal an impending revolution, the Wilsons reassure us that there is \"no new paradigm here, no redefinition of the corporation, no need for a business revolution\". Their ambition sounds deceptively simple: \"We hope that a manager who reads this book and then starts talking to a wider range of people and reading from a wider range of sources will start to make better decisions.\" They offer sympathetic, helpful assessments of what it is like to be an expatriate manager or a government bureaucrat in a non-industrialised country. One of their friends \"has just been promoted in a major multinational and been told that he'll be sacked unless he meets his annual targets. It's hard\", they say, \"for him to focus on corporate reputation or long-term profitability or, for goodness' sake, poverty reduction when his mortgage and his kids' schooling depend on how much profit his small bit of the company makes over the next twelve months.\" Alternatively, try putting yourself in the shoes of government officials in non-industrialised countries. \"They are often incredibly poor,\" the Wilsons explain, \"operating in a severely dysfunctional bureaucracy, and with very low levels of autonomy.\" In case all of this sounds like apologies for the folk who stall the eradication of poverty, it isn't. It's an attempt to provide the reality check needed to ensure that future efforts do not dribble away, as so many have before. The authors stress that poverty is dangerous because of its role as \"a crucible for terrorism and instability\", and that it masks some of the greatest potential market opportunities of the new century. But they warn against new forms of irrational exuberance. For those who would argue that C. K. Prahalad scooped them with his Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid, the Wilsons note, \"You'd be well advised to read his book first before starting on ours because he does the motivation, the ambition and the shining city on the hill. We're more interested in replacing a few light bulbs down here in the valley.\" If you're an anti-globaliser, the book's worth reading just for its discussion of how China's development has helped pull millions out of poverty. No need to agree on every point; indeed, a key reward is having your assumptions poked. -- John Elkington Resurgence 243 (July/August 2007)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was educated at King Edward's School, Bath. At the age of thirteen he joined the flag-ship of Admiral Cornwallis in the Channel fleet as a first-class volunteer, in 1806 became a midshipman, and in 1810 received promotion to the rank of lieutenant in the frigate Alexander, which spent the next three years in the protection of the Spitsbergen whale fishery. He took advantage of this opportunity for the study and practice of astronomical observations in northern latitudes, and afterwards published the results of his studies in a small volume on Nautical Astronomy by Night (1816). From 1813-1817 he served on the North American station.In 1818 he received command of the brig Alexander in the Arctic expedition under Captain (afterwards Sir) John Ross. This expedition returned to England without having made any new discoveries but Parry, confident, as he expressed it, \"that attempts at Polar discovery had been hitherto relinquished just at a time when there was the greatest chance of succeeding\", in the following year obtained the chief command of a new Arctic expedition; consisting of the two ships HMS Griper and HMS Hecla. This expedition returned to England in November, 1820 after a voyage of almost unprecedented Arctic success, having accomplished more than half the journey from Greenland to Bering Strait, the completion of which solved the ancient problem of a Northwest Passage. A narrative of the expedition, entitled Journal of a Voyage to discover a North-west Passage, appeared in 1821.", "related": ["B004GHN6Z4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science & Math", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Susan B. Anthony followed this tradition. Convinced that the principle of equal rights for all, as stated in the Declaration of Independence, must be expressed in the laws of a true republic, she devoted her life to the establishment of this ideal.Because she recognized in Negro slavery and in the legal bondage of women flagrant violations of this principle, she became an active, courageous, effective antislavery crusader and a champion of civil and political rights for women. She saw women's struggle for freedom from legal restrictions as an important phase in the development of American democracy. To her this struggle was never a battle of the sexes, but a battle such as any freedom-loving people would wage for civil and political rights.While her goals for women were only partially realized in her lifetime, she prepared the soil for the acceptance not only of her long-hoped-for federal woman suffrage amendment but for a worldwide recognition of human rights, now expressed in the United Nations Charter and the Declaration of Human Rights. She looked forward to the time when throughout the world there would be no discrimination because of race, color, religion, or sex.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Eager to bask in the reflected glory of the James clan, many people claim a family connection to these two famous outlaws. In response, notable historian, folklorist, and expert on the Ozarks Phillip W. Steele penned an authoritative chronicle of the James family, drawing on sources discovered in the past few decades.   Anecdotes, family stories, and genealogies of all members, along with more than forty rare photographs, accurately document the James clan's history. Individuals who believe they share a blood tie with the James brothers will find this book an invaluable resource in authenticating their claim. Those who are merely captivated by the romance and mystery of two of America's most wanted men will discover startling facts about these celebrated figures. Phillip W. Steele (July 20, 1934-November 8, 2007) was a well-respected folklorist and historian. He was a member of the Western Writers of America, Jesse James Historical Society, and National Association for Outlaw and Lawman History. Steele is also the author of Pelican's Phillip Steele's Ozark Stories, Ozark Tales and Superstitions, Outlaws and Gunfighters of the Old West, The Last Cherokee Warriors, The Many Faces of Jesse James, Starr Tracks: Belle and Pearl Starr, The Family Story of Bonnie and Clyde, Civil War in the Ozarks, and Two Longs and a Short: An Ozark Boyhood Remembered.", "related": ["B009K4MKOG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hollywood has portrayed them as assassins and highly-trained, American-speaking killing machines. But Steve Anderson's research has uncovered a very different truth: these were scared soldiers who had exaggerated their English skills in the hopes of getting sent far from the battlefront. They had no idea what they were actually signing up for. They were poorly trained and poorly outfitted, and their mission was doomed from the start by poor leadership and the futility of their objective. Anderson draws on what scant historical evidence remains of Operation Greif to present a new view on its participants, imagining in vivid detail the sense of powerlessness and despair that they must have felt as they advanced behind enemy lines.Sitting Ducksilluminates the crucial role the soldiers of Operation Greif played in the Battle of the Bulge--crucial not only to advancing the German offensive, but also to rally the dispirited American soldiers. --Malissa Kent", "related": [], "rank": 434561, "title": "Sitting Ducks (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Steve Anderson", "category": "History", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 3.5333, "rating_total": 53.0}

McMahon, The Ohio State University\"This book is written with the support of the intellectual vision and accumulated knowledge of two of the world's most prominent scholars on the history of U.S.-East Asian relations. It provides an original, thoughtful, well-documented and readable 'grand narrative' about how America's empire-building drive in East Asia became connected with the wars in the Philippines, against Japan, in Korea and, then, Vietnam. The depth of the authors' analysis is greatly enhanced as they give keen attention to East Asia's diverse 'local' settings and conditions. Vividly and convincingly highlighted are the strengths and limits of 'American power' even when the United States was ascending to the zenith of its global dominance. Today, at the time that America's leadership role in the world is facing serious challenges, this is a study that neither specialists nor general readers can afford to ignore.\"--Chen Jian, Cornell University", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

On returning to the UK, after a short spell in Dorset, he settled in Wales in 1935 where he lived for the rest of his long life. Those are the bare bones of his life. In some senses they seem unimportant when set alongside his extraordinary writing career. Not only was output prodigious, it was like nothing else in English Literature. Indeed, George Steiner has made the bold claim that his works are 'the only novels produced by an English writer that can fairly be compared to the fictions of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky'. And even that doesn't touch on their multifarious strangeness.John Cowper Powys wrote compulsively: letters, diaries, short stories, fantasies, poetry, literary criticism, philosophy and, above all, novels poured out of him. He also wrote a remarkable autobiography. In addition to hisAutobiographyhis masterpieces are considered to beWolf Solent,Glastonbury Romance,Weymouth SandsandPorius. But his lesser, or less well-known, works shouldn't be overlooked, they spring from the same weird, mystical, brilliant and obsessive imagination.John Cowper Powys is a challenging author with an impressive list of admirers. In addition to George Steiner, these have included Robertson Davies, Margaret Drabble, Theodore Dreiser, Henry Miller, J. B. Priestley and Angus Wilson.", "related": [], "rank": 2029502, "title": "The Brazen Head", "author": "John Cowper Powys", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I have a degree in Early Childhood Education from Kennesaw State University.  I teach Pre School part time and write the other part along with taking care of my family and the house, so not a lot of spare time. I have been married to a wonderful man for ten years.  We have two amazing children ages eight and five.  Most of the time my life is a mix of chaos and complete nonsense that is both invigorating and exhausting.  In short I absolutely love it! I was born in Dalton, Ga.  I still live in Georgia in the little town I grew up in.  Although I always said I wouldn’t stay, I just couldn’t leave it. I write because I enjoy it.  It allows me to escape from the normality of life and weave romantic stories the way I choose.  I love strong men with a soft center, just like a tootsie pop.  I admit that some of my heroines are sappy, but I also like strong quippy women as well.   I like to vary my characters in attitude and personality, so you never know what you might get when you open one of my books. I admit that when I started writing I thought it was crazy how authors said that their characters ‘speak to them,’ but now I understand.  The story unfolds in the mind and the characters build themselves and the events in the story.  So… I really don’t know exactly what will happen in the story until it is finished.  Of course I have an idea of what I want, but it may or may not turn out that way in the end.   I enjoy hearing from you.  I do read emails and I try my best to reply if necessary.  I would love to hear your ideas and all about the types of books you enjoy most.  Who knows, you may give me a great new book idea?   amandaanderson2@tds.net", "related": ["B00IKWGM8O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In Consumer-Brand Relationships, the authors have taken a major, comprehensive step towards understanding the real drivers of successful brand-consumer intimacy. Through scholarly assessment and pragmatic insights, the real meaning of ‘brand relationships’ is revealed: how they are built, nurtured and, too often, abused. Read, learn and profit!'- Hayes Roth, Chief Marketing Officer, Landor Associates'Every marketer aspires to move his or her brand from one that is preferred to one that is loved. The consumer-brand relationship is a delicate dance that when properly choreographed can create material value for both the customer and the organization. Consumer-Brand Relationships provides an insightful primer in understanding the framework of what ignites, engages and sustains consumer-brand relationships over time. This book is a must-read for organizations seeking competitive advantage through deeper brand engagement.'- Michael Simon, Chief Marketing Officer, Panera Bread'A brand cannot be valuable without a true understanding of its relationship with its customers. Consumer Brand Relationships provides a thought provoking and illuminating journey through one of the most the complex and multifaceted components of any great brand: its bond with customers. Consumers change so fast within society. Read this if you want a more thorough understanding of their world.'- Graham Hales, CEO Interbrand London'There are few concepts in marketing as illuminating as the consumer-brand relationship.  Understanding the relationship dynamics between brands and people is a powerful tool for strategists, creatives, and CMOs.  With terrific insight and vision Fournier pioneered the basis for the ideas presented in this book years ago while teaching at Harvard Business School. But in the modern marketing era, defined by connections that consumers actively choose, the framework has become more relevant and useful than ever.  Relationships drive economic performance.  If you understand that, and care about the relationship your brand has with customers and prospects, read this book.'- Baba Shetty, Chief Strategy Officer, Hill Holliday'Fournier, Breazeale, Fetscherin and Melewar have assembled heavy hitters to take on the big questions.  I am wowed by the results.  This book will transform the theory and practice of branding enormously and take us one great leap forward.'- Grant McCracken, MIT Research Affiliate and author of several leading cultural branding books including Culturematic and Chief Culture Officer'This smartly edited volume, which brings together prominent academic and practitioner branding experts, advances our understanding of questions fundamental to consumer-brand relationships: their types, their properties, drivers, and consequences to consumers and marketers alike. Critical issues regarding the consumer as co-creator of brand meanings as well as the boundaries of the human relationship metaphor to the study of brands add novel insight to our understanding of this rich topic. A brilliant concluding chapter charts a far-reaching and powerful agenda for pushing the boundaries of knowledge about consumers’ relationships with their brands.'- Debbie MacInnis, Professor of Marketing, University of Southern California'Too often relationship marketing practices have been more relationship destructive than helpful to consumers and their marketing sponsors. This book brings together leading scholars who breathe new life and understanding into the fundamental challenges of building the ‘right’ kinds of relationships with consumers. The insights in this book will revitalize relationship marketing in ways that will deliver value to marketers and foster ties that are valued, strong, and that can endure.'- James McAlexander, Professor of Marketing, Oregon State University'The editors of this volume have assembled a valuable collection of cutting edge works exploring the nature of the relationship between consumers and the brands they love. The authors have examined the subject from a variety of conceptual and methodological approaches. I highly recommend this book for scholars and managers who want a deeper understanding of the fascinating connections between consumers and their special brands.'- Tom J. Brown, President, Academic Council, American Marketing Association and Noble Foundation Chair in Marketing Strategy, Oklahoma State University'Branding has become the sine qua non for effective marketing in the 21st century.  Ranging from organizational to individual brands, and from perceptions to experiences, this book allows thoughtful scholars and practitioners to re-engage with fundamental concepts.  Consumer-Brand Relationships offers an important conceptual and perceptual map in todays’ fiercely competitive global world.'- Philip J. Kitchen, Dean and Professor of Marketing, Brock University, Ontario, Canada and author of several books and 100 plus articles on marketing and corporate communications'Love me, love me not? An essential question not only for people but also for brands! Yet, just like human relationships, consumer-brand relationships are multifaceted and vary significantly in nature and depth. This book bears convincing witness to these many facets and variations, covering multiple conceptual perspectives and the application of different methods. Hence, it is a must-read for everyone interested in a thorough understanding of how consumers embrace brands in their daily life.'- Suzanne C. Beckmann, Professor of Marketing, Copenhagen Business School'Consumer-brand relationships is exceptionally rich in brand metaphors, with key human phenomena such as love, friendship, and forgiveness being used to explain relationships between consumers and brands. The comprehensive and in-depth contributions develop along fundamentally subjective lines to show how brands can become person-like when brand and individual identities intermingle in a complex process. Another great merit of this book is to consider both the positive and the negative sides of consumer-brand relationships with topics such as brand avoidance and the potentially destructive effect of CRM.'- Jean Claude Usunier, Professor of Marketing, HEC Lausanne, University of Lausanne, Switzerland'Exploring every facet of how people connect with brands, this fascinating collection of papers gets right to the heart of why branding matters more than ever. Everyone knows that brand loyalty breeds commercial advantage. But here we see how brands reciprocate, bestowing benefits on people, society and culture. We learn how brand affinity is analogous to building a friendship, falling in love, having a fling or forgiving an infidelity. And critically, we gain a better understanding of how social media is redefining how such relationships work.'- Jim Bodoh, Brand Consultant, Radley Yeldar, London, UK'In many industries the brand is the only way to differentiate your company from your competitors. And the consumer’s emotional attachment to your brand is maybe the only thing your competitor cannot imitate. Thus, in-depth understanding of consumer-brand relationship is a key issue in order to achieve sustainable advantages and earn superior profits. The editors have done a great job providing a comprehensive overview of the topic and addressing its many facets by encouraging renowned scholars and experienced practitioners to share their insights with us. This book will help understanding, teaching and improving customer-brand relations.'- Manfred Schwaiger, Professor Munich School of Management, Ludwig-Maximillians Universi...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And while some people may not like the slight riddle the ending leaves behind - or does it? - I liked that; it fit the whole slightly mysterious but entirely logical plot line. The other aspect I really enjoyed was the slightly snippy tone of the main character and the humor in the way he narrates what happens to him. He reminded me of another one of SA's books (An Elf for all Centuries), which I totally loved.Aiden is a young photographer, a bit of an impulsive man, who jumps from lover to lover, leaving a trail of failed relationships behind him. He never seems to find what he is looking for. He keeps looking and when he travels to Paris to meet one of his idols, French photographer and recluse, Jean-Luc Montpluessy, or Monty, in 1978, all paranormal hell breaks loose when Monty hands him a mysterious ring.This is definitely a story for 'advanced time travel aficionados', since much knowledge is presumed already present and a lot of guesswork is left to the reader. There are no clear cut explanations here, which is a marvelous change to so many stories that explain and detail ad nauseam. I have found an entirely logical way to explain what happened - but who is to say it is the correct one? The beauty of this story is that you may read it and come up with something totally different.If you like stories that are part mystery part fun, if you enjoy a puzzle and not being told every step of the solution, and if time travel gives you one of those headaches you don't know whether to hate or to love, you will like this story as much as I did.", "related": ["B00655A8HO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Nolan notes, \"Gardner, more than any other writer, popularized the law profession for a mass-market audience, melding fact and fiction to achieve a unique blend; no one ever handled courtroom drama better than he did.\"Richard Senate further sums up the significance of Gardner?s contribution: \"Although the character of Perry Mason is not unique as a 'lawyer-sleuth,' he is the first to come to anyone's mind when it comes to sheer brilliance in solving courtroom-detective cases by rather unconventional means. Besides 'Tarzan,' 'Sherlock Holmes,' 'Superman' ? 'Perry Mason' qualifies as an American icon of popular culture in the twentieth century.\"Gardner's writing has touched a lot of people including a number of high profile figures. Brian Kelleher and Diana Merrill say in their 1987 book, The Perry Mason TV Show Book that Harry S. Truman was a fan and that it is rumored that when Einstein died, a Perry Mason book was at his bedside. They further describe that when Raymond Burr met Pope John XXIII, the actor reported that the pontiff \"seemed to know all about Perry Mason.\" Federal judge Sonya Sotomayor frequently mentions how Perry Mason was one of her earliest influences.Starting with his first book, Gardner had a very definite vision of the shape the Perry Mason character would take:\"I want to make my hero a fighter,\" he wrote to his publisher, \"not by having him be ruthless to women and underlings, but by creating a character who, with infinite patience jockeys his enemies into a position where he can deliver one good knockout punch.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Later she was transferred to a second orphanage in Preston in England, which was less harsh, and where, due to one special nun, she became acquainted with the magic of storytelling.  In her teenage years she moved to London to study Drama, working as a telephonist at night to pay her rent and attending Drama school in the day: after which she spent some years working full time in theatre and occasionally in television.  Her first attempts at professional writing began after her two children were born, and she became a full-time mother, writing at night when the world and her children were asleep.  She began with two short stories, both of which won prizes.  She then began her first novel,  `Tread Softly On My Dream’s, based on the true story of the young Irish hero, Robert Emmet. Published by Headline and critically acclaimed by the Press, Tread Softly On My Dreams was acquired by the University of Notre Dame in the US, and The Princess Grace Irish Library in the palace of Monaco. This was followed by her second Irish novel, Fire On The Hill and later followed by her first contemporary novel, Ghosts In Sunlight. Gretta’s writing career was interrupted in full flow when her son broke his back in an accident and needed her care for some years. Now fully recovered, her son is a successful young actor and Gretta has returned to her passion for writing.    She has just completed her new Historical novel, By Eastern Windows, based again on a true story, set primarily in Scotland and India, and has already started work on the sequel The Far Horizon, set primarily in early Australia. Gretta is married to a lawyer and lives in London.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In late 18th-century Seville, Pilar Marie Sandoval y Serna must escape the clutches of her stepfather, Don Esteban, \"a devil in human form\" whom she suspects of murdering her mother and stealing her family fortune. In desperation, she asks the infamous bandit \"El Leon\" to abduct her when Don Esteban escorts her to the convent to which he has consigned her. El Leon, who is by birth a gentleman named Refugio and has his own quarrel to settle with Don Esteban, agrees. But the rapacious Esteban in turn seizes Refugio's brother Vincente and sails for New Orleans to take up a political appointment. Pilar, Refugio and his band follow them to the New World, braving pirate attacks and other dangers. Once across the Atlantic, though, pursuers become the pursued as the Don tracks Refugio and Pilar westward through Indian territory. Pilar becomes Refugio's mistress on the run and ultimately his true love as the plot wends its way to a happy ending.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The result appeared in Vampires 2, a small neo-pulp magazine. I used a series character of mine (Chuck Cave) without any actual consideration of the impact such an adventure would have on him. In fact, I believed \"CatV\" was a lark. I would put together an action-packed supernatural story and then get back to my \"real world\" Chuck Cave thriller stories, but fate or chance decided on a different path for me. Cave and the Vamp became something of a sensation for V2, and the editor requested more. Of course, I obliged, and a series of supernatural thrillers followed.Flash forward a few years. I had been tinkering around with the idea of fleshing out the story. Building it into something longer. The result was a novella, the first in a series of similarly length projects about hero Cave and his mysterious vamp love, Morven. I had no idea what to do with the book, though. It was too long to sell to short fiction markets, too short for a novel market. In that time, Vampires 2 went from a neo pulp magazine to a neo-pulp webzine to a full fledged eBook publisher, and they wanted to release \"Cave and the Vamp\" in short story form. I suggested they take a look at the novella, and editor Carlos Dunn did. To my surprise, he agreed that it was an exciting book and well worth publishing.I hope you enjoy Cave and the Vamp. If so, perhaps you will consider giving the sequel a try.Cave and the Feral Angeltakes the action and thrills to the max, bringing Cave to South America for an unforgettable adventure.", "related": [], "rank": 4961076, "title": "CAVE AND THE VAMP", "author": "C.C.

At the same time, Walter Stanek, a hydrogeologist contracted to work on a government-sponsored disaster-prevention project, arrives in town. At a restaurant, the two Americans meet when Walter steps between Diane and a would-be attacker; this chance encounter sends them on a headlong chase through the underbelly of Paraguayan society and smack-dab into the middle of a plot to overthrow the government. Can these strangers in a strange land extricate themselves from this mess? And how much can they trust \"Dink\" Denton, the American copter pilot whose loyalties are as mysterious as his past? The author keeps the action moving at a brisk clip, which is good, because the small flaws in the plot pass by too quickly for us to be much bothered by them.David PittCopyright © American Library Association.

However, they did fall into three broad categories: Plotter, Pantser and Explorer which was somewhere in between the other two. All the books only explored variations on The plotter. I saw a need for a book that would not so much tell a person the one and only way to plot a story, but how to discover their own process and once they discover it how to optimize that approach. This is the result of that effort.I hope you find it helpful.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But,\nwithin the mental, emotional, and physical pain which he suffered, God worked to\nbring a good that overcame.After being born-again in college, James was\nvisited by the Holy Spirit, but he didn't understand it A local campus organization condemned his experience.\nHe was not supposed to ask God for more than what they taught He would give. James\njust wanted peace. But, their teachings made God seem somewhat distance and\nuncaring, unless one could properly do His will.Attending a Midwestern seminary proved fruitless. They\ntaught doing the will of God. James wanted to know Who God is and would He end his\nsuffering? Would He bless him?Thus began years of attending churches, Bible studies, classes,\nand more. No one could answer his questions like \"How do I come to know God,\nhow do I come to trust Him, how do you get Him to work in my life for good?\"\nThe best anyone could say was, \"Read the Bible, pray, and serve God and He will\ndo whatever He wills to do.\" It seemed like God used love to woo people into\nHis fold and then becames a tyrant who was impossible to please.\nBut, James believed there had to be more. In his early forties, after a terrible emotional crisis,\nGod began opening James' eyes to understand the process by which He created\nmankind to live. For the first time, James began to understand how his heart\nworks. God's will began to make sense, and it wasn't difficult or mysterious.\nGod had not made understanding Him difficult, mankind had.Literally, within hours James began feeling like a brand new\nperson. The depression, anxiety, and other mental and emotional problems began\nto disappear.After over two decades of wonderful change James, his son,\nand the other members of their family share this wonderful news with anyone who will listen. It is\nthe Gospel. It is news that causes people to leap for joy.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He surrendered to Christ in 1980 at the tender age of 18 and entered full time ministry in 1985. He is the author of many books dealing with the life of the believer and helping leaders understand some of the complex issues of ministry. Terry is also the founder of Project India, a ministry which trains indigenous church planters for taking the gospel to rural unreached areas of india. Since December of 2011, he has overseen the planting of 74 churches in previously unreached areas with over 7,600 new converts. He, along with his wife Susanne, have established an orphanage in India which cares for 16 children. Terry's passion is sharing God's Word to challenge and encourage leaders and believers, and in sharing God's love and truth to those who do not know Jesus as their Lord and Savior. Meeting, encouraging and spending time with other believers, especially leaders, is one of the great joys of his life. Terry has spent his life pouring over God's Word in order to discover the treasures of the Lord has given us. In 2008, he was diagnosed with cancer and experienced the horrors of chemotherapy and radiation. However, as he will tell anyone, those times were 'painfully precious' and brought the understanding of God's heart even closer in his life. A devotional book for those going through suffering is in the working. Terry and Susanne have been married since 1983 and have 3 grown boys: Joshua (1987), Joseph (1989) and Joel (1992). Terry lives in Mississippi, but is available for travel and speaking engagements.", "related": ["B007U7JSUO"], "rank": 1736499, "title": "Praying in the Spirit: What is it? Who can do it?

In Today, I'll Be Good, kids learn to tackle minor\nbehavioral issues without realizing that they are learning at all. School-aged\nkids who are heading off for their first time at pre-school or kindergarten may\nbe confused and bewildered by the rules that they have to follow at school,\nwhich they didn't have to follow at home. Terri leads the way for them, and\ndepicts what will happen if they decide not to listen to their teachers, and\nconsequences at home when you misbehave at school.One thing I love about Terri's stories is that she portrays diverse families\nvery well. In this particular story, the main character only has a dad. We\ndon't know if he's a single dad, a stay-at-home dad, or one of a same-sex\ncouple pairing, but I enjoyed that Terri is making it more accepted and\n\"normal\" to have one parent take care of a child. Very cool in my\nbook!The illustrator, Mardee Santos, is much more realistic with her artwork than\nwhat I see in a lot of children's books. While I thought that the kids in the\nstory were a little old for the topic (they look about 5th grade, and this book\nis obviously for children about the age of 5 or 6), she used colored pencils in\nher drawings to great effect. The characters' expressions are really vivid and\ndetailed, and you can tell what is going on in the story even without the\nwords. That quality of being able to interpret the story from drawings is what\nmarks a very good illustrator, so Mardee is one of those elite few.", "related": ["B00DFRUJQK"], "rank": 3290485, "title": "Today I'll Be Good eBook", "author": "Terri Kelley", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When the teacher asked me to show it to the principal, I thought I'd done something horribly wrong until the principal smiled with her red-painted lips and pressed a sticker to the cover, telling me how much she enjoyed my story about a haunted house. Though it took me some time to realize that writing was my preferred form of expression, I have had a drive to tell stories my whole life. I received my BA in English and my MFA in Creative Writing from San Jose State University in Fiction and Screenwriting. I also co-produce and host the webseries \"Happy Hobbit\" with my sister for TheOneRing.net, the premiere fansite for J.R.R. Tolkien, and am known as \"Kili\" on camera. My debut novel, Darkling, was inspired by a dream that most would consider a nightmare. I didn't realize I'd written a story about grief until I was done, and I hope that its message will help others as much as the writing helped me. I have many more books in the works and several belong to series.

The book chronicles Alan ('Stoddy') Stoddart's life, loves and\ncareer over about a twenty-five-year period, in a relaxed and engaging style\nthat allows the characters to evolve and change plausibly. In an interesting\nmove, the second part of the book switches from third- to first-person\nnarration. It takes a bit of getting used to for the first few pages, after\nwhich it's very much business as usual, with perhaps slightly less critical\ndistance. That's OK, though, because you'll like Stoddy (who couldn't?), and\nyou'll like the way he ends up. Enough said. Thoroughly enjoyable, and warmly\nrecommended. - The Other Abbey RoadFor fans of\nthe university novel, and of tales of the 60s, The German Girl is a real treat.\nSet in London, Paris, Cambridge and the Midlands, it entertains us with the\nlife and loves of Alan 'Stoddy' Stoddart, as he moves from callow undergraduate\nto accomplished academic and falls for a series of fascinating women who,\nrather to his surprise, fall for him in return. Highlights of this éducation\nsentimentale - in turns funny, poignant and thought-provoking - include\nyouthful adventures in the France of Mai '68 and initiation into the baroque\nworlds of Oxbridge and provincial academia, all of which catch Stoddy, academic\neveryman and determined good sort, slightly unawares.The novel is well paced, its characters pique our interest throughout, and the\nplot is nicely wrought.  A very good read: I found it hard to put\ndown. - prof Alex Hughes", "related": ["B00AH0OJ5A"], "rank": 2541063, "title": "The German Girl", "author": "Dennis Wood", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I live in the heart of wine country along the shores of Lake Erie in Western Pennsylvania. My husband, a former member of the Marines and the Pennsylvania State Police Department, is a built in advisor for military and law enforcement issues. My stories are romantic suspense with a hearth and home slant. I strive to make them interesting and authentic by drawing from life experiences. I've worked as a bank teller, veterinary assistant, fitness instructor, and am currently working part time at an exclusive bra boutique. But writing has become my focus and, I've discovered, is a constant learning experience. Wherever I go I gather ideas for my stories.

Un músico durante más de 30 años, David tiene una perspectiva especial de la música y la creatividad que se basa en sus experiencias tocando y enseñando música en Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Brazil, Argentina, Nicaragua, España y Estados Unidos. Creó Improvisa de Verdad para permitir a cualquier persona comprender cómo realmente funciona la música y disfrutar de la emoción de improvisar.

Curiosity of pioneer life, herbal medicine and figuring out how to do things other people only dream of, all influence her writing. Finishing college as a 38 year old wife and mother was a challenge, but well worth it.  After completing a Bachelor’s degree in business and education, Peggy earned  a Master’s in Management. She began teaching business and computer classes at a nearby college, and then for the public school system. Currently she is still married to her wonderful husband of 37 years and living a few miles from her childhood home.  Their children are grown and married and have produced two delightful grandchildren. Peggy’s time is spent volunteering at their school, writing books with her good friend, Maggie DeCocker, and teaching college courses.", "related": ["B00GFZZAO0"], "rank": 1179605, "title": "My Heart Stayed Home (An Eaton Creek Adventure Book 2)", "author": "Peggy A.

She was the kind of kid who pulled out grammar books in the summer and wrote research pa-pers “for fun.” (No joke.) In the fall of 2011, she finished and pub-lished her first novel, Forgotten Memories. The summer of 2012 brought the next, Shrouded Jewels. Davey and Mical can be found in both. Also in 2012, Jansina began an editing and publishing business, Rivershore Books (www.rivershorebooks.com). There are now three secondary proofreaders and an illustrator working with her, and the business continues to grow. Jansina’s next project, Tomatoes Don’t Judge, is a story of friendship and focuses on Davey’s younger brother, Robbie. So many steps led to where she is now, and she truly feels it's what Papa (her affectionate name for God) wants her to be doing. Her goal is to honor Him in her writing and encourage other authors to do the same with their own.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That's not to say it's easy. That's more like saying the characters are alive for you.Mercy is a compilation of a few very wonderful girls, and a some of my own feelings and experiences.Deacon could easily be a guy I've known. But then again so could Chance.Chance *sigh*    Now Chance is the guy that makes every girl's heart race and head spin. So why wasn't he the one for Mercy? He just wasn't.Chance needs a girl who can match his passion and his darkness with a depth that isn't eclipsed by his. You'll see what I mean when you read Streetwise: Chance.That book will be followed up by Streetwise: Sage. And you will never guess who Sage will fall for. Or maybe you will guess it. Readers sometimes know characters better than writers do. I wonder why that is.I love to hear from readers. I love when they get as involved in a character as I am. These characters may be a part of fiction, but they are so very real in my heart. I hope you feel the same way.stellaPS. The funny things is, I never pictured the ranch on the cover. I told the cover artist what the story was about and a brief bit about Mercy and Deacon. Then she showed me the cover. I was like ...wow, this is unexpected, and very cool.So here we have a book cover that looks a little bit country--which is funny because part of the story, a good part of it, takes place on a ranch. Pretty cool the way it worked out.Another cool thing, the setting for Deacon's family ranch is a real place. Yep, it's a friend of mine's house. I spent quite a bit of time there, and I never planned for her place to be a setting in the book. But then,Bam,one evening, at a party, the whole thing played out in my mind. So although Mercy and Deacon had been a thought for a few weeks/months, that night they were fleshed out.Anyway, hope I didn't bore you to tears, just wanted to share.s", "related": ["B00AAHC6HS"], "rank": 2727056, "title": "Streetwise: Mercy", "author": "Stella Graves", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is the first book in the Shattering the Darkness Series.  I'm crazy and love my friends, family and booze. Yes. Booze. (Don't judge me.)  I used to never read when I was growing up. My mother always tried to get me to read and I wanted no part in it. I figured why read when it's going to be a movie. (Yes, like I said crazy.) Well a few years ago I jumped on the Twilight band wagon. I've always loved supernatural movies and when I saw the previews I knew I wanted to see it. And see it I did. I immediately went out and bought the books and became hooked. They came to me at a very special time in my life.  I discovered I loved to read and found my nitch in the paranormal and romance genre. I started a book club with a cousin and all of a sudden these thoughts kept assaulting my brain. So I wrote them down. Then, deciding that I wanted to write, I contacted some wonderfully amazing women who helped me through the process. This is the result. I love Breccan and Harper and hope you all do as well. The book is dark and graphic. It pushes the boundaries and will make you cry, (hopefully) laugh and (hopefully) fall in love.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 25.0}
