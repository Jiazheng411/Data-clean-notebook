He discusses what women might unconsciously do to trigger those feelings, including over-estimate their man's strength and fortitude, or compare him to other men. Men, Weinberg maintains, have four basic needs: to feel special, to \"travel light,\" to know their partners are loyal and to \"be close emotionally.\" Explaining how that last need is true in the face of so much evidence to the contrary is one of the main tasks of the book, one that Weinberg carries out carefully and without condescension. But the implications of this theory of \"gut reactions\" that must be managed has consequences: because men are actually the \"weaker sex,\" the job of seeing through a man's \"Masculine Pretense\" and acting accordingly-at least with men who are not in therapy with Weinberg-falls to women, who must be willing to accept that role. Weinberg necessarily paints men in broad strokes-surely not every man equates earning power with virility-but for women who can see the individual beneath the stereotype and who don't mind being the minder of the relationship, this book offers concrete advice.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The size of this little book—an expanded essay—belies its power. Acclaimed novelist Farrington (The Monk Downstairs) drills deep into his soul to ponder his own lifelong coexistence with depression. It is a meditation: the author lays bare his stream of thoughts, experience, details, a few pretty good jokes and many insights drawn from the consummate spiritual writer on interior darkness, John of the Cross. Farrington is well-read and draws from other writers and artists as well as the Spanish mystic in showing his way through the dark wood. He writes about his slow crawl to regular, functional life with beauty, cleverness, bone-breaking honesty and a deep, hard-won appreciation for the holy. Medications help; faith helps even more, and that costs a lot more than pharmaceuticals ever will. This book may be too unbearable for some who are depressed. For others, it could be a small voice in the darkness and a lifeline for those unsung sufferers living with someone who is depressed.(Feb.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From this point, Gladys Milton looks back, telling her story to Wendy Bovard, a midwife and one of Gladys' many patients. Gladys was raised by her midwife aunt in rural Florida during the years when white doctors and hospitals refused to care for brown and black-skinned people. By the time she is a teenager, Gladys has helped her Aunt deliver dozens of babies. In 1958, after her marriage and the birth of her seven children, Gladys is asked by a school nurse to study to become a lay midwife as part of the state's plan to improve rural health care. Although initially reluctant, Gladys finally agrees, swayed in large part by the encouragement of her husband and children. In 1988, after thirty years of delivering thousands of healthy babies - many remembered in exquisite detail - and after several personal tragedies, Gladys Milton is asked to \"retire\" from midwifery by the state agency which trained her. When she refuses, she is threatened with \"serious charges.\" Although adamant that \"anyone who knows me knows that I'll run a hundred miles out of my way to avoid a fight,\" she unearths the courage to face her challengers in court. Buoyed by her faith and far-reaching support, Gladys Milton proves her family adage: \"Success comes in cans, failure comes in can'ts.\"-- For great reviews of books for girls, check outLet's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14. --From500 Great Books by Women; review by Jesse Larsen", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

These books teach kanji only through the kana.

There have been many incremental changes in response to these challenges, but incremental change is not enough. In order to respond to our rapidly changing environment, we need comprehensive change, a change in paradigms. As campus leaders face increasing pressure to show that their institutions are doing all they can to achieve successful student learning outcomes, the need for moving beyond learner-centered teaching to learner-centered campuses will become increasingly crucial.Leading the Learner-Centered Campus offers an approach for campus leaders who are willing to take on the challenge of reenvisioning their own practices in order to make the shift in paradigms complete. The book provides leaders with a framework for examining their work and offers specific strategies for beginning the task of critically studying habitual practices in order to make every aspect of their work intentional, with the ultimate aim of bridging the disconnect between institutionally espoused values and campus leaders' true operating values.This book seeks to change the learner-centered paradigm from an effort by individual faculty working alone in their classrooms to an institution-wide effort led by administrators at all levels working to make their entire campuses into learner-centered environments. The authors translate theory into practice, carefully outline how the roles of academic leaders must change in a learner-centered academic environment, and show how to make learning the focus of the institution throughout its varied processes. For everyone from department chairs to college presidents, Leading the Learner-Centered Campus will prove to be a powerful tool for improving higher education.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rayburn opens the story by uprooting her heroine from a fun but gadget-free existence in rural Kansas. Although narrator Ruby points out all of the parallels between her life and Dorothy Gale's, Rayburn doesn't force too much of the movie's plot onto her own story. Ruby moves to Florida with her mother and adapts to their new life with Ruby's grandmother; Ruby's new middle school seems less like Oz than it does a (very well financed) public middle school, complete with mean girls and an American Idol–like contest. The happy ending not only brings all three generations together and finds Mom a great new career and boyfriend, but Ruby, too, finds true love and her own talent. Over the rainbow, yes, and a little bit over the top.

Then she meets Jack Meyer at a dinner party, and her world turns upside down. They hit it off immediately, and the flirtation advances from words to deeds. Things really heat up on a trip to South Africa, where Jack owns vineyards and Angelica is on a book tour. When she returns home, she begins to realize how rich her life is and what she would be risking by following her desire. This run-of-the-mill female midlife crisis novel has few surprises and even the ending twist will be caught early on by any reader who's paying attention. While Montefiore's supporting characters sparkle, her leads are dull, especially in their pseudophilosophical repartee. Cuckolded husband Olivier becomes more interesting as the story progresses, but Angelica and Jack fail to set off any sparks.(June)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This million-pound production, with some of Britain's finest actors was released at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991.His extensive esoteric works are said to be the largest collection in the produced by a living author.

Serious dancers.I followed them when they were very young. They chose to travel and compete. My wife and I both supported their dreams.But I couldn't sit still. I photographed the dance teams as they competed, and shared the images with the studios and other parents. Shooting film and slides, I would feature the images in slide shows at their recitals.Gradually, the studios where my kids lived asked me to photograph not just the competitions but the entire dance membership. I moved from \"photojournalist\" Dance Dad to \"Official Dance Pictures\" Dance Dad.This took a couple of years and a lot of investment in both equipment and technique. It's a HUGE jump from incidental photographer to the OFFICIAL photographer for posed portraits.But I learned, invested and grew. Over the next several years I developed a mutually beneficial and profitable program that allowed the studio owner and my company to grow and increase client satisfaction.This book describes the techniques and skills required to excel as a dance studio photographer. I hope that you can use it to grow and develop this niche in your photography business.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Crisp, was born in Essex were he still lives with his wife and cocker spaniel. His favourite reading genre is horror, but he also has a love of stories that are based on conspiracy theories. The author of three books, his first took him nearly ten years to write, due not only to work and personal commitments, but mainly because he had never written before. Since then, Geoff has gone from strength to strength. \"Night Stalker\" and \"Tom Fanshawe and the Apple blossom Ghost\", were the first two stories Geoff produced. These were printed by vanity publishers, and he hopes to rewrite them soon, so that they can be brought under the wing of Pigwidgeon Books, the name he publishes under. His latest thriller, \"Agent Arrow\" is now available on Kindle. After deciding that he could do a better job himself, Geoff took on the difficult task of producing his latest book. Although he was in no way an artist, he produced a cover, that to his eye, was pleasing. Having found a printer that would give him just what he wanted, \"Agent Arrow\" was finally produced. Geoff has two more manuscripts ready to go, and is now working on a third. Geoff believes that Ebooks, give \"Indie\" writers a real chance to get their work into the public eye, work that would otherwise be lost, and that the future of publishing is Ebooks, and the future of Authoring is \"Indie\".Show Less", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The authors, a philosopher and a nurse-scholar who co-teach the course upon which this volume is based, address a growing need for increased philosophy of science content in evolving DNP programs, as well as practice-oriented research considerations for this discipline.The volume presents a creative use of the social, political, and historical content in which nursing has evolved. As a whole, this extremely important text reassures the student of the fluid and palpable connections between philosophy of science and nursing science and practice.Key Features:Explores the concept of nursing as a practice profession and assesses how much philosophy of science is needed for doctoral nursing students.Examines the practical application of the philosophy of science to both DNP and PhD students.Addresses the basic principles and concepts of the philosophy of science and their practical application for contemporary practice inquiry.Provides an overview of the century-long path to the development of nursing science that is an essential \"bridge\" to the philosophy of science content and serves as a \"next step\" towards building a nursing epistemologyReinforces important connections between the philosophy of science to nursing science and nursing practice.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Crystal Davis did a wonderful job bringing all the characters together. Each story was hot! A must read! My favorite couple was Jake and Camille. All I can say is he got everything he deserved at the end! All of my friends purchased a copy for their Kindle and love it. --D.Wells, Lakeland, FLThere was nothing complicated about reading this book. Simply Complicated was an easy read. I could not put it down. I read it over the weekend and with my busy schedule that is good. My favorite couple was Jake and Camille. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet but all I can say is I wish I had a Paul in my life. LOL. Wow what a guy he turned out to be!

Spaniard Ramon del Valle-Inclán broke ground in 1926 withTirano Banderas.”—The Miami Herald “The radical innovation in the theater that came after World War I is known here mainly through the plays of Brecht. In Spain, the prophet of this new movement was Ramón del Valle-Inclán. . . Written in 1920,Divinas Palabrasactually precedes Brecht’s agitprop dramas.” —The New York Times “It is a dark, violent, gorey work whose unbridled lyricism cannot mask its many horrors. . . .Tirano Banderas, which Valle-Inclán wrote in his 20s, is Cubist in that its writing is highly fragmented, while its range of deep, intense colours is reminiscent of Goya. But its main characteristic isesperpento, a genre created by Ville-Inclán himself.Esperpentois a mixture of terror and comedy, in which a character from tragedy is reduced to the dimensions of a fairground huckster.Tirano Banderasis a farce written with a poisoned pen.” —Manchester Guardian Weekly “Tirano Banderaswas the first novel to describe a South American dictator. It was written before other authors, such as Asturias and Garcia Marquez. . . .

Since Emma Kay was born almost nine years ago, I have kept pictorial records (both still and video) of her life, growth, and activities. We soon began to lose faith in our judicial system, especially as it relates to the male spouse in divorce proceedings. The Internet had a site for a local attorney which gave instructions on getting the male spouse out of the house-corner him so he will be forced to touch the female spouse to get past her. She played her cards to the limit after that, signing papers for a restraining order. The separation agreement was already written, but the dates in the agreement were all wrong. My son was set up and trapped. He lost his home businesses and didn't see his daughter for five weeks. The hatred, anger, and emotional abuse she continued to show exceeded any behavior I had ever witnessed. Her emotional abuse to her daughter, and to me, was inconceivable, incomprehensible, and inexcusable. I  started keeping written documentation more than six months prior to her actual drama. I started my documentation as a therapeutic value for me. It was much later that I decided to document everything I could in a book.

At another, I returned to the book when I felt the need for the comfort of a close friend. Indeed, as I approach The End I want to fill the gap and find another good companion and that suggests the next book in the series. What is especially good about this book is its positivity. It strikes an optimistic note: if you adopt positive intention to work constructively with the Other side, it is possible to have positive outcomes, to overcome emotional and physically dangerous obstacles and to live a romantic life in the classical sense. --Graham S.

I had always wanted to write a book and no matter how often I started one I never seemed to finish. Well the whole idea behind nano is to sit down and write a book in a month, no excuses! The month of November is nothing but fast and furious writing by hundreds of thousands of people world wide. So October 31, 2010 I was ready to go, I had everything lined up to start at the stroke of midnight, I had arraigned my work schedule so that I would have more time to write. Everything was perfect and ready except for one thing; I had no idea what to write about. None whatsoever, I had no outline, no story line, no line of any kind, nothing. The clock struck 12 and the only thing I could think to do was put the one piece of advise I could remember to work, \"Don't think just write, you can think about it later.\" So that is what I did. I wrote the first chapter for Knocking that night and proceeded for the whole month never thinking about what I was writing just writing it.  After the smoke cleared I took a few months off and then dived into editing and rewriting; although that first chapter is almost word for word as I wrote it that first night. I hope that everyone who reads it enjoys it as much as I enjoyed writing it.", "related": [], "rank": 4070103, "title": "Knocking on Reality's Door (The Chronicles of Clark Wilson Book 1) eBook", "author": "Karl Williams", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Killer Moves is full of action and suspense, ties in with the paranormal, a serial killer, and a second chance at love. With so much going on, it's amazing that Kara and Davis even have time for a little romance.Kara is psychic that had been helping police for many years to solve various crimes. When she got involved with the FBI and one specific case her whole life changes to the point that she hasn't helped others in many years. I have to say, that I really liked Kara. I would like to think if I had the same abilities that I would attempt to use them as she does and help find missing people or to solve crimes.Davis is an FBI Agent whose life has been flipped upside down so many times that it takes a figurative slap in the face to make him change his ways. When this killer comes around again and starts going after people that Davis has known in the past, he knows this case is going to get personal and he needs Kara. He needs to protect her and he needs her help to solve this thing once and for all. Davis is a good character, I liked him, but he isn't as memorable after the fact as Kara is.Killer Moves comes so close to being one of the best books I've read in quite awhile. While I can't tell you what made it drop a notch without giving away parts of the story, I can say that I really did enjoy Killer Moves and think you will too. The action and suspense will keep you turning each page of Killer Moves and waiting for the final culmination of events that is sure to knock your socks off.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When his mother loses her job, the family is forced to move into the city with grandma. Her house is tiny and crowded, and she keeps calling Rafe by the wrong name. Rafe is accepted into the prestigious Cathedral School of the Arts, and he makes his first \"real, live human friend\" since starting middle school. Things are looking up, but not for long. The trouble begins with a couple of bullies at school and continues when Rafe decides to embark on a mission to \"get a life.\" What ensues is a tale of things broken-families, water balloons, artwork, and trust. Bryan Kennedy perfectly voices Rafe, expertly navigating his ups and downs. Have the book available so students can peruse Laura Park's illustrations. This fast-paced tale of middle school mishaps and mayhem will appeal to reluctant readers and students who enjoyed Jeff Kinney's \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" series.-Lisa Hubler, Charles F.

But Truss’s fans may also enjoy dipping into this look at the ever-morphing English language. Burridge’s book developed from a series of short pieces she wrote for her down-under radio show, and it’s a delightful guide to the complexities and idiosyncrasies of the English language. The author’s own prose is graceful and easygoing as she explains why Eliza Doolittle said \"absobloominlutely\" and not \"abbloominsolutely\" and how irregularities in a language \"are typically relics of past regularity.\" Brief sidebars focus on particular illustrations of her subject, such as the 12th-century appearance of the pronoun \"she\" (which prevented English from having a gender-neutral third-person pronoun) and the mystery of the disappearing l (think of \"calm\" and \"walk\"). Anyone fascinated by the vagaries of English will enjoy taking a stroll in Burridge’s blooming linguistic garden.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I was not aware that I could self publish my Guide until I saw another author on a talk show and she self published her book with great success.  This gave me the spark that I needed to finally get my Guide out there for all to see.  The world has become so fast that we have lost sight of how important it is to reassure our loved ones how special they are and how much they mean to us.  I have been married for 36 years so a lot of the Romance Guides ideas and techniques have been tested and yes they do work we are still together.

It examines the intellectual milieu of the era, the specific problem of a war with Greece in 1914, the foreign policy imperatives, the reaction to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the formation of the alliance with Germany and, finally, the uneasy relations with Germany after the alliance was formed....This study gives historians a much needed corrective to the view that the Empire should only be seen as a puppet of Germany.\" -- Contemporary Review\"..well organized and well written volume is extensively researched...\" -Alexander M.

In the introduction to \"Loneliness in Philosophy, Psychology, and Literature\" he concludes that \"man is a social, a \"political\", that is to say, a communal animal,\" and on page 1 of his first chapter, he also writes that \"I believe that man has always and everywhere suffered from feelings of acute loneliness and that his entire existence is consumed by the struggle to escape his fate.\" Mijuskovic acknowledges further on in this opening chapter that \"the drive to avoid a sense of isolation, actually constitutes the dominant psychic force underlying all human consciousness and conduct.\" The author feels that Arthur Machen's \"The Hill of Dreams\" is the most frightening portrayal of loneliness and that Thomas Wolfe is the foremost novelist using the theme of loneliness. But the author states clearly that this is not the loneliness of the dreamer, the poet or the prophet, but that of every man.\"Loneliness in Philosophy, Psychology and Literature\" is a deep and extremely thoughtful work with excellent footnotes, references and appendices. This is not a work for the casual reader and is recommended for college and university library collections. Ben Lazare Mijuskovic is a scholar and a serious writer, and \"Loneliness in Philosophy, Psychology and Literature\" shows his seriousness and depth of knowledge. It is a brilliant work of research and its learned presence will be welcome wherever scholars are present.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lesser's light tenor is perfectly suited to the many roles (Parson Yorick, Doctor Slop, et al) who crowd Sterne's narrative. This translates into 15 CDs and about 19 hours of listening. Perfect for a wet summer. -- Robert McCrum, The Observer. This extraordinary novel - precursor of post-modernism by 250 years - would be an unwieldy beast in unabridged form: its 19 hours of whim and wit would be indigestible , if swallowed whole. But at a gentle pace it makes a lovely listen, as Anton Lesser brings characters and situations to life in infectiously unbuttoned style. Massive books like Sterne's don't fit modern lifestyles, but this massive audio-book may well fit in very well. -- Betty Tadman, The Scotsman As a general rule I go along with the advice that if a book doesn't grab you by the end of chapter 4, don't waste your time, there are plenty more. Yes, but not like Tristram Shandy. Nothing I've ever come across is like Sterne's extraordinary comic tour de force published 250 years ago which, I freely admit, I found pretty hard going a long way past chapter 4. And then, suddenly, I got it. Or at least I realised I was coming at it from the wrong direction. It isn't a novel. It has no plot. Chapters break off in mid-sentence because, advises the narrator, 'I would not give a groat for that man's knowledge in pen-craft who does not understand this: That the best plain narrative in the world, tacked very close to the last spirited apostrophe to my Uncle Toby, would have felt both cold and vapid upon the reader's palate; therefore I forthwith put an end to the chapter, though I was in the middle of my story.' And which story might that have been? The one about Uncle Toby's dalliance with the widow Wadman? Or his manservant Corporal Trim's tireless reconstructions of Flanders campaigns, complete with battering rams and catapults on the bowling green behind the vegetable garden? Or of Dr Slop, summoned to assist at the narrator's birth, being thrown from his horse and ... Enough. If you've ever sat spellbound listening to a witty, satirical, outrageous, digressive raconteur regaling you with endless stories about preposterous characters that lead nowhere but keep you hanging on every word, trust me - they learned their craft from Sterne. So did postmodernists such as James Joyce and Flann O'Brien. It is tailor-made for audio, as is Anton Lesser's reading - intelligent, humorous, charming. Dr Johnson admired the book enormously, but opined that 'nothing odd will do long'. For once he was wrong. Tristram Shandy is decidedly odd and extremely long, but it has stayed the course. -- Sue Arnold, The Guardian When I'm in London during the summer, I don't have the car. This is liberating to an extent, but does mean that I can't listen to Tristram Shandy. I bought the unabridged 15-CD set at the best possible place - Shandy Hall, Laurence Sterne's home at Coxwold, in Yorkshire. On visiting, I became uncomfortably aware that I'd never managed to get through any Sterne. Anton Lesser reads Tristram to perfection. By the time I'd driven back to Ramsgate the next day, I had heard 10 CDs, but what about the remainder? My ears are the wrong shape for an iPod; the little earphones fall out. I can't expect the family to share Sterne in the car. Besides, is he suitable for children? Eventually, they may take to him more quickly than me always going off at a tangent, with no obvious beginning, middle and end, Tristram should appeal to the internet generation. --Clive Aslet, Town Mouse Country Life", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's a recipe for conflict-and at a crucial moment for the future of the global economy -- Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group and author of 'The End of the Free Market' For anyone longing to make sense of tectonic, eco-political shifts occurring in the commodities market, Winner Takes All is a fascinating and important book. By focusing her razor-sharp mind on China's central role in the new commodities rush, Moyo sheds light on and makes sense of a profound and dramatic moment in our history. Her book is a must-read -- Peter Munk, Chairman and Founder, Barrick Gold Corporation [Praise for How The West Was Lost] Moyo is a very serious lady indeed -- Dominic Lawson The Times Moyo's diagnosis of the recent disasters in financial markets is succinct and sophisticated...I applaud her brave alarum -- Paul Collier The Observer", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Angular textural sketches, apparently rough drafts for an animated feature (many possess a Fantasia -like sensibility), are set against an overpowering black background that negates the tale's playfulness. Multiple frames on several pages make the (rather feeble) scenario difficult to follow, while the fabled, fearsome beast is here only silly--with its beaky, birdish head atop a caterpillary cover, it resembles a Chinese New Year parade's dragon or a Mardi Gras costume. When the victorious hero goes \"galumphing back\" with only the Jabberwock's head, youngsters may not realize that the weird animal is actually slain. Overall, this repackaging appears devoid of personality, and doesn't do justice to the comical original. These mome raths and mimsy borogroves deserve better.

I especially enjoyed the fact that the author portrays the woman as almost an equal in the story. Usually, the woman is the destitute one and the man is knight in shining armor. In this novel, both Claire and Christopher needed each other. It was also an interesting read because the historical event around which this story is centered is a true story. So this adds to the authenticity and excitement of the novel. For all historical fiction lovers, this story will surely capture your attention.

Mental health providers with basic expertise in CBT will easily be able to adapt this evidence-based group intervention to their own practice, making treatment more accessible and affordable.\"--Debra A. Hope, PhD, Department of Psychology, University of Nebraska-Lincoln\"A tremendous resource for mental health professionals. Drawing on the latest research showing that common processes cut across various disorders, this book provides an excellent framework for understanding and treating anxiety disorders. Each chapter is a delight to read and guides the reader with clear descriptions and clinical examples. The book is an invaluable training tool for graduate students; I look forward to adopting it for our clinical practica.\"--Lata K. McGinn, PhD, Director, Clinical Program and CBT Training Program, Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, Yeshiva University\"This book has sufficient detail for CBT beginners, yet the transdiagnostic perspective offers new insights even for readers with advanced skills. The book presents a fresh approach to case conceptualization rooted in the behavioral and cognitive elements maintaining irrational fears, rather than the specific content of the fear. Norton translates years of clinical research into an approach that is evidence based, efficient, and feasible in most practice settings. He incorporates traditional interventions (exposure, response prevention, and cognitive restructuring) as well as newer approaches, such as motivation enhancement and mindfulness. For each element of treatment, Norton provides a compelling rationale, structured guidance for the therapist, and frank discussion of common problems encountered.\"--Sheila R. Woody, PhD, Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia, Canada\"What if there were a treatment model that allowed you to apply one set of principles across all of the anxiety disorders?

THE ORIGINAL POCKET PATRIOT Robert Woods, born in the aftermath of The Great Depression was raised on a ranch in the mountains of Colorado. At seventeen, during the Korean Campaign, he enlisted in the Navy. After his service, he attended San Diego State, studied Speech Arts, and became an actor. First working in Hollywood and New York, he went on to Paris, performing leading roles for ‘The American Theater’s,’ repertory company. The god’s beamed. He was contracted to star in five internationally co-produced Westerns, going on to star in over fifty films, in a career that took him all over the World. After sixteen years abroad, Robert returned home, only to discover that the freedom he had known growing up, had degenerated into a soap opera of politically driven, self-serving, rhetorical ATM machines that defined Patriotism as domestic terrorism. With the collaboration of his trusted friend, Marco Fiorini, the original Pocket Patriot was born from their desire to reiterate the true meaning of self-government and return to the freedom of the Constitutional America of their youth… MARCO FIORINI... born, Maurizio in 1941 Rome. WW2 Italy. To the delight of his artist but fascist father, child Marco sitting on the lap of amused dictator Benito, ‘Il Duce’ Mussolini, often, to prove his patriotism and gain ‘gelato’, ‘sang’ him the Fascist National Anthem. His Canadian-born mother suffered these performances and the insanity of war with a ‘patriotic’ grin. When the allies bombed Rome’s central train station, Marco was left in a coma and his nanny dead. Three weeks later, returning to consciousness, Marco, ‘following his bliss’ went looking for Diogenes, and the proverbial ‘honest man.’ In thought, word and deed, he’s been at it ever since.

Samantha is trying to save it, but the new bank owner, Blake, refuses to grant them any more time on their loan. She and her sisters develop a chocolate festival for the small town to provide needed tourism and revenue. The most popular event features a Mr. Dreamy contest. Samantha tries to pull off the fast-approaching festival in spite of a closed road, red tape, and harassing creditors. She also tries to deny her attraction to Blake. In an interesting and realistic story line, her mother is trying to rally after the death of her husband, who had poor business sense. This is an engrossing story with strong characters and arcs similar to Debbie Macomber’s Cedar Cove titles. The light romance, delicious descriptions of chocolate, and recipes add to the flavor of Roberts’ promising new series. --Amy Alessio", "related": ["B006J14KKK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But very soon, my writer-self and my reader-self were in\nconflict. Writer-self wanted a series about the community mentioned above.\nReader-self wants to know what to expect when she opens a book. And so, I\ndivided the characters in Myrtle according to the genre of their tales.\nOrdinary Days in Myrtle Hill is romance. And Wren's nest is the beginning of a\nsuspenseful series, The Phoenix Connection.I think the next best thing to reading a good book is writing one. So I let my\ncharacters tell me their story and I enjoy sharing their experience as I write\nthe chapters. I plan to let them tell their stories, each in their own way. The\nmain characters share a strong faith and believe they are God's boots on the\nground. They sometimes call themselves earth angels. They simply mean that when\nthey are in the right place, at the right time, they are ready to serve. They\nare ordinary people until \"something\" makes them special. Sometimes\ntheir lives are filled with romance, sometimes mystery, and sometimes\nsuspense... but they're always God's boots on the ground.", "related": [], "rank": 683171, "title": "Wren's Nest (The Phoenix Connection Book 1)", "author": "Deanne Durrett", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.8333, "rating_total": 29.0}

Her second release 'Kickstart My Heart' followed. Both madcap memoirs were originally released through Penguin/Viking. Both were extremely well received. Lana has appeared on national breakfast television and she and her books have featured in Vogue, Cleo, Madison, Famous, Woman's Day, That's Life and numerous newspapers and radio shows. She appeared on stage as part of the Darren Hayes Big Night In tour throughout the UK, Ireland, Sydney and Thailand. She was also a guest speaker on four panels at the prestigious Byron Bay Writers' Festival.  With her stories being rife with musical references, a 'Kickstart My Heart' companion CD was released through Universal Music.  Today Lana can be found gazing through her window in between writing thought-provoking sentences and wishing that she had a cat.

In his second novel, Luvaas (The Seductions of Natalie Bach) skillfully peels away the layers of deception in the Tillotson family to reveal three generations of trauma and abuse. His exposure of the clan's painful history, seamlessly narrated from several points of view, begins with Jerri's attractive and astute sister Deborah noting that Jerri is drinking more than usual. The reasons are soon made clear. Not only is Jerri gradually becoming aware that her husband is unfaithful, but she fears that he is sexually abusing their 11-year-old daughter, Meena-a repetition of a nightmare from her own past that she has never escaped. Hoping for renewal, Don moves the family to California, but matters only deteriorate as he becomes sexually aggressive with Deborah, Jerri's drinking escalates and Meena's half-brother rapes her, seemingly pushing her over the edge of sanity. The children's digging of a huge tunnel in Oregon, their life over an earthquake fault in California and an obsession with the La Brea tar pits help conjure up a sense of a continuing downward spiral and an impending collapse. A surreal and frightening air prevails as guilt, aggression and madness escalate in this powerful evocation of family members coming to grips with their crimes against one another.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Three years of 100% business travel saved me from golf.” But her husband really wanted to play and Janelle knew he wouldn’t do it if it meant Saturdays of leaving her at home. “I bought new clubs just so Howard would, but I knew I needed a different approach.  Golf had to be fun.  Through trial and error, I developed the system presented in GoodShot! Golf.  Even while I was still a beginner, we played golf on great golf courses all over the country.  Golf became our joint passion, so a vacation in Pebble Beach seemed like a desirable – if huge -- expenditure to both of us.” Now Janelle is a solid bogey golfer with a handicap index in the mid-teens.  She decided to share want she had learned about learning to play golf with other women. “Golf is a great sport for women.  We just need to get over the hump of playing badly while learning.  If a woman falls in love with playing golf, she’ll master it.  GoodShot! Golf is intended to help women by showing them how to play like accomplished golfers until they become one.” For those who are concerned, Janelle does have a day job as an Oracle software developer.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Sports & Outdoors", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the spring of\n1923, Mr. and Mrs. Fred Noegel, Miss Pansy Deese and her dog named Dan made a trip from Georgia to California in a Model \"T\" Ford. Their story evokes images of covered wagons crossing the plains and mountains of\na still untamed land.The authors are to be commended for saving and putting together the letters and photographs produced\nby the three pioneers and sharing the story with a new generation.-- Chuck Thompson, Journalist,The Macon Telegraph The Auto Gypsiesis certainly one of the finest books on travel that I have ever read. This book is of special interest\nto me because of my work, which takes me to Asia, Africa and the Middle East. But the book is much more than a travelogue. It is the story of true America pioneer spirit and resolve.I was so taken by the brilliant writing of Miss Pansy Deese. I couldn't wait to turn each page\nand read of the glorious adventure and see the breath-taking landscapes so vividly displayed in the pictures. She was ready for any challenge, and in the history of women's liberation, surely there is a place for Miss Pansy\nDeese.--Ron Abney, Consultant,Republican Institute", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Even as a little girl I could not fathom anything more exciting than to draw and to invent stories, so it was pretty logical to imagine myself becoming a writer or a painter. But things went at first a different direction: I studied law, I met my husband at the Cote d'Azur and immigrated to France, obtained my master's degree in German, worked as a teacher for German and English at elementary school and later at the sales department of a publishing house.  Only in 2001, I returned to my first love, drawing/painting:  My mother in Germany knitted 'like a maniac 'for her little grandson Yann in France: Sweaters and socks galore. It was her idea to write the first story (The Beach Sweater) for him to accompany those sweaters. I illustrated it.  Thus the magical world of adventure about mema's sweaters developed, starring Yann himself.  The next stories my mother wrote, were \"The Unravel-Rams\" and \"The Rainy-Weather-Sweater\", then she passed on the task, to continue writing stories, to me. This lead to the creation of \"The Thunderstorm-Sweater\" and \"The Christmas-Sweater\" as part of the series \"Mema Knits Stories\".

At the age of twenty he talked himself into a job as an architectural assistant with a prestigious practice in London and spent the next seven years designing banks and partying in the city. By the age of twenty seven, the wander lust hit him and he headed off to Montego Bay in Jamaica, there he both ran a diving school and freelanced as an architect for hoteliers. For five years he managed to keep this up and himself narrowly out of trouble. Until after one too many close calls, he decided it was time to leave. He boarded a plane and headed for Singapore to visit a Singaporean girl he’d got to know.  Singapore or more pointedly the Singaporean girl managed to calm Nic down, somewhat, and for a dozen years he based himself out off Singapore working in various fields. He taught diving and escorted dive parties to remote locations throughout the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Indonesian archipelago. He designed the odd hotel or two in the Maldives and Thailand and expanded his photographic repertoire to become one of the foremost photographers in the region.

Ross draws on her experience as a busy lawyer, professional speaker, over-committed mother, and executive coach to teach others her time-tested and easy-to-implement strategies for handling difficult conversations at work and at home. Diane became involved in difficult conversation techniques when she noticed that the negotiating skills she had mastered in the courtroom - a.k.a the \"I'm right and you're wrong\" method - weren't working for the difficult conversations she encountered in everyday life. So began the long journey filled with Harvard training, exhaustive research, and lots of trial and error (with friends, family, and coworkers as unwitting guinea pigs). The results in Diane's own life were astounding: her work relationships improved, her family life became more harmonious, and communication became easier and more productive. Diane was so grateful to be effectively managing difficult conversations that she was anxious to share her strategies with the rest of the world so they could achieve similar results in their own lives. The concept for her first difficult conversations book, \"The Elephant in the Office: Super-Simple Strategies for Difficult Conversations at Work,\" was born. The book, available in print and digital versions, is the first in the Elephant Conversations(tm) Ltd. series. As an author, Diane A. Ross is witty and straightforward. She uses real-life examples, including many from her own life, to explain the process of having difficult conversations with as little anxiety and as much success as possible. Her accessible, no B.S. style and humorous approach are hallmarks of the Elephant Conversations(tm) brand. Hers are not boring textbooks, but fun, easy reads filled with practical strategies and simple solutions to the most common difficult conversation hurdles. When Diane isn't penning her next book, she is leading difficult conversation seminars to help others achieve the success she enjoys in her own life. She is also a busy wife and mom of two who lives with her family on beautiful Vancouver Island, Canada.", "related": ["B00BB7Z89Y"], "rank": 1107392, "title": "The Elephant in the Office", "author": "Diane A.

Whether an academic or a legislator, think tank or government staffer, if you care about turning good ideas into good policy, Andrew's book will guide you down the right path.\"—Barry Jackson, former Senior Advisor to President George W.

It should prove enormously helpful both to think tanks and to scholars who study these complex and increasingly visible organizations.\"—Don Abelson, The University of Western Ontario\"The policy world is filled with voices clamoring to be heard, but few organizations are consistently successful at getting the ear of policymakers and shaping the ideas that become part of public debate.

The second half collects everything else, including essays packed with right-wing (and anti-left-wing) rhetoric, advice for when Vikings are raiding you, hyper-paeans to the world's 20 manliest firearms, and a Viking advice column by Crazy Einar. Williamson cheerfully and sometimes grimly bounces among military expertise, humor, controlled anger, and the gruesome and sublime extremes of a soldier's world.

She sees herself as a woman who is determined at all cost to leave her stamp on this literary world, she is determined to make people give more of themselves to push past their comfort zone to leave the people thirsty for more. “Look out at the things that once moved you, recall the words you used to recite, ponder over the thoughts that once consumed you, allow yourself to release the pain that once held you frozen in place. Climb the mountains, move through clouds, and push aside the doubt, that my dear is what living and loving is all about. Can you recall when you were a child how you used to sit and stare, you had dreams, you knew that one day you would be there. Wife and mom, doctor, lawyer, rich man, poor man, all of those things that you would dream, you knew that they would come true, you grew, standing taller you opened the door and allowed doubt to walk through. LOOK at the things that once moved you, recall the words you used to recite, remember the dreams that set your soul and heart on fire. Reach higher, remove the clouds, and push aside that doubt. For my dear that is what living and loving is all about. Maybe he or she will hurt you, maybe you won’t succeed, maybe they will all laugh at you, maybe, maybe are just empty fears indeed. I challenge you to sing the songs that you used to love, to dream the dreams that used to ignite. Ignite the flame that you have allowed to burn low, get up, rise from there, move the clouds aside, climb the mountains.

Writing has always been a hobby and a passion of mine from a very young age; I can recall writing a novel on my first family computer which was inspired (as well as a being blatant rip-off!) of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone. It was really this book; the first full novel I had ever read by myself, that inspired me to write for myself and to create worlds beyond our own and fictions that can redefine the past or give suppositions about the future. I would list J.K. Rowling as one of my top inspirations, as well as the likes of Anthony Horowitz, Ian Banks, Charlaine Harris and Suzanne Collins. I also draw inspiration from T.V. shows and scriptwriters, such as Joss Whedon, J.J. Abram, Maurissa Tancheroen, Steven Moffat and Jane Espenson.

As a mediocre high school student, he excelled in athletics with later inductions into the high school and college football halls of fame.

Then drafted into the Korean War, he served as a field counselor for traumatized combat soldiers and as a football coach. When discharged, his work with the emotionally troubled guided him away from a sports career to a MS degree in psychology. In his spare time, however, he enjoyed competitive skiing, ski patrol, ocean sailing, and national race car driving--for over 20 years.      After a decade in the criminal justice system as parole agent, probation officer, and psychologist in several maximum security prisons, Dr. Wonderling obtained his PhD in clinical psychology and a private practice with drunks, junkies, and a wide variety of mentally disturbed social rejects in the rough San Francisco Tenderloin.      He also worked as a Peace Corps consultant psychologist for fifteen years, with assignments throughout the world including Afghanistan, Swaziland, Ghana, Morocco, and both Central and South America. In addition to assisting troubled volunteers, he gained an international reputation as a cross cultural speaker and a human relations program developer.      He is a critically acclaimed author with seven published books since his retirement, a columnist for a local Prescott, Arizona magazine for over five years, and has written numerous professional articles.       In his 80's, Dr. Wonderling leads an exceptionally healthy, active life, with a continued concern for helping the disadvantaged, while enjoying each day.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

We were about to head out on a road trip to Florida and my parents allowed me to choose a new book for the ride. I chose a book called The College Names of the Games by Mike Lessiter. I still have this book. The book described how every college in NCAA Division 1 came to have their nickname. I have loved nicknames ever since.Tocsinagon: Follow The Footsteps and Black Lions: Walk With Pride were born from this fascination with nicknames. I came up with the name Black Lions early on in the writing process for Tocsinagon. It wasn't until I had finished the final draft for Tocsinagon that I decided to search the internet for Black Lions. I was curious to see if there were other Black Lions and, if so, what or who they were. Ethiopian lions are known for their black manes. When I typed \"black lions\" into a search engine, I stumbled across some articles about three lions in Ethiopia who protected a girl from kidnapping. Apparently, she was kidnapped to be forced into a marriage, but the lions came out of the jungle and attacked her kidnappers. The lions guarded the girl until the villagers came for her and then they receded into the jungle.Some have said the lions protected her because her crying sounded like a lion cub. Others have said that the lions actually intended to eat the girl but were interrupted by the villagers. I like to think that they were purely protecting her and their appearance was more than just serendipitous. The cover design and three characters in the story are subtle tributes to those lions and their good deed. If you're curious, simply type \"Ethiopian lions save girl\" in any search engine.My interest in nicknames and this fascinating news story came together as I wrote Black Lions: Walk With Pride.", "related": ["B006CCXS6S"], "rank": 2858132, "title": "Black Lions", "author": "Joshua P Strychalski", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I forget his name.  Having written Packing for FEMA Camp and the political espionage thriller \"The DawnFire Saga\" Moore is currently hiding in the hills.  Based on the economic theory in Packing for FEMA Camp, the DawnFire Saga tells the story of Chance Kiernan.  The U.S. Army trained him as an assassin. His women taught him the dangers of a world painted gray. Now he's our only hope for a new beginning. In a world filled with terror, can freedom be regained? Follow Chance Kiernan, from Delta Force to renegade patriot, in the DawnFire Saga by F.T. Moore. Read The Tempest Illusion:  Book One in the DawnFire Saga. When Chance Kiernan, assassin for hire, meets a young business woman on her first international assignment, the hard shell he constructed to save his own soul cracks. Katie Black is accused of spying, but when this hard- line soldier comes for her, she shows him a world of nuance where life and values are not black and white.  The soldier pulls the lady out of the fire, but her fierce independence pushes both of them over the ledge. When Kiernan and Black get together, the gray areas of spy-vs-mercenary explode into a penetrating landscape of breadth and color.  But tragedy seeks-and-destroys Kiernan’s new world-view like a predator drone.  His failure to stop Bockenheim's plot sets off a cascade of events which collapse the world's economy. Martial law is declared in America, and the starving citizens line up to ride buses to FEMA refugee camps. As the citizens of the world respond to the chain of disasters triggered by Bockenheim's plan, it is up to Arceneaux and Chance Kiernan together to renew the world order.  But can their ragged band of patriots, living a primitive life in the back woods, overcome the forces of corruption and greed that have overtaken the American government?  Can these two male and female former assassins bring a new dawn to the beleaguered and imprisoned citizens of the USA, and reignite the fire of American democracy? Covering thirty years of American life and global commerce, the DawnFire Saga turns conspiracy theory on its head.  A story that will change your outlook on America, and chill you to the marrow of your bone.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Here's whatKirkus Reviewshas to say about this\nbook: The book opens after the\nfamous events ofA Christmas Carol.\nEbenezer Scrooge - now aged 50 - has woken after a night of vivid and\nunpleasant dreams. Despite his wealth, Scrooge is still a miser, but he's\nbeginning to have regrets about his life. He doesn't want to die as Marley did\n- 'There are few things more depressing than a funeral in an empty church' -\nand he can't take his money with him when he dies, but how is he to spend it? With the help of his faithful\nclerk Cratchit, Scrooge sets up a charitable trust to provide education,\nhospitals, refuges for the homeless and assistance to the poor. With the\nattractive young Sasha and the handsome widow of Pewsey, Mrs Kincaid, to guide\nhim along unfamiliar paths, Scrooge finally decides that life in the country\nsuits him better in his later years. He discovers village life is\nfull of surprises. The monthly sewing circle organised by Mrs Kincaid is a\ncover for something very different, and she introduces him to 'the rites of the\nold religion', the eight festivals in the calendar year related to the movement\nof the sun and the fertility of the land. This book is for anyone who\nwondered whatever became of Scrooge. Despite its Dickensian flavour the book is\nwritten in a modern, robust style with wit and panache. An unusual and\nentertaining read.", "related": ["B00DCKW16G"], "rank": 2418045, "title": "What did Scrooge do next?

After retiring as Hong Kong's last expatriate Government Chemist, David and his wife, the children's book author and illustrator Gail Clarke, moved to Tuscany where David embarked on a course of study and work experience in art restoration. David and his wife now share their time between Tuscany and Thailand, with regular trips to Hong Kong, UK, Kenya and New York to visit their widely-spaced offspring and grandchildren. In writing the Rare Traits Trilogy - to date comprising two parts: Rare Traits & Delusional Traits - David has drawn on his extensive forensic science background, the fascinating world of Renaissance art and art restoration and his travels to many parts of the globe.

But few organizations know how to move effectively toward it, often finding themselves adrift. The authors describe seven major companies and what it took to achieve a market-focused reinvention, all captured in an illuminating four-stage process. Based on thorough research, Resurgence offers valuable insights into an increasingly important management challenge.” —Philip Kotler, S. C. Johnson & Son Professor of International Marketing, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University“Change is the only constant. Disruptions of business models that used to take decades now take a few years or even months. In  response, companies must disrupt themselves before the competition does in order survive and thrive. The Four Stages of Market-Focused Reinvention provides a smart and simple framework for companies to navigate the need for constant change.” —Jonathan D. Becher, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, SAP“A topical manifesto on turning around troubled businesses. With lively case studies on companies like Alberto-Culver, Harley Davidson, and Motorola, authors Carpenter, Gebhardt and Sherry speak to the urgency of reinventing a company not just by following the right steps but by following them in the right order. A highly readable blend of scholarly ethnography and how-to prescriptions.” —Rohit Deshpande, Sebastian S. Kresge Professor of Marketing, Harvard Business School“A gem of a book.  It’s a thought provoking managerial book that is rigorous as well as pragmatic. Steeped in several years of field research this book distils unique insights and a pragmatic step by step approach for businesses that are in need to reinvent themselves. Easily accessible, a joy to read and practically useful.” —Marcel Corstjens, Unilever Chaired Professor of Marketing, INSEAD“Resurgenceis a unique combination of academic rigor and practical advice. The case studies and Reinvention Model clearly communicate the importance of leaders building a collaborative, results-oriented culture to seize marketplace opportunity.” —Mary Dillon, CEO, Ulta Beauty“For many businesses, it may seem like the world is moving faster than ever.  Markets shift, competitors emerge and customer expectations rise, seemingly overnight.  Yet organizations often fail to respond with speed, ending up adrift and in need of massive change just to survive.  If success and history are the enemies of innovation,  the practical actions mapped out in Resurgence offer a relevant and timely approach to confront the conditions that lead to stagnation.  This book offers a refreshingly clear-eyed view of the challenges of sustaining change  – and offers a straight-forward approach to reinvention that is relevant whether your organization is striving to reignite growth or just trying to stay ahead of the change happening all around you.”—Lou Sanchez, Vice President, Leadership & Organization Development, eBay Inc.“Resurgenceprovides a formula for successfully transforming your organization into a customer-driven organization. Employing a unique, ethnographic research approach, the authors discover that the secret sauce is in the sequence of initiatives and confirm that organizational health and culture play a critical role.\"—Betsy D Holden, Former Co-CEO, Kraft Foods", "related": [], "rank": 1232159, "title": "Resurgence", "author": "Gregory S.

And how would such a place have come to be?When beginning The Mazer, I had no such profound thoughts running through my mind. Instead, I had a glorious vision of a beautiful island growing out of the sea. A small place; one large town; few roads to speak of. But rivers fast and blue, fields of yellow and green, forests of darkness and depth, and coastlines of silvery gray.Populating my little island brought a few surprises. The citizens of Southernwood, for example, are a practical lot. They've never wondered, as you or I might, why a tree should go out of its way to compose a poem or two now and again. They would certainly never think twice about idly scribbling on a leaf with a treequill, or researching their family history on the leaves in the Albatorium library, where Marchus, the archivist, would leap out of a dusty corner to help out if need be. In other ways, our islanders are very much like us, for I know nobody who would refuse an invitation to the Albatorium halls to sample some the delicacies of Winifred's kitchen!An island and its people. And their story? Yes, this was the most fascinating part of writing - asking myself questions, pinning down reasons and motives, weaving the past into the \"now\" of the tale, slowly but surely understanding more about the world I was creating. It's been an incredible adventure, but that adventure is only mine. The fruit of that adventure, however -  the story of The Mazer - belongs to you.", "related": ["B00E3ERICC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
