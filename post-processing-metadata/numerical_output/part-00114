To find the\n'right' heroine for him, we needed to invent a very special young woman...or so\nwe thought.In our earliest conversations about\nMaria, we decided she should be of royal blood. For story purposes, she needed\nto be born in a certain year. She would be a princess who had been a cog in the\n'marital diplomacy' of a royalty court. Married off to a foreign king who has\ndied, she has been left a young widow. We decided that her family would be\nready to marry her off again, but that she has grown tired of being used as a pawn\nin such politics.So we thought of Charles, Emperor\nof the Holy Roman Empire. We knew that he had forged alliances with other\nmonarchs through such means, so we opened the history books.And there she was. Maria, Queen of\nHungary. Younger sister of the emperor. Married off as a child. Her much older\nhusband killed in battle. Her brother entering into negotiations to use her\nagain for his own political purposes, a plan that does not succeed.We'd found her. She was waiting to\nhave her story told. And she comes to life as the Queen of Hearts to our own\nJack of Hearts!We hope you enjoyedThe Beauty of the Mist. In the epilogue\nof the novel, we mention Jaime, the secret lovechild of Mary Boleyn and Henry\nVIII. Introduced inHeart of Gold,\nshe was spirited away to the Highlands and raised by the Macphersons. In our\nnext novel,The Intended,Jaime\nbecomes the heroine of her own story. Stranded at the glittering palace of the\nEnglish Duke of Norfolk, she finds herself caught up in the cutthroat perils of\ncourt intrigue at its most dangerous!As we've mentioned before, we are\ncurrently writing a trilogy of novels that begins with our RITA™ finalist,Tess and the Highlander.That series\nwill follow the adventures of the next generation of Macpherson heroes.Tessis available now; for the\nothers...stay tuned.Nikoo & Jim", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What a privilege it will be for me to witness their hearts open up as they receive God s gifts and experience the joy of being who God created them to be.Terry Patersonbr Human ResourceElk Grove, CA --Happy --Happy CustomerThis book is incredible. It opens up the mind to many things unknown or often ignored. Trust me. I ve done it many times myself. I feel as if God is speaking and it s time for everyone to listen. If you don t know God, this is also the path to meeting Him. We are all connected. And, through our gifts, we can help each other in so many ways. It is part of God s plan for our happiness, if we just take hold of it. I ve ignored this message before and was left feeling incomplete by taking a different path. I prayed and this book, in many ways, is my answer from God. It s not just an answer for me, but for many others, too. The message I got from this book: Listen and pay attention to the book. The book says, Do what you love to do. And, Make others happy doing what you love to do. Let no one stop you from showing or sharing your God-given gift(s). There are many obstacles in life that we face and God is always our answer. Seek and you will find. In finding your gift, as it says in the book, give to others, and know that is our place in this world. In filling up the lives of others, we will receive so much more in return.Misty (Singer)br Elk Grove, CA --Happy CustomerThe Gift Table is an incredible and amazing book. This book is filled with helpful advice, encouraging you to recognize your gift by giving steps to achieve self-worth. While reading and interacting with the text (writing in the journals between chapters), I began to feel a message from God. The message, Get it together Devone. I began to realize that all I ever wanted to be was an actress .Acting has led me to experiences with script writing, working with film equipment, hair, and make-up, which are all derived from my acting talent. I didn t realize how connected my talents were, until I read The Gift Table, which gave me my conclusion I need to act .Reading this book, put me back on track with my gift, but also with God. I believe this book was given to me for a self-confidence boost. The Gift Table allowed me to look at myself internally and examine things that I need to change to be successful in life (also my gift).

Mistrustful when mysterious, smooth-talking businessman Mr. Aladdin asks him to locate a missing lamp, Mr. Pigg is strong-armed into accepting the case. A madcap adventure ensues, drawing in allusions to fairy tales on nearly every page, from Mr. Pigg’s nimble assistant, Jack Horner, to the geographical setting of Grimmtown. Burke seems to be shooting for the tone of 1940s detective stories in Mr. Pigg’s first-person voice (“that Red Riding Dame”), but one reference to Mr. Aladdin as “an oriental gentleman” feels jarringly unnecessary, particularly given that children will most likely not have the genre familiarity to put such an outdated, derogatory term in context. With discussion and explanation, though, this high-energy caper could make a useful addition to fractured-fairy-tale units. Pair this with titles in Michael Buckley’s The Sisters Grimm series and Bruce Hale’s Chet Gecko books.

While pop-science terms such as \"metabo-meals\" (fruits and cereals) and \"thermal walks\" (walks after meals) betray promotional zest, in general tone and content have integrity. Well organized and deftly written to reach and hold the reader's interest, Miller's guide includes a brief education in the role of metabolism in diet; a useful question-and-answer section; a clearly defined menu and exercise schedule; and a hefty selection of simple and varied recipes.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Carr, the remarkable man who laid the solid foundation of modern professional football from 1922 to 1937. Described by Willis as \"the Henry Ford of the NFL,\" Carr, a tireless visionary, rose from his modest Irish upbringing to create one of the first traveling football teams, the Columbus Panhandles, in the early part of the last century and guided the new professional football league, the American Professional Football Association, in 1921. With complete access to Carr's family and associates, the author performs a workmanlike recounting of Carr as the diligent, straight-shooting president of the NFL, overseeing many of the achievements we take for granted today: standard player's contracts, rules for college recruitment, professional football regulations, players' statistics, creation of two NFL divisions, the NFL draft, and the championship game.

Insp. Ted Stratton falls short of the high standard set by its predecessor, The Innocent Spy, which won the CWA Ellis Peters Historical Award. When Stratton looks into the suspicious death of Dr. Reynolds, whose fatal head wounds might have resulted from foul play or a falling bomb, the inspector discovers that Reynolds may have been fooling around with the nurses at his hospital, and that the physician may have been negligent in the handling of several patients who ended up dying. Wilson alternates between Stratton's perspective and that of a psychopath who infiltrates the staff of Reynolds's hospital by posing as a doctor, James Dacre, despite the absence of any medical training. Dacre manages to avoid being found out for an unrealistic length of time, but that improbability is dwarfed by the over-the-top ending that vitiates almost all the emotional force of the novel's opening.

In a sense, my writing is autobiographical, as it reflects my own gratifying, but at times, difficult journey of emotional and spiritual recovery.On the long road of my journey, I slowly learned that, even when I don't have answers, I must strive to find forgiveness and self-worth and to connect to the good in the world.

A man driving a black Mercedes convertible was in traffic next to me, and on his Massachusetts license plate were his initials plus MD. I wondered where the handsome doctor could be going. The Fall is my answer to that question. As I developed the character of Ted, a pediatric oncologist, I realized I needed some day-in-the-life details to make his character more authentic. During an Internet search, I discovered a blog by Dr. Samuel Blackman, at the time a pediatric oncologist at Children's Hospital Boston. The similarities between Sam's story and the back story I had already given Ted were startling, to say the least. Sam generously allowed me to borrow anecdotes from his blog that added so much to this story. For that as well as his friendship and support, I'm truly grateful.Thank you Christina Camara, Julie Cupp, Paula Del Bonis-Platt and Lisa Ridder, who read the early drafts and provided invaluable feedback. Alyson Hackett and Ronlyn Howe read the most recent version, and I thank them for the excellent insight that made The Fall a better book.To all the readers who have made my author journey so rewarding, I'm eternally indebted to you. Your friendship has been one of the great gifts in my life.To Dan, Emily, Jake, Brandy, and Dad, I love you best of all.xoxoMarie", "related": ["B00IJI2RH4"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 47, "rating_average": 4.4468, "rating_total": 209.0}

The ending was a bit unexpected, but is a very happy one indeed. I will read this book again and urge you to get the book for yourself. 4 Cups!\" Coffee Time Romance", "related": ["B00CUQR7RG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Nearly 20 years later, Gerrold has reworked it for his own sf series chronicling the adventures of the starshipStar Wolf. Ship's commander Jon Korie serves under Captain Parsons (Star Wolfcaptains tend to meet ill fates), whom he likes and respects. WhenStar Wolfstumbles across the starshipNorway,apparently adrift on a collision course with a star, Korie takes a team to investigate and search for survivors. What they find are blood worms, parasites so deadly that, according to Alliance law, infected ships are to be destroyed. Parsons isn't willing to give up on the crew, even if it means risking her command. An exciting space adventure with a poignant metaphor at its core.

His parents however would see to it that their kids attended public school so that they would not feel they were better than the other children.  As a boy, jay was particularly neat.  He always had things planned out, or a schedule to stay fit, but never let those qualities interfere with his  over active imagination.  He started writing at the age of ten.  Tall tales he would construct from movies he would see or stories he would hear from his father.  As he grew into a teenager his family settled quaintly into southern middle class, and his father's work abroad would have them move many times among the South East United States.  This gypsy like attribute to his teen years colored him culturally, as he was forced to change high schools more than 4 times. At 17 his interest in school work had dimiinshed completely and he was already a budding entrepeneur.  Getting his G.E.D. and serving in the U.S. Navy along side BuDS class 243 was but one adventure of his youth.  Constantly he  stayed engulfed in the art ninjutsu and practical Earth magics. Tinkering in phoilosopshy and religion, and finding adequate similarities across the globe, though gaping distances separated their past, he became intrigued in connecting these strange occurences.  His writting career, especially his earliest works, reflects this in every sense.  From works on martial arts to joke books, he genuinely longs to bring humanity into harmony on the planet, and see in his lifetime the world speaking with a single voice of praise and love.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Michael Willard has had a varied career as a newsman, political and policy advisor to U.S. Senators, senior public relations and advertising counselor, author, publisher and entrepreneur.  Before becoming a founding partner of The Willard Group, he was managing director and market leader of Burson-Marsteller's operations in Russia and Ukraine, supervising services in public relations, research, governmental relations, special events and advertising.  Willard has worked in Eastern Europe for more than 15 years. In 1998 he purchased the Kyiv office of Burson-Marsteller and formed The Willard Group Companies. In 2001, the company opened a Moscow office and in 2005 an Istanbul office.  Willard launched B-M's first commercial operation in Ukraine in 1996 and in 1997 helped lead the Russian B-M team to a successful transition from government-funded projects to commercial work.  First coming to the former Soviet Union in 1994, Willard led B-M's largest government funded project in the region, the Ukraine Market Reform Education Program.  During this period, Willard provided counsel to the Bosnian government in Sarajevo on issues not resolved in the Dayton Peace Accords, working directly with the Prime Minister. Today Willard serves as a policy advisor to several Central and East European governments.  Prior to joining B-M, Willard was president and owner of Willard & Associates for nearly a decade before selling the advertising/public relations agency to his employees.  Willard was director of U.S. Sen. Robert Byrd's Democratic Leader's office when Byrd held that position, also serving in the capacity of communications, foreign affairs and domestic policy advisor for seven years.  Wanting to open a business in West Virginia, Willard first returned to the state as Communications Director for then Gov. John D.Rockefeller IV. Willard served as a political advisor to Rockefeller in his successful bid to win a U.S. Senate seat.  A native of Vidalia, Georgia, Willard calls Charleston, West Virginia his home. He is a graduate of the University of Florida with a degree in advertising and marketing and is a former member of the board of directors of the European Business Association.  Willard is publisher and a columnist for Willard Marketing Monthly, a magazine launched in August, 2009.

Albrecht (1894-1985), a descendant of seventeenth-century English Puritans, Nantucket Quakers, and Dutch settlers on Long Island, began working as assistant children’s librarian at the Westfield Athenaeum in Westfield, Massachusetts, in 1927, and was the first curator of its Edwin Smith Historical Museum, serving from 1928 to 1952. The museum’s Colonial Kitchen is now named after her. The Albrechts lived for many years in Westfield, where Mrs. Albrecht became interested in the town’s three centuries of history. It was to teach history that she first started writing short stories for children set among the real people and places of western Massachusetts and created the story of fictional antique doll Deborah. The stories she wrote about Deborah’s adventures in Westfield’s history eventually became the full-length children’s book Deborah Remembers. Publishers at first turned down a book about a doll’s memoirs, but encouraged Mrs. Albrecht to write more historical children’s stories. She then wrote Hannah’s Hessian, which appeared in 1958 and was an immediate success; soon her publisher was eager to publish Deborah Remembers, which has since become the best-known of her books. Deborah was followed by three more stories set in Westfield and western Massachusetts in the colonial and Revolutionary eras. Mrs. Albrecht’s granddaughter, historical author Susanne Alleyn,  is delighted to bring Lillie V. Albrecht’s books, with additional annotations and background, to a new generation of young readers. Susanne Alleyn (editor & notes) is the author of _A Far Better Rest_, a retelling of Charles Dickens’ classic novel A Tale of Two Cities; the Aristide Ravel historical mystery series, set in Paris during the French Revolution; the nonfiction _Medieval Underpants and Other Blunders: A Writer’s (and Editor’s) Guide to Keeping Historical Fiction Free of Common Anachronisms, Errors, and Myths_; and _The Executioner's Heir: A Novel of Eighteenth-Century France_.

The collateral damage piles up while Eve, who's moved from London to her father's flat in Norwich, struggles to unravel the myriad skeins that tangle her life: her brother's real role in the robbery he was sentenced for; the meaning of her father's death; the handsome policeman wooing her; the packages she's guarding for the con protecting her brother and the mysterious item that someone named Joe thinks she is hiding.

In keeping with the textbook character of their book, they also cite many examples. The book is an integrated textbook of DMths, adequate for undergraduate computer scientists, featuring a synoptic and vital presentation of this important, useful and interesting field. Of course, it is also interesting and useful for students of mathematics, as well as for those who work with informatics in general. It is a classic textbook, well structured and sufficiently complete within the framework established by similar textbooks. The work does a good job keeping a balance between conciseness and in-depth examinations … .—Contemporary Physics, Vol. 52, No. 2, March-April 2011This is a textbook on discrete mathematics for undergraduate students in computer science and mathematics. The choice of the topics covered in this text is largely suggested by the needs of computer science. It contains chapters on set theory, logic, algebra (matrix algebra and Boolean algebra), and graph theory with applications. … The style of exposition is very clear, step by step and the level is well adapted to undergraduates in computer science. The treatment is mathematically rigorous; therefore it is also suitable for mathematics students. Besides the theory there are many concrete examples and exercises (with solutions!) to develop the routine of the student. So I can recommend warmly this book as a textbook for a course. It looks very attractive and has a nice typography. … Although I haven’t used this book in class (up to now), I think it is an excellent textbook.—H.G.J. Pijls, University of Amsterdam, The NetherlandsPraise for Previous EditionsGarnier and Taylor offer a work on discrete mathematics sufficiently comprehensive to be used as a resource work in a variety of courses … Now in its second edition, it would also make an excellent general reference book on these areas … a fine undergraduate book.—R.L. Pour, Emory & Henry College,CHOICEProvides an accessible introduction to discrete mathematics, including the core mathematics requirements for undergraduate computer science students.—SciTech Book News, Vol. 122This is the second edition of this accessible yet rigorous introduction to discrete mathematics. As in the first edition, the theory is illustrated by a large number of solved exercises. In this edition further exercises have been added, in particular, at the routine level. In addition, some new material on typed set theory is included.—S. TeschlThe book is designed for students of computer science. It contains main mathematical topics needed in their undergraduate study. In the second edition, the authors added a lot of new exercises and examples, illustrating discussed concepts. The book contains a lot of well-ordered and nicely illustrated material.—Vladimir Soucek,European Mathematical Society Newsletter, June 2004", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Computers & Technology", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Aryanne’s central and compelling proposition is that each internal or external supplier must be accountable for finding solutions and building long-term, productive relationships with their clients even when faced with seemingly unreasonable behaviours and demands from them. Her approach is to work through a number of scenarios to set the scene around different types of problem, and then to suggest ways to apply the learning to the reader’s own environment. This is a practical book which acts as a guide to handling challenging customer relationships.

As a pastor of many years experience he brings the subject to his readers with vivacity, illustration, and attention to theological accuracy. It will show us what our churches today need and yet not do so by glamorizing the past. It deserves to be widely read. --Maurice Roberts, emeritus pastor in the Free Church of Scotland (Continuing)Jonathan Edwards rightly believed that the Father's great gift to the Church is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of His beloved Son. How sad then that many sectors of professing Christianity failed to understand Him in the past century: liberals because they no longer believed the truth about God; Pentecostals and charismatics because they forgot that the coming of the Spirit ever sheds light in the mind; and evangelicals and reformed believers because they feared to be accused of fanaticism. For a variety of reasons, this situation with regards to evangelical and Reformed Christians is changing for the better and that partly because of solid biblical reflection on the blessed Holy Spirit like this new work by the Welsh pastor Geoff Thomas. Pastor Thomas comes from a tradition that has always honored the Spirit and longed for His power. Pastor Thomas, though, is also deeply rooted in biblical truth and rightly wary of experience that is not infrangibly tied to the Bible, which, it goes without saying, is the creation of the Spirit Himself. I hope this important meditation on the Spirit gets a wide hearing, for there is much biblical wisdom here. --Michael A. G.

My wife is, and always has been my best friend, and the one person in the world I trust the most. Aww, I hear you say, and I guess you’re right. Life is hard, and having a life-long friend to share it with does make it much easier. I’m a young granddad, which is great fun. I absolutely adore children. So much so, that I worked as a volunteer for about six years helping to run the Stevenage 17th Brownie pack. I’m still a member of the Girl Guiding Association, though not an active member at any more. Kids are cool. They can teach us adults so much if only we would take the time to listen to them. Working with children is what inspired me to start writing in the first place. Kids books obviously. I haven’t always been a writer. I spent most of my life working in the building trade as a carpenter. I actually wrote most of my first fantasy series, Truth Teller, whilst at work at the side of the road in a builder’s van. It was the only place I could get piece and quiet from my crazy household.

Pilgrim es un escritor nacido en Málaga en el verano del 81. Desde su infancia demostró un creciente interés en la literatura y que su imaginación sólo tenía los límites que él ponía. Con 14 años de edad terminó un relato policial llamado Uno contra todos, de cerca de 20 páginas. Ese fue su primer paso en la satisfactoria y emocionante singladura literaria. En los años siguientes, si bien inició varias historias (como la segunda parte de Uno contra todos), todas quedaron inconclusas. En los primeros días de 2005 empezó a bosquejar la historia de (lo que posteriormente se convertiría) Las Crónicas del Leon: El Reino de los Veintisiete Hombres. Pero ésta no tuvo el honor de ser la primera novela. Ese honor recaería en La Carpeta Negra. En Junio de 2006, terminó con la escritura de La Carpeta Negra. En consecuencia, la escritura de Las Crónicas del León comenzó. Finalmente, el día 9 del mes 9 del año 9 del segundo milenio, se terminó su concepción y revisión. Un año después llega su último trabajo hasta la fecha: Mi Pequeño Y Sucio Secreto. Una novela polémica que narra una hermosa historia de amor entre una prometedora vedette y un estudiante de dirección cinematográfica. Primera incursión en un libro donde prima la trama romántica sobre otras. Actualmente, H.J Pilgrim cuenta con un amplio banco de ideas que va creciendo conforme pasa el tiempo. Sus siguientes trabajos planeados son: ciencia ficción, misterio, aventuras, fantasía y la continuación de La Carpeta Negra. En la vida real, H.J. Pilgrim se desempeña como Team Lead de SAP FI en una multinacional norteamericana líder en consultoría IT. Amante de los animales, tiene una caniche toy llamada Layla (o la histería y locura hechas perra). Adicto a la lectura, el cine, las series de TV y los videojuegos, no encuentra tiempo para convivir con su pareja, la escritura, el trabajo... es que 24 horas son muy pocas horas al día. También es un esporádico deportista, practicó karate (dueño del peligroso cinturón amarillo pollo), Iaido, natación y amante del fútbol. Si bien es del Málaga C.F., expresa un amor no correspondido con el Real Madrid C.F.

The sheer heft of it, along with the sturdy slipcover; the fine, coated stock; and an unusually intoxicating new-book smell, commanded attention. And when a trailer truck packed with 1,300 copies was hijacked during a cross-country run, I was secretly thrilled that discerning thieves had thought40worthy of a heist—and that the book would soon be showing up on the street at people's prices.No such luck. The unloaded truck was eventually located on an interstate off-ramp, presumably abandoned in disgust. I've tried to imagine the reaction of the hijackers' supervisor when he broke into the trailer and discovered 13,000 pounds ofDoonesburywhere palettes of hi-def TVs should have been. Let us hope no one was hurt; it was an honest mistake.Still, after all that excitement, you'd think that the digital reimagining of40would be a letdown. Not so; we can now invite more people to the party. I've come to appreciate that many readers prefer to forego the risk of herniation while picking up a book—no matter that the risk is slight if you push up from your knees and have someone spot you. There was also the problem of where to display the book once consumed, as standard bookshelves could not accommodate it. We briefly considered shrink-wrapping it with four attachable legs, but then worried it might bump us into Amazon's Home and Kitchen category.Clearly the answer lay in rendering the collection in ones and zeros. And to further facilitate the reader experience, we divided the book into four easy pieces—each covering a full decade's worth of strips. Everyone has a favorite decade, although let's face it, it's never the '70s. Especially in my case. Not to wave the reader off, but my opening decade was filled with the uncertain stops and starts of a rank amateur learning his craft in full public view. I was wildly unready, but as the syndicate salesmen assured me, that was the point. The young had hijacked the culture, and with that standing, our voices—raw, impassioned, ungovernable—were in high demand.Besides, all journeys need a beginning, and the early wheel-spinning is part of the fun. To paraphrase the Dead, it's been a long, strange strip, and40comprises the long of it, it ought to retain the strange as well.", "related": [], "rank": 624637, "title": "40: A Doonesbury Retrospective, 1970 to 1979", "author": "G.B.

Inspired by this mission and the role of the town common, a public gathering place for the display and exchange of ideas, The Common seeks to recapture an old idea. The Common publishes fiction, essays, poetry, documentary vignettes, and images that embody particular times and places both real and imagined; from deserts to teeming ports; from Winnipeg to Beijing; from Earth to the Moon: literature and art powerful enough to reach from there to here. In short, we seek a modern sense of place. Used for decades to describe the tangible local environments and rootedness in works by authors like Faulkner, Frost, and Welty, the idea of a sense of place has fallen out of fashion. Some may think the notion of place outdated or unimportant given our globally mobile populations and technology-driven careers. But these characteristics mean that sense of place is more important now than ever. In our hectic and sometimes alienating world, themes of place provoke us to reflect on our situations and both comfort and fascinate us. Sense of place is not provincial nor old fashioned. It is a characteristic of great literature from all ages around the world. It is, simply, the feeling of being transported, of \"being there.\" The Common aims to renew and reenergize our literary and artistic sense of place. The Common is published in print biannually from Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts. Ours is a small community with far-reaching ideas. We're a place of farmers, professors, immigrants, liberals, conservatives, dairy cows, tobacco plants, strip malls, and Victorian and Brutalist architecture. We have a rich literary history and support a vibrant diversity of artists and authors. The Common fosters regional creative spirit while stitching together a national and international community through publishing literature and art from around the world, bringing readers into a common space.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They address many of my concerns with existing texts by providing instructors with a great deal of leeway in designing a syllabus. Each case study is written by a prominent scholar or rising comparativist and is nicely linked to the thematic survey. This would allow me the flexibility of using a different survey text or no survey text at all.”—Emmanuel Teitelbaum, George Washington University “I have looked at many comparative politics textbooks and none of them have appealed to me the way that this one did right away. Some aim too high and ask far too much of students, losing them in a sea of concepts with few tools to make sense of them. Others aim too low and ask far too little of students, failing to challenge them on the essential themes and concepts of comparative politics. This one finds the middle ground by presenting topics in an interesting and engaging manner and challenging students to cultivate their analytical skills.”—Katy Crossley-Frolick, Denison University “David Samuels helps students make sense of complex theoretical questions and approaches, and he applies them very effectively to case examples. This textbook beats all the alternatives; it is very well thought-out.”—Kenneth Roberts, Cornell University “Samuels engages professors as well as students by making our field accessible without compromising the curiosities and complexities that make it so interesting. The study of institutions, interests, and identities introduces undergraduates to the politics of countries in the world through a rigorous lens of comparative analysis. Samuels raises the most interesting questions and puzzles within our field and guides the student through the methods of comparative politics science. To have a textbook that moves beyond a list of concepts and an historical chronology of countries is immensely satisfying.”—Lauretta Frederking, University of Portland “I am delighted that the author recognizes how graduate-level comparative political scientists are trained and that he has brought this approach to the undergraduate level. This is useful training not only for budding comparative politics students but for those who seek to become informed world citizens.”—Jennifer White, University of Georgia “Comparative Politicsis a theory-centered introductory text that perfectly balances the substantive nature of our field with the level of accessibility necessary for an undergraduate class.”—Julie Mazzei, Kent State University “David Samuels provides a strong introduction to the themes, concepts, and current debates of comparative politics without burying the reader in a mound of empirical details. It encourages hypothesis testing, fosters students’ critical thinking skills, and encourages students to place current political developments in context.”—John Scherpereel, James Madison University “I am impressed that Samuels does not shy away from introducing students to the major debates in comparative politics and having them evaluate competing arguments. In trying to get the students to think theoretically, he has definitely chosen an approach that will challenge the best students.”—Steve Barracca, Eastern Kentucky University “This is a readable and well-organized exploration of major topics in comparative politics that brings together basic as well as more advanced topics. It provides students with examples of how to actually do comparative politics and prompts them to think through the major arguments of the field.”—Wendy N. Whitman Cobb, Santa Fe College “David Samuels does a better job than any I have seen of discussing key themes in comparative politics in an intelligent and well-written way. He raises the big questions in a straightforward and engaged manner, and he does a good job of addressing them in comparative perspective with the American institutions that my students know well.”—Kevin Deegan-Krause, Wayne State University “Samuels offers students a theoretically robust yet highly accessible introduction to the study of comparative politics. He clearly introduces core concepts and theories, offering compelling examples that encourage students to think through different ways of answering fundamental questions that define the field. I’m thrilled to see the strong focus on political identity in an introductory textbook.”—James Ross, University of Northern Colorado “This work is thoughtfully and freshly conceived and focuses on a straightforward analysis of political outcomes instead of rehashing historical debates in comparative politics that are not germane to students just coming to the topic. David Samuels writes with an enthusiasm that will entice students, and his emphasis on comparative politics as a puzzle is something that I would like my students to assimilate.”—David Levenbach, Arkansas State University “David Samuel’s innovative thematic survey and country casebook stand out as the most comprehensive material for introductory comparative politics courses. Throughout both, he successfully weaves the themes of institutions, identity and interests and demonstrates how these impact social, economic and political outcomes in different countries.”–Dauda Abubakar, University of Michigan–Flint “I have been teaching introductory comparative politics for over four years now, and I have examined some fifteen textbooks for this class. Samuels’ textbook is one of the best, and I will strongly consider adopting it.”—Anca Turcu, University of Central Florida", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A beautifully illustrated children s book with paintings by illustrator Sara Japanwalla, Degroot found inspiration for her fantastical island story from her own daughter. The character of Princess Charleston enjoys nature and the animals that live around her, as the story takes place on scenic Isle of Palms. As princess, Charleston is responsible for protecting her friends in the ocean, sky, and land. But as a threatening storm approaches, Charleston has to find a way to get all of her animal friends to safety. Calling to each of her friends from her magic window, she sings a special song. But will it be enough save all of the island animals? This heartwarming story is a perfect bedtime tale for children of all ages. The lessons of hospitality, kindness, and friendship are all woven into this charming story of Princess Charleston. --Island Eye NewsIt is a story about a little girl in her very own fairy tale along a Lowcountry Beach. The book is \"Princess Charleston of the Isle of Palms.\" Author Kelly Sheehy DeGroot devised the story when her daughter, Charleston, was just nine week old. DeGroot was at her family home on Isle of Palms and was rocking Charleston on the outside porch. \"My one true joy was sitting on the back porch singing songs and telling her stories,\" DeGroot told Lowcountry Live. Charleston is now four years old and DeGroot is sharing the story with other children in her newly released, self-published book. DeGroot describes \"Princess Charleston of the Isle of Palms\" as a \"modern day princess tale where the princess does the rescuing rather than having to be rescued.\" The story also promotes conservation while showcasing respect for the Lowcountry and its natural beauty. DeGroot is especially proud of the illustrations. She hired an artist from the United Kingdom to provide watercolor illustrations, based on Lowcountry photos provided by DeGroot. --WCIV ABC 4 News, Amy KehmIt is a story about a little girl in her very own fairy tale along a Lowcountry Beach.

Tennyson excelled at penning short lyrics, such as \"Break, Break, Break\", \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\", \"Tears, Idle Tears\" and \"Crossing the Bar\". Much of his verse was based on classical mythological themes, such as Ulysses, although In Memoriam A.H.H. was written to commemorate his best friend Arthur Hallam, a fellow poet and fellow student at Trinity College, Cambridge, who was engaged to Tennyson's sister, but died from a brain haemorrhage before they could marry. Tennyson also wrote some notable blank verse including Idylls of the King, \"Ulysses\", and \"Tithonus\". During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays enjoyed little success. A number of phrases from Tennyson's work have become commonplaces of the English language, including \"Nature, red in tooth and claw\", \"'Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all\", \"Theirs not to reason why, / Theirs but to do and die\", \"My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure\", \"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield\", \"Knowledge comes, but Wisdom lingers\", and \"The old order changeth, yielding place to new\".

Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in 1804 in the city of Salem, Massachusetts to Nathaniel Hathorne and the former Elizabeth Clarke Manning. His ancestors include John Hathorne, the only judge involved in the Salem witch trials who never repented of his actions. Nathaniel later added a \"w\" to make his name \"Hawthorne\" in order to hide this relation. He entered Bowdoin College in 1821, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1824, and graduated in 1825. Hawthorne anonymously published his first work, a novel titled Fanshawe, in 1828. He published several short stories in various periodicals which he collected in 1837 as Twice-Told Tales. The next year, he became engaged to Sophia Peabody. He worked at a Custom Houseand joined Brook Farm, a transcendentalist community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem, the Berkshires, then to The Wayside in Concord. The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to The Wayside in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, and was survived by his wife and their three children. -wikipedia", "related": ["B004UJ7W6C"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Manoeuvres took him all over the country, including the Orkney and Shetland Isles. Finally, he participated in the Battle of Arnhem, where all his training was put into practice. The skill, stamina and endurance needed to survive those hard times paid off when he was one of the lucky survivors of that battle. He was however, taken prisoner and endured incredible hardships until he finally escaped. Once home he married his sweetheart, Dorothy, and lived a contented life with her in the North-East and in Devon.

The plot\nis new, interesting, and will engage your mind in the story. A great\nwork was created by the author with this trilogy. I enjoyed the\nwell-developed characters and their many adventures.In this book, the twins have more mysteries to solve: a copy of Princess\n Kira has a very important secret mission. Fred is worried about his\nfiancée Kira, for she is throwing herself into Prince Hunston's arms,\nand men aren't allowed in Arbor, the Lost City of legend.In all, this is a very nice piece of writing. The trilogy has been\ncompleted without leaving any loose ends. I would have to say that this\nhas been an overall enchanting trip into a fantasy realm. It is suitable\n for readers from pre-teens to adults alike. It is a clean and wholesome\n series and readers will be happy owning these books. Happy readings.Reviewed by Author Anna del C.

In my favorites, I'm amazed at the intertwining subplots and the just plain good stories that hold me to the last page with imagination, suspense, romance, and gospel mixed together in well-proportioned doses. In his first non-fiction books,Breathing Graceand nowThe Cure, Kraus's expert storytelling provides the setting for larger direct doses of biblical truth than what's effective in a novel. In his life as a physician, Kraus looks at normal events and sees parallels with God and our need for him. InThe Cure, facts about a healthy human body become parables of a healthy body of Christ. Realities as diverse as DNA and a disastrous first date point us personally toward God and the immensity of his love and how much we need that love.

The\nnarrative usually revolves around buying and restoring a ruined farmhouse\nsomewhere near Siena, thereby getting to know the locals who are charming\nrustic sages or unscrupulous Latin cheats. The ensuing picture of Tuscany tends\nto be simplistic, idealistic or downright meretricious.Tony Rocca's book is a welcome change in a climate of\nclichés. He does actually write about purchasing a dilapidated property, and he\nalso describes the individuals thus encountered. He even devotes pages to the\nwonders of the landscape. Yet there is nothing trite in his tale. Instead, he relates his experience with humor and discernment,\nmapping the course of a learning curve beset with daunting vicissitudes. The\nresultant picture rings true because it mirrors both the region and the author\nas they undergo change. It is this element of change that sets Tony Rocca's story\napart and gives it a certain healthy dynamism.  [...] Any owner of a wine estate that has Robert Parker,\nWine Spectator and Decanter magazine among its admirers would be pardoned for a\ntouch of self-satisfaction. Not Tony Rocca. Instead he tells marvelous stories\nof near disasters. Tony Rocca is self-effacing as well as amusing. He is also\nperceptive. It is these qualities that make his book so enjoyable. - From a review of\nCatching Fireflies (2004) by Kate Singleton.

Thanks so much for your interest in my books! My principal interests are true stories of the unusual or of the previously Unknown or unexplained. I have occasionally also written some fiction.  I was born in Memphis Tennessee and grew up in the small town of Saltillo near Tupelo Mississippi. After graduating from Mississippi State University as an aerospace engineer I moved to Orlando Florida and worked for Lockheed Martin for 24 years. I advanced from an aerospace engineer to a Vice President of the Company and President of the Tactical Weapons Systems Division in Orlando. I then formed Parks-Jaggers Aerospace Company and sold it 4 years later. I continued my education throughout my career with a MBA degree from Rollins College and with Post Graduate Studies in Astrophysics at UCLA; Laser Physics at the University of Michigan; Computer Science at the University of Florida; and Finance and Accounting at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. After selling my aerospace company I formed Quest Studios, Quest Entertainment and Rosebud Entertainment to make films at Universal Studios. I produced 10 films, directed 7 films and wrote 5 films produced at Universal Studios. I then formed UnknownTruths Publishing Company to publish true stories of the unusual or of the previously Unknown or unexplained. These include books about past events so unbelievable that most people have relegated them to \"myths\". I have published 22 books, 20 of these have also been converted to audio books.  I have an additional 12 books in development.", "related": [], "rank": 2406605, "title": "Reagan's Star Wars eBook", "author": "Walter Parks", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Or how one should arrange the seating at a diplomatic dinner? The art (or perhaps it is a science) of protocol is one that is rarely observed outside of the reaches of capital cities, but strict observance of rules can ease cultural differences and provide an orderly framework in all sorts of difficult situations. Author French, chief of protocol during the Clinton administration, is well qualified to lay out the proper way to get through an event with no offense. Her somewhat lighthearted presentation in no way impedes her seriousness of purpose, and the examples of problems that she or her predecessors encountered make this volume quite readable.   The book starts with the order of precedence: who goes in first; titles and forms of address across cultures; and stations for letters, introductions, and place cards. It then moves on to how one behaves while visiting the president. Information on official entertaining, formal seating, and flag etiquette follow. There is an important and timely chapter on Internet protocol and a long section with various useful lists, such as facts about all the presidents and states, addresses of agencies and embassies, and American and religious holidays.   All in all, this is a useful and inexpensive book that can serve as a reference source for party planners, letter writers, and anyone interested in knowing how things are done. The personal asides give a flavor of what it might be like to rub elbows with the powerful, and the readable prose encourages random dipping into sections. In this subject area, there is a 37-page PDF from the Foreign Service but nothing new published in the past 20 years. If your patrons have any interest in this area, it is a worthy purchase. --Danise Hoover", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She works a full time day job to pay the bills but looses herself in books and her writing whenever possible.  She is a loving mother of two wonderful children that she admits she is obsessed with.

Luther taught that salvation is not earned by good deeds but received only as a free gift of God's grace through faith in Jesus as redeemer from sin. His theology challenged the authority of the pope of the Roman Catholic Church by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood. Those who identify with Luther's teachings are called Lutherans. His translation of the Bible into the language of the people (instead of Latin) made it more accessible, causing a tremendous impact on the church and on German culture. It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language, added several principles to the art of translation, and influenced the translation into English of the King James Bible. His hymns influenced the development of singing in churches. His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage, allowing Protestant priests to marry.", "related": ["B00AVYSUQQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kennedy; and The Octopus: Secret Government and the Death of Danny Casolaro, about theInslaw affair.

Feral House also recently published the new book, fully titled JFK & UFO: Military-Industrial Conspiracy and Cover-Up from Maury Island to Dallas. Thomas calls his research interest \"parapolitics,\" the study of conspiracies of all colors -- from alien abductions and the Illuminati, to the John F. Kennedy assassination and the September 11, 2001 attacks. The New Yorker called his work \"on the cutting edge\" of conspiracy.

Nikki doesn't understand why her father left when she was just three.  He can't bring himself to tell her the truth and has been trying to hide from it most of his life. But when their worlds collide they can no longer hide, and the novel traces the story of how they are both forced to \"grow up\" and what happens when they do. I personally feel it's a story that will appeal to both men and women, young and old equally.  I hope that as readers it will touch your hearts, provide you with a good and intriguing tale and leave you feeling like you have been on a colorful, rich and fulfilling journey.   I think that one of my greatest lessons in life comes through in this book - that life is like a good wine, providing us with the opportunities to grow and mature, allowing us to mellow with time and care, and truly appreciate and cherish what we have in life.", "related": [], "rank": 1541582, "title": "DRY TORTUGAS", "author": "AFN CLARKE", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Drawn to the genre from an early age, it seemed natural that her first novel, Take a Deep Breath, be a contemporary romance. Many readers emailed Shar how much they enjoyed Take a Deep Breath and asked for more. Writing in the early mornings and late evenings with a push from the National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), she pushed ahead and wrote her next novel, Take Your Time, the second book in what is now the “Lake of the Pines” series. She is currently at work on the third book, Take My Hand. Shar holds a Master of Arts in English from Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio.

A life time of ups and downs helping each other struggle through life?s trials and tribulations is the most rewarding experience you will ever travel through. Trust and obey. These are simple yet probably the most difficult words to follow. Parker Valley Sondra is the first of a series of books about four young women whom after the death of their parents are forced to live trusting God for all their needs. It is a story about commitment and trust. This book, dealing mostly with the Covenant of Marriage, is probably the most important Covenant that you will make with God besides the Covenant of Salvation. These series of books will guide us through the trials with the Parker Sisters as they walk out their journey finding faith, hope, and obedience in God. Covenants with God are binding and extremely valuable. Learning to trust and understand another human being, financially physically and spiritually is a step of faith that God wants us to trust Him with. He will walk you through the ups and downs of your emotional journey through life before and after marriage. Finding a soul mate that is God's highest and best for you, will be the most exciting journey you will ever take. I pray if you have not yet found your 'soul mate' that you search diligently for the one that God has placed on this earth for you. Just like Sondra you will know when he or she comes along. It's not difficult when God is in control of your life. Walk faithfully with the Risen Lord Jesus trusting Him always, first with your life and then putting your trust in your mate, honoring him or her with all that God has shared with you. You will then become one in the Spirit through the Covenant of Marriage. Two can fight the enemy better than one, when you are in the same spiritual standing. I will pray that God is glorified in your life now, and in times to come. May God Bless You and keep you now and forever.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After losing his 6-year-old brother to a drowning accident, 18-year-old Dylan tried to escape the constant nightmares by working for a summer at Ravenslake Lodge, a five-star resort in the middle of a national forest. But now the resort is closed and Dylan, along with quiet coworker Josh, decides to stay for an extra week to help Edward, the strict-bordering-on-cruel hotel manager, prepare the place for the oncoming winter. It’s a setup straight out of Friday the 13th: alone in the woods, separated from civilization, and creepy things begin to happen, including the destruction of cabins, a raccoon being dissected, and increasingly unnerving behavior by Edward. There’s less mystery to this than you’d hope—exactly what you think is going to happen happens—but Rodman’s economized prose is a pleasure to buzz through, and the finale incorporates the ghostly aspect of the story in a surprisingly haunting fashion.

The result is \"GURNARD'S BOOK OF\nDELIGHTS\" which includes stories written by some of the children in an\nanthology, published alongside excerpts and short stories by professional\nauthors.Having now read the children's stories and witnessed their\ncreative talents, I know my confidence in their abilities has been justified.\nThere is such a wide variety of themes here, with the winners in each year\ngroup producing some fantastic storylines. I hope, as you read through this\nanthology, you will agree we have some very talented children, who may well\ngrow up to become authors in the future.Reading and writing are such important skills for life, by\nencouraging and motivating children to take an interest in these areas; we are\nproviding them with the tools for the future. In turn this will enable them, as\nthey grow to adulthood, to access and maximise the exciting opportunities in\nthe work place and indeed in the world that will be available to them, many of\nwhich do not even exist at this moment in time.Many thanks to Vanessa Wester and S.P. Moss for the time\nthey have given to judging the entries and also to Vanessa who has given so\ngenerously of her time in compiling this - our first book of stories. I do hope\nyou will enjoy reading the children's stories and who knows; if this book is\nsuccessful we could look forward to several more editions being published in\nthe future!Congratulations to all of the children who have had their\nwork published - I am very proud of you all.Liz JacksonHead teacher -\nGurnard Primary School 2013", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After graduation from veterinarian school,  Jennifer has returned to Calico to live with her wise and wonderful  grandfather, who is the local pastor, and his gregarious housekeeper,  Emma.  One of the chief delights of this series is getting to know the  quirky residents of Calico who assist Jennifer in her investigations -  from the overworked (and overfed) sheriff who connives with Jennifer,  to the ambitious young attorney who adores her. In this first book of  the series, Jennifer is asked to treat a dog who has obviously been  poisoned with strychnine.  Jennifer's natural curiosity turns to  suspicion when the dog's owner, Pam Aldrich, claims the poison was  meant for her! Be sure not to miss a single one of Jennifer's cases -  all of which are based on her love and concern for her four-footed and  feathered friends.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is delighted with the mystery of Lord Pargeter's marriage and secret heir and offers to help Lady Sykes, a distasteful connection of the late Lord, to prove foul play.  He is also pleasantly surprised when he meets the pretty Jane Lonsdale, not the usual pampered sort of his crowd. Lady Sykes, thinking Jane is the secret heir to Wildercliffe, puts everything at sixes and sevens with her plots.  She wants her brother to court Lady Pargeter, her son to court Jane and has plans for herself to marry another neighbor, Lord Malton.  Add to that, a kind, bumbling Scawen Swann trying to find a wife, and you have a Regency comedy that offers three love stories in one.Joan Smith has a light, humorous touch in Tea and Scandal that's just right for a wonderful Regency! Tea And Scandal is a Regency at its best--humor, gossip, and characters to love and hate! Tea And Scandal has a touch of mystery and a stroke of humor that makes this Regency a delight to read! Joan Smith has created characters that portray the Regency period in its prime!Denise Hawkins Camp  --Copyright © 1994-97 Literary Times, Inc.

Her books includeThe Way I See It, and the national bestsellers,Thinking in Pictures,Animals in Translation, andAnimals Make Us Human. We were eager to hear what Grandin thought about Rupert Isaacson and his family's quest to go to the ends of the earth to help their son. Read her exclusive Amazon guest review to find out.This is a fascinating book.  It is the tale of a family's journey to Mongolia with their five-year-old son who has autism.  The family travels to the northern remote areas and lives with the nomads and herders away from the cities.  I loved the descriptions of the nomad way of life, and that they were so accepting of a child with autism.  Rowan loved baby animals and the people did not mind when he grabbed a baby goat and climbed into one of their beds with it.  During the trip, Rowan developed improved language and behavior. He also had a magical connection with horses.  There are many wonderful passages about Rowan’s exploits with a Mongolian horse named Blackie.Rupert Isaacson was surprised at how accommodating the Mongolian people were. They tolerated Rowan's pushing, yelping, and joyful rushing about.  At the end of the book the family get a rude awakening when a German tourist who was a psychologist disapproved of bringing a child with autism to a national park to view wild horses.  I was interviewed by Rupert Isaacson before he wrote his book and we discussed perhaps the shamans and the healers in some traditional cultures had autistic traits.  Their rituals with rhythmic chanting and repetitive movements have similarities to autistic \"stims.\"  When I was little, I went into a calm trance-like state when I rocked and dribbled sand through my hands.Children with autism need to be exposed to lots of interesting things and new experiences in order to develop.  One of the reasons the trip to Mongolia was so beneficial was that Rowan could explore lots of fascinating things such as horses, streams, plants, and animals in an environment that was QUIET. The Mongolian pastureland was a quiet environment free of the things that overload the sensory system of a child with autism.  There were no florescent lights or constant noise and echoes.  Some individuals with autism see the flicker of florescent lights which is like being in a disco with strobe lights.  When I was a child, loud sounds hurt my ears.Parents and teachers can duplicate the benefits of this trip without having to travel. Horseback riding is a great activity.  Many parents have told me that their child spoke his/her first words on a horse.  Activities that combine both rhythm and balancing such as horseback riding, sitting on a ball, or swinging help stabilize a disordered sensory system.  There are lots of places you can take a child to explore nature such as parks, brooks or a field with tall grass.  Children with autism need to be shown interesting things and encouraged to do new things.  Everywhere Rowan went he was asked questions and encouraged to talk about the things he was looking at. You need to find QUIET, interesting places away from crowds of people, florescent lights, traffic, and noise, where you can engage the child and keep him tuned in. This is a great book and everyone who is interested in autism, animals or different cultures should read it.--Temple Grandin", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He highlighted the epic battle between\nthe cities of good and evil, the loss of innocence, and the great dark lord. So\nI reread Paradise Lost and fell in love with the angelic civil war. In a moment of\ninspiration, I mashed together the Norse myths with the biblical material in\nDante's Inferno and Paradise Lost. I spent months studying angelic folklore and\nrabbinical demonology. I added a runic magic system and fleshed out the setting\nfor a story. The problem was I\nhad no story. The setting sat\nthere, collecting dust, while I worked on other projects. After I survived a\nbattle with cancer. I wanted to write about it, but the world has enough\ndepressing cancer memoirs. So I tackled the problem with a dark fantasy. Underneath all the\nmonsters, intrigue, and epic battles, the heart of the story is a man\nstruggling with intense pain. The best parts of him are slowly dying, and the\nonce great empire he served is rotting from the inside out. He remembers better\ndays and regrets the way his life has become a twisted and dark thing. He\ndoesn't recognize himself anymore. This is what\ncancer feels like, but I buried the theme deep inside an action story. The\nplot is saving a baby from demons. The story is a warrior refusing to surrender\nagainst impossible odds. The theme adds depth to the fantasy, but, if I've done\nmy job as a storyteller, readers should care more about the monsters stalking a\nlittle girl in a dark forest. One final note: because stoicism helped me survive cancer, I\ntitled the first book after a quote by one of my favorite stoics: \"Tomorrow is\nnothing, today is too late; the good lived yesterday.\"~ Marcus Aurelius", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There are moments ofSongs Only You Know that seem almost too painful to bear—but only almost. What carries the reader through is both the naked beauty of the prose and the deep human certainty that it is always better to face the truth than to flinch away from it. No flinching here. I admired every page of it.\"  —Elizabeth Gilbert, #1New York Timesbestselling author ofEat, Pray, LoveandThe Signature of All Things\"Songs Only You Knowis a truly moving book, full of pain, longing, strangeness and even grim comedy, and one of its greatest triumphs is the way Hoen describes a certain creative intensity -- youthful, monstrous, fragile -- that is both life-giving and dangerous, especially in troubled times. Maybe everybody has a song, but Hoen sings his with fresh phrasing and genuine feeling.\"—Sam Lipsyte, author ofThe Fun Parts\"I don’t know anyone who has described that terrible yearning for ecstasy and immolation through music as lucidly as Sean Madigan Hoen inSongs Only You Know. Only a thorough initiate of the scene who also had some genius with language could summon the demotic yet electric voice for the job. If there is ruefulness, now, for the way he treated his body, his girlfriends, and his family, he wisely reprises in his book, in neon detail, the fever that once placed him in the same drunken boat with Iggy Pop, Rimbaud and Artaud.\"—Jaimy Gordon, National Book Award-winning author ofLord of Misrule\"Perceptive, sprawling memoir of a young man’s escape from cascading   family tragedies into the noise-punk underground.... A dark, knowing   look at addiction, rock ’n’ roll, and the ties that bind.\"—Kirkus Reviews\"Here's what you get when you mix Nick Flynn with Karl Ove Knausgaard: a book of almost spooky clarity and relentless compassion. I bet whenSongs Only You Knowgets translated to Norwegian they'll call itMy Struggle(With Drugs and Rock-n-Roll). Which would kind of get it, and kind of wouldn't. Because it's also universal, and ridiculously readable, and Hoen has, in this memoir, brought his life pinned and wriggling to page, and you can't help but be moved by it, and even find yourself changed.\"—Darin Strauss, National Book Critics Circle award-winning author ofHalf a Life“Sean Madigan Hoen puts raw need indelibly on the page—the need for family, for belonging, for alcohol and drugs, and for a music that will burn all those things away (and if the music fails, try more alcohol and drugs). Hoen’s younger self thinks, ‘To achieve self-invention, you first evacuate the truest parts of yourself,’ not quite knowing yet that the sort of evacuation he craves is only ever temporary: the check always comes due. This moving, often brutal memoir records Hoen’s long journey back toward the truth.”—Bill Clegg, author ofPortrait of an Addict as a Young Man“It's an odd feeling to have, to not want a book to end when it covers so many miserable and sometimes manic moments in a life, but that's how I felt reading this fantastic, honest, unsentimental and finally generous-hearted book.”—Rivka Galchen, author ofAtmospheric Disturbances\"Songs Only You Knowis cigarettes and buck knives, crabgrass and  asphalt, rolling brownouts and horseshit vinyl. Sean Madigan Hoen  offers the best things a writer can offer a reader: the big heart, the  big hurts, the big bad news about the impermanence of life's gig.\" —Kyle Minor, author ofPraying Drunk“Sean Hoen has written a wise and moving memoir about anger, rock music and the endurance of familial love. For Hoen the ultimate redemption is rendering honestly the hard facts of his own transgression, while never losing track of the beauty and kindness that are also, thank goodness, ineradicable aspects of human existence.”—Stephen O’Connor, author of Here Comes Another Lesson", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

[This list does not include the fire ants that live round the corner.]He has written books on many subjects (his latest being the development of Embedded Computer Software Systems) but this is his first using a Science Fiction / Fantasy theme.People say to write about what you know.  He has applied this to his writing since he is well-traveled through the USA, Europe and Africa, is an open water certified SCUBA diver, has had some glider training, has an 1100cc Honda Blackbird sports bike in the garage and has been up and down Mount Palomar grade more times than he can remember.He has always had a dream of finding / building / stealing (sorry, acquiring) a space ship and traveling the stars.  Perhaps that was the inspiration that has materialized itself into this book.He hopes you enjoy the adventure.", "related": ["B00FQ8VDIO"], "rank": 3608110, "title": "First Contact (Stryders Odyssey Book 2) eBook", "author": "Steve McClure", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a single mother of three children who has raised them on my own with no financial assistance, child support, regular visits, etc., I have a lot of interesting, heart breaking, heart warming and humorous stories. Then on September 9, 2013 at 10:22 PM, both of my daughters were in a car accident, and everything changed. I have a pretty large number of followers who kept up with our story on a day by day basis via my blog. I have definitely been blessed with the written word during our journey. I wrote the first phase of our journey in my first published work, The Never Say never Kid. I had just finished a novel that I have worked on for a long time the day before the accident.

I quickly realized that the  good things, the gifts that can come with Autism, are incredible.  They are \"superhero\" like.        Watching my son's similar gifts inspired me to write an wonderful adventure story based on the fantastic autistic abilities I have witnessed and read about, on my own journey as an Autism Dad.

Before Esther Yarrington discovered her unique brand of message, \"Your Life Story is Your Message\", before she could clearly define her message and speak her truth to the masses, her life was riddled with hardships and challenges. No one would have believed that one day she would be living a prosperous and successful life.Esther grew up in a third world country, the 10th child of an illiterate mother and father who worked hard to feed them and give them an education. She was sexually and emotionally abused by her teachers and relatives from an early age of 7, widowed at the age of 23, divorced and a single mother of 3 by the age of 30. Life seemed like a continuous struggle with no room for escape.Instead of accepting this as her life story Esther worked hard and at the age of 21 moved to America where she put herself through college and became a Registered Nurse. Esther has worked with thousands of patients to help them heal and find peace with their ailing bodies.After 15 years as a Registered Nurse Esther had a calling to work with more than just patients in the hospitals. She wanted to work with people who had deeper wounds; wounds that most people do not talk about or go to the doctor to seek treatment for. Wounds that lie dormant for years yet affect our happiness, relationships, prosperity and abundance.Through her personal experiences, traumas and challenges, Esther is equipped with a unique way of looking at life that is fresh and authentic. By understanding her traumas and painful past she was able to tap into her Divine Purpose. Her life's mission is to assist others to live their truth by embracing themselves fully and becoming their highest most powerful self.", "related": [], "rank": 3490424, "title": "THE GIFT: THE SUREFIRE WAY TO HAVE A PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE", "author": "Esther Yarrington", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a gripping story, told with mounting drama and emotional power--and with great fidelity to the historical record.\" -Donald L. Miller, Professor of History, Lafayette College, and author of Masters of the Air, America's Bomber Boys Who Fought the Air War Against Nazi Germany\"The minimal text is packed with information on politics, history, technical specifications, and military strategy, making this book appealing to both reluctant readers and those wanting a quick history review. Don't rush through, though: the illustrations themselves are full of content and personality, conveying the human (and inhuman) aspects of war.\" -HistoricalNovelSociety.org\"A note about the illustrations. I think these are of about the same quality as Hal Foster's original drawings in his long-running Prince Valiant comic strip. There's not a single illustration where I couldn't tell what kind of airplane or who Vansant was talking about in the accompanying narrative. They are cartoons, no question,but they are very good; and every one well supports the thread of the history presented. For a quick and enjoyable summary of the technology, strategy, tactics, and personalities involved in this huge six-year military campaign, this book very adequately fills the bill.\" -Air Power History\"Vansant has created a visual narrative of the bombing war that is highly original, striking, engaging and accessible. It is an outstanding achievement. Any good graphic novel has to be visually striking, and Vansant's graphics more than fit this bill. They are not merely \"re-draws\" of iconic photographs; they are original works of art. Bombing Nazi Germany is so well done - visually stunning, historically accurate, emotionally gripping - that it is bound to lure younger readers and keep them turning the pages. But no air war buff of any age should leave it unexplored.\" -World War II Magazine", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Comics & Graphic Novels", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I never intended for these to be a trilogy, and didn't realize they were\nuntilWorlds Awaywas being written.  When I was writing the third\nbook many years ago, I found myself stuck, like many writers, with no idea how\nto continue.  Back in those days, I was still smoking, so I went outside\nto have a cigarette to think about it, and within seconds, I thought of a\ncharacter inAll The Gods...,a child named, Divinity, and just like\nthat, I had my story.  Malon, as well, the Black God, inAll The Gods\nAgainst Me,made an appearance inCalliope,but I realized I could\ntie them all together beautifully with the character Divinity, which is what I\ndid.  There were other ties as well, but that one I liked a lot, and I\nliked what it created between the three books.  I guess I could have\ncalled it theDivinity Trilogy, but honestly,The Blood and Fire\nTrilogyis more appropriate, as you will see when you read them.\nAgain, all the novels stand alone, but the beauty of creativity and the\nsubconscious mind are really quite extraordinary, and what happened when I\nwrote all three was not intended. If you do read them in order, you will\nnoticed a circle that completes itself that you would not have gotten\notherwise.  It is the cycle of light and dark.  Dark being the way\nthe trilogy begins withAll the Gods Against Me,and finishing on an\naspect of light withWorlds Away. Calliope,of course,\nhovering there in the middle like a tug of war, but very necessary.  It\nwas a pretty extraordinary experience to be a part of, that particular,\nunintended creative process, and I was pleasantly surprised, even awed by what\nhad been created without my knowledge.  I hope you enjoy reading them as\nmuch as I enjoyed writing them.", "related": ["B00AMMH26G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Regan hopes to one day write a novel set on Mars\nwhile sitting in his boxer shorts on the actual Red Planet, and\neverything that comes before that is really just his way of saving up\nfor the one-way trip.Though Regan has been shafted by residency\nrequirements in his pursuit of the MacArthur genius grant, his current\nfiction is considered to be of high caliber, reflecting a marked\nimprovement in style and grammar from the aforementioned thing with the\nhamster. It also has far fewer graphic scenes of pound puppy plushes\nhaving sex in the back of a shoebox with paper wheels.What does Regan have to say about Regan?\"I recently passed up the chance to hassle Samuel L. Jackson.\"\"I've always wanted to change my name to something boring, like Hugh Howey.\"\"I know how to cook six things.

Ruth was raised strictly Brethren and from birth attended three meetings every Sunday at the Gospel Hall, the Wednesday night meeting, and the yearly \"Conference,\" until she left the Brethren at the age of twenty one. Ruth still has close friends in the Brethren, as well as the Amish, both groups descending from Anabaptists. Ruth's family had electricity, but not television, radio, or magazines, and they had plain cars. Make up, bright or fashionable clothes, and hair cutting were not permitted for women. Women had to wear hats in meetings (what others would call church meetings) but not elsewhere. The word \"church\" was never used and there were no bishops or ministers. All baptized men were able to speak (preach, or give out a hymn) spontaneously at meetings. Musical instruments were forbidden, with the exception of the traditional pump organ which was allowed only if played in the home for hymn music. Even so, singing of hymns in accompaniment was forbidden. Ruth Hartzler is a widow with one adult child and two grandchildren. She lives alone with her Yorkshire Terrier and two cats. She is a retired middle school teacher and enjoys quilting, reading, and writing.", "related": ["B00L0MA25A"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
