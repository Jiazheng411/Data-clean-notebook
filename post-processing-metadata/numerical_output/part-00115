McGonagle:\"All CI analysts worth their salt should own. read and master (both of their) books. Once having mastered them, keep them handy for their encyclopedic and crystal clear way in which each dissects the pros and cons of critical CI analysis tools, and explains how to use, when to use, and when not to use each of them.\"This comprehensive compendium of methods to analyze business and competition does a yeoman's job of providing practical, useful pointers to executives. -- R. Subramanian, Montclair State University (Reprinted with permission from CHOICE, copyright by the American Library Association)  \"Too much data and not enough insight? Fleisher and Bensoussan offer a fabulous solution to the problem.Business and Competitive Analysisprovides a nice combination of theory and practice, including a comprehensive, wide-ranging description of analytical techniques. Providing a strong complement to their previous work,Strategic and Competitive Analysis, this latest work is a \"must read\" for anyone analyzing strategic and tactical issues across the competitive landscape.\"--Timothy J. Kindler, Director, Competitive Intelligence, Eastman Kodak Company and 2005 President, Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals\"This book (Business and Competitive Analysis: Effective Application of New and Classic Methods) is an essential resource for competitive intelligence practitioners, business school students, and anyone looking to improve the strength and clarity of their competitive and market analyses. While no tool will perform analysis for you, the techniques explained here will provide inspiration, structure, and discipline for those who need to deliver compelling analysis to decision makers. I believe that this book will fill a great need for both full-time competitive intelligence practitioners and those looking to add analytical skills to their managerial tool kit.\"--Bill Fiora, Partner and Founder, Outward Insights “Anything which improves business and competitive analysis practice has to be applauded. Too frequently \"strategy\" type texts include just the bare minimum and even then the familiar old models would appear, with little explanation, hardly any critique, and even less insight. Unlike these, Fleisher and Bensoussan offer a full and unique demonstration of how to successfully cross the divide between theory and practice. All practicing managers and business decision makers should be grateful to Fleisher and Bensoussan for showing them how their analysis work can become more rigorous and their approach less casual. Accept no imitations. This is the genuine article.”--Sheila Wright, Director of the Competitive Intelligence-Marketing Interface Teaching and Research Initiative (CIMITRI) at Leicester Business School, De Montfort University \"Baruch's Law reminds us that, 'when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail,' a condition describing the single most difficult challenge facing both business analysts and consultants, novice and veteran alike. In 2003, Fleisher and Bensoussan delivered what all leading intelligence thinkers agree was THE definitive guide to analytics and interpretation for the first half-decade of the new millennium. With their latest collaboration, this expert duo has defined the second-half of this decade as one guided by knowing the tools appropriate for the cognitive task at hand while expanding the toolkit available to be even more complete, valuable, and useful through the actionable detailing of 24 all new techniques. Plus, the unique FAROUT approach to tool selection equips analysts to quickly and easily apply the right techniques more reliably and scientifically to the range of outcomes anticipated in every business-decision support situation.\"--Arik Johnson, Managing Director, Aurora WDC “The realm of competitive intelligence has, in recent years, benefited from a profusion of books, handbooks, and essays, most of which deal with issues in intelligence collection: emerging techniques and technologies and general overviews of the business intelligence discipline. Fleisher and Bensoussan offer a choice of analytical models destined to narrow corporate course charting uncertainties and present a convincing case for matching science and art in the analysis process. This new book is an important addition to the definitive professional library on the art and science of business intelligence.”--Michael Belkine, Managing Director, Splendour Ltd \"Having been involved in information analysis and strategic information support to companies for many years, I found this book very helpful and full of insights addressed not only to the new-comer, but also to an experienced person.The in depth review of each analysis technique actually brings new ways of looking at problems: information analysis becomes an instrument in the hands of a thinking person; it's not an academic exercise or just a conceptual framework.Furthermore, in my experience usually some of the analysis techniques are almost known and used only by people working in a few functions inside a company. This book enters you in a fascinating multi-stage and multi-face analysis world: everyone needs a way of organizing thoughts, and here you can find what you require to perform a good analysis and give insightful meanings to the information you manage, wherever you work in your company, whatever the problem you face is.Every day everyone needs to analyze information to understand phenomena and then act to achieve the best performance: hence you need to keep this book on your desk.”--Milena Motta, Managing Director, Strategie&Innovazione, Italy \"There are very few books I recommend as a must-read to the managers who come to us from all over the world for professional training in competitive intelligence. Porter, Fuld, Gilad (of course), and Fleisher and Bensoussan.\"--Dr. Benjamin Gilad, president, The Fuld-Gilad-Herring Academy of Competitive intelligence, www.academyci.com \"At last a comprehensive manual of tools and techniques for the business and competitive analysis professional! Fleisher and Bensoussan's second collaborative work builds beautifully on their first. It provides the specific guidance desperately needed by company analysts to ensure that decision makers receive the right information at the right time to make the right decisions.\" --Kirk W. M. Tyson, CEO, Perpetual Strategist Ltd., Chicago, USA \"The dynamic collaborative team of Bensoussan and Fleisher have done it again. Expanding on their earlier text,Strategic and Competitive Analysis, the refined perspectives offered in their latest work,Business and Competitive Analysis, have raised the bar for essential literature in the profession of decision support. By artfully interweaving both pragmatic and theoretic principles, this book couples frameworks for critical thinking with practical operational guidance for the successful analyst. They never lose sight of the ultimate end game--sustainable competitive advantage through sound, evidence-based decision making. Very few enterprises seem capable of achieving this elusive objective in the hypercompetitive business environment of the 21st century. These thought leaders have built another pillar in the foundation of the business intelligence literature base which should be required reading in both academic and corporate settings.\" --Clifford Kalb, Vice President, Life Sciences, Wood Mackenzie, Inc. “Business and Competitive Analysis: Effective Application of New and Classic Methodsfrom Fleisher and Bensoussan is 'the definitive must have' for anyone undertaking competitive analysis, irrespective of experience, practitioner, or third party vendor. This practical and actionable set of techniques grows and develops the agenda of the first edition by extending the range of techniques, focusing on their actionability rather than a statement of their intent and allows the practitioner to hit the nail on the head with at times complex problems and their recommendations. Through the consistent approach adopted with the techniques it provides the guide to what can be achieved and how and helps structure the problem from the very outset. The FAROUT methodology again helps the practitioner work out which ones to apply first given their own unique position and provides a development framework to seek out opportunities to apply the rest. Like the first edition, it becomes the most sought after next installment in defining competitive analysis' role in business for practitioner and user alike.”--Andrew Beurschgens, Competitive Analysis Manager, Orange, UK “Bravo! Bensoussan and Fleisher have returned for an encore performance as your instructive desktop guides to thoughtfully assist analysts of all stripes in selecting and applying a wide-ranging array of frameworks, all designed to enhance analytical thinking, insight, and decision-making.

So an actor needs precise exercise and clear understanding to liberate his hidden possibilities and to learn the hard task of being true to the ‘instinct of the moment’. As her book points out with remarkable persuasiveness ‘technique’ as such is a myth, for there is no such thing as a correct voice. There is no right way—there are only a million wrong ways, which are wrong because they deny what would otherwise be affirmed. Wrong uses of the voice are those that constipate feeling, constrict activity, blunt expression, level out idiosyncrasy, generalize experience, coarsen intimacy. These blockages are multiple and are the results of acquired habits that have become part of the automatic vocal equipment; unnoticed and unknown, they stand between the actor's voice as it is and as it could be and they will not vanish by themselves. So the work is not how to do but how to permit: how, in fact, to set the voice free. And since life in the voice springs from emotion, drab and uninspiring technical exercises can never be sufficient. Cicely Berry never departs from the fundamental recognition that speaking is part of a whole: an expression of inner life…. After a voice session with her I have known actors speak not of the voice but of a growth in human relationships. This is a high tribute to work that is the opposite of specialization. Cicely Berry sees the voice teacher as involved in all of a theatre's work. She would never try to separate the sound of words from their living context. For her the two are inseparable. —from Peter Brook's foreword to Voice and the Actor", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With equal parts humor and heartache—with heartache leaping from the page in the columns written after her cancer diagnosis—Rosenswein deals with aging parents, challenging modern schedules, timeless holy days and the joys of raising her three children. The columns address the quotidian concerns of a suburban Jewish family as well as more global issues: the fear and sadness after 9/11 and the sense of anxiety that some American Jews have about Israel. Sometimes, the order of the short essays is distracting—her daughter is four, then a newborn. Since the essays are so heavily autobiographical, a chronological order would have better suited the collection. Still, this is a treasure trove of wisdom from one of American Judaism's most beloved and lamented voices. Rosenswein's husband, Barry Lichtenberg, provides a touching afterword, and novelist Tova Mirvis (a former intern of hers) the foreword.(Dec. 11)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He did more than any other man in modern times to establish the faith of the people in the validity of the Holy Scriptures.His weekly sermons were published by a newspaper syndicate composing some 2000 newspapers with a combined circulation of fifteen million readers. \"His writings are said to have greater newspaper circulation every week than those of any living man....\" (Editor of the \"Continent\")In addition, his missionary tour of Russia, where he delivered lectures to thousands of Orthodox Jews on \"the regathering of the Jewish people to Palestine,\" plus his travels to Japan, China, Korea and India to preach the Good News were widely known. On his return to America he was given a standing ovation at the New York City Hippodrome by thousands of Jews, his discourse on \"The Returning Favor to Israel\" being published by Hebrew newspapers, both in America and Europe.Convinced of the harmony of the Bible, Pastor Russell devoted his life to the cause to which he gave his life ... the teaching of the Holy Scriptures.

He was born on September 1, 1875 in Chicago, Illinois, and entered military service in 1895. Two years later, he was diagnosed with a heart problem and was discharged. He drifted from job to job and in 1911, he found work selling pencil sharpeners. Because he had plenty of free time during this period, he started reading pulp fiction magazines. He thought that if people were getting paid for writing such rot, then he could write stories which were just as rotten. After seven years of being paid low wages he began writing his own fiction.

He was a peacemaker who sought unity among Protestants, and yet he was a highly independent thinker and at the center of every major controversy in England during his lifetime. Born in Rowton to parents who undervalued education, Baxter was largely self-taught. He eventually studied at a free school, then at royal court, where he became disgusted at what he saw as frivolity. He left to study divinity, and at age 23, he was ordained into the Church of England. Within the Anglican church, Baxter found common ground with the Puritans, a growing faction who opposed the church's episcopacy and was itself breaking into factions. Baxter, for his part, did his best to avoid the disputes between Anglicans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and other denominations, even convincing local ministers to cooperate in some pastoral matters. \"In necessary things, unity; in doubtful things, liberty; in all things, charity,\" he was fond of saying. The interest in cooperation was not due to a lack of conviction. On the contrary, Baxter was opinionated in his theology, which was not quite Separatist and not quite Conformist. Among his more than 200 works are long, controversial discourses on doctrine. Still, he believed society was a large family under a loving father, and in his theology, he tried to cut between the extremes. He eventually registered himself as \"a mere Nonconformist\" (\"Nonconformist\" was a technical term meaning \"not Anglican\"), breaking with the Church of England mainly because of the lack of power it gave parish clergy. Baxter became even better known for his prolific writing. His devotional classic The Saints' Everlasting Rest was one of the most widely read books of the century. When asked what deviations should be permitted from the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, he created an entirely new one, called Reformed Liturgy, in two weeks. His Christian Directory contains over one million words. His autobiography and his pastoral guide, The Reformed Pastor, are still widely read today.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was a good story with lots of emotional ups and downs, you\nnever knew what was going to happen with the heroine and the other 2\nladies locked up with the gladiators. Were they safe or were they going\nto be thrown to the gladiators at any moment. They had no privacy and\npractically no clothing in the cells and men we're constantly parading\nin front of the cells and they weren't just normal men they were big\nferocious aliens that were really scary looking, even the ones that\nseemed friendly. Later in the book you met up with the Hirachi from the\nother books and saw how their village and people had progressed how good\n they were at adapting in new environments, which was a nice touch.Happily Ever After-Desmond-4 Tea Cups!\"Kaitlyn O'Connor has done it\n again in creating a story, rich in adventure with sexual overtones and\nrobust characters.

In these studies I fancy I am about as far from mastering the mystery as the ant which I saw this morning industriously exploring a small section of the garden walk is from getting a clear idea of the geography of the North American Continent.  But the ant was occupied and was apparently happy, and she must have learned something about a small fraction of that part of the earth's surface.'' ''My imagination and ingrained humanism are appealed to by the facts and methods of natural history.  I find something akin to poetry and religion  (using the latter word in its non-mythological sense, as indicating the sum of mystery and reverence we feel in the presence of the great facts of life an death) in the shows of day and night, and in my excursions to fields and woods.   The love of nature is a different thing from the love of science, though the two may go together. To the rigid man of science this is frank mysticism; but without a sense of the unknown and unknowable, life is flat and barren.  Without the emotion of the beautiful, the sublime, the mysterious, there is no art, no religion, and no literature.  How to get from the clod underfoot to the brain and consciousness of man without invoking something outside of, and superior to, natural laws, is the question.  For my own part I content myself with the thought of some unknown and doubtless unknowable tendency or power in the elements themselves - a kind of universal mind pervading living matter and the reason of its living, through which the whole drama of evolution is brought about.\"John Burroughs", "related": ["B0093M15D2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And\nI can honestly say that their lives and relationships grew so intense that at\none point, the book began to write itself. I always felt that the\nrelationship between the main character Timber and her ex-fiancé Brian was very\nrealistic and powerful. There were times when I'd read over certain things I'd written\nabout these two, especially some of the dialogue they'd share, and gasp in\nshock! And then there's the beautiful friendship between Timber and her best\nfriend/Brian's daughter, Eva. Such a fine line these two have to walk in order\nto maintain their rapport after Timber and Brian's split. It's interesting to\nsee how Eva handles various aspects of Timber's life, such as her new\nrelationship with burgeoning actor Alex Witherspoon, all while struggling to\nsustain some sort of allegiance to her father. \"The Road to Bliss\" is\nfilled with so many surprising twists and turns.

Ice Changers is not only my first Sci-Fi novel but also my first novel available for the Kindle.   I live in a little town called Eldora in Iowa and am 52 years old. I also write poetry and songs and have produced a C.D. of some of my own songs titled \"SimplyD\".  Having my 8 year old, blind brothers hand placed on my 7 year old shoulders, I became his eyes and he became my teacher. I learned to see the world \"In living color\" and to describe the world in a way that he could \"see\" the world through my eyes. Green leaves became the lime flavored cereal from Froot Loops. Red became hot and the taste of a Bing Cherry.  This 10 year blessing taught me to write so that the reader could see and feel everything I was feeling as I wrote.   My wife became stricken with Muscular Dystrophy one year after we were married. Through her, I also learned to write with passion and compassion that I believe blessed me with an even greater ability to reach out and touch the heart and souls of the reader.   My passion is and always will be to write from my soul.

In March 2009 an innocent-looking Facebook post stated \"I've an idea for a book, who wants to help me write it?\" and, after a flurry of posts and emails, Marshall Buckley was born; very soon after, the result (which bears only a passing resemblance to that original idea) was The Long Second. With no publishing experience to speak of (one half of Marshall Buckley is a Sales Executive while the other is an IT Professional), The Long Second was sent out to the world in full confidence of securing an agent and a publisher in a matter of days. By some good fortune, the first was actually achieved, but the second remained elusive. Marshall Buckley now has a full two years' worth of publishing experience but is no closer to understanding the mysteries of the industry.

But with a new story that is part coming-of-age, part paranormal tale, he has helped give the form a boost--and us a reminder of how skillfully he works in a small space. In King’s worlds, peril and disaster often hide in the most ordinary things and places, and inMile 81, danger lurks at an abandoned rest stop in the author's standard Maine setting. With expert pacing, King allows a short but life-changing journey to unfold for his young protagonist, and the most pedestrian details of the rest stop take on eerie significance with each quickly-turned page: a cut-up chain-link fence surrounding the place, a hollowed-out Burger King left fallow, a door of a filthy car hanging silently “open like an invitation.” Fans will recognize nods toChristineandFrom a Buick 8, but the destructive force inMile 81is even more savage, the horror more faceless and primal. And as one would expect, it’s not just a scary story--it reads, in ways, as parable, his characters at once archetypal and uniquely crafted. Although set in present day,Mile 81feels timeless---it's a story about good people encountering the terror of the unknowable, and about the courage that innocents must summon in the face of it, when there is no one left to protect them. --Simone Gorrindo", "related": [], "rank": 92220, "title": "Mile 81 (Kindle Single)", "author": "Stephen King", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 167, "rating_average": 4.012, "rating_total": 670.0}

The farm had been broken from the native prairie, first by his father, joined later by his grandfather and uncle.   To the west were the towering ramparts of the Rocky Mountains and, to the east the sprawling grasslands of Canada's largest Indian reserve. Within two years the economic ravages of the depression struck.  Coupled with the increasingly dry, dust laden winds of a persecuting climate shift, the family was forced to move to other farms further north.  At the first of these, intrigued by a robin's nest in a tree, hitherto unfamiliar on the treeless plains, a slip of a foot produced devastating damage to one eye and threatened the future of the other as a released branch lashed across his face. Rushed through education, in a family of skilled teachers, before feared blindness descended, Allen was ready for university too young to become a teacher.  With special permission, he entered the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Alberta at age sixteen, instead.  Agriculture led him to a short career in Alberta, Ontario and Yellowknife before taking up his anticipated life as a teacher.  Teaching blended with agriculture, introducing tropical agriculture courses in Barbados.  Back in Canada he moved up in Canadian secondary and university education with a side trip to teacher training in West Africa. Retiring from education, after reaching the top administrative position in his County, Allen applied administrative skill and a chemical background to local, national and international organizations devoted to industrial and community safety around the world.  At seventy, he retired again, back to college and university teaching.  Published writing punctuated more than sixty of his eighty years and readers will benefit from that persistent interest.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

If she can decorate his house he'll be swimming in enough money to start his own business. Now all he has to do is convince her.The last thing she expects is to fall for an ambitious, anti-family man. Yet he sparks something that she's believed to be dead inside of her. Brice is not Prince Charming nor will he ever be, but there's something about Hazel that stirs an unknown need with him.With something just a little supernatural about the small island, will both Brice and Hazel get everything they need...and more?", "related": ["B00JQS5FIO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Each chapter includes cases and lessons from the field and reflective questions. Eleanor Drago-Severson combines research and practice to create an essential handbook for leaders of adults.\"(The School Administrator Magazine, January 2011 2010-12-22)“Eleanor Drago-Severson takes hold of an important and neglected truth: students grow best in schools where the adults around them are growing, too. In this nurturing and much-anticipated work, the author shows us exactly how to make this happen. Sound theory, vivid examples, and a practice-ready framework—it’s all here! Anyone who cares about making our schools better will feel richly rewarded for spending time with this encouraging book.”(Robert Kegan, Meehan Professor of Adult Learning and Professional Development 2009-04-06)\"There is no greater opportunity for improving public education than to make schools places where adults learn and lead together. In her rich and engaging book, Drago-Severson explores the challenge of this important work and shows us how success is both possible and deeply rewarding.\"(Susan Moore Johnson, Pforzheimer Professor of Teaching and Learning 2009-05-15)\"Building on the 'pillar practices' of her earlier work and animated with stories, exercises, and illustrations, this book offers both lucid explication of the powerful insights of constructive developmental theory and intensely practical partnership in how to put it all to work on Monday morning. In these hard times, this is a welcome and hopeful blueprint for the reanimation of our schools and the transformation of our communities.\"(Laurent A.

Vince, his son Race, and his pack of bikers, The Tribe, are on the run, but it's not long before the group is chased by something far more frightening and relentless than the memory of their own crimes. InThrottle, Stephen King and his son, novelist Joe Hill, have paired up to write a suspenseful novella in homage to Richard Matheson's famous \"Duel,\" a story which also features a mysterious driver with deadly road rage. In both works, the driver is faceless, a senseless source of terror that feels almost machine-like, inhuman: King and Hill reveal only his arm hanging out of his window, \"a cigarette smoldering between two fingers.\" Throughout, the story is enlivened with vivid illustrations, and the prose is quieter and more lyrical than we've come to expect from King, full of visual detail: the desert cliffs \"striped in chalky shades of yellow and red,\" the \"tires churning up a fog of dust that turned the blue sky white.\" It seems Hill may have had a strong hand in the prose, but a father-son team is definitely behind this: amid its horror, the real heart ofThrottleis the complex, thorny relationship between Vince and his son. Nothing is black and white in this horror story. The reader will no doubt root for The Tribe inThrottle's battle, but as the curtain closes, everyone has blood on their hands.\n--Simone Gorrindo", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 105, "rating_average": 4.1619, "rating_total": 437.0}

Whitney. In October 1989, Bergthold and a longtime adventure companion set out on a 14-day odyssey through the most extreme climates and barren regions of North America. Armed with carefully selected gear and food, the men arranged to pick up water at checkpoints as their only form of outside aid, no small feat in a pre-cellphone era. Bergthold uses his trip diary and memory to reconstruct one travel day per chapter, describing in detail meager rations, odd camping spots, hard-core survival techniques, frantic water searches and wildly varying temperatures. The memoir excels at communicating the grandeur and terror of the wastelands: “The macabre, wind-swept landscape made us suddenly see and feel the effect of an outlaw wind that had nowhere to go except in all directions. It had nothing better to do than to blast an already taxed land and to batter the living beings.” Bergthold shines when explaining the internal motivations that impelled his Frodo-like quest as well as the nirvana attained during the final ascent to 14,000 feet on Mt. Whitney in severe winter weather. Largely driven by the thought of hardships faced by ancestors and the softness of modern humanity, which he and his companion deplore, Bergthold writes passionately of trying to measure up to these “real men” of yore who did battle with nature. A few issues prevent this otherwise exciting narrative from unfolding with maximum dramatic impact. For one thing, the lack of details about the men’s “real lives” prior to the trek limits the reader’s emotional investment in their journey. One often wonders where these decontextualized wanderers hail from and who might be waiting for them to come back. Second, the author considerably undercuts the climactic effect of reaching the summit of Mt. Whitney by frequently overusing exclamation points, italics and sensational adjectives throughout earlier chapters. A riveting if unevenly paced survival story that covers both interior psychological and exterior geographical terrain.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Early in her walk with the Lord, she had been called by God to lead a prayer ministry by the name \"Wailing Women at the Wall.\" There she served for one year until God instructed her to move on as a youth leader for a girls club in Brooklyn, New York. There, God would instruct her on guiding the youth in their struggles, using the Word of God as the tool to overcome and heal the inner wounds of our youth. God has also opened many doors for her to facilitate discovery groups, which consist of women who are in search of healing from their corrupted beliefs and replacing them with the Truth of God's Word. Josephine De Jesus loves to spend her quality time in the presence of the Lord, where God speaks to her and guides her fingers to write what He has given unto His people for healing and deliverance. Through her writings, she is able to find what God wants for herself and for His people. To be healed from all wounds of the past. Behold old things are past away; all things become new. \"Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life\" (Rom. 6:4, KJV).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After her stepfather leaves, 12-year-old Ivy feels like she's bickering all the time with her Mama, who is trying to keep the family afloat. First her mother makes them join a church to ask for help, and then she lets weird kid Caleb board with them when his guardians move to a town three hours away. Meanwhile, Ivy can't fathom her best friend's sudden desperation to befriend a popular girl and wear new clothes and makeup. Ivy comes across as a strong but genuine seventh grader voicing her legitimate worries without devolving into angst. The characters feel true and the story line never lags. Woodworth anchors the mystery surrounding Caleb's obsession with telling stories about missionaries in Haiti between the adults' ongoing drama and Ivy's friendship ups-and-downs so that questions about the strange boy's background persist, nagging Ivy (and readers) until the conclusion. This is a book with a memorable cast that can be recommended to readers who don't mind adults holding prominent roles in their fiction, e.g., fans of Hilary McKay or Wendy Mass.-Rhona Campbell, Georgetown Day School, Washington, DCα(c) Copyright 2011.

On the surface, LauraJo appears so typical that fellow patients in a mental institution wonder why she’s there. Yet her articulate daybook entries are filled with despair and feelings she can’t quite control, sometimes lurking just beneath her observations. “No one could ask or be more thankful for such a glorious day,” LauraJo writes after one outing. “Then darkness fell, the sun was gone and anxiety, doubt and thoughts of suicide returned. I truly believed earlier in the day that I had it licked.” Self-harm becomes an integral part of her life, as other journal entries mention several failed suicide attempts and the quest for something to make rat poison taste good. Decades after her daughter’s death, Engebrecht’s commentary is the voice of a mother who’s accepted that she’ll never have answers for some questions: “Why didn’t I see evidence of your self-abuse earlier?” she wonders. Whether she’s writing about a flash flood that destroyed the family home in mere minutes or LauraJo’s success as a tennis player and her struggles with her sexuality, Engebrecht lays bare the bones of her own life and her daughter’s. Rare technical slips, like the use of “flower” instead of “flour,” are irrelevant in the face of such honesty.

This is partly true, the fingering system is pretty straight forward and easy to learn, most people can do it inside of a couple hours. Producing a great sound on the saxophone is another matter which will take serious dedication and some time. Unlike many other instruments, there are several variables with the sax that can all contribute seriously to even being able to produce a tone. The position of your mouth, teeth, lips, tongue - what about the reed, is it the proper strength? Is it even a good working reed? Then there is the mouthpiece, and proper breathing. We haven't even mentioned the saxophone yet! A beginner can't obviously know all this or even know if any of these things are right.What I've done in this short, focused, step-by-step course is explain the most important areas that the beginner will face. Most would argue, myself included is the best way to take instrument lessons is with a good qualified instructor face to face.  Since I have recorded lesson videos that relate to the lessons included here, I feel this is the next best way, and a good accompanying guide, even if one is taking personal private lessons because the video concept allows the student to take things slowly and repetitively.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the middle of a speech, Rosselli collapses, shocking his followers. The politician is treated and released from the hospital, but soon after, Cellini, the former cop turned private eye, learns that Rosselli's long-term partner, Flavia, has disappeared, leaving behind their infant son without explanation or clue as to her whereabouts. Sarto, a particularly memorable character, has overcome great struggles to be in a position to help Cellini as the investigation builds to its tragic end. Kent does a fine job setting a mournful tone for this sad book and in conveying the average person's frustrations in the face of endemic government corruption.

Needless to say, that endeavor in seeking publication was 'returned to sender', but she did find success later by winning 2nd place for writing her first full-fledged fictional story by pen at her elementary school competition when she was only six years old.Later, after being homeschooled for the rest of her education, followed by years of putting her true love of writing on hold to join the workforce at the age of 16, Kimberly found love in human form. She married and had her first child when she decided to do what she firmly believes she was created to do; write.

Her father worked within the oil industry and she spent much of her younger years travelling, finishing in Canada, where she attended, and graduated from St John High school in New Brunswick. Her love of the English language was due partly to the inspiration of her English Tutor. An Oxford Don, he despaired of the American/English idioms, and as she was the only English student in the school, found her a delight to teach. Spending another year in working in Canada, life then returned her to England and on to the remote Shetland Isles for three years. Following her return to the UK, she threw herself into Floristry for fifteen years, and her artistic talents took another turn when she picked up a pen for the first time to write her first dragon fantasy novel. It took another ten years and the passing of her artistic father, to discover her talent for painting. Setting out on a new path, she now paints celebrity portraits to raise money for charities. Through Face book in 2010 she met a friend who encouraged her to take up writing again, shortly after this inspiration which rekindled her spiritual beliefs, she met her (writing collaborator and co-conspirator) Keith David. They now combine their sensual words drawn from the depths of their souls, to captivate the imagination, and entice the reader to discover their innermost desires. Virginia, now residing on Madeira Island, Portugal, soon intends a final move to a small town in Texas where inspiration for the Heaven Scent trilogy originated.", "related": [], "rank": 5093791, "title": "Heaven Scented", "author": "Virginia Alison", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The draw to Northern Nevada was strong, and she eventually returned.  Marja wrote a weekly column for a small newspaper in No. Nevada and she was the editor for the Sisters in Crime Internet Newsletter for a year and a half.   Marja has appeared on the morning news in Reno, Nevada, and on The Morning Show on KLBC-TV in Laughlin, Nevada. She’s also been a guest on several radio and Internet radio shows.  Starting with Secrets of Holt House, A Mystery, Marja followed up with A Well-Kept Family Secret - A Sandi Webster Mystery and the beginning of the Sandi Webster series. Bubba’s Ghost, Prudy’s Back!, The Bogey Man and Old Murders Never Die followed. Bogey Nights – A Bogey Man Mystery, the first book in a new series was followed by Bogey’s Ace in the Hole and They Call Me Ace. She says that each of her mysteries contains a little humor, a little romance and a little murder, and that her books concentrate on the characters and solving the crime rather than the crime itself.

Who am I? How can I ask myself questions? There are people who want to know, the audience. I’ve been writing since sixth grade. I’m prolifically unpublished. Why do you write? I write because I want to know how it turns out. I write because it’s my answer to impermanence. I write because I don’t feel like I have a choice. I write because writing helps me know myself. I write because writing helps me keep in touch with my humanity and the humanity of this world. I write because the world has so much suffering. I write because we can all live with more kindness and compassion and grace. I write so that others will know that they’re not alone. I write because it moves me. I write because writing is a gateway to my heart. Nice. That was nice. Thanks. You’re welcome. What do you write about? What gives life meaning? How can we live more fully and with more happiness? That’s it? I write about people realizing the ways in which they have been their own worst enemies, then realizing that they are also their own best friends. I write about the great abyss that all of us are standing before and how we do, or do not, look at it. I write about loss. Of course, what I’m writing about, is my own heart. The struggles, joys, difficulties, loves and hardships of my own heart. Why are you publishing your work yourself? I’m not good at targeting the right market and then sending my writing to the right person. That doesn’t interest me. I just want to write. The business of writing, well, it’s a lot of business. I don’t want to be in business. I want to write. What wants to be written is what gets written What’s the next step for your writing? I’d like to find a publisher and an editor (laughing). Everything I’ve written is very raw. That’s good in its own way. It’s pure. It’s straight from my heart, but I’m very much not an editor. I’m a writer. To me they’re two very different jobs. I write and just let it all come out.  Are you working on any current projects? Always. Until I’m dead.", "related": ["B00DRN6VQY"], "rank": 3448928, "title": "Breathless", "author": "T.

We\nare highly skilled, talented, smart, beautiful female entrepreneurs doing\nbusiness all across this nation, but we are not getting paid what we are worth.\nWe need a bigger paycheck, and we need it now. We are working harder than ever,\nscratching and clawing for every dollar and every opportunity, and yet many of\nus are not making enough money in our businesses to have the kind of lifestyle\nwe want and deserve.In fact, some of us are overdrawn in our checking accounts\nright now, today, and don't know how we are going to pay our bills or keep our\ndoors open. That is not why we went into business for ourselves. We work way\ntoo many hours to face each day with that kind of uncertainty.As female entrepreneurs, we have the drive to want\nmore--no, to demand more--from our businesses. We aren't satisfied with counting\non an employer for a paycheck or validation. We don't mind taking risks in\nexchange for the benefits of being our own bosses. We thrive on the\nindependence that comes with calling the shots, and we have the smarts to find\nways to make it all happen--to achieve success on our own, and on our own terms.And if everything goes according to plan, we expect to reap the financial rewards\nfrom all those long hours invested and risks taken early on. We dream of being\nable to retire in comfort, help our families in times of need, and give back to\nour communities. The truth is, however, some of us are scared to death that we won't\neven be able to help put our kids or grand kids through college. And we are all horrified\nthat we could retire broke.I'm not having it. I'm not going out like that.\nAre you? I didn't think so.Ladies, we are going to have to make a dramatic\nshift in our businesses, and we are going to have to pull together and form\npowerful strategic alliances to make it happen. That means taking what we do\nand what we know to create multiple streams of income, so we canget paid more and work less. In other\nwords, we want to create a smarter, savvier way of doing business that generates\nrevenue almost on auto-pilot. But, we will have to lean on each other, seek\neach other out, leverage our skills, and go where the money is to make it\nhappen.Here we are in 2013, doing business in the fastest\npaced, most globalized economy in the history of the world, and working women in\nAmerica are still only making seventy-seven cents of every dollar made by their\nmale counterparts doing the same type of work.\nI believe this is unfair and is a big problem; but I also have a solution.As\nfemale entrepreneurs, we have to be savvier about doing deals and creating\nopportunities for ourselves and each other. That's what theSavvy Female Marketer™ is all\nabout--helping female entrepreneurs solve their money-making and\ncustomer-getting challenges, and closing that earnings gap while doing it.Women are launching small businesses at record\nrates, yet we struggle with the confidence, capital, and getting access to the\ntransformational advice and training we need to become financially successful. And,\nthat's just crazy, because I know we are doing what it takes to make things\nhappen every single day. If we pull together, empower each other with the\nskills for success--like we do atSavvy\nFemale Marketer™--we can put a dent in this crazy inequality of income.\nSeventy-seven cents of every dollar?! We have to fix this, and we have to fix\nit now by taking charge of our own personal economies. We can each control our\nown destiny, and I want to show you how I'm doing it.I'm a single mom and I live with two powerful ladies, my mother and my daughter, we are a team..I'm sure many of you can relate. It's an amazing and beautiful thing to watch my daughter learn from my mother - her grandma, and for my daughter to get a front row view to witness how me and mom relate and work together, and love one another.I believe, and I hope you will agree, that women...female\nentrepreneurs are the most influential group of women in our nation right now.\nI think that folks are counting on us to use our God-given talents to shake\nthings up a bit.According to a speech given by President Obama last year, female\nentrepreneurs are responsible for 30 percent of American small businesses, and\nthese businesses generate and contribute $1.2 trillion into our economy. Yet, women\ncontinue battling against pay discrimination in the workplace and have a more\ndifficult time securing the small business loans they need to level the playing\nfield, often having to go deeper into personal debt, like with those high\ninterest credit cards, just to stay in the game.I believe women are the engine that can drive\nchange, and we are definitely part of the solution. We deserve to be treated\nwith respect, and we should be celebrated for the contributions we make to\nsociety, like raising the next president of the United States or the next research\nscientist who will find the cure for cancer.Our hard work will continue to\nfuel this nation's economic recovery, but we must have access to better\ninformation, better tools, better training, better coaches that are mentors, better\nadvice, and more money in order to make this happen. And we've got to stiffen\nup a little bit. We've got to be more creative. We've got to think way outside the\nbox. We've got to bring our A-plus-plus-plus game every day and be even savvier\nin how we run our businesses.So, I want to do my part to help us catch up in the money game. I know that corporations are waiting for your call, they have the money, they need our ideas, and I have 20 years of experience of landing partnerships with major corporations, and I want to share that knowledge with you in my book Savvy Female Marketer: How You Can Land Corporate Partnerships to Get Paid More and Work Less. Enjoy!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But Kinza Waneeza maintains her superior craftsmanship and imagination and has put together a recipe book that focuses on Mexican Salads and it is full of unusual treats as well as some fine pointers on the standard cuisine.She starts us off with, oddly enough, a `Mexican Salad' - but this one includes tortilla chips, cheddar cheese, olives, tomatoes and is topped off with an Avocado Dressing that is suitable way beyond the confines of this delicious little salad. Then come her adventuresome (but still easy to prepare and kind to the pocketbook while shopping) salads such as Very Low-Fat Black Bean and Corn Salad, Jalapeno Chicken Salad, Mexican Pasta Salad, Fiesta Cucumber-Corn Salad, a Cilantro-Sour Cream Dressing, Avocado with Cumin Lime Mayo Dressing, Tortilla Ranch Chopped Salad, Jicama with Orange, Cucumber, Mango, Red Chile & Lime, Avocado Mango Salad, Guy's Chipotle-Lime Salad, China Lily Chicken Salad (made with crispy wonton skins and hoisin sauce and ginger etc if you're wondering where the `China' entered the Mexican picture), Mexican Quinoa Salad, and a Mexican Low Fat Citrus Salad Dressing, and then comes Peppers and Black Beans on a Bed of Crunchy Tortilla strips and more and more.Never would anyone believe that Mexican food could be health conscious, but being a nutrition centered chef Kinza has created delicious fare that is healthy all at the same time. And you don't even have to come to California now...", "related": ["B00ED2YVQ0"], "rank": 3635440, "title": "TOP 30 Mexican Salad Recipes: Delicious, Mouth-Watering And Extraordinary Must Eat Salad Recipes Before You Die", "author": "Kinza Waneeza", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Evidently, the rent boy's killer fears Enzo will solve the crime if he ever gets a chance. May makes the French settings sharply real, while creating a seething tangle of emotional conflicts between Enzo and the people around him. By novel's end, the overall plot, like the emotional relationships, isn't really settled, which may feel frustrating—or may hook readers into following the developments of an unusually compelling ongoing saga. Those already familiar with the previous two books in the series,Extraordinary People(2006) andThe Critic(2007), will be at an advantage.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I’ve lived in many places and enjoyed a wide range of experiences in my life.  I learned to shoot at 8 years old. I’ve hunted deer and when shot at by another hunter, decided on another hobby. I’ve  fished in fresh water and on the ocean. Fish don’t shoot back!  I’ve worked on a farm, herded cows on horseback, chopped cotton, stomped silage, bucked hay bales, plowed fields, and milked cows. I played football, basketball, and went out for track. I liked school despite being bored much of the time.  I finished college on my timeline, adding the electives of getting drunk, experiencing hangovers, and chasing young women. I was tested, ‘short armed’ in El Paso, Texas and rejected for flat feet. Eventually I became a school teacher. I completed a master’s degree, got married (45 years), bought and sold property, raised 3 kids, supported dogs, cats, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, a goat, pigs, horses and cows. I have felled big trees, cleared land, and built fences. I have built different kinds of farm structures.   I’ve traveled across twelve of the western states and lived in six of them. I’ve been an archer, a skier, sailed a boat, and paddled my own canoe. I’ve been a smoker and a drinker. I quit smoking but enjoy a glass of wine now and then. I’ve been in more churches than Carter has pills, studied religions, and been “saved” via sprinkle, splash, and dunk.  Well, I got wet anyway.  I bring all of that to my writing.", "related": [], "rank": 2926077, "title": "The New Order (Ambler's Travels #3) eBook", "author": "George Wallace", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In their ambition to universalize their particular visions of Jesus/Christ, both show in fact some sectarian tendencies. Very different, however, from the partisanship that characterizes both camps of the discussion, Adams enters into a theological conversation with both of them - a conversation, interestingly, that Hick and Newbigin themselves, though being active at the same time and in the same city, never had. The outcome is a Christology which is serious about decolonizing universalist concepts such as \"truth\" and \"humanity\", having open membranes towards the otherness around it and, inevitably, is resistant to the temptation of closure. Like all good theology, Adams' theological proposal does not lead us to God but to ourselves and to those around us.

This is quite a blanket statement, but really majority of the adult\nworld population use their bodies in an unhealthy manner. By sitting\nincorrectly, we cause discomfort, pain and illness to ourselves. That's why I\nthink it's more than necessary that we spread word and have people rediscover\nthe way that their bodies were naturally intended to move, especially with\nregard to standing and sitting properly.The very act of sitting down itself, which we typically\ndefine as a \"state of rest,\" has become in modern times, ironically, a source\nof stress and unease for many. And do I really need say the obvious? The many\nhours of work that we do while sitting improperly only aggravate the problem.\nThis is what inspired me to write this book, and through this work I hope I can\nhelp ease the millions, if not billions, of professionals, students and pretty\nmuch everyone who daily undergo such ordeal. Indeed proper sitting is the key\nso that we may have a more graceful, natural and dynamic form. More than\nanything, it can also help us achieve greater health by having our internal\nsystems work optimally and by strengthening our overall build.Proper sitting principles, as I see it, are derived from the\nprinciples common to all types of human movement: standing, running and all\nother activities. For this reason, we will spend several chapters of this book\nexplaining the basics of human movement so that we understand the correct way\nof moving the human body. Although we focus very much on sitting in this book,\nI wish that you will find it holistic enough in the way it touches on other\naspects of human movement.", "related": ["B00DYXLD9W"], "rank": 2089877, "title": "Correct sitting posture: how to sit while working, eating, driving or talking", "author": "Nadav Chaikin-Bentor", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It was very well written much like the style of JK Rowling descriptive enough to where your mind is transported to the fae realm.

I could not put it down till I reached the end of the story because I had to know what happened next.The writing style is wonderful. It a couple of pages to get in the rhythm of the main character's speaking/thinking and get into the head of the young woman's mind but once it took hold I had to hold on tight of the ride the book takes you on.Pick this up, you will love your Kindle till the end!\"5.0 out of 5 stars Enjoyable!, August 19, 2013By Debbie VThis review is from: Earth Child (Romance Novels of The Fae Realm 1) (Kindle Edition)If you like light romance blended with a little fantasy, this book is for you!

Catapulted from sigh-maker in the high-school halls to superstardom in the fashion world, she makes it look easy.  A girl like that has everything; every reason to be happy.  Then why does Lia Copeland just want everyone to leave her the hell alone?Behind the dazzling light of Lia's successes is a dark tale of fear, betrayal and confusion, leaving her with unfathomable anger--and so many questions.  Chief among them: why is apathy threatening to take over her life?  She forces herself to look to both inside and outside sources of the problem, leading her through a maze of emotions and relationships as she carries out her quest.From the friends of Lia's youth--her best friend, Maddie, her tragic kinship with Doug, the tangled love triangle between her, Doug's cousin, Chad, and her pal, Wilson--to her later-day bond with her mentor, Jade, and therapist Ruth, Lia discovers the necessity of friendship and forgiveness in order to reach a life-affirming resolution.A story about the choices made in the wake of travail and tragedy, it explores relationships with all their messy and marvelous moments and magnifies the beauty, wonder and endurance of first love.", "related": [], "rank": 634107, "title": "Flawless eBook", "author": "Jennifer McGill-Sadera", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.625, "rating_total": 37.0}

When Alessandra falls in love with Wyn, a talented musician, they enjoy being together but seem to have very little in common. The relationship is plagued from the beginning by Alessandra's jealousy of Wyn's former girlfriend, Debbie, and when Wyn and Alessandra have the opportunity to spend two days--and nights--alone in New York, Debbie makes a complicating and unwelcome appearance. While the story does have its amusing moments, neither Wyn nor Alessandra comes off as particularly likable characters. Both are self-centered and fairly one dimensional. Wyn's only interests are himself and music, and Alessandra's only interests are herself and Wyn. It's not too easy to identify with these two. But the plot is a tight one, the situations believable, and Alessandra's best friend Melissa is delightful. All in all, a credible offering in the sometimes overwhelming sea of teen romances. --Trish Ebbatson, Delaware County District Library, OhioCopyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 2867803, "title": "Alessandra in Love", "author": "Robert Kaplow", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Many of her teachers encouraged her writing along the way but she didn’t begin to take it seriously until later in life.  An “empty nest” began to make her look at the world through new eyes. Much of her poetry is dream-based.  But some of it is written through personal experience and some through daydreams and desires. Penny also enjoys music and photography.  Currently in the works is a book containing her photography, as well as another book of poems, some short stories and a novel in progress.

Two dozen novels were published from 1924 to 1944 as by Archibald Fielding, A. E. Fielding, or Archibald E. Fielding, yet the only clue as to the real author is a comment by the American publishers, H.C. Kinsey Co. that A. E. Fielding was in reality a “middle-aged English woman by the name of Dorothy Feilding whose peacetime address is Sheffield Terrace, Kensington, London, and who enjoys gardening.”  Research on the part of John Herrington has uncovered a person by that name living at 2 Sheffield Terrace from 1932-1936.  She appears to have moved to Islington in 1937 after which she disappears.  To complicate things, some have attributed the authorship to Lady Dorothy Mary Evelyn Moore nee Feilding (1889-1935), however, a grandson of Lady Dorothy denied any family knowledge of such authorship.  The archivist at Collins, the British publisher, reports that any records of A. Fielding were presumably lost during WWII.  Birthdates have been given variously as 1884, 1889, and 1900.  Unless new information comes to light, it would appear that the real authorship must remain a mystery.", "related": ["B00JI7N986"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He began the work in his first period of imprisonment, and probably finished it during the second. The earliest edition in which the two parts combined in one volume came in 1728. A third part falsely attributed to Bunyan appeared in 1693, and was reprinted as late as 1852. Its full title is The Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which Is to Come.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So it was no wonder that her first writing credit was a featured article in the magazine America’s Civil War. Keogh’s particular interest in the Civil War led her into re-enacting for several years as a field musician. Keogh's most recent time period of historical interest is early colonial America and the age of piracy.  She is crafting a series of novels that center around the adventures of Jack Mallory, a young Englishmen who is both pirate and eventually the patriarch of a large rice plantation in the colonial province of Carolina. Outside of her writing life, Keogh works in the health care field and enjoys travel (preferably to warm places outside of her native Michigan!), the arts, and equestrian activities.", "related": ["B00H2BGCWK"], "rank": 133814, "title": "The Alliance (The Jack Mallory Chronicles Book 2)", "author": "S.K.

This chemical compound is known to erode the mind and cause delusions of grandeur. After several doses the patient is rendered psychologically insane but left with extreme amounts of creativity. Some test subjects in the trial were even able to project their own mental image of themselves externally, resulting in the morphing of size, shape and form. Tex has been documented as one of the prime examples of this and nobody is really sure what he actually looks like. Due to the damage caused by this drug, Tex believes himself to be a self employed spy and travels the world seeking clues to his own origin. He says that there are secret messages encoded in his literary works and that others that have been exposed to the compound will be able to decode it. His residence, is always changing.

Antranig Dereyan was able to capture that feeling perfectly. While reading this novel I felt transported to my own high school, I felt like I was walking the halls of my old classrooms.The characters are simply wonderful, and are really fleshed out. I wanted to hug (or punch) several of them. All of the typical high school characters you expect are here, from the jock to the cheerleader, but they all have added wrinkles, new twists that take the story in unexpected directions.I gave up on trying to figure out where the story was going, the author managed to consistently elude my expectations, consistently keeping me on the edge of my seat. Would they make up? Would he get the nerve to ask her? I'm not sure how the author did it, but these normally tired clichés somehow felt fresh and new.The pacing was overall very decent. It is tight and precise when needed, but slower and more methodical when the story called for it. I especially like the fight sequence, I was somehow simultaneously inside Sev's head and a member of the audience at the same time. I had to reread the entire segment before I was able to move on.I was worried about the parts involving drugs, but the author was able to expertly weave them into the story so that it felt like a natural progression, not like a tacked on afterthought. It got a little darker than I personally like, but my tolerance for the topic is probably much higher than most.I'm not afraid to admit that I cried during a few later scenes. I highly recommend it as the ride is worth it.", "related": [], "rank": 1708470, "title": "High School Society of One", "author": "Antranig Dereyan", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 25.0}

Her laptop is falling apart, her voice recognition software can't understand a word she says, and she is the intimidated new owner of a 770 page book called Social Media Marketing for Dummies.  If the shoe fits. . . Tug of Love is Glynnis' third book.   Her first book \"Dig Deeper: A Murder on Captiva Island\" finds the protagonist, her husband, and her lovable hound, discovering a dead body.   Her husband had a shouting match with the victim earlier on the day of the murder and becomes the prime suspect.  She and her friends 'dig deeper' into the murder victims past in an attempt to track down the real killer before the Homicide Detective throws her husband in prison for a crime he didn't commit.                           ********* Her second book, \"Youngtimer\", is a middle grade book and features a thirteen (going on thirty) protagonist whose beloved Grampa dies and leaves her a time machine!  She is fearless and ready for great adventures with her BFF (if she can talk her into it!).  One of her solo adventures backfires, as she changes something in the past that will affect her future, and not in a good way. Youngtimer is a series. The second book in the series - \"Youngtimer: Time Flies When You're Having Fun\" will be coming out in the summer of 2014.", "related": ["B00JDTRPFW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a scientist when I\nwas working in a hospital, I always head a deadline. I had 45 minutes with a\npatient, and I had a list to get through. Every patient's appointment was a\ndeadline. I have had to learn that I cannot bring that attitude with me into my\nwriting life, even if something takes longer than my originally intended plan. I can see now that\npatience is the only way forward with this journey.What are you working on right now? I am currently working on a dystopian series called The Dawn.  The first in the series will be released in the next couple of months, and I am really excited to get that out into the world.  The first in the series is subtitled 'The Bombs Fall'.  I am working on the cover with my designer right now, and I am excited by the concept art that she has shown me!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.375, "rating_total": 35.0}

A pesar de contar con una serie de elementos abiertamente fantásticos —dragones, videntes, hechiceros y seres que se metamorfosean—, la obra de Martin da la sensación de estar fundamentada en la realidad brutal de la Edad Media. El resultado es un éxito con mente y corazón, un libro sin parangón en la historia de la literatura fantástica”.The Washington Post “Martin escribe fantasía para adultos con una mundanalidad cruda y franca… Es un derviche literario, cautivado por personajes complicados y un lenguaje vívido que enaltece la visión salvaje de los mejores relatores…Danza de dragones, sin duda, está a la altura de los estándares que sentaron sus cuatro hermanos mayores. Y, al igual que las mejores sagas, no le da un respiro emocional al lector, pues concluye con múltiples interrogantes incisivas, a medida que las pesadas ruedas de la fortuna se ponen en movimiento”.The New York Times “En 2005 escribí una reseña en la que llamaba a Martin ‘el Tolkien americano’. En ese momento creía que era el maestro de la fantasía épica de nuestros tiempos: ahora, seis años después, al leerDanza de dragones, confirmé con gran placer que tenía razón: la destreza literaria de Martin excede la de cualquier novelista actual... Leer una novela es un poco parecido a comandar un ejército: siempre se está explorando y reconociendo el terreno para intentar adivinar hacia dónde irá el autor, así como descifrar qué es finta y qué indica la verdadera dirección hacia donde se dirige la acción. No sé cuántas veces antes de leer a Martin me he sentido superado en términos de estrategia de una forma tan contundente: en cada turno, Martin sube las apuestas, incluso cuando los otros escritores han abandonado la mesa. Y cuando uno cree que se retirará… lo apuesta todo”.
