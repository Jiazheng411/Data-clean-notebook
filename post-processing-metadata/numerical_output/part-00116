In the first half of the book, a sexually  voracious architect prowls the dark corners of New York looking for some action  before he heads back to his frigid L.A. wife. In the second half, a prostitute's  grisly rape-murder engages the attention of the guys (and girl) in blue. What's  the connection between the murdered woman and the obsession-ridden architect? A  string of coincidences that make the reader expect a surprise ending, of course.  But it doesn't happen, which makes one wonder why the two authors (who happen to  be the same person) bothered with the gimmick. Still, both Ed McBain (author of  the 87th Precinct novels) and Evan Hunter (his more literary and much sexier  incarnation) are old pros, so the pacing, character development, and thorough  knowledge of police procedure and human nature that mark this tidy little  mystery make it a pleasant enough diversion. A new McBain or Hunter is always  cause for celebration, andCandyland, which is a lot grittier than most  police procedurals, will titillate their many fans until either (or both) comes  through with a new thriller. The distinct narrative voices of the multitalented  writer are on view here; although the writing styles aren't different enough to  make it more than a parlor trick, the result is still twice as good as most of  the season's new offerings.--Jane Adams", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kat feels she can't talk to her parent without getting a lecture or instructions on what she should be doing, and that she is always doing something wrong. But with the help of one of her mother's clients, Kat sees herself and her mom in a new light. This book covers topics that are familiar to most readers of YA fiction, but most of the characters are well developed and the themes are addressed in a fresh manner. Kat is generally confident and secure, and the relationships among the characters are generally realistic and well rounded.

Muttering a curse, she wheeled around to wear another rut in the imported carpet.Her younger sister, Lydia, had left earlier that afternoon and she hadn't said where she was going or when she'd be back. Now it was dark and Evangeline was worried. She had the uneasy feeling that something was amiss.A loud wail erupted near the front door. The sound echoed through the tiled foyer and bounced off the walls. Evangeline whirled around to race to the study door.She stared incredulously at Lydia's disheveled coiffure, tear-stained eyes and puffy face. \"Dear God, what happened to you?\"Dirt soiled Lydia's expensive pink gown. The pristine lace—that was now a dingy shade of brown—was snagged with leaves and twigs and drooped noticeably over the torn ruffles.\"Oh, Eva, I'm such a fool!\" Lydia burst out as she flung herself into Eva's arms.The sobs and howls commenced in earnest—the outpouring of emotion that had apparently sustained Lydia until she reached the safe haven of their lavish mansion. She clung to Eva as if she was a lifeline and she proceeded to bawl her head off.Eva let her sister vent her anguish for several minutes before guiding her to the sofa that sat perpendicular to the bookshelves that stretched from floor to ceiling of the north wall. Although Lydia refused to release her hand—and nearly squeezed off the blood flow to her fingers—Eva didn't complain. She had spent years nursing Lydia through one melodramatic, emotional ordeal after another because she had assumed the role of mother, father and older sister.This high drama, however, seemed to be more serious than usual for Lydia.\"You were right about him,\" Lydia blubbered, then dragged in a shuddering breath. \"I was an imbecile to believe him.\"Him,Eva presumed, was the suave, smooth-talking gentleman who had been courting Lydia and escorting her to Denver's elite social functions for the past three months.Eva tensed as she reassessed her sister's tattered gown. \"If Gordon Carter forced himself on you—\"Lydia flung up a trembling hand that sported three broken fingernails. \"Worse!\"Eva's dark brows elevated. \"Worse than ravishing you?\"Lydia bobbed her head, sending shiny waves of auburn hair tumbling from her lopsided coiffure to cascade haphazardly over her shoulders. \"He broke my heart, stole my buggy and my favorite horse and he swiped my money!\" she cried in distress.Eva went perfectly still, her mind racing back through time to reevaluate Lydia's rather peculiar behavior this past week. She had been in and out of the mansion without bothering to inform Eva or the servants when she planned to return. If Eva hadn't been preoccupied— fending off a particularly persistent suitor—she might have paid more attention.Shouldhave paid attention, she chastised herself. It was her sworn duty to protect and care for Lydia. She had solemnly promised her father that she would, after he fell ill suddenly then died.Lydia wiped her eyes with the back of her grimy hand, sniffled loudly then glanced toward the imported grandfather clock that graced the corner. \"Gordon and I were going to elope because he said you wouldn't approve and you were jealous because you were interested in him. He said we had to be clever and discreet. He said you would be outraged if you weren't the first to wed.\"\"What!\" Eva scrambled to control her temper then gnashed her teeth, wishing she could take several bites out of Gordon's conniving hide. \"I never had any interest in that scoundrel. It was plain to me that he was insincere. He made all the right noises, in his dedicated effort to impress you and others in our social circle, but I didn't trust his intentions. The fact that he tried to pityouagainstmeis one more reason why I dislike him.\"\"It worked to some extent,\" Lydia admitted on a ragged breath. \"He suggested that I gather plenty of funds so we could elope—\" Her voice broke and she half collapsed on the couch. \"Oh, Eva, I'm so humiliated I could die! Gordon insisted that we shouldn't bother with luggage so no one would suspect a thing. With my satchel of money we headed south to Canyon Springs to be married.\"Hot fury boiled through Eva's veins as she visualized that silver-tongued, self-serving bastard luring her naive sister beneath his spell. At nineteen, Lydia hadn't learned to be wary and cautious of shysters who sought to separate her from her inheritance. She had fallen for Gordon's flattery and premeditated charm. His scheme had been to divide and conquer the Hallowell sisters so he could manipulate Lydia. Damn that lying, cheating bastard! He would be punished severely for this, she fumed.Although Eva was silently condemning Gordon Carter to the farthest reaches of hell, she reined in her anger to listen to the rest of the infuriating tale.\"Then what happened?\" she questioned intently.Lydia rerouted the tears on her flushed cheeks, dabbed at her eyes with her dirty sleeve and finally met Eva's unblinking gaze. \"Gordon stopped the buggy in the middle of nowhere and shoved me out. He claimed that he was bored with my childish prattle, and I should walk back home because marrying me was the very last thing on his list of what to do with the rest of his life…\"Her voice fizzled out and humiliated wails erupted. Lydia flung herself facedown on the sofa, sprawling in emotional defeat. A few moments later, she raised her tousled head and clutched Eva's hand again, accidentally scratching her with jagged fingernails.\"I'm dreadfully sorry I listened to Gordon's lies. He kept telling me that you were spiteful, stifling and envious because I was happy and you weren't. Since you discouraged me from seeing him I thought it might be true.\"Eva shook her head adamantly. \"You should have known better, Lydia. I have sworn off men for good reason. I can guarantee that I will never be jealous of my own sister. I want you to be happy, but you need to realize that adventurers will always set their sights on you because you have access to a fortune. That's why we have to be so wary and selective of men.\"Lydia nodded and sniffled. \"I understand that now, but Gordon kept telling me that he loved me and he'd never met anyone like me. Then his sugary tone changed to disdain once he had my money, my carriage and Hodge. You know how much I adore that horse. He was my last gift from Papa.\"Eva promised herself, there and then, that she would hunt down that vermin and see to it that he was poisoned, stabbed, shot and strung up by his heels. Then she would haul his sorry carcass to jail for the duration of his life.\"From now on I'm going to be just like you,\" Lydia said determinedly. \"I'll never again trust a man with my heart or my money.\"\"I regret that you had to find out the hard way that our family fortune is a burden and a curse. It attracts the wrong kind of men.\" A faint smile pursed Eva's lips as she brushed the tendrils from Lydia's face and met her watery gaze. \"For us, Lydia, all men are the wrong kind of men. They will always want what wehave,not who weareon the inside. They want our prestigious connections, not our companionship. The only way I've found not to be hurt, disappointed or taken advantage of is to guard my heart carefully. You must look beneath the charming smiles and calculated flattery to determine a man's sincerity.\"Lydia nodded her head. \"I know you speak from experience because you were so sad three years ago and—\"\"Past is past and I never look back,\" she interrupted. \"I prefer to profit from my mistakes, not repeat them.\"Although Lydia insisted on talking her unpleasant experiences to death, Eva preferred to keep them buried. The man who taught her not to trust, not to expose her heart to pain, was a closed chapter of her life. If she never saw him again, that would be perfectly fine with her. Unfortunately, Felix Winslow owned a successful local jewelry shop— thanks to his new wife's financial backing. He showed up often with his young bride at parties and Eva had taught herself to look through him as if he wasn't there.When the grandfather clock chimed ten times, Eva glanced up. She tapped Lydia on the shoulder then urged her to her feet. \"Why don't you go upstairs and I'll have a warm bath prepared for you. I need to go out for a while, but I'll return shortly.\"Lydia levered herself upright and managed the faintest hint of a smile. \"If you are off to shoot that lying scoundrel I'll send you out with my blessing, but I know he's headed toward Canyon Springs, and probably to parts unknown. Finding him will be next to impossible.\"\"You're right. Iwouldlike to shoot him a couple of times for hurting you,\" Eva insisted. \"It's the only purpose the men in our lives can possibly serve. Target practice.\"Lydia snickered but her expression sobered when she surveyed the irreparable damage to her expensive gown. \"This was to have been my wedding dress.\"\"Burn it,\" Eva recommended. \"That's what I did with the one I wore the last time I was with Felix Winslow. I imagined him in it while it burned to ashes.\"Lydia shrugged, and when Lydia trudged up the staircase, Eva sailed out the front door. She jogged down the street to the Philbert estate. Roger and Sadie Philbert— twin brother and sister—were her lifelong playmates and friends. The blond-haired, blue-eyed twosome was returning from a party and they stepped down from their coach just as Eva hurried up the flagstone driveway.\"Rather late to be gadding out in men's breeches, isn't it?\" Roger teased as he appraised her unconventional attire.Eva glanced down, having forgotten that she was still wearing the garments she had donned for horseback riding, while attempting to track down her missing sister.She shrugged carelessly in response to Roger's playful grin. \"Y...", "related": ["B00ERBW21S"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While Laurel's voice certainly has the volume needed to sing opera, she is unable to carry a tune, and after several unsuccessful tries, she is told in no uncertain terms that she will never be hired, no matter how much she practices.  Discouraged but not defeated, Laurel comes to the humbling realization that her alternatives are very limited.  Thus, when Chance Rafferty offers her a job singing for miners and gamblers in his saloon, the Aurora Borealis, Laurel accepts on the condition that singing is all she will be required to do. Chance Rafferty has no idea why he hired Laurel.  She can't sing worth a hoot, her womanly attributes don't even come close to filling out the satin dresses he provides for her, and to top it off, she is constantly preaching about the evils of drinking and gambling.  Add to that negative list the fact that she has somehow drawn the attention of the town=s most notorious and dangerous pimp, and Chance now has a full-time job protecting the saloon-singing sweetheart's virtue.  But who's going to protect her not-until-I'm-married virtue from him?  And who's going to protect his live-for-the-moment heart from her? The Aurora Borealis is home to a menagerie of social misfits, including a black couple, Bertha and Jup, who are substitute parents for Chance and his childlike cousin, Whitey; Pearl and Flora Sue, the barmaids who earn a little extra money in the upstairs rooms; Bull, the bartender, who somehow manages to gain the ire of a local temperance worker; and Percy, the bar's resident parrot, who cusses like a drunken miner, but does so with wonderfully impeccable (and embarrassing) timing.  When taken into consideration that this unlikely group is Chance's adopted family and that he takes care of and provides jobs for all of them, it's not surprising to the reader that Chance also takes Laurel in.  It also comes as no surprise to the readers that Laurel slowly eases her way into Chance's heart without even trying, but it sure as heck surprises Chance, and he does everything he can think of to deny that he is Laurel's Prince Charming, complete with white charger.Sweet Laurel is the second book in Millie's Flowers of the West trilogy.  Packed with well-drawn characters who don't act entirely as expected and aren't quite what they appear, Sweet Laurel delivers the romance in typical, humorous Criswell style.  Ms. Criswell includes snippets about the other Flowers in her trilogy, Heather and Rose, in the form of letters written to Laurel.  The stories are happening simultaneously, and these sisterly letters will make the reader anxious to complete the entire series. Millie Criswell's romantic style keeps the reader happily turning pages. Ms. Criswell writes with humor and love, creating characters and situations that charm the reader into believing. Flowers are more romantic when delivered by Millie Criswell.Gerrie Shepard  --Copyright © 1994-97 Literary Times, Inc.

(pop. 100,000), seems overwhelmed with a spate of crimes. But as this busy and engaging mystery quickly shows, the unassuming officer can, with a little help from his six amiable detectives, rise to the challenge. Rowdy's Bar has been robbed, and Babe Krueger, the bar's owner and Jake's old pal, was left bound and gagged in the basement. Suspicion immediately falls on Babe's surly son Randy and his disreputable friends. When Babe and Randy's bodies are found tied together three days later in a river, the case takes on a more sinister air. Jake's team, all enthusiastic novices, lend their skills (photography, fingerprinting, etc.) and fan out through the city in a widening investigation that just might tie in with some other problems, including a child's kidnapping and a thriving drug ring. Jake's mounting frustration with his increasing case load lends urgency to the narrative; he is particularly puzzled when an unlikely pair pleads guilty to the bar robbery. This second Jake Hines adventure (after Triple Play) starts slowly and wraps up implausibly, but clever writing, zesty action and a simmering romance carry the day.

Both the Old Testament and New Testament recount the tales of a group of specially favored people elected by God to receive providential blessings if they will follow God's teachings. Yet as Spina points out in what is unfortunately a pedantic and unconvincing book, the Bible also includes the stories of outsiders who teach this community of insiders about faith in God. Not all of the outsiders he discusses are foreigners, for Esau, Tamar (by marriage) and Achan are insiders whose acts bestow outsider status upon them, but whose stories teach insiders valuable lessons about God's work in the world. Ruth, Rahab (the Canaanite prostitute who helped Joshua conquer Jericho) and the woman at the well in the Gospel of John are true outsiders—that is, not Israelites—who provide lessons in faith. For example, Rahab offers a model of trust in God that can teach insiders about God's all-embracing love. Despite the book's excellent premise, Spina's superficial reflections offer few interesting insights, and he fails to provide any clear arguments about why and how the outsiders have an impact on the insiders.(Mar.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Readers initially may find it difficult to warm to prickly, rash Snowbone, but many will grow to appreciate her complexity, despite some wobbly plot developments (in particular, her plan to help slaves transform into trees, rendering them useless as laborers, doesn't feel as much like true freedom as one might have wished). This stand-alone adventure ultimately rests upon Weatherill's rollicking storytelling: As rooted in the oral tradition as Brian Jacques' Redwall novels, the epic battle drama comes with cozy interludes, and it's all broken into short, exciting chapters ideal for sharing aloud. As in Barkbelly, Peter Brown provides occasional, full-page drawings, not available in the galley.

The first-person narrative of Baltimore doctor William Chivers, a childhood friend of Poe, alternates with the third-person account of Irish rabble-rouser Finn Devlin. Dr. Chivers, who attends the famous author after his collapse in 1849 that in real life led to his demise, agrees to help Poe evade his enemies by colluding in a scheme to fake his death. The plot thickens after Devlin slaughters Charles Dickens's U.S. publisher in a manner reminiscent of one of Poe's tales and later kidnaps Dickens, who's on tour in America. Poe fans may find his prolonged absence from the action not compensated for by the extended portrayal of the tormented Chivers. Still, Gray does a fine job of evoking his mid–19th-century milieu.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With all the books about World War II history, there is still not much for teens about the occupation of Norway and the resistance that took place there. Fuller tells part of the story through the experience of one brave boy, Gunnar Haines, just 12 in 1940. Gunnar's older brother joins the underground resistance in the mountains, but Gunnar takes risks right in his own neighborhood. He steals a gun from an SS officer, then working as an errand boy in a hotel, he steals a precious radio. Several times he crawls under the fence of a POW camp to bring bread to starving Russians. The writing style is dull and ponderous, overloaded with detail and heavy commentary, but war buffs, including adults, will read this for the adventures, the picture of ordinary life during occupation, and, yes, the detail.

He discusses the remarkable transformation of a military dominated by one sector of society--the Christian communities, and particularly the Maronites--into one that is characterized by power sharing among Lebanon's various communities, large families, and regions. The book develops a new approach to the study of the role of the military in divided societies by examining military institutions from three intertwined angles: first, as major arenas for social coexistence and conflict; second, as actors that are involved in politics but are also affected by political processes; and third, as actors that promote the process of state formation. This comprehensive look at Lebanon will inform the discussion of other divided societies, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that face the dual challenge of restoring the political system and the security sector after state failure and intrastate conflict.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My other full-time job for the past 10 years has been maintaining 3 of the top websites on different aspects of consciousness. Near Death Experience Research Foundation (NDERF) studies the near death experience. www.nderf.org . We have thousands of people who have submitted their experiences from all over the world. We also have over 250 translators who have translated major portions of the website into over 20 different languages in an ongoing effort to share the message of love, peace and unity with the world. The other two websites are After Death Communication Research Foundation (ADCRF) where people submit their after death communication experiences for study. www.adcrf.org  The Out of Body Research Foundation (OBERF) studies everything else that is not a NDE or an ADC, such as out of body experiences, power of prayer, spiritually transformative events and much more. www.oberf.org  Between all the websites it is fascinating to discover the vast expanse of the human psyche! In my spare time, one of my hobbies is jewelry making. www.jewelrybyjody.com. This is my place of \"flow\" where creativity meets spirit. I found that I had so many necklaces, that I needed to put them on a website for sale. That way the hobby can continue to fund more of the hobby :)  I also enjoy working with my dog - Zara.

These two enthusiastically rid themselves of their sexual  anxieties and their virginities. For Lol\", pregnancy ensues; for  Father Alonso, a crisis of vocation.

During her journey in counseling clients, one of the valuable tools which she uses is dream interpretation.  She does this on a down-to-earth level, applying humor, compassion and examples from daily life experiences to illuminate the messages which often comes to us during the sleep state.   She uses samples from her own files to illustrate how to make sense of what the psyche is trying to tell us about ourselves. In  \"I DREAMT I WAS NAKED (How To Interpret Your Dreams),\"  she guides us through the process of remembering, recording, and then interpreting our dreams.  According to Tessie, you don't need a college degree and an I.Q. of 150 to understand yourself. You only need to pay attention to what your inner self is telling you through the dreams which come to you every night.   Because the language, images and symbols which come to you are filtered by the psyche according to your personal vocabulary, knowledge and experiences, you are the best person in the world to interpret such messages for your daily guidance. Tessie considers herself an eternal student of our multi- and inter-dimensional existence.  Since humans use only about 10% of the brain potential, her feeling is... why not try to expand that percentage? Through the course of her exploration of the ever-fascinating workings of the Universe, she has studied Numerology, Astrology, Feng Shui, Palmistry, Face-Reading, Tarot-Card-Reading, Handwriting Analysis and the Native American lore of power animals.  In addition, she taught Numerology at Los Angeles City College as part of their Community Services program. Tessie's goal in this book, and throughout her life, is to illuminate her path and the path of others so that all the wondrous possibilities of existence can be experienced to the utmost potential. Please go to her website, www.tessiejayme.com, to learn more about Tessie's other projects.", "related": ["B004UJCE0G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Minority-serving institutions (MSIs) enroll and graduate the majority of students of color in the United States and traditionally include historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, tribal colleges, and more recently Asian American- and Pacific Islander-serving institutions. The book's contributors focus on several issues, including institutional mission, faculty governance, student engagement, social justice, federal policy, and accreditation. They critically analyze the scholarship on MSIs, not only describing the existing research and stressing what is missing, but also providing new lines of thought for additional research.\"This book is a much-needed contribution to the literature about minority issues in higher education and MSIs in particular. It adds to our understanding about where MSIs have been and where they are likely to go, and will be enormously useful to the national dialogue about improving both the quality and accessibility of American higher education in the coming years.\" -- Jamie P. Merisotis, President, Institute for Higher Education Policy\"This robust collection provides an exemplary introduction to MSIs. With passion and scholarly acumen, this diverse and engaging book offers multiple perspectives on the contributions as well as challenges and opportunities facing these institutions--and brings attention to institutions that have often remained largely invisible on the landscape of higher education.\" -- Clifton Conrad, University of Wisconsin at Madison\"This is an engaging, insightful, and masterfully crafted book. The editors deserve praise for assembling such a respectable cast of scholars and producing a book that will surely become the seminal text on MSIs. This book adds tremendous value, illuminates critical trends and issues, and dispels several faulty assumptions regarding MSIs.\" -- Shaun R.

In Date Night, we’re treated to ten encounters between the lovely lesbian and her equally luscious partner Cassie.Dale begins with the couple preparing for that ever familiar but oh-so-favorite setting: The masquerade party. A sense of the deep intimacy and emotion between the two is instantly evoked, and the romantic interlude that follows at the event seems not only natural but inevitable.Dale takes the couple in some interesting directions – up to the top of the ferris wheel at the county fair, onto the mini golf course, across the country and into the fancy boxed seats at the opera. But whether Jen and Cassie are dancing in a coffee shop or snuggling under surprising star lit skies, the same strong love keeps shining through.Extremely well done characterization explores Cassie’s tortourous mix of confidence and insecurity. The same woman who takes dance classes and dons stripper attire to dance for her beloved is knocked for a loop when Jen runs into a former lover. At the same time, Jen finds herself surprised by her own possessiveness. Dale does a masterful job working these deeper themes throughout the entire work, subtly using snippets of dialog to catalog the emotional evolution.Date Night can be read on two levels: as a delightful erotic romp, or as a careful study of two women in love. It succeeds on both levels. Dale is to be commended.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has written a number of plays, screenplays and, most recently, novels. Massara lives in Sydney, Australia, with all of her novel characters crammed inside her head waiting to come out and express themselves. As a multi-genre author, Massara draws on her varied experience from having worked in the field of human resources across many industries including the glamorous world of hotels.One of Massara's favourite genres is romance -- romantic comedy -- and she has a soft spot for older chicks who are in their 40s and beyond. One of her novels, \"The Other Boyfriend\", is loosely based on her own life experience whilst she lived in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Massara followed through with \"Like Casablanca\", another romantic comedy about internet dating, and she drew on some of her own experiences as she went in search of \"the one\" (whom, by the way, she never found). On a more serious note, Massara wrote a very touching general fiction drama, \"The Soul Bearers\", which touches on issues of child abuse, AIDS and gay rights; a story inspired by real life events and filled with hope and inspiration when overcoming fear, loss, and betrayal while learning to live and love again. At present, the novel is under consideration for adaptation into a feature film.An avid fan of classic black and white Hollywood movies of the 40s including film noir, Massara has recently embarked on a contemporary mystery series whose protagonist is an older, spunky and wiseass chick at 48, and who works in the international world of hotels. The theme is comedic, sprinkled with a little bit of film noir, and the stories are fast-paced and set in the modern day world. The first novel in the series is \"Playing With The Bad Boys\" -- A Mia Ferrari mystery. Massara is now working on her second mystery \"The Gay Mardi Gras Murders\".", "related": ["B004LLIGNM"], "rank": 2864751, "title": "Like Casablanca", "author": "Sylvia Massara", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.1429, "rating_total": 29.0}

He founded a missionary hospital in Bannu in the North-West Frontier of British India, now Pakistan. For his work he received the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal for Public Service in India. In addition, to this book, he wrote \"Things Seen in Northern India\". He died of septicemia on March 23, 1912 at age 45 in his own hospital at Bannu. He has probably contracted that disease from the patients in his hospital. He had married a lady doctor from India. His work was carried on by his wife, Alice Maud Sorabji Pennell, who wrote several biographies of her late husband, including \"Pennell of the Afghan frontier : The life of Theodore Leighton Pennell\", A hero of the Afghan frontier: The splendid life story of T.L. Pennell ... retold for boys & girls,  and Pennell of the Afghan frontier: The life of Theodore Leighton Pennell, M.D., B. SC., F.R.C.S. Kaisar-i-Hind medal for public service in India. As Mrs. Theodore Pennell, she also wrote \"Children of the Border\" and \"The Begum's Son\" but none of her books achieved the fame of her husband's work, \"Among The Wild Tribes Of The Afghan Frontier: A Record Of Sixteen Years' Close Intercourse With The Natives Of The Indian Marches\". Bannu was then and is now regarded as one of the most dangerous places in the world. It is right next to the Tribal Area of Pakistan, a lawless region where every man carries a gun. It is now the scene of the heaviest fighting between the US and Pakistan Armies vs. The Taliban and Al-Qaeda.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hairy moments with fog and large barges on the mighty river Rhine, along with strong currents, huge waves and massive locks, test the skipper's maritime skills to the limit. Finding somewhere suitable to berth, endless documentation requiring an official stamp from local customs officers (limited English spoken) and their often incompetent police counterparts are a regular occurrence. Time-wasting bureaucratic practices, however, are quickly overlooked when a bottle of whiskey is produced. Surprisingly, we learn little about Brown s on-board life and even less about his relationship with the crew. All appear to work together and contribute to a successful voyage. Included in a series of appendices are details of the ship s log and list of yacht havens, hotels and restaurants used en route. The book, which is well-written, has an attractive cover, plus a section of coloured photographs. A good read and well worth the cover price. --The Self Publishing Magazine", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Using his experience as a U.S. Naval officer, and his extensive experience in the aerospace industry, he began his first novel in 1976 with a story about an attempt by North Korean special forces to hijack a U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier. Fifteen years later Raid On Truman was published in hardbound and paperback and was translated into Japanese for hardbound and paperback sales in Japan. That was the fulfillment of a dream to become a published novelist. He sold a second novel on the heels of the first. COBRA DANE was published in paperback in 1995. A third novel, Sub Zero, quickly followed and was published in 1996 along with publication in Japan. John has written four more novels, Vauclain’s Shield, Hidden Sun, These Final Hours, and The Telekinetic Man and a screenplay derived from The Telekinetic Man and is in the process of trying to sell them.  Another book was published in 2003 just before the Iraqi War. Desert War was a nonfiction look at how the war might be conducted, weapons systems, intelligence gathering, and forces on both sides. While John was the author, his daughter, Christine researched the work.  Influenced initially by the works of Ian Fleming and his brand of no-holds-barred action and intrigue, John has tried to bring to readers that same action elements, but with a large dose of sobering reality. Violence has profound consequences and the characters within John's novels feel all the passion and agony of real people. Raid On Truman, COBRA DANE, Sub Zero, Vauclain's Shield, These Final Hours, The Telekinetic Man, and Hidden Sun are available on Amazon's Kindle Store. Note that COBRA DANE has for its cover image a picture of the actual COBRA DANE radar on the island of Shemya in the Aleutians. Vauclain's Shield's cover image has a photo of actual reentry vehicles passing through the atmosphere over Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific, and Raid On Truman has a real picture of the USS Harry Truman taken by the author.         A collection of fourteen sci-fi/horror/paranormal short stories, A Case of the Vapors was added to the Kindle store in August 2013. These stories run the gamut from the humorous A Case of the Vapors to the somber, but hopeful, The Iron Sergeant.

While the action of the poem is intense and demanding, the painterly illustrations by Harrison are overwhelmingly powerful; they seem to take on a life of their own, drawing readers' attentions away from the text and toward the surrealistic interpretation of events. With ice-cold blues and violets, accented by vibrant reds and yellows, Harrison creates a pulsating world of hate and destruction; it's a fascinating interpretation of a well-known poem about the frustrations and splendors of the Canadian Gold Rush.

Regan (public affairs, George Mason Univ.) examines congressional policymaking regarding privacy in three areas: information services (computerized databases), wiretapping, and polygraph testing. She has two goals: to explain how policy is formulated and adopted and to examine the reasons why the public often fails to support legislative attempts at protecting privacy. While other books have been written on specific aspects of privacy, such as Alan Westin's Privacy and Freedom (LJ 5/1/67) and David O'Brien's Privacy, Law, and Public Policy (Praeger, 1979), Regan believes that these works fail to identify a concept of privacy upon which legislation can be effectively grounded. She argues that we err when we define privacy by emphasizing the individual's interests and rights. Regan suggests, instead, that privacy serves common public interests and that recognition of these shared interests would form the basis of stronger public policy. While this is an academic study, developed out of Regan's doctoral dissertation and her research interests, it is recommended to an educated general audience.?Jerry E.

Smith was educated at a state school before reading Latin at the University of Reading in the early 1970s. After a spell as a journalist in local radio in Manchester, she joined the staff of the Sunday Times in 1979 and stayed at the newspaper until 1984. She has had a regular column in the Guardian Weekend supplement, also freelancing for the newspaper and in recent years has contributed to The Independent, the Independent on Sunday, and the New Statesman. In her non-fiction Smith displays a commitment to atheism, feminism and republicanism; she has travelled extensively and this is reflected in her articles. In 2003 she was offered the MBE for her services to PEN, but refused the award. She is a supporter of the political organisation, Republic and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society. In November 2011 she gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into press and media standards following the telephone hacking practiced by the News of the World. She testified that she considered celebrities thought they could control press content if they put themselves into the public domain when, in reality the opposite was more likely. She repeated a claim that she has persistently adhered to in her writings that the press is misogynistic", "related": ["B00K0XZX8G"], "rank": 300464, "title": "A Masculine Ending (Loretta Lawson)", "author": "Joan Smith", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In other words, it is an excellent introduction not only to metaphysics in general but also to Parmenides, Aristotle, Duns Scotus, Descartes, Schelling, Heidegger, and more.(Michael King, University of Reading)I know of no other book that gives such a subtle and often original reading of the major moments in the history of metaphysics and does so with the aim of elucidating the nature, scope, and future of metaphysics.(Francisco J. Gonzalez, University of Ottawa)We have no modern historical and reliable introduction to the history and paradoxes of metaphysics: either we have old-fashioned, neo-scholastic handbooks; partial, un-historical essays in the analytical style; or brilliant yet enigmatic 'deconstructionist' essays. We desperately need a sound, scholarly, up-to-date, and lucid approach to this subject: a historical and, at the same time, speculative description of the doctrines and living questions in this field. Jean Grondin'sIntroduction to Metaphysicsis the perfect match for those challenges.(Jean-Luc Marion)This book is directed toward those analytic and continental philosophers who still believe it is possible to think independently of our metaphysical tradition, that is, of Being. Heidegger, Rorty, and Vattimo show us that metaphysics is impossible to overcome yet can only be surpassed, that is, weakened and incorporated into the event of our own thoughts. Given this new task for philosophy, Jean Grondin's text must be studied carefully by anyone who wants to become a philosopher in the twenty-first century.(Santiago Zabala, ICREA Research Professor at the University of Barcelona)Knowledgeable and thought-provoking -- Grondin tells us, from a Continental point of view, a compelling story of metaphysics.(Vittorio G. Hösle, University of Notre Dame)Grondin is the best expert on Gadamer and hermeneutic philosophy, and a leading scholar on Kant and Heidegger. For some ten years, he has been publishing on broad issues like religion and the meaning of life. He has now produced a masterly synthesis on metaphysics that makes a powerful case for its present relevance.(Rémi Brague, University of Paris 1--Panthéon-Sorbonne)", "related": ["B0050YV1R2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Many\ntourists use Colombo as quick stop over without realizing how much they've\nreally skipped. The city is small, but is a great way for travelers to get acquainted\nwith Sri Lankan culture. I had the pleasure of staying at the Cinnamon Lakeside\nHotel (previously known as the TransAsia Hotel), and I can attest to its\nmodern, elegant décor and thoughtful staff. Restaurants in Colombo proved to be\ndiverse and delicious. Expatriated restaurateurs have helped revamp the dining\nscene, and prices seem to be fair across the board. Unlike restaurants, finding\nworthwhile nightlife venues proved to be a bit more challenging. It's not that\nthere aren't plenty of bars and clubs in town; it is that they change names\nconstantly. What is popular this month may not be the next. That is why I\nstress the importance of speaking with your hotel concierge for more up-to-date\ninformation than I can provide in this guide. One experience that you must not\npass up is sunset by the beach at Galle Face Green. The area gets packed with\nfamilies and hungry folks who come from all over Colombo to sample the street\ngrub. And, who doesn't like an Indian Ocean sunset? Negombo and Kalutara are just\ntwo day trip options you have from the capital. There are hundreds of beachside\ntowns spanning Sri Lanka's west coast. Most have upscale resorts that help\narrange excursions, water sports, and other tours of interest. The best time to\nvisit Sri Lanka's west coast is November to April, which is the dry season and\nbest time for swimming. Come hungry, dive in, and sleep tight in historic\nColombo before exploring other parts of this island nation.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Travel", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

True life is more mysterious than fiction. Through the pain and the obstacles, in this journey that is known as \"life\" we seek resolution. The outcome of resolve, may not be perfect, however, there is always a lesson that can be learned. Researching, true life stories can be a tedious undertaking. However, the rewards, justify the outcome. In 1995, Ann became interesting in writing about Andre Coppage. Andre was an eye-witness to a brutal murder. A small but deadly drug cartel thought that Andre had told police about the murder, so the gang murdered Andre’s five younger siblings. In 2003, after years of following the case, \"Code of Silence, the Andre Coppage Story,\" was written. In 2005, after her mother passed away, Ann, immersed in grief decided to fulfill a promise. Ann promised her mother that she would research their family’s history. All her life, Ann had heard about the story of her 3rd great grandmother a slave named Mariah. While researching, Ann realized that her ancestors lived in a world submerged in violence. To understand historical violence, she went back to college. In 2007, she received a Bachelor of Human Services, major: Community Violence Prevention and Intervention.   Ann and Genealogist G. Johnson have documents supporting: Mariah’s ancestry (slave bills) dating back to 1785, Civil War records of Mariah’s husband in the Colored Union Troops and her brother in-law Ben Williams, a slave, who was the bodyguard of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The book depicts the family stories of the lynching’s, the hardships and triumphs of succeeding despite the Jim Crow laws. After 7 years of researching, in 2012, Ann fulfilled her promise to her mother, \"Human Property Hanging in the Family Tree Yields a Harvest,\" was written.", "related": [], "rank": 1061767, "title": "Human Property Hanging in the Family Tree Yields a Harvest eBook", "author": "Ann Lee", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Great escapism, well written and am looking forward to the next installment!\" - Joleen\"I don't usually read fantasy books, but once I started, I just had to know what happened to Willem. The story grabs the reader from the start. Although it has the standard elements of fantasy-magic rings, caves, quests, dragons, demons, etc.-they are handled in a unique way. I like that Ryder is a strong female character instead of a damsel in distress. I think YA readers will really like this book.\" - Betsy A. Riley\"The Mage's Servant had me hooked from the very first page. Great start, great pace, very visual - I felt like I was really part of the action. The main character (Willem) was as likable as the villain (Gothar) was hateful, and the supporting characters are all well drawn and lifelike. I recommend this book for anyone looking for a light, engaging roller-coaster ride of a book. Great fun!\" - Sam Watson\"Although I've read a lot of fantasy stories like this one, I was glad to say that it's better-written and has more likable characters than the usual stuff I've seen. Good protagonists, good rules for magic, and some good plot development all around. I'll be sure to give this novel a more detailed review on my WordPress blog as soon as possible!\" - Alex Willging", "related": ["B008QZAACO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He moved to Vancouver, BC (Canada) in the mid seventies and eventually became the Executive Director of the North Shore Counseling Centre. The Centre grew rapidly under his leadership and had 8 field offices around greater Vancouver and a clinical staff of 30 therapists. He retired in 1995. His books are based on his own clinical practice with clients and his teaching work with students from various clinical disciplines, as well as with clergy of different denominations. Ron adopted Bowen Family Systems Theory as his preferred approach to practice early in his professional life. He also found it especially effective in his own family and marital life. Documenting this, he has recorded some of his personal family work in his book \"Becoming a Healthier Pastor.\" He and his wife enjoy travel and are active outdoor enthusiasts.

From learning to fly in small planes, to smuggling, fighting\nin wars, flying big jets, to running an airline, it's all there. What I lacked\nin connections, education, money and health, I made up for with luck, naïveté, talent,\nand old-fashioned chutzpah. I was too dumb to realize I was supposed to fail.Volume One, 1951 to 1967, Minnow\nto Mercenary, tells of learning to fly, dealing with an engine failure,\nsmuggling seafood off beaches in Mexico and going to jail, flying corporate,\nfighting in the Congo, timber spraying, getting shot at in Laos, and Vietnam with\nContinental Air Service. Whew! Volume Two, 1967 to 1977, Props to Jets, takes me from Honolulu to\nHong Kong (Where I met and married Vickie.) flying a DC-3 round trip, once a\nweek to Vung Tau and Cam Ranh Bay during the war. I then hired on to fly jets\nwith Overseas National Airways, a growing supplemental airline. Before\nderegulation put the airline out of business, I learned how to span oceans\ncarrying passengers and cargo.Volume Three, 1982 to 1995,\nFreight Dog to Freelance, is my experience flying contract freighters for\nEmery Air Freight around the world, teaching, test piloting, and finally the\nDirector of Flight Operations for a small flag carrier in the Pacific.Sorry, it's all PG rated; there is no vitriol, or get-evens, just a bunch\nof hangar-flying stories. All-in-all, it's a grand run I'm sharing with you.\nOne that allowed me to taste many of the flavors life offers; for that I'm\nforever thankful.I've edited the memoir correcting spelling, punctuation and grammar,\nuntil I'm exhausted. Nevertheless, the reader will find errors. My Scots blood\ntrumped my Irish ego, preventing me from hiring an editor to put the final\npolish on this behemoth. Once printed, it's all there for the world to see ­­-\nhow embarrassing.Someone said the job of a writer is to make the reader turn the page; I\nsincerely hope I've done my job; one way or the other.

Scholars of the time had transformed Vergil into a sage and a seer, a type of universal philosophereven a Christian poet and a guide of a Christian poet. In the midtwelfth century, there surfaced legends that converted Vergil into a magician, endowing him with supernatural powers. Comparetti explores the ongoing interest in Vergil's poetry as it appeared in popular folklore and legends as well as in medieval classical scholarship. This great synthesizing work, which has been unavailable for over twenty years, is now back in print, based on E.F.M. Benecke's 1895 translation of the Italian second edition.Comparetti begins with the period in which Vergil lived and goes on to evaluate how the later images, particularly the legends, of Vergil coincide with the more scholarly accounts of his life. The result is a grand sweep of literary history from the first century B.C.E. through the end of the Middle Ages, with implications for the nineteenth century and the rise of Italian nationalism.", "related": ["B00E5KB9RE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is packed full of commonsense tips on\npreserving your wealth when you are a traditionally hard-up student. In\nfact, most of us could pick up a frugal idea or two from this book. Schaefer concentrates on the areas of food, books, supplies,\nentertainment and housing before finishing with a more general look at\nmanaging your money and some concluding tips. There is advice on healthy\n and sensible living too along the way. Tight budgeting doesn't mean\njeopardizing your physical or mental health in the process.The book is clearly laid out and is illustrated with colour photos to\nkeep the atmosphere lively. Advice is conversationally given, with\nplenty of links to websites for students to follow up for themselves.\nThese of course may become obsolete but for now they are useful and\nrelevant. Recycling and downsizing expectations and needs figure\nstrongly throughout the book. Youngsters can survive with secondhand\ngoods and clothes, seriously. And no manicures! This may be a new\nconcept for our teen generation, depending on their background, but if\nthey can adjust to it, they'll be set up with financial acuity for the\nrest of their lives. Nights in can be as fun as nights out with the\nright frame of mind and some friends. Overall, the most important piece\nof advice that is given is that students must keep track of their\nfinances. Start this from day one and it becomes second nature and\nincredibly valuable. Despite having been aimed specifically at the US\nmarket, students the world over will benefit from this clear and crucial\n advice.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 22.0}

Often called the \"reluctant prophet\", he shuns the limelight and has never yet granted an interview to traditional news outlets and very seldom to non-traditional ones. When asked why, he explains, \"I do not wish to be put up on a pedestal because of the books that have come through me. In the case of the 'Oracles of Celestine Light', I was merely the scribe dutifully recording everything I witnessed and heard. The lost teachings found within the 'Oracles' are profound and it is those that I hope people will focus on. The uplifting, life-changing effects the teachings in this book can have are because of the life examples and the words spoken by the people in the book, not because of the messenger.\" Though the lyrical writing style and moving expositions on life's challenges presented in '22 Steps to the Light of Your Soul' have been compared to the classic book The Prophet, by Kalil Gibran, Embrosewyn also demurs the accolades for his modern classic. He explains, \"In a book like the 22 Steps to the Light of Your Soul' every sentence could be a quote on your wall. The words uplift you, they motivate you, they call you to be the great person you truly have the potential to become. I suppose I am a good example, for the words that so uplift, and the lyrical writing style that so entrances and moves the heart, those are far beyond my normal capabilities. But as David McKay once said, \"there is something great within every person calling for something greater.\" If I have discovered some of the keys that will help others unlock those magical doors to their potential that is as great a reward as I could ever ask or hope.\"", "related": ["B00AQS1I4S"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The glass door came next and then the alarm system until at last she was able to enter. The heels of her boots clicked against the polished wood f loors as she moved through the workroom into the gallery itself, switching on lights as she strode toward the front of the store.Once there, she unlocked and opened that door, as well, and stepped out onto the sidewalk of Traterg, carrying with her a sandwich board that advertised the gallery was open for business. She set it up on the sidewalk as usual, shivering as a cold winter wind blew around her legs and teased up the hem of her dress.Back inside, she returned to the workroom where she took off her coat and deposited that and her shoulder bag in her locker. She took a second to smooth her hair and the dress she'd finished making just the night before, a swirl of lavender and purple with vibrant shots of yellow. The garment was of her own design, one of her better efforts. The fact was she made almost everything she wore with the exception of socks, shoes and underwear. That she hadn't been told to modify her appearance when asked to help out was just another indication of how ill Aunt Eleanor was.Skylar opened the vault next and took out a tray of jeweled shells that she tucked into a window display along with several glass sculptures. There were a few other pricey items that she retrieved and set in place, delighting in the sparkle and quality of each.A pot of coffee, very strong, the way most of the citizens of the small Balkan country of Kanistan preferred it, came next. While it brewed, Skylar opened the square pink box she'd brought along from the bakery down the street and arranged jam-filled cookies on a handblown glass platter infused with replications of the small gold-and-red blossoms that were Kanistan's national wild-flower. Her aunt had made this piece as she had many of the others in the gallery. A flip of a switch filled the air with Verdi.The store looked and sounded elegant. It was not exactly to Skylar's taste, which tended to be a little livelier, but it suited her aunt and the mostly kind of stuffy people who came here to purchase art pieces. Skylar thought briefly of getting out her iPod and listening to her own playlist but dismissed the idea. Her job was to greet customers and sell art, not cocoon away behind a sketch pad thinking of new ideas for what she grandly termed her spring collection.But, hey, she couldn't wait to get going on it. There was lots of downtime after the gallery closed, time when Uncle Luca worked late and her aunt, exhausted from illness and stress, went to bed early. The grays and blacks of the winter city, so different than all the light she was used to in Southern California, continually stirred creative juices that were finding their way into her designs.For now, she settled down behind the desk to work on the flyer for the Valentine's Day open house. She was busily moving templates around, wishing Aunt Eleanor was well enough to consult, when the bell over the door alerted her that the first customer of the day had arrived.She looked up to find two middle-aged women bundled up against the chill. Their coats, hats and gloves looked well-made if dated. By their accents, Skylar judged them to be from closer to the Ukrainian border. Maybe they were on holiday, and maybe they were looking for gifts to take back home.Skylar had never been a hasty judge of other people, not until she'd taken this job. But in the few short weeks she'd been here, she'd learned to tell a serious collector from a tourist looking for a keepsake, and these two had the look of the latter. Sure enough, they moved quickly past the pricey sculptures and paintings to gather around a central case.\"May I help you?\" Skylar asked.They raised their eyebrows, probably at the accent they could detect in her speech. The taller one asked to see the tray within the case that held an assortment of handblown glass wine stoppers Skylar's aunt had created when she discovered the need for something inexpensive for the casual shopper. Skylar fished the tray out of the case and backed off as the women set about the task of weeding out their favorites.Skylar glanced at her watch. Aneta was late again, had been all week. She was the local girl Aunt Eleanor employed to help out, but Skylar hadn't found her all that helpful, especially for the past couple of weeks when she'd been distracted and nervous. Aneta had finally confessed she had become involved in a new romance and hinted at trouble. Skylar would have been happy to help if she could, but Aneta's prickly disposition made it tough.Another jangle of the bell set Skylar's head turning. This time, it was a lone man who entered, pausing inside the door as though scouting out the gallery. As his gaze connected with Skylar's, she felt a small jolt of something akin to recognition although she knew she'd never seen him before.He didn't look like any other customer she'd ever encountered in this establishment. He was young, not much over thirty, but there was the look of experience in his clear blue eyes that held a challenge, an aura of appraisal, like he was checking out the room in a calculating way and that included her. As though he'd made a decision, he moved toward her with a purpose of step that galvanized her to the spot, his shoulders broad beneath a well-cut dark brown leather jacket that shone with the same richness as his equally dark hair.The almost imperceptible limp that revealed itself as he walked aroused curiosity and speculation and somehow added to his inherent swagger. She wasn't sure why this guy was here, but she'd wager it had nothing to do with art.At five foot two, Skylar was already a little on the diminutive side, and when he stopped a few feet away and stared down, his presence was imposing, muscles impressive, expression impossible to read.\"Do you speak English?\" he asked.\"Yes,\" she said, smiling.\"You're American,\" he said, eyes sparkling as though he'd longed to hear his own language.\"Same as you,\" she said. She'd known before he opened his mouth that he was a fellow Yank. There was something very U.S. of A. about him, something quietly strong, infinitely self-assured. And maybe something slightly dangerous.\"My name is Cole Bennett. I'm looking for Eleanor Ables,\" he said, using her aunt's maiden name, the one she'd kept when she'd married three decades before. His voice was deep and sexy and sent a little flutter down her spine. \"I'm betting you're not her.\"\"What gave it away?\" Skylar asked with a smile. \"The pink stripe in my hair?\"He narrowed his eyes, but there was a glint of humor evident in the slight curve of his lips as his gaze darted up to peruse the stripe. His appraisal traveled down her body to her feet, and he smiled. \"I think it might actually be the yellow cowboy boots.\"\"Maybe I'm an avant-garde kind of artist,\" she flirted. It was obvious to her that he knew she was playing with him and didn't mind it one bit.\"Maybe you are, but you're also a few decades too young. Are you even out of high school?\"\"I beg your pardon,\" she said. \"I'm twenty-five. And a half.\"\"You look like you're sixteen. And a half.\"\"I think I'm offended,\" she said.His smile ratcheted up a notch. \"Didn't mean it that way. Most women are happy to be told they look younger than their years.\"\"Not when it plunges them into jailbait territory,\" she said. \"Anyway, as you so astutely discerned, I am not Eleanor Ables. I'm filling in for her. May I help you?\"\"How about a name?\"\"Skylar Pope.\" Skylar suddenly became aware that the other customers had moved to the counter with their choices and had discreetly approached the cookie plate. \"Excuse me a minute,\" she said and hurried over to help them, aware that Cole Bennett's gaze tracked every move she made.Skylar chatted warmly with the customers as she wrapped each modest purchase as though it was a Picasso, per her aunt's long-standing tradition. After the women left, she looked around to see where Cole had wandered off to and found him studying a shelf of glass displayed against a roughly hewn wooden wall. She decided to give him space. It took him a few minutes, but eventually he sought her out again. She offered him coffee and a cookie.\"Thanks,\" he said, accepting the coffee, watching her as she dropped a single sugar cube in it as requested. \"You speak the language very well.\"\"Years of practice,\" she said. \"Unless I get careless, most people can't tell I'm from somewhere else.\"\"And where is that somewhere else?\"\"California, but I spent a week or two here each summer when I was growing up.\" She tilted her head and added, \"Do you know my aunt, Mr. Bennett?\"\"Eleanor Ables is your aunt?\"\"Yes, my father's sister.\"He took a sip, and she struggled to ignore the way his muscles moved under the soft leather of his jacket, the snug fit of the soft black shirt against his trim torso. Hopeless not to notice those things, however. She'd never designed men's clothes, but she bet he'd look fabulous in anything he wore.\"Call me Cole,\" he said. \"And, no, I've never had the pleasure. A friend of mine visited Traterg last year and brought home the most unique glass figurine. He raved about the woman who had created and sold it to him. When I found myself in Kanistan, I decided to come meet the artist and see if I could find something equally tempting for myself.\"She looked up into his eyes. Everything he'd just said sounded as though he'd rehearse...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kain by Ginger Anne is truly\namazing because of what is written between the lines.

The weight carried by this novel is\n much more than anyone thus far has given it credit for. This novel is a\n commentary on issues much larger than the missions at hand throughout\nKain.That being said, I would like to let everyone know that the\n1-star ratings of this novel are fabricated by people who have not read\nthis novel. I'm sorry if this is a spoiler, but there are no\n\"embarrassing\" sexual scenes. This is a young adult novel, and it's\nwritten appropriately for all ages.Kain by Ginger Anne London is\n a tale dedicated to anyone who has ever felt out of place,\nmisunderstood, or faced with questions about themselves. The message it\ncarries is timeless and as I said her delivery was far above my\nexpectations.Kain is a must read - and read it with care and\nattention for it holds much more than a pretty main character, his\nlover, and their adventures.I would rate this a 4.5.\"\n-Ashley Jessome\"Kain is a fun read!  His vain way of describing himself and the world\n around him is hysterical.

Following undergraduate school with a three-degree, 217-hour performance, the author felt it absolutely necessary to hid away in a cave to complete his works. These works, or rather, masterpieces are an emblem and symbol of the past, present, and future of the essence of life. In a world so tattered, he gives the human race an elucidation of dark history teamed up with a peaceful and hopeful message filled with warnings of the it's survival. Waters is currently traveling, still writing, and living a life on the edge and to the max. He has traveled to 37 states in the past year alone and is currently involved in completing three new volumes of poetic works of art. Trying to nail down Waters is virtually impossible, as his travels seem very random and mystique-just as his character portrays. Waters lives life as an art, rather than deriving art from the life he lives. Waters is currently still writing. When not traveling, he enjoys running his t-shirt company, his publishing company and cruising in his convertible at top speeds. His plans include publishing his third book of poetry, writing music, completing a novel on his college life, and continuing his bizarre sports column, The Bohemian Vagrant.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Debra also writes fiction--Historial Western Romance, Contemporary Romance, Fantasy Romance, and Science Fiction. Her Montana Sky series, sweet historical Western romances, is published by Amazon Montlake. The Gods' Dream Trilogy (fantasy romance) is available on Kindle. The common publishing philosophy is that an author should take different pen names for different kinds of book or \"the reader will be confused.\" Debra thinks her readers are smart enough to distinguish between her various books. Thus, she's publishing everything under her own name. Debra lives in Southern California and has one dogs and two cats. She's a second degree blackbelt and teaches martial arts.

Some are worse than others, but a few winters back was the worst. There were 18 inches of wet cement-like snow on the ground almost immediately and the roads closed. Those in our subdivision who had generators that ran by gasoline were out of luck unless they had stored enough gas to get them through over a week of no power. We, on the other hand, have a generator that runs on propane, and in 15 seconds after a power failure, it turns on. Neighbors gathered at our house, the women brought perishable food from both their refrigerators and freezers, and we cooked, ate, showered and weathered the storm. So, in my book, one of the couples has a generator and most of the characters from the series (dogs, cats, in-laws, au pair,etc.) arrive at their house. To find out how I had the storm set the stage for Sammy to escape while on the way to the dentist, you will have to read the book.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And the tales of woe flow, unceasingly. A forensic psychologist, Taylor well understands that her undertaking is far from empirically definitive. She concedes that much. Yet, she is convinced that there is something wretched, damning about her fellow countrymen. She lays down her rules. Her counsel to other women is lucid, stark: Beware, think, tread lightly. And for men, she is quite blunt: Mend your ways. Taylor admits that her driving ambition and independence may have contributed to what she terms her \"dating inurement.\" These are loaded words upon which women should reflect. Are the so-called traditional roles of women inherently anachronistic ... an albatross that robs women of their self-worth ... a reminder of \"dark days?\" Shouldn't situational demands be our compass? Clearly, traditionalism and modernity need not be irreconcilable. Not that male culture ought not to be re-examined... Taylor manages to raise some ontological and sociological questions that transcend Jamaican society. Taylor has not only revealed a personal wound, but has invited a debate on culture, gender politics and the changing role of women. 50 Something Dates proves an interesting read, baiting and hooking readers with its prescription for the ills of Jamaican men. But, all this pales to its strident call for change, a call that should provoke the conscience of a nation.

Haley began life in a military family that occasionally moved to new towns like Denver, Kansas City and Detroit.  His young family happily found their way back home to Fort Worth, Texas in the late '60s.  It was there that he, his older brother and later his younger brother grew up, and the Beatles song \"Paperback Writer\" inspired him to write. Living near Carswell Air Force Base meant tolerating the thunderous, deafening roar of B-52 bombers lumbering overhead a mere four or five thousand feet.  While the lives of the bomber crews on hours-long training missions seemed to interest Haley, the planes were so low and loud at times that the brothers could not even hear each other's shouts.  Such an environment often seems to sever much of the day into twenty or thirty minute tolerable fragments. A break from the relentless chaos came with a move to a waterfront home on a quiet cove of a nearby lake, where Haley finished high school.  Despite the better lifestyle of country living, he ultimately moved back to Fort Worth and accepted a civil service job on the Air Force base so that he could work his way through college, support his new family, and do his part to support America's military.  During his 15 years in the defense industry, Haley found himself a single parent and did his best to meet the challenges of trying to raise two daughters while working a job that required some international travel. Instead of sleeping at night, he often worked part time ghost-writing contracts and did homework for a software engineering degree. His daughters have long since grown up and, between them, have three bright kids of their own.  Haley moved to Denver in 2005 where he married a brilliant doctor, works as a software engineer, and spends some of his free time writing in some of his favorite Rocky Mountain hideaways.", "related": [], "rank": 1500564, "title": "The Attunement", "author": "Gary B.

His most frequent comment growing up was \"Why did you people settle here when there are much warmer places to live?\" He confounded his teachers and most grown ups at a young age writing incredibly powerful algorithms for phenomenally underpowered computers at the dawn of the computer age. This is a skill he has employed throughout his professional career and still take great pride in (the confounding part mostly). At 17 years of age he made a deal with the US Navy \"Teach me about airplanes and computers. Take me anywhere it doesn't snow and I'm all yours.\" They kept the bargain and started him on a world traveling adventure that has continued far beyond his six-year enlistment. He continued his world traveling adventures as a businessman frequently logging one fourth of his time out of he country. He feels as comfortable abroad as he does at home and has developed an appreciation for a wide range of cultures and cuisines. He settled in Southern California after his service was complete and studied Engineering, Business and Finance at night while working at a series of start-up firms by day. He claims that growing up on the farm and the Navy have ruined his ability to sleep late and habitually gets up well before the sane portion of population starts their day.", "related": ["B00B15Z1P2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But you will have a hard time finding such a diverse, challenging, and appropriate collection all in one place.When I first started this project I was working with over four hundred riddles that I considered good. Then I focused it down to about 150 puzzles that I thought were very good. Then I kept focusing it down and refining the list of riddles until I landed on 78 brain teasers that I thought were -amazing- and unique.For example, any riddle-lover knows that you will come across countless numbers of riddles that involve liars and truth-tellers and so many of them can all be solved using the exact same logic and reasoning. I tried to take the best of those types of riddles and include the greatest ones from each archetype. This keeps the content fresh and exciting with each new riddle, but also allows you to explore all of these different lines of reasoning and solving.It has been an absolute pleasure putting this collection together and I hope that you enjoy having such a wide but focused collection of riddles all condensed into one place!-Zack", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 4.6667, "rating_total": 56.0}

J.C.’s parents were both educators working at the middle school level, and he married into another family of educators.  In his family, counting in-laws, there are now two retired principals, two retired teachers, a retired school counselor, and an active science teacher. In his youth, J.C. read quite a lot.  The Call of the Wild was one of his early favorites, and into middle school he began to devour other books such as Anne McCaffrey’s Dragonriders of Pern series.  Unfortunately, J.C. developed a form of dylexia that made reading from the page of a book difficult.  It was later discovered that the curvature of the page itself caused the issue, and the advent of the eReader (with its perfectly flat screen) has allowed him to once again enjoy reading as he used to. He enjoys both indoor and outdoor pursuits including computers, cars, and camping.  J.C., his wife, and their three sons enjoy hockey, and set aside time several times each season to watch the local WHL franchise.", "related": [], "rank": 2009451, "title": "Columbus", "author": "J.C.

Living with the condition...\nthat's the hard part. Join Alyssa as she stumbles through the world of the\n\"Unnatural.\" Book 1: Immortalis\nCarpe Noctem  - Newbie vampire Alyssa\nnever asked for this life, but now it's all she has. Rescued from death by\nLysander, the aloof and sexy leader of the Peregrinus vampire clan, she's\nbarely cut her teeth before she becomes a target. Kallisto, an ancient and\nvindictive vampire queen - and Lysander's old mate - wants nothing less than\nfinal death for her former lover and his new toy. She's not above letting the\nActa Sanctorum, and its greatest vampire hunter, Santino, know exactly where\nthe clan can be found.With no time to mourn her old life, Alyssa's survival\ndepends on her new family. She will have to stand alongside Lysander and fight\nagainst two enemies who will stop at nothing to destroy them. Book 2: Hunters &\nPrey-  Rule number one: humans and\nvampires don't co-exist. One is the hunter and one is the prey. Simple, right?\nNot for newly-turned vampire Alyssa. A surprise confrontation with Santino\nVitale, the Acta Sanctorum's most fearsome hunter, sends her fleeing back to\nthe world she once knew, and Fallon, the human friend she's missed more than\nanything. Now she has some explaining to do. However, that will have to wait.\nWith the Acta Sanctorum hot on their heels, staying alive is more important\nthan educating a human on the finer points of bloodlust. Book 3: Pandora's Box-  After a few months as a vampire, Alyssa\nthought she'd learned all she needed to know about the supernatural world. But\nher confidence is shattered by the delivery of a mysterious package - a\nPandora's Box. Seemingly innocuous, the box is in reality an ancient prison,\ngenerated by a magic more powerful than anyone in her clan has ever known. But\nwhat manner of evil could need such force to contain it? When the box is\nopened, the sinister creature within is released, and only supernatural blood\nwill satiate its thirst. The clan soon learns how it feels when the hunter\nbecomes the hunted. Book 4: Soulstone-  It's a desperate time for rookie\nvampire Alyssa, and her sanity is hanging by a slender thread. Her clan is\nstill reeling from the monumental battle with Aniketos; a battle that claimed the\nbody of Lysander, her sire and lover, and trapped his spirit in a mysterious\ncrystal. A Soulstone. Unfortunately, no amount of magic has been able to\nrelease Lysander's spirit, and the stone is starting to fade. Weeks of effort\nhave proved futile. Her clan, the Peregrinus, have all but given up hope. Only\nAlyssa still believes her lover can be released. In despair, Alyssa begs the\nhelp of the local witch coven, and unwittingly exposes the supernaturals of\nBoston to unwanted attention from the Acta Sanctorum. The Saints converge on\nthe city and begin their cleansing crusade to rid the world of all things\n\"Unnatural.\" In the middle of an all-out war, but no closer to a solution to\nthe dying stone, Alyssa is left with an unenviable choice: save her mate, or save\nher clan. Book 5: MoonlightGood girls don't wear fur, or fight over men, and they\ncertainly don't run around naked, howling at the moon. But then, no-one ever\ncalled Fallon a good girl. As a humanunofficiallymated to an Alpha werewolf, Fallon is being pressured to \"become\"...or be gone.\nHer mate Aiden, the interim leader of the Olde Town Pack, is in a position that\ndemands he either choose a wolf mate...or leave the pack forever. No matter how\nhot the sex with Fallon is, he can't ignore centuries of tradition. Become a\nwolf or not. If only the choice were that simple. Fallon's options are further\nclouded by the overt presence of other females desperate to be the Alpha's\nmate. And when these bitches get serious, it's not just claws that come out. If\nFallon wants to keep her man and take the title she'll have to exert a little\ndominance of her own. Book 6: Dark\nSalvationA gathering storm of violence is on the horizon. Whispered\nthreats of the Acta Sanctorum's return have the supernatural world abuzz. Only\nrecently aware of the other world hidden behind our own, Kitara Vanders has\nbarely scratched the surface of what being supernatural truly means. A special\nwoman in her own right, she possesses unique telepathic abilities, gifts that\nhave recently come under the scrutiny of the Acta Sanctorum, a fanatical\norganization whose mission is to cleanse the world of anything supernatural.\nTargeted, and marked for death, Kitara's only hope lies with the lethally\nseductive yet emotionally scarred warrior, Nicholas.Knowing full well the atrocities the Acta Sanctorum is\ncapable of, Nicholas is all too eager for the battle to begin. Fueled by pain\nand rage from the loss of his mate, he's itching for a fight, but one thing\nstands in his way, Kitara: a beautiful dark-haired woman with unique psychic\nabilities and an unusual link to the Saints. Despite his resolve to remain\nfocused on his mission, a purely physical relationship binds them together in a\nway neither of them expected. And when her life hangs in the balance, Nicholas\nfinds his own is teetering on the edge too.", "related": ["B00JZEUTBC"], "rank": 790615, "title": "Dark Salvation (Immortalis Vampire Series Book 5)", "author": "Katie Salidas", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 18, "rating_average": 4.8333, "rating_total": 87.0}

Although they follow a definite pattern (as is the case with episode's)\neach episode is written as a stand-alone story in its own right - so don't be\nafraid to 'jump in' anywhere along the line.Aviemore, the small town at the centre of\nthe story, is very much a real place and certainly worth a visit if you are\never in Scotland. Indeed, most of the places mentioned in the stories are in\nfact real places, though the names may have been altered for privacy's sake.\nThe green lochan for instance is a fantastic place for a picnic - and it is\nactually an opaque green colour. Do fairies really wash their clothes there?Although these episodes are categorised as\ncontemporary romance, I have to admit that there is as much action and\nadventure included, especially in the later stories. Contemporary romance it\nseems, is a little more 'gritty' these days than Sally and Robert would be\nhappy with - the Highland idea of morals a little more adverse to 'getting you're\nkit out' perhaps! Subsequently 'adult' content is only included where it actually\nplays a part in the overall story - if you're looking for gratuitous hot and\nsteamy sex scenes - these stories are perhaps not for you!I have visited and stayed in Aviemore many\ntimes, and continue to do so whenever I get the chance. It is a quiet peaceful\ntown, surrounded by spectacular mountains and beautiful highland scenery. - Ideal\nfor long walks and planning the next Sally book! This Highland town is popular\nboth in summer and winter for the many outdoor pursuits available; with Skiing\nin the Cairngorm Mountains, being the\nmajor draw over the winter period.Through these stories, I invite you to share\nand experience (albeit vicariously) the life of Sally and Robert, along with\ntheir growing family; as they settle into life in the highlands of Scotland. Encountering\nadventure and tribulation as well as love and romance - even murder mystery ! - life's twists and turns ensure that drama\nand intrigue, are never far away from the Lindsey household.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He moved from the UK in 2008 where he worked full-time. Writing is in Kaden’s blood. Or so it seems. Ever since learning to read, he has written. From a short story about going shopping written as a toddler, to a story of meeting a lover, Kaden wants to tell his story, or any story for that matter that he can think of. Loving to discover hidden plots he can take the reader off on new unforeseen tangents, often surprising with the sheer horror, thrilling climax, or tear-jerking empathy. So Kaden loves writing. Obviously he loves his urban fiction, the stuff of witches, undead beings, immortals, vampires, angels and other creatures such as Si-Kee and Par-Tos, two of the terrifying Lessers capable of truly messing with anyone’s head. Yup, his characters are scary and seriously messed-up. Yet they are believable and we punch the air with joy when they come up trumps. despite their total lack of ethics, drug use, profanity and blatant promiscuity Kaden’s characters are, in many ways, the reflection of ourselves: in them we see our own failings, our own questions, our own confusions. Hence, he makes those people us. And the result is we want to fight for them, join in their fight, help resolve their issues. He may only be some guy who likes fine food, wine, good conversation and good coffee, but he is also a fan of fiction, an avid reader who admires the differing styles of the greats of contemporary fiction. Yet he reads many genre, but sticks mainly to mainly crime thrillers, and, naturally, urban fiction. The darker the better. Kaden’s stories include the autobiographical short  “A Boy and a Girl” and the urban fiction “Rhesus A”. He is currently working on “O Negative”, the sequel to Rhesus A.", "related": ["B00E9QPFTM"], "rank": 2054869, "title": "Lilith eBook", "author": "Kaden Brown", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There is no scarcity of books that claim to reveal what science \"really\" is. Most of them have exactly one of two virtues: Either they are historically, philosophically or sociologically well-informed, or they show a profound knowledge of present-day cutting edge science from the scientific practitioners' view. In a remarkable accomplishment, scientist and philosopher Dominique Chu combines both: His book combines scholarly sophistication with up-to-date discussions about \"hot topics\" such as complex systems, systems biology, evidence-based health care, neuroscience and more. Written in a language that anybody above the age of 14 can understand, the book offers ample food for thought for everyone - for university students; science vs religion combatants; citizens thrilled or concerned by modern science and technology; and not the least scientists themselves. In particular, practising scientists will finally have a book that translates contemporary philosophical and sociological research on science, technology and society into messages that they can understand and relate to. I will not be surprised if \"The Science Myth\" finds its way into science curricula all the way from the high school level to the PhD.-Prof. Roger Strand, University of Bergen, Norway -", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Having first met informally to discuss a manuscript, the writer and the student fall deeply in lust after several brief, clandestine encounters. The student tells her dull, invisible husband that she is at her aunt's house, and the lovers \"all the pleasures prove\" with great abandon. They even take Polaroids of each other, in increasingly erotic poses, all elegantly described in the book's pages, a smart metaphor for their awareness of their own violation and the pleasure they take in it. Of course, the relationship moves beyond sex, as the lovers become well versed in each other's pasts. The writer must also come to terms with a heart condition, a sign that his body could age beyond his capacity to love. Farber's dialogue-heavy style, with its brief episodes, works perfectly in concert with the dance of flesh that drives this book like a well-paced film. The story itself is not new, and there are some unbelievable crannies here, such as the writer's project, a verbal study of nude models who come to his apartment to pose for him, or his decision to think of his lover as his daughter, a device reiterated throughout the second half of the book without any kind of substantial reckoning, even though it is the book's most controversial element. Nevertheless, Farber knows the heart, the groin and the conscience equally well, and this novel is an impressive display of his wisdom.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The Black Act is a thoroughly enriching read.\"-Rio Youers, author of Mama Fish, Everdead, and End Times\"The Black Act is very, very good! It sort of walks a literary tightrope between Octavia Butler and Orson Scott Card.... I find high fantasy of any kind difficult to keep my attention over the long haul, and once a book starts getting into high magicks my eyes usually start glazing over, but this is doing an admirable job of keeping me fixed on it.\"-Karen Koehler, author of the Mrs. McGillicuddy series\"The Black Act is a beautiful tale, beautifully written. Louise Bohmer places her pot squarely on the pile and begins cooking immediately. The aromas in her kitchen are familiar--a hint of J.R.R. Tolkien, a trace of Geoge R.R. Martin, and a whiff of Ursula K. LeGuin--ah, but when you taste this delicious stew, you'll find a fresh recipe with plenty of meat and potatoes.

I include my in-depth growing methods for most garden plants, especially those vegetables that we cannot live without.To give you an example, I created a salad mound that hasn't bolted or died yet. It is the first of July and I'm still eating salads. The leaf lettuce plants has developed big stalks and roots that finding water and nutrients is easy. I never in my life, ever seen such developed plant growth in leaf lettuce.I hate to toot my horn. But this book (not a pamphlet) is a must read. It is guaranteed not to disappoint. There is something useful in it for everyone.

Through discipline and planning, a man can take\ncontrol of his finances and not be a slave not only to debt, but to the\nconcept that there is no hope for financial stability, both of which are\n devastating. By using his guide and answering the key question in a\nreal and honest manner, the reader can move beyond many of the personal\nstruggles that he is facing and find the freedom that goes along with\nbeing a responsible steward of one's resources. Throughout the book,\nBradley's points are illustrated by the use of scripture references from\n the book of Proverbs which accurately reveal the wisdom about finances\nthat God has shared with us in His word. With forms that can be acquired\n through Bradley's website as well as other additional resources, this\nis not just a 'read it and move on' type of book, but rather a guide\nthat is to be used and referred to over and over until financial freedom\n is won.Money problems have plagued all of us from time to time.

Following a decade of peace, the 1930s bring hard times to the country. Men ride the rails in search of jobs, and shantytowns called Hoovervilles spring up across the landscape. The Stuart farm in the Ozarks is failing. Even Lylah in the film industry feels the strain. Changes rock the Stuarts, testing their faith in God and drawing them together in unexpected ways. The younger members of the Stuart clan find themselves in unfamiliar places, from a hobo jungle in an Illinois city to the glitter of a Hollywood movie set.

When asked what he does for a living, Hopkins simply replies: “I help people pay less taxes, get out of debt, and build generational wealth.” He is extremely concerned that more and more wealth in this country is being controlled by fewer and fewer people. Hopkins feels that “The only way to effectively reverse this trend is through a grass-roots effort to increase the level of financial literacy of all Americans… not just the wealthy.” He is earnestly attempting to address this issue by conducting workshops, seminars, providing personal coaching and, of course, writing this book.

When asked if he misses California he gets a wistful look in his eyes and replies he misses the green mountains in the winter, but he is glad to be back home. His grandfather and mother are avid readers and Sam says his own passion started when he pressed his grandfather to find out what was so interesting. His grandfather handed him a book and he has been an avid reader ever since. He claims to have finished the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy in fourth grade and says he can still remember the look, feel, and smell of some of those early books. (He has been spotted sniffing books as he ruffles the pages.) While doing research for a Western novel, Sam was not surprised to find out that, once upon a time, half of his family had been on the wrong side of the law. It stands to reason that when your great-great-grandfather was a marshal in Cripple Creek, Colorado, someone in the family had to be a horse thief. Sam was, however, surprised to find the family name had originally been McKnight and that the thieves had taken the 'Mc' part of the name with them. (Or the lawmen let them have it to distance themselves from that side of the family.) Having served a stint working in a correctional facility, he has often wondered if being a lawman runs in the blood. His great grandfather upheld the law in Mooreland, OK, as well as Springfield and Florence CO, among other places, with his grandfather occasionally deputized to assist. When asked why he would want to become a writer, Sam recounts a time when he was in fifth grade. Illness stuck him in bed for two weeks with only books for companions. (This was a bit before video game phone implants were in common use.) He burned through the Xanth trilogy (back before it expanded into thirty some books), the Riddle of Stars trilogy, a couple of John Carter of Mars books, and several Pip and Flinx novels, relishing the moments when he would become so engrossed he would forget the ills of the physical. A thought floated through his mind at that time, about being able to return the favor to the authors who were providing so much to him. That thought never left and now he sincerely hopes anyone picking up one his stories can find something they were looking for. Drop in and see what he is up to at SamKnight.com.

I wrote \"The Christmas Journey\" in 2012, but I felt it was too late to publish for the 2012 Christmas Season, so I let it brew in my writing journal and published it this year, for the 2013 Christmas Season.While the story is a Christian-Themed one, I truly believe that anyone may read it and enjoy it. At the heart of it, what I want the reader to think is: why is this young boy off on his own, looking for his father, in Heaven, of all places?!?! It's sad, yet hopeful. It's inspiring, yet, at some points, a tad fearful. Thank goodness for the Wagon...Originally, the title was \"The Christmas Wagon.\" In my heart, it is still this title. However, I changed it to *Journey* after some considerable thought.When I found the image of \"Winter Kid\" on istockphoto, I instantly fell in love with the image's atmosphere. As the saying goes: you know it when you see it.As I wrote this piece, several things hit me profoundly, and it has to do the characters.- The Boy and his fear, his faith, and the journey his father planned before his birth is, well, complicated.- The Wagon is a trusty sidekick and, while I'm not giving any spoilers away, it may be more than just a sidekick.- The Town, the Snow, the Wind, and the individuals the Boy meets along the way are \"characters\" themselves. One doesn't often think of \"wind\" or \"snow\" as characters, but in The Christmas Journey, these things actively participate as if they were human beings.- The 12 Santas at the end.

Connolly's book will be an essential resource for first-time readers and seasoned scholars alike. -- Carol Apollonio, Professor of the Practice, Slavic and Eurasian Studies, Duke University, USA This is an excellent guide to Dostoevsky's final grand statement as a novelist, illuminating the complexities of its plot, characters, themes, and motifs, and paying special attention to its religious dimensions. Drawing on a wide body of scholarship, it will be helpful both for first readers of the novel and for its more advanced students. -- John Burt Foster, Professor of World and Comparative Literature, George Mason University, US After guiding the readers through the intricacies of Nabokov's Lolita, Julian W. Connolly once again produced a valuable companion, this time to Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov. Connolly should be commended for the lucid and at the same time insightful and nuanced presentation of the complexities of Dostoevsky's last novel. Connolly's book will be indispensable not only for students in every echelon of academic learning, but also for all those interested in Russian literature. -- Gavriel Shapiro, Professor of Comparative and Russian Literature, Cornell University, US", "related": [], "rank": 1290001, "title": "Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov (Reader's Guides) eBook", "author": "Julian W Connolly", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It doesn't take long before she notices how her mother dotes upon older sister, Liz and younger brother, Evan, but neglects her. Curious and inquisitive, the protagonist is often ignored by her parents, but it's from the sidelines that she is able to surmise early on her family's breakdown. Often left in the care of others-along with her siblings-she is only ever the focus of her mother's interest when Rose is seeking Rinnie's opinion on her makeup. When the girl asks Rose why she is treated differently than her siblings, her mother responds by saying, \"I created a monster.\" As a teen, she tries to rid herself of the \"monster\" with an eating disorder, while seeking love and acceptance from her housekeeper, nurse, and Gaga, her grandmother. Rinnie escapes reality by living in her dreams and finding deeper meaning through writing and art, especially when tragedy strikes during the novel's climax. Baskin takes readers through a tug of war of emotions, punctuated by short, lyrical chapters that include poems, letters, and lists. Teens will follow the protagonist's tumultuous journey from innocent little girl to heartbroken teen and eventually a brave young adult. By helping others, Rinnie discovers a kindness only she knows how to give.—Keisha Miller, South Orange Public Library, NJ", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Out of the scenes that unfolded, I found she needed an equally\npowerful and breathtakingly handsome mate. Though divinely gifted with their\nabilities and looks, they would also reflect the very essence of vulnerability.\nLending them a humbleness for which we mere humans could relate.           The first\nchapters, in which they lived, will not see the light of day for some time, as\nthat storyline does not unfold for many years yet. I do promise, you will see\nthem, some day.             When Winds\nof Change came to be, I was at a loss to what I could contribute to the\ncollection. Everything I had written to that point in time was part of a bigger\nseries, and mostly adult rated. So, I went over file after file, searching for\nthe right characters in which to use for a short story. That is when I decided\nto write Sienna and Alex's love story, beginning with how they met.           Not far\ninto the process, I knew I wouldn't be able to complete it within the confines\nof a short story, and quite possibly had an entire book upon my hands. In order\nto meet deadlines, and get the ball rolling with Ravenfire, I decided to write\nit in parts, publishing part one in the first volume of Winds of Change and\nplanning to release the second and final part in the volumes to come.           At the insistence\nof friends and fans, I have decided to release Ravenfire, Ravenfrost, and\nfinally Ravenroyal as separate novellas.(For more information about Winds of Change, please visit my\ncharity Facebook page for RoMRelief)", "related": ["B00FKEJ4KS"], "rank": 2562215, "title": "Ravenfire (The Raven Saga Book 1) eBook", "author": "Tracey Renae", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has been a pastor, home schooling parent, businessman, public speaker and writer, all of which served to give him a highly textured view of life.While his experiences in life have given him a broad view of many topics, he is ultimately defined by his high view of God. Whether he is ministering to babies or consulting with businessmen, God is not far off. He sees the principles from the Word as applicable everywhere, and celebrates the power of God flowing from principles.For decades now, people have said that they see God and life very differently for having been exposed to his world view.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
