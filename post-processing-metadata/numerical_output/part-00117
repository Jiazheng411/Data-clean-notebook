Proceeding from a brilliant New Yorker essay (\"My Grandmother's House\") about a childhood dominated and emblematized by a powerful and mysterious matriarch and her old-fashioned house, Gordon tracks her progress outward to the grand Manhattan spaces that were her refuge as a student at Barnard, to a beloved writer's retreat on Cape Cod, then to her return to the apartment of her girlhood dreams as a Barnard professor. Not surprisingly, the writing anchored in childhood is the strongest; there, Gordon conveys a sadness and solitude that is a kind of fertile darkness. Nurtured by her Catholic- and Hollywood-themed fantasies, \"trying to construct a world of lightness,\" she nonetheless practiced a ruthless honesty that, she notes, serves her well as a writer. The child of a gentle failure, a writer of unpublishable pieces, and of a proud, polio-crippled working mother, Gordon was forced to move in with her grandmother after the death of her father. There, she marinated in the shadows, seeing but seemingly unseen, making observations shot through with longing and wit. An immaculate young priest entered the darkly feminine house, making the girl feel \"a lightening of the atmosphere that made me think there was some hope for my future life.\" The later essays are often sketchy and self-indulgent, as when she ruminates about her good fortune in landing again at Barnard. At her best here, however, Gordon shows us the creative power of remembering.

A Catholic Guide to Caring for Your Aging Parent is a comprehensive guide for caregivers.Dodds insists that faith is a fundamental part of caregiving, and her approach is deeply rooted in Catholic spirituality. She shows adult children how they can love and serve their aging parents better by deepening their own spiritual lives. “Caregiving”, she says, “is a time of many grace-filled moments.”Dodds explains how to properly assess the needs ofa failing older person, and she writes in detail about the physical, mental, emotional, interpersonal, and spiritual dimensions of care.

Since its publication in 1996, the Interactions study series has sold over 1.2 million units. These studies are very practical and connect with real-life needs of people. The key to the series is found in the name, Interactions. Much more than a fill-in-the-blank Bible study, Interactions is full of questions that drive each group member to a personal, in-depth understanding of God’s solutions to pressing issues that affect all people. The combination of openended, action-oriented questions, matched with topics that are meeting the needs of people today, makes this series a sought-after resource for small group growth.

Her other passion is science-fiction and she likes nothing more than to immerse herself in a whole new universe and the amazing species therein. She used to while away days at school and college dreaming of vampires, werewolves and witches, or being lost in space, and used to while away evenings watching movies about them or reading gothic horror stories, science-fiction and romances.Having tried her hand at various romance genres, it was only natural for her to turn her focus back to the paranormal, fantasy and science-fiction worlds she enjoys so much. She loves to write seductive, sexy and strong vampires, werewolves, witches, angels and alien species. The worlds she often dreams up for them are vicious, dark and dangerous, reflecting aspects of the heroines and heroes, but her characters also love deeply, laugh, cry and feel every emotion as keenly as anyone does. She makes no excuses for the darkness surrounding them, especially the paranormal creatures, and says that this is their world. She's just honoured to write down their adventures.", "related": ["B00JMUQJ5O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her second memoir,Manhattan, When I Was Young, is a sparkling account of those New York days and nights. In her third memoir,Speaking with Strangers, Cantwell has come full circle and again longs to escape and experience something new. The breakdown of her marriage and her father's death left Cantwell feeling isolated and disconnected, craving new intimacies to compensate for the ones she had lost.  Traveling on photographic assignments gave Cantwell the opportunity to refresh her psyche and forge new bonds. Through a series of minitravel vignettes, Cantwell constructs colorful characterizations of the eclectic gathering of characters she encounters from all corners of the world. From Australian sheep ranchers and Russian soldiers to novelists and ministers, strangers enter and exit Cantwell's life absorbing her into conversations. Yet Cantwell realizes that traveling provides a \"peculiar intimacy of people who will never see each other again,\" and we are left feeling that she will never find the intimacy for which she longs.

It was always a fascinating place, constantly changing. You had the contrast of the old Art Deco buildings, often fading and run down, against the beauty of the ocean. Gradually people began buying up old hotels and renovating them, and chefs opening cool restaurants, and then fascinating quirky stores opening.I wanted to set a book there for a long time. Finally, with GayLife.com, I had that chance. But there were still so many more stories that could be told. I wrote a few short stories that built off that setting, and then, one day I was walking past a gym just off Lincoln Road. Through the big plate glass windows I could see lots of handsome, muscled guys working out.I wondered what it would feel like to live on Miami Beach and see that kind of thing every day, and long to be (or have sex with) one of those guys. That was the first genesis of The Guardian Angel of South Beach.I wrote  a short story around this idea and submitted it for an anthology. The editor rejected it, and I don't blame her; there was too much plot for such a short piece. I went back and expanded it, teasing out the relationship that develops between the protagonist and a very cute barista. So it's both a story about coming to accept yourself, as well as a sexy romance.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However, he initially chose engineering as a full time career, although this quickly gave way to writing. In World War II he entered the army and looked likely to fight in the line, but was soon after commissioned and ended the war as assistant director of the army film unit and a Lieutenant-Colonel. This experience translated into civilian life and Ambler had a very successful career as a screen writer, receiving an Academy Award for his work on The Cruel Sea by Nicolas Monsarrat in 1953. Many of his own works have been filmed, the most famous probably being Light of Day, filmed as Topkapi under which title it is now published. He established a reputation as a thriller writer of extraordinary depth and originality and received many other accolades during his lifetime, including two Edgar Awards from The Mystery Writers of America (best novel for Topkapi and best biographical work for Here Lies Eric Ambler), and two Gold Dagger Awards from the Crime Writer's Association (Passage of Arms and The Levanter). Often credited as being the inventor of the modern political thriller, John Le Carre once described Ambler as 'the source on which we all draw.' A recurring theme in his works is the success of the well meaning yet somewhat bungling amateur who triumphs in the face of both adversity and hardened professionals.

Then he\nheard the sound again. Someone was banging on his front door. Insistently. He\nglanced at the watch he'd left on his bathroom counter. It was almost ten.\nNormally he'd be in bed by now and so would most of his men, but they'd had\ntrouble with some of the cattle getting out after a section of one of his\nfences had been intentionally knocked down. By drug smugglers no doubt. They\nwere getting worse in this area and he was fed up with it.Without bothering to put on clothes, he headed toward the\nfront door. That's when he heard the one voice that had the ability to make him\ngo rock hard in seconds.\"Macklin Quinn, I know you're in there! You better open this\ndoor right now!\" Eve's shouts were followed by three more bangs.For such a petite woman she had a loud knock. Shaking his\nhead, he jerked the door open.\"Damn it, Mac...\" She trailed off as she stared at him.\nUnabashedly her eyes tracked down his bare chest to the damp towel hanging on\nhis hips.Her peaches and cream complexion often gave away her\nemotions and now was no different. Those dark eyes of hers flared with\nmomentary interest as they reached the top of his towel. When her gaze landed\non his growing erection, her cheeks tinged an adorable pink and she quickly\nlooked up. \"Uh...do you have company?\"\"No.\" The only company he wanted was her. In his bed. But\nthat wasn't going to happen. So why was she here?She sighed and visibly relaxed. \"I need a place to stay\ntonight.\"Mac wouldn't mind accommodating her but he knew her well\nenough that she wasn't looking to jump into his bed. If only. He frowned as he\ntook in her appearance. \"What the hell happened to you, Eve?\" The question came\nout harsher than he intended. Her hair was hidden by a dark cap and she wore\nall black, like some sort of cat burglar. Dirt smudges covered her face\nand...were those leaves sticking out of her collar?She bit her bottom lip and eyed him nervously. \"Aren't you\ngoing to let me in?\"Sighing because he couldn't say no to her, he stepped back.\nWhen he shut the door behind her, she wrung her hands in front of her stomach.\n\"I did something stupid tonight but I'm not going to tell you what it is if\nyou're going to give me a lecture.\"Oh, shit.If the stubborn woman was actually admitting she'd done something\nstupid, he'd no doubt need a shot of whiskey.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 21, "rating_average": 4.1429, "rating_total": 87.0}

While reading, I was surprised how thousands of people need blood transfusion. The demand remains high and blood banks always need more supply. I also realize the government should immediately help these banks to get more qualified donors. And did I say my twenty-year-old son liked the book? Yes, you heard me right. He likes it and even donate a pint in Red Cross after reading it.  - Austin L.

Soto met de la Cruz, now in her 80s, at a 1998 gathering of the California Rural Assistance League and shortly after began interviewing her. Through her stories of her life as a child laborer, a young mother working under grueling conditions in the fields, a union organizer, and eventually a small farm owner, Soto illuminates the plight of migrant workers from the 1920s to today and the history of the La Causa movement. Told in simple prose that rings with the lilt of a Spanish accent, he covers the work of de la Cruz and her husband. They spent half a century persuading fellow farm workers to stand up for themselves, negotiating and leading strikes, and accompanying Ch vez on the heroic 250-mile march from the lower end of the Great Central Valley to Sacramento. Ch vez comes to life in the book as well, as a friend, a worker, and a tenacious thorn in the collective conscience of the country. Several pages of black-and-white photographs are included. While unapologetically devoted to his subject, the author effectively personalizes the struggle of farmworkers in a manner that will enable students to understand and care about their triumphs.-Mary R.

His memoir [is]...an inside look at the day-to-day realities of the drug trafficking world. All in all, it was a book that I couldn't put down.\"In the early 1980s, drug investigations in the Portland Police Bureau followed traditional buy-bust methods of catching and arresting drug dealers. It worked to get dealers off the streets for short stints, but did little to slow down the traffickers who were bringing more and more drugs into the Northwest. At the same time, Jose Carlos Pepe Chavez-Vernaza, a native of Peru, was riding high as one of the Portland area s biggest suppliers of cocaine. He imported high-quality product from sources in South America and sold it to associates who would cut it 40 to 60 percent with various substances and then sell to street dealers. Everyone made a hefty profit, and Chavez made no secret of his success. But Portland police had been unsuccessful in pinning anything on Chavez, and was able to flaunt his wealth while staying one step ahead of the law. Sgt. Ray Tercek, newly transferred to the Drugs and Vice Division, was frustrated with the miniscule progress the Portland bureau was making with the drug traffickers, and wanted the authority to try something new. With the help of local, county, state and federal law enforcement, Tercek began the first long-term drug trafficking investigation in the Portland bureau s history. Along the way, Tercek would have to contend with not only the seedy underbelly of the Northwest drug trade but resistance within his own bureau. Superiors and team members alike were hesitant to move away from the buy-bust tactics, and chafed at the seeming lack of progress of the investigation. In the end the team enjoyed a modicum of success, but the investigative techniques pioneered by Tercek and his team members changed the way major drug trafficking cases are handled today. Tercek served 31 years in law enforcement, 26 of those with the Portland Police Bureau. His memoir of the Chavez case is jam-packed with information about the law enforcement teams, the drug dealers and Chavez himself, gathered during the two-years investigation. Extensive interviews with Chavez s network yield an inside look at the day-to-day realities of the drug trafficking world, and Tercek s casual style makes the book quite accessible. However, Tercek s liberal use of law enforcement terms and acronyms sometimes muddied the chapters devoted to the police team and slowed the otherwise breakneck pace of the book. All in all, it was a book that I couldn t put down, and I was rooting for Tercek and his crew the whole way. --Renee Struthers-Hogge is the editorial assistant for the East Oregonian.", "related": [], "rank": 1747748, "title": "The Investigation of Pepe Chavez et al: How Presidential Task Force #NW-OR-001 Challenged Conventional Drug Investigation Methods", "author": "Ray Tercek", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

partly because,\nin the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because\nif I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately\nwithCaptain Vorpatril's Alliance) it would upwhack the numbering\nsystem. Nevertheless, the books and\nstories do have a chronological order, if not a strict one. It was always my intention to write each book as a\nstand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with\nthat book that's in your handright now, don't put it back on the\nshelf! While still somewhat true, as the\nseries developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that were\nricher for each other. I will list the\nsub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats. Shards of HonorandBarrayar. The first two books in the series proper,\nthey detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral\nVorkosigan of Barrayar. Shardswas my very first novel ever;Barrayarwas actually my eighth, but\ncontinues the tale the next day after the end ofShards. For readers who want to be sure of beginning\nat the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two. The Warrior's ApprenticeandThe Vor Game(with, perhaps, the novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" tucked in\nbetween.) The Warrior's Apprenticeintroduces the character who became the series' linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the\nfirst book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by accident; the second\nhow he fixed his mistakes from the first round.Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things\none can best discover for oneself),The Warrior's Apprenticemakes\nanother good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male\nprotagonist. After that:Brothers in Armsshould be read beforeMirror\nDance, and both, ideally, beforeMemory. Komarrmakes another good alternate entry point for\nthe series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read beforeA Civil Campaign. Borders of Infinity, a collection of three of the\nfive currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure\nsampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit\nthemselves to length. (But it may make\nmore sense if read afterThe Warrior's Apprentice.) Take care not to confuse the\ncollection-as-a-whole with its title story, \"The Borders of Infinity\". Falling Freetakes place 200\nyears earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with\nthe main body of the series. Most\nreaders recommend picking up this story later.It should likely be read beforeDiplomatic Immunity, however, which\nrevisits the \"quaddies\", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in Miles's\ntime. The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear\nin italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words\nand 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.  Falling FreeShards of HonorBarrayarThe Warrior's Apprentice\"The Mountains of Mourning\"\"Weatherman\"The Vor GameCetagandaEthan of AthosBorders of Infinity\"Labyrinth\"\"The Borders of Infinity\"Brothers in ArmsMirror DanceMemoryKomarrA Civil Campaign\"Winterfair Gifts\"Diplomatic ImmunityCaptain Vorpatril's AllianceCryoBurn                   Caveats: The novella \"Weatherman\" is an\nout-take from the beginning of the novelThe Vor Game. If you already haveThe Vor Game, you\nlikely don't need this. The original 'novel'Borders of\nInfinitywas a fix-up collection containing the three novellas \"The\nMountains of Mourning\", \"Labyrinth\", and \"The Borders of Infinity\", together\nwith a frame story to tie the pieces together.Again, beware duplication. The\nframe story does not stand alone, and mainly is of interest to completists.  The Fantasy Novels My fantasy novels are a bit easier\nto order. Easiest of all isThe\nSpirit Ring, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed\nbooks that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series. Next easiest are the four volumes ofThe\nSharing Knife--in order,Beguilement,Legacy,Passage,\nandHorizon--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one\ncontinuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks. What have come to be called the\nChalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written,\nlike the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and\ncan in theory be read in any order. (The\nthird book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely\nconnected first two.) Some readers think\nthe world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in\npublication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the\nfirst (but not the third.) In any case,\nthe publication order is: The Curse of ChalionPaladin of SoulsThe Hallowed Hunt  The short story collectionProto\nZoawas an e-book experiment; it contains five very early tales--three\n(1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but\nnot in this handy format. The novelette\n\"Dreamweaver's Dilemma\" may be of interest to Vorkosigan completists, as it is\nthe first story in which that proto-universe began, mentioning Beta Colony but\nbefore Barrayar was even thought of.My latest original e-edition isSidelines: Talks and Essays, which is\njust what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of my nonfiction\nwritings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions,\nand some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove an interesting companion\npiece to my fiction.\n Happy reading!  -- Lois McMaster Bujold.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Creating Michael and Roxann's love story not only sparked the idea for the Private Protectors series, it helped me tackle the brutality known as the grieving process.In 2010, Carina Press acquired Man Law and A Just Deception, but my editor asked for changes on Michael and Roxann's book. The decision was made to release Risking Trust third in the series rather than first. I was thrilled to be able to revisit the two characters who helped start my writing journey.The other day someone asked me how the idea for the Private Protectors series came about.  The series actually started with Roxann. I'd worked in the newspaper industry for years and wondered how it would feel for a woman to assume her father's role as publisher of a large newspaper while grieving his death.  I also wanted to explore what it would take for two people who had once loved each other fiercely to find that love again. To risk trusting each other when their history had failed them.While doing revisions, I threw myself into making Michael's voice as powerful as it is in Man Law. I wanted him to be the man he didn't know how to be when he'd first fallen in love with Roxann. And for Roxann, I gave her a willingness to do battle when necessary. I also found that I knew (and loved) these characters so much more. They are the beginning of this series and, in many ways, they are the home base, the safe place for the Taylor Security guys to land.So, here it is, the book that started my writing journey.

Her boyfriend Chris was supposed to join her, but they had broken up before the trip, so Erica goes to Brazil alone. On her first morning there while having breakfast, a handsome man sits down with her. After a lovely meal, the two decide they will continue their travels together. So Erica and Sam set off to see Brazil. I could almost feel as though I was seeing Brazil with Them. Pictures of what the two are seeing are a delightful addition to the story. Sam makes the trip even better than Erica had hoped and she quickly finds herself as a willing sex partner, girlfriend, and traveling companion to him.Footprints in the Sands of Time took me to the beaches, towns, sights, and restaurants of Brazil and I loved seeing the pictures of where they were. Andy Garner made this novella much more than just a guidebook but added a love story with a surprise ending. I felt as though I wanted to hop on the next plane and rush to the beaches of Brazil. Erica was so easy to like and I felt that I so wanted to offer her some words of wisdom along the way. Sam was the man every woman would love to have a summer fling with.I really loved this book and was so sad when the story was over. Andy Garner has earned a five star rating for Footprints in the Sands of Time.", "related": ["B006MZH7XU"], "rank": 4192990, "title": "Footprints in the Sands of Time", "author": "Andy Garner", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Veterinarian Buzhardt and social worker Steib pair up to offer a thoughtful, comprehensive guide for pet-owning parents. Families often have pets before babies, so the authors provide tips for introducing a baby into a household with pets. Subsequent chapters address families with children but no pets and offer step-by-step assistance from the decision to get a pet to its eventual loss, with stops at all points in between. The authors handle outstandingly the tricky issues of selecting the ideal family companion animal and managing child-pet interactions. Some uneven writing and elevated phrases are jarring, especially when the authors provide scientific evidence to back their points. Many books focus on children and dog ownership, but this treatment is notable for including cats and the unique concerns that come with them. It provides a solid update to Mordecai Siegal's core title,A Dog for the Kids, and is a good companion to Colleen Pelar's training-focusedLiving with Kids and Dogs.

Even as a child, her sister claims all she ever did was sit in her closet and scribble in a notebook. Now, she concedes the scribbling part, but not the closet part. Why would she need to sit in her closet when she had a perfectly good desk? In any event, she won her first writing contest when she was seven, and she was hooked! She married young, and soon had three wonderful little boys running around the house, so writing took a backseat for several years as she worked a variety of jobs that she hated. Once she started seriously pursuing a writing career, she found it was not as easy as she had expected, and she was not the prodigy she had imagined. But she joined a writer's group, and made a ton of writing friends along the way who showed her the error of her ways and unselfishly helped her get a little better. By the time she sold her first book in 2006, she'd already been at this for over ten years and was about ready to give up. Rejection is hard! But holding that first book in her hands made it all worth it.  Now her sons are all grown up, and two of them have babies of their own, so she is a grandma. But she now has all the time in the world to devote to telling the stories that just won't let her sleep. She hopes you enjoy them!

By extending outwards to left libertarians he takes on even greater diversity.\" —Sheila Rowbotham,Red Pepper\"The history of the British anarchist movement has been little studied or appreciated outside of the movement itself. David Goodway's book,Anarchist Seeds beneath the Snow, should go a long way towards rectifying this blind spot in established labour and political history. His broad ranging erudition combined with a penetrating understanding of the subject matter has produced a fascinating, highly readable history. Its epic sweep explores anarchist ideas in the work of eleven of Britain's native-born writers stretching from William Morris in the 1880s down to Colin Ward at the start of the twenty-first century. Along the way he provides a valuable cultural history of anarchist thought in Britain and places the actions and ideas of these writers in their historical and political context. And what a gathering of writers he has woven into his text!\" —Joey Cain, edwardcarpenterforum.org\"A splendid survey of 'left-libertarian thought' in this country, it has given me hours of delight and interest. Though it is very learned, it isn’t dry. Goodway’s friends in the awkward squad (especially William Blake) are both stimulating and comforting companions in today’s political climate.\" —A. N.

I love hard and war just the same. I'm passive, yet aggressive. Indecisive, yet decisive. I'm sexy, but I don't wear my sexiness on my sleeves. I'm smart, but not boisterous or cocky. I'm as deliberate as I am mysterious. I'm fiercely guarded and suspicious of others - at least at first interaction. I'm profoundly curious about everything- people and how they think, self expression, the creative process - and, ultimately, about the oneness of humankind. I have my faults and weaknesses - as we all do. I'm not very sociable, yet very personable. I'm passionate, but not possessive. Loyalty is everything. I associate myself with a small circle of like minded people and I take care of those around me. I'm a nurturer and a giver to a fault. I'm uninhibited, yet reserved and guarded. I'm mild mannered, yet strong willed. I'm quiet, yet outspoken. Indirect, yet straightforward. I'm shy, yet confident. I cradle in the belly of Truth, it's all that I know. Truth isn't always neither popular or welcomed, but it's all that I know. Truth is something that I make a conscious decision to speak, hear and give away. As I break through mental and traditional chains, I'm discovering the Goddess in me and I'm falling deeply in love with her. Right now is my most defining moment and I'm going for broke. I'm a rebel in her own rite. I'm a no nonsense and driven kind of girl, one whom loves - the hard way. I sometimes have a hard time playing by the rules, conforming to society's set standards and fitting inside anyone's box. I have both a writing style and mind of my own. I'm passionate about writing and I write from my heart. Writing is one of the things that I was created to do. I have a natural nack and ability of making the reader feel as if she's sitting right there beside them, narrating the story in real time. This is my second published work.

Henry and his pal, FBI agent Karl Donaldson, off on a much-anticipated hike in the Lancashire moors, see their road trip derailed when Donaldson comes down with debilitating food poisoning and, in his weakened state, falls and badly twists his ankle. When a major blizzard blows up out of nowhere, the friends decide to seek shelter. By the time they reach the village of Kendleton, Karl is very ill, so it's with a great sigh of relief that they find a local inn. Little do they know their troubles are just beginning: they are soon to be caught up in a gang war and a brutal murder case that will make their disastrous walk across the moors seem like a stroll in the park. Oldham, a rising star in British crime fiction, deserves recognition for his skilled plotting and unusual characters--and, in this case, his ability to meld procedural detail with taut suspense and the mood of an adventure thriller. -- Booklist, November 1, 2011", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She decides to pick the pocket of a dangerous looking gunslinger to get the money she needs to aid her escape. Josie's first mistake is stealing Ethan Savage's money.  Her second mistake is agreeing to marry him.  Ethan has been content to put his past behind him and forget his English heritage.  He's made a life for himself in the wild American west and he doesn't need a family or a home.  But then his father's solicitor shows up in Abilene and Ethan's past comes back to haunt him.  He discovers he's the heir to Stonecliff Park and the title of Earl of Stonecliff.  He has to go back to England, but he doesn't intend to go alone.  He's taking a bride...  a very unsuitable bride.  Just This Once is a lovely tale about two people discovering themselves even as they discover love.  Josie is wonderful as the scrappy heroine who doesn't believe anyone can love her.  Ethan is the troubled, brooding hero who is changed by Josie's love.  Jill Gregory does a nice job of bringing these two engaging characters together.Jill Gregory is a unique voice in romance!  She creates engaging characters that readers care about! A thoroughly romantic tale!  Jill Gregory writes from the heart! A sweet tale of love and belonging!

The good looking blond was in his late twenties or early thirties, ambling through the fog in jeans and a hunter green coat. He raised an eyebrow. Wondering if he'd heard me ranting about my boyfriend's car accident, I shortened my German shepherd's leash to give him time to pass us. Ever since the accident I'd been taking my dog out to isolated areas where I could throw every swear word I knew at the sky. The last thing I wanted was some guy listening to me.      Nikki pricked her ears and moved her wolfish body through the tall grass to the pavement. Usually the road cleared when I took her for a walk, but not that day. The man slowed down by the fence as if he wanted to say something. By then I couldn't avoid eye contact, so I gave in and nodded.      \"Beautiful dog,\" he said, staring at me.      \"Yeah, she's my best friend,\" I replied, walking by him.      \"I'm looking for Meade Road.\"      I turned around. A tourist. No camera, but I should have known. Somebody who'd driven here in the dead of winter to see the battlefield.      \"I'm house sitting near Meade,\" I said. The second I said it, I couldn't believe I let that out. \"Are you driving or walking?\"      He gave me an amused smile. \"Walking.\"      I flushed under his gaze. Of course he was walking, but I'd thought maybe he'd parked nearby. There was something odd about his right hand. He had six fingers. A polydactyl, some kind of birth defect. I didn't want to stare and turned to the field.      \"Meade's over there on the ridge.\" I pointed to the foggy horizon. \"You can walk across the field or you can follow Long Lane around to the Rec Park and cut up through the Armory. There's some snow in the field so you might want to take the road.\"      Nikki made a low noise in the back of her throat and nosed my leg.      \"We expanded here this year,\" the man said. \"I own the Grasslands.\" Both of his hands had six long, perfect fingers, not just the right one. I'd never seen anything like it and caught myself staring again. \"You'll have to come out when we open.\"      So I was talking to local royalty. The Grasslands was a resort under construction in the middle of wild nowhere off Route 15. The plans for a soaring dome and an open-air restaurant surrounded by exotic ornamental grasses had been all over the newspapers. The Grasslands was supposed to revitalize the area, but I didn't get it. The place was too remote. And six weeks ago, Ben had died in a terrible car accident on the same rural road. I had no intention of ever going out there.      \"Amy Wong,\" I said. \"I missed your name.\"      His eyes flickered to a Honda as it passed us. \"John Savenue. You live here?\"      I hesitated. \"I'm from D.C., but I go to Gettysburg College. Look, I've got to be someplace right now.\" Which was a lie, but I'd picked up a faint taunt behind his eyes and didn't want to stand there any longer with him. I nodded goodbye, reeled in my dog, and took off in the opposite direction, intending to take a roundabout way to the Rec Park in case he went the same way. I'd left my Jeep in the parking lot when Nikki and I began our hike.      Something told me to glance back. The six-fingered man was still there, staring at me, and then he loped across the field. Strange guy. When he reached the creek, something fell out of his coat on the bank. I almost called after him, but I stopped myself. He was too far away to hear me.      \"Come on,\" I told Nikki. \"Let's go see.\"      He'd dropped his cell phone. It took me a while to find it in the ice-encrusted grass, but the cover wouldn't slide back or flip open. I put it in my pocket. John Savenue. I'd look him up when I got to the house. It was the decent thing to do even though he gave me the creeps.", "related": ["B00FC7O8UY"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 3.8571, "rating_total": 27.0}

What results is a spellbinding and unflinching meditation on forgiveness, a novel that secures Kimball's reputation as a literary innovator Time Out, Chicago We carry our parents with us. For some, it's a mostly congenial burden, a mixed blessing of joy, resentment, respect, anger, pleasure and pain. For others, including Daniel Todd Carrier, the aptly named narrator of Michael Kimball's astonishingly moving novel, the weight is almost too much to bear . Big Ray is an appalling tale told with anger, dark humor and surprising tenderness Wall Street Journal Michael Kimball never ceases to astonish. He is a hero of contemporary fiction Sam Lipsyte In this tender, gorgeous novel, Michael Kimball explores how we try to understand even the most difficult family members Oprah.com A short read that will stay with you for a long time ... Humorous yet heartbreaking Grazia In this sparingly written document, which pares back all extraneous detail to get at the emotional core, there's a striking degree of honesty ... It is, above all, a convincing depiction of a man trying to work through conflicting emotions to settle on a conclusion about a father's real legacy: how he is remembered by his children Herald (Glasgow) Slim haunting novel ... Daniel's meditations on his dead father achieve the precision of poetry.

Then I decided to expand it to include thoughts from other family members and friends for whom my Dad was a father, a grandfather, a father figure, and/or an inspiration in their lives in some way.In another section, I decided to include thoughts from other people about their own fathers, grandfathers, father figures, and -- yes -- reflections on our Heavenly Father.Finally, since I know not everyone has had the benefit of having a wonderful Dad like I did, I decided to include a section of thoughts for current and future fathers about things to do and NOT do in order to be good fathers.The experience of writing this eBook has been an amazing journey, reflecting on my childhood and 50+ years of life -- all influenced by the amazing man I was proud to call Dad: Ben Willis.Even though he left this world too soon, as a victim of lymphoma in 2002, his influence and his legacy live on in all of us who had the privilege of knowing him and loving him, in all his various roles as a husband, father, grandfather, uncle, brother, and friend.Sadly, my Mom also passed away, in July 2011. While we miss her, we are comforted in knowing that she has joined 'her Ben' and her heavenly Father, both of whom we suspect awaited her with open arms and Dad's trademark hugs!Their final resting places are side by side, at the Veterans Cemetery in New Hampshire -- together again, in heaven and on earth!I hope that this book will be a blessing and an inspiration to all those who read it -- and that all men who are or someday will be fathers might learn from the examples shared about my Dad and other beloved fathers.          ~~K'Lee Banks, June, 2012", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So when a beautiful young stranger begs her to investigate the death of her sister, Mike is soon not - too - reluctantly embroiled in a mystery that involves the whole town of Three Prongs.

But when he does finally ask her out, her need to track down culprits and bring them to justice gets in the way every time. Will they finally settle on a date and keep it? And more importantly, will Mike's M&M fantasies ever grow roots in a real relationship?

However, she is frightened of the consequences that a night of pleasure may bring. She doesn't know how to speak of it with her patient husband, but she continues to find excuses for not fulfilling her wifely duties. Only now she has heard the rumors that Lord Lovett has returned to the arms of his former mistress. What's a naïve wife to do?Lady Lovett's Little Dilemma was a charmingly tame short story. The dilemma that Cressida was dealing with was thoroughly explained, but it helped to realize that her knowledge was completely different from today's standards. Justin was an excellent hero, but he could only take so much of what Cressida was dishing out to him. It was the norm for his peers to stray back then, after all. I'm not sure that Lady Lovett's Little Dilemma was completely, historically accurate, but is sure was a sweet story!Lady Lovett's Little Dilemma even showed that someone who has become bitter over their lot in life can continue to be nasty and not change. It was also quite lovely that so many enjoyed a HEA in Lady Lovett's Little Dilemma without sacrificing too much for their bit of happiness. I wouldn't have minded if Beverley Oakley had wanted to push the limits a bit more in Lady Lovett's Little Dilemma, but I did find this a sweet refreshing story.", "related": ["B0094JIRTE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However, the mill's corrupt overseer, aptly named Hoggart, makes improper advances toward her. With neighbor and potential sweetheart Robert, Annie gathers evidence against Hoggart, but Robert dies in a suspicious accident and Annie must struggle on with little help. Her eventual triumph over Hoggart has a bitter taste: Robert is dead, and she cannot yet follow her dream of becoming a schoolteacher. As in My Brother Sam Is Dead , the Colliers dramatize abstract historical issues in a realistic, small-town setting; they show changes in women's roles, in material goods and even in ways of seeing time (differences between sun time and clock time), as these topics affect the townsfolk's everyday lives. The novel thus succeeds not only as historical fiction, but also as a riveting story of the tragic romance and hard-won victory of one teenaged girl. Illustrations not seen by PW.

Always digging for a story in the news-poor village, Vince can't help feeling excited when he learns that a woman has fallen to her death off Eagle's Cliff. But no story comes without strings, as it seems Vince's mother might somehow be involved in the girl's death. Why, though, would the police want to brush the case under the carpet? Vince is distracted by this question--but, then again, Vince is distracted by many things, including the affectionate relationship that seems to be growing between his wife and her coworker and his growing sense that he is not cut out for fatherhood. Vince's journey of self-discovery serves as a fitting backdrop for this light but satisfying mystery, the first of a series.Mary Frances WilkensCopyright © American Library Association.

Zion Full Gospel-Daughters of Zion Women’s Retreats from 2005 to 2008. In addition to spoken word contributions, she also wrote and directed a play for the 2007 women’s retreat. These outlets allowed her to hone her skills and talents as well as opened doors to new avenues and platforms for her writing.   As a result, T.W.C. has self-published her first collection of poetry entitled Self Portrait, as well as completed 4 additional poetry collections. In 2009 she completed her first novel, Dark Princess, which is being edited in preparation for release in 2013 as well as a number of other projects, both fiction and nonfiction set to be released by 2014. Lastly, she has offered her skills as a creative consultant for other aspiring writers as well as utilized her passion for writing to provide services to individuals in need of the right words to commemorate or celebrate special occasions such as wedding presentations, Father’s day recognition's, awards, gifts etc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has always wanted to be a writer so she also took several classes in creative writing. Hadena’s primary literary genre is action/thriller.  She currently writes two series, both use action/thriller.  “The Brenna Strachan Series” uses fantasy and the “Dreams & Reality Series” uses murder mystery as its secondary genre.  She continues to explore and expand her writing and hopes to soon produce a comedic action/thriller.  When she isn’t busy writing or running her business, Hadena enjoys playing in a steel-tip dart league.  She also loves to travel throughout North America and Europe. Her favorite cities are Chicago, Illinois and Berlin, Germany.  She is an avid reader, reading everything from the classics like Jane Austen to modern writers like Terry Pratchett.  One of her all-time favorite books is “Good Omens” by Neil Gaimen and Terry Pratchett.  She writes all of her books while listening to music and the bands tend to get “honorable mentions” within the pages. http://www.facebook.com/hadenajames hadenajames.wordpress.com", "related": ["B00KET4TR2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Now Jonathan Addleton's inside look at the diplomatic relations between the two countries carries lessons for anyone wishing to learn from the past as a guide to future relations between the great powers of Asia and America.(Jack Weatherford, author ofGenghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World)Ambassador Addleton admirably documents contemporary Mongolian relations, together with early contacts in the 1860s and exotic adventures in the twentieth century. His timely, highly readable record of bilateral engagement since 1987 highlights the development of Mongolian democracy and the entwined interests of our two countries.(Alphonse F. La Porta, US Ambassador to Mongolia, 1997--2000)Hearty thanks to Jonathan Addleton for this lively and illuminating account of the US-Mongolian relationship's rapid multidimensional development and major contribution to the historical transformation of this remote and fascinating country.(Richard Williams, First US Ambassador to Mongolia)Mongolia and the United Statesis must reading for professional diplomats and business people preparing to work in Ulaanbaatar. Well organized and authoritative, Ambassador Addleton's book will be welcomed by libraries and academic researchers seeking a work that puts all the data on US-Mongolia relations in one place. Lively descriptions of past history lead up to informative treatments of contemporary USAID measures to reform the Mongolian banking system, security cooperation between our military establishments, and Peace Corps people-to-people relationships. A valuable contribution to the literature on a strategic Asian country.(Nicholas Platt, President Emeritus, Asia Society)This in-depth study, which also includes personal observations by six of Addleton's seven predecessors, goes beyond the tradition of diplomatic memoirs in that it is a well-researched and detailed, but eminently readable, review of American impact on Mongolia's rapidly modernizing nomadic society. It will be the inspiration for further analysis of the post--Cold War American policies of democratic nationbuilding, free market promotion, and people-to-people contact in a country whose mineral-rich economy is emerging as a leader in Northeast Asia.(Alicia Campi, author ofThe Impact of China and Russia on United States--Mongolian Political Relations in the Twentieth Century)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Like most young adults the world revolves around them, and they act as though they are invincible. As fate would have it their plans of always sticking together and \"running the town\" as police officers does not pan out quite like they had hoped. Reality sets in, and the friends choose separate paths. As an incident that devastated the five friends resurfaces, the gang is brought back together as Dena pieces the puzzle of their lives together.  I found myself engrossed in the middle and the ending of the book. Because of the foreshadowing in the beginning I knew what was coming at the end I like how the author tied it all together and left the reader with just enough of a cliffhanger to keep them wanting more (I assume a second book is in the works).I believe that the theme of this book was the reality that everyone has secrets or as the book states \"skeletons in the closet\" that often we may be blind to. Often people turn a blind eye to what they do not want to see, but just because they do not wish to see it does not make it any less there.In rating the book I would give it 4 out of 5 stars. The beginning of the book does not do justice to the middle and the ending of the book. The author is able to relate to the characters, it brought me back to my days in high school. I remember all too well thinking the same thing as the main characters, that my friends and I would all work together and spend the rest of our lives like we were living in high school. The ending was great, when I got to the final page I was disappointed I wanted more! The book totally engrossed me and left me wanting more at the final page.", "related": ["B00CJ17UA6"], "rank": 3229464, "title": "Secrets Unleashed", "author": "Denise Daigle", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Years in the making, the collection examines the guiding principles of 15 major philosophical traditions and 6 living religions. A publication of monumental scale and detail, it features an innovative thematic structure that aggregates traditions according to their core models, allowing the reader to grasp the common features of  ultimate realities as understood in diverse traditions such as Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and in some non-religious discussions. Borne out of proceedings at both  the American Philosophical Association and the American Academy of Religion, the volume also examines foundational questions related to the human propensity for creating and using such models, including the issue of whether we are capable of acquiring knowledge of ultimate reality. It features a sustained analysis of the concept that modeling such an ultimate reality is a fruitless endeavor doomed to failure since the ultimate might well be beyond human conception, as well as reflections on the staggering diversity of these models and their application to concepts such as spirituality, gender equality, war, and global warming. Accessible and authoritative, the collection combines section primers for those new to the field, deeper treatment in dedicated essays, and a wealth of references for further reading and study.", "related": [], "rank": 2441883, "title": "Models of God and Alternative Ultimate Realities", "author": "Jeanine Diller", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Like some of the great comic novels—Catch-22, for example, or M*A*S*H—this one gets its humor from its characters: young Mary; conniving Hearst reporter K. O. Doyle; preacher Percy Brubacher and his manipulative partner, Floyd Cruickshank; even eccentric ol’ W. R. Hearst himself. There are plenty of funny situations here, but the situations are driven by the characters rather than an author thinking up humorous set-pieces and contriving to get the characters into them. This is a stylishly written, very funny historical novel that has some smart things to say about the mass media, manufactured phenomena, and religious nogoodniks. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This third volume of his tripartite theology begins with God himself as the appropriate place to ground the meaning and significance of this life. It then turns to explain the centrality of the communities within which individuals share their existence, grow in virtue and find their true self. Faith in action, worship and spirituality as inseparable from ethics, and leadership as service--these are a few of the emphases of the message of the Old Testament developed in this work. ReadIsrael's Lifeand deepen your appreciation of the Old Testament's relevance . . . and enhance your vision of a life well-lived and pleasing to God.\" (M. Daniel Carroll R., Denver Seminary)\"Finally, Goldingay's OT ethics! In a highly readable fashion he demonstrates masterfully that Israel's vision of life before God is not irrelevant to modern existence. In fact, the communal shape of Israel's faith, as well as its profound sense of individual responsibility and freedom, cast our own society's peculiar sicknesses into sharpest relief and point firmly in the direction of a cure. This is first-rate, thrilling stuff--the appropriate culmination of a glittering trilogy.\" (Stephen B. Chapman, Duke University)\"John Goldingay writes with magisterial knowledge of the biblical texts and a keen eye for how to open them in fresh ways for scholars, teachers, preachers and all serious readers. Drawing deeply and widely on the scholarly literature--and also on literature that most scholars would not think to consult--he demonstrates with utter lucidity and conviction how the Hebrew Scriptures present a vision of life in community that is still sane, salvific and maybe even more essential for this generation of faith than for our ancestors.\" (Dr. Ellen Davis, Amos Ragan Kearns Professor of Bible and Practical Theology, Duke Divinity School)\"In the third and final volume of his massive Old Testament Theology John Goldingay turns to ethics and explores 'the life of the children of God' (Barth). He shows how this is presented as response to the gospel as Israel experienced it and as an expression of their faith in Yhwh. Goldingay sees the ethics of the Old Testament as a direct call to us today: the presentation is as far from antiquarian as it could be. Christians and Jews alike will need to ponder this challenging work.\" (John Barton, Oriel & Laing Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture, University of Oxford)\"The fruits of Goldingay's lifelong devotion to the study of the Old Testament are visible on every page.

You wouldn't want to attend a church with chipped paint or threadbare carpeting, says Meyer, so by the same token, your body, the temple of the Holy Spirit, should be well cared for. After rehearsing her autobiography (a classic conversion narrative in which Meyer had a \"poor relationship\" with her body but then saw the light), Meyer offers 12 unoriginal steps to healthy living. She promises that if you follow her instructions, you will learn to love your body; boost your metabolism by drinking water and getting lots of sleep; eat more mindfully; envision feeling \"fit, comfortable, and happy\"; exercise; avoid fad diets; and even have a better relationship with God. The most important part of the book may be the epilogue, which addresses the rising rate of childhood obesity. Occasionally, Meyer seems out of touch with reality. For example, she says that one of the main reasons people fail to care for their bodies is that they are \"pathologically selfless,\" so caught up in altruistic deeds that they forget to care for themselves. All in all, there's nothing here that hasn't been said many times before. (Apr. 4)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A. Bennett is mother to three cute kiddos and a master of Taekwondo. Okay so maybe that last part is a lie, but it sounded really good. When she’s not writing she’s probably either reading or thinking about writing. She currently resides in Tooele, Utah with her sexy husband and the aforementioned kiddos. Eventually the day came when the voices in Kelley Lynn’s head were more insistent then her engineering professor’s. So instead of turning to her Thermodynamics book, Kelley brought up a blank page on her computer screen and wrote. Somewhere along the way she became a Young Adult author. FRACTION OF STONE (Sapphire Star Publishing) was released in March 2013. ROAD TO SOMEWHERE, Kelley's collab with Jenny S. Morris, is to be released by Bloomsbury Spark in January 2014. David was born in beautiful downtown Burbank, California, where his love for film inspired him to become a writer. An avid fan of all things science fiction and fantasy, David also has a soft spot for zombies and the paranormal. He now lives in the mountain West with his wife and two children. When Jessica kept seeing a scene play over and over in her head, she decided the only thing she could do was write it down. That or go crazy. One chapter turned into ten and she thought 'huh, maybe I can write a book.' Books had always been an integral part of her life; she just never thought she could write one. Now on her third novel, she knows it's something she can never live without. Becca Ann writes in her super duper clean house with her angel children who fan her while she clacks away on the keyboard. When she wakes up to the real world, she manages to get in a few hours here and there between all the chaos two little boys and a wittle baby girl can cause to get the stories out of her head and on the computer.", "related": [], "rank": 1995375, "title": "The Spirit of Christmas", "author": "J.

I am not in the least kidding when I say that he discusses which of the action, for example, happens on a Monday. More so, *what* Monday and why that is important, why Shakespeare chose it.I first stumbled across Steve s work on the Hamlet is 30 topic, which we ve discussed twice before. It is his position that the well known I have been sexton here, man and boy 30 years the primary evidence that Hamlet is 30 is actually a misinterpretation. He feels that the line actually reads I (the gravedigger) have been sixteen here (i.e., have been at this job 16 years)...It is a bold position to take. The secondary bit of evidence, that Yorick who Hamlet played with as a child died 23 years ago, is harder to contradict. But Roth finds Q1 evidence that the line was originally 12 years, which would fall right in line.As I said above, and as my regular readers probably know, this is not how I do it. There s a world of difference between just assuming that some time elapsed before the nunnery confrontation, and mapping that time out to a number of days, a time of year, everything. The flowers that Ophelia picked (if she didn t imagine them), were they in bloom at that time of year? The old king was supposedly sleeping in his orchard... how cold was it? There are folks that eat that stuff up. I m willing to bet that there s a handful of regular readers of my blog, in fact, who are all over it.It s often hard to make the case, and Roth knows that. When he s got details he makes his case clear. When the case is a little weaker on fact, he s not afraid to say That sounds about right. In particular, Hamlet s time with the pirates is particularly tricky to nail down.There are also times where I just don t plain understand what calendar we re supposed to be using. The anachronism of going back to Wittenberg is oft cited it wasn t there in Hamlet s time, but would have been in Shakespeare s time. Ok, fair enough. But much of Roth s calendar calculation is done against the 1601 calendar, when Hamlet would have been *performed*, not when it took place. Is that too much a convenience? Did Hamlet really write in jokes and references that would have been out of date a year later, much less 400?Within all the calendar counting, though, there are still opportunities to learn new things (again, this is part of what I love). For instance, this book brings up the idea that Hamlet s harping on Gertrude not going to bed with Claudius is not because he s got some Oedipal issues, but because (if Hamlet is 16, mind you), Gertrude is clearly still young enough to bear a child by Claudius. A child that would be next in line to the throne, bumping Hamlet out of the picture. Maybe that s common knowledge, but I d never thought of it. And if Hamlet is 30, it s more far fetched.Roth s book is small, barely 150 pages, and has it s fair share of tables taking up space. So it s a quick read. You don t have to buy the Hamlet is 16 premise to enjoy it either, though Roth certainly makes a good showing for his case. This book would be a fine addition to the collection of any Hamlet geeks out there.--Shakespearegeek BlogThe problem with much of the criticism that's been published in the past couple of centuries (at least from what I've seen) is that orthodoxy has led to stagnation and too often writers tie themselves in knots quoting from and disproving what has gone before instead of contributing something truly innovative on the subject. Plus it's usually impenetrable and oppressive to the point of becoming unreadable.Which makes Steve Roth's Hamlet: The Undiscovered Country (of which the author was good enough to send me a copy) a rare pleasure because it's very readable and manages to illuminate at least two aspects of the play that hadn't occurred, at least to me, to the point that it makes me wonder if theatre has been doing the play a disservice for the past four hundred years. Roth's persuasive central thesis which for some reason isn't mentioned on the cover (making the book seem from the outside like just a general survey of the play) is that Hamlet is a teenager, just sixteen years old and that the time scheme of the play spans the six month period from September 1601 and February 1602.The opening chapter regarding Hamlet's age is available at the book's promotional website along with a wealth of background evidential material. It seems only proper to let you read the chapter yourself and enjoy the eureka moment (assuming that, like me, you're not a textual scholar). Whilst it's true that \"sexton\" does refer to \"officer charged with the maintenance of its buildings and/or the surrounding graveyard\" [wiki] sixteen does seem like a better fit - and indeed Shakespeare always substituted words to create double meaning - his intention could have been to imply both.If you assume that Hamlet is indeed just sixteen as the text of the First Folio suggests, as Roth goes on to demonstrate in the remainder of the book, all kinds of curious elements of the play begin to fall into place. Hamlet's somewhat petulant behaviour becomes perfectly natural when we realise that we're watching the story of a teenager on the edge of adulthood, that it's a good old fashioned coming of age tale, a tragic teen drama with the cast predominantly made up of youngsters playing Ophelia, Laertes, Horatio, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.I love this. I also love that the gravedigger, far from the being the pensioner that turns up in most productions could in fact be \"just\" thirty years old, and Gertrude too, which as Roth notes means that she's still of child bearing age and able to produce an heir to the throne to cement Claudius's rights, simultaneously removing Hamlet from the accession (and explaining why he wasn't given the crown to begin with).If this book gains the large audience it deserves, perhaps we'll sometime see a film, which, after the Ghost scene features the caption \"Two Months Later. Tuesday 5th January 1602.\"--The Hamlet WeblogA quite remarkable study of what Steve calls \"the seminal text of the Humanist religion.\" --Joseph Mooney.

That Zachary has set this tale in the Ireland of several centuries ago is testament that these issues are not confined to the modern world.\" --Ken Mooney, writer of Godhead \"Zachary vividly brings post-Cromwell Ireland to life, showing us both the human cost of hatred and the human capacity to love long after we have closed ourselves off from the world.\" --Moira Katson, author ofThe Light & Shadow Trilogy \"I'm usually the kind of guy who reads books with explosions and gun fights, but Scott has given me a reason to care about a little group of Irish travelers.

A bad day for Gibbons gets worse when fellow agent Gary Peterson, working undercover, is shot while waiting to meet with crazy mob middleman Tony \"Bells\" Bellavita. Meanwhile, the Agency has let another mob associate, Bobby \"Freshy\" DeFresco, slide in exchange for introducing Tozzi, also working undercover, to Bells, who takes him to meet big-time loan shark Buddha Stanzione. Freshy is a minnow swimming among mob sharks, but Bells sponsors him because he's crazy for Freshy's sister, Gina, who's a buyer at Macy's-and who is Tozzi's current romantic interest as well, though she knows him only as \"Mike Santoro the pornmeister.\" Bells persuades Buddha to loan Freshy and Tozzi start-up dough, then takes them on a shakedown tour that ends at Macy's, where he sees his face on every TV-wanted for Peterson's shooting-and realizes that Tozzi is FBI. Enraged, Bells grabs Gina and Tozzi and splits with revenge on his mind-only to be followed, with hilariously limited success, by Freshy and an accomplice, who snatch Gibbons and his wife to track Bells in an FBI surveillance van. Multiple chase scenes, mob justice and women trouble for both agents are zanily choreographed by Bruno right up to a climactic Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade shootout. Though paced more slowly than other entries in the series, partly because of a relative paucity of Bruno's always drop-dead dialogue, this story builds white-knuckle tension even as its earthy heroes continue to amuse and charm.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00KL13WXK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I let my sexy imagination loose and before I knew it I'd filled a more than a few pages. The characters came to life and the story began to take shape.I'm blessed with incredible friends who were willing to read as I wrote. They offered insight and suggestions, but most importantly they offered unconditional support and encouragement to keep writing.And so began, the greatest chapter of my life.I was hooked. While I waited, I started writing another novel. An entirely new set of characters, a new setting, and a new plot began to take shape. By the end of October, I'd put the finishing touches onGoing the Distance, the story of Austin Campbell and Brett Tanner.Writing has been cathartic. Becoming published has been exhilarating.This journey isn't over. I continue to write, as time permits.
