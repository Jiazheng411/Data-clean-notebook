He was educated at Sydney Grammar School and at the University of Sydney, where he won a scholarship for classics, mathematics and chemistry. He did not complete a course at Sydney, but left for England at the age of 18 and entered St John's College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1876, and in 1877 studied at the University of Berlin. He was secretary of the Society of Hebrew Literature from 1878 to 1884, and in 1882 came into prominence as the writer of a series of articles in The Times on the persecution of the Jews in Russia. This led to the formation of the mansion house fund and committee, of which Jacobs was secretary from 1882 to 1900. During these years he gave much time to anthropological studies in connexion with the Jewish race, and became an authority on the question.\"(Quote from wikipedia.org)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 13, "rating_average": 3.9231, "rating_total": 51.0}

But as Herrup argues in this very scholarly study, the court was concerned with sodomy more as the source of \"disorder\" than as an immoral act. The sexual behaviors in the earl's mansion were not unusual for the times. What made Castlehaven different, Herrup carefully documents, was that the earl was threatening social order, disrupting societal expectations of nobility. The earl's encouragement of a servant attempting to rape his wife outraged the nobles not out of concern for the woman but because cross-class sex threatened to \"pollute\" the noble lineage. Likewise, his son complained about the earl's sex with servants not because of sexual propriety but because his father was giving them land and wealth the son expected to inherit. Herrup (history and law, Duke Univ.; The Common Peace) presents this interesting argument clearly and thoroughly. A good choice for legal and academic collections, a little dry for public collections.ARobert C.

In classical Judaism, God will ultimately send the Messiah to raise the dead and open the way toward the restoration of Eden. For Christians, the second coming of Jesus, the true Messiah, will bring final redemption and the kingdom of God on earth. Levine, a Reform rabbi, ably explores these differences while emphasizing Jewish notions of the Messiah and their history. He traces the stories of the false messiahs such as Bar Kokhba in the first century, Sabbatai Tzvi in the 17th century and Jacob Frank in the 18th century. Also, he examines the question of whether or not the late Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, was the Messiah, as some of his followers believe. Throughout, Levine explains his own idea about the Messiah by exhorting his readers to accept responsibility for \"the messianic mission intended for each one of us.\" He argues that individual efforts to follow the mitzvoth (commandments) constitute the kind of \"messianic behavior\" that will prepare for the Messiah and bring the Messianic Age. His inspirational emphasis on personal accountability offers a distinctive message. While it is primarily directed to Jews, Levine's wide-ranging consideration of the idea of the Messiah suggests the utility of his thesis and the general appeal of his book even though it is a departure from normative Judaism.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Scott Savage-s first book in his new YA Fantasy series, Far World. A book that I found enjoyable, adventurous, and captivating. The characters are unique and skillfully drawn. Meet thirteen year old Marcus-a nobody, an outcast, living on earth where he is passed from one foster home to another. A boy with magical powers. Meet Kyja, a thirteen-year-old girl who lives in Far World, a magical place where horses tell jokes and the sun rises to dawn chimes. But Kyja is a girl who can do no magic, and isn-t affected by magic, or so she thinks. Meet Master Therapass, a powerful wizard who has kept a dangerous secret for thirteen years. When the Dark Circle discovers the secret, the two worlds of Marcus and Kyja collide. Together they must outsmart the Dark Circle and travel to Water Keep-the first elemental that can help them defeat the Dark Circle. Far World is full of suspense, humor, and surprising twists that will keep readers of any age guessing. After I read Far World, I went back to the store and bought three more copies for gifts.100 Readers Can't Be Wrong!, September 19, 2008By LuAnnI'm currently reading Farworld: Water Keep to my 7th grade classes---all 100 students---and every day kids come to class asking, \"Are you going to read Farworld to us today?\" On the days I say \"Yes\" a great cheer goes through the room.

As the estranged members of the Drummond family straggle into Florida for youngest sister Sarah's impending space shuttle launch, we only begin to glimpse the true meaning of the worddysfunctional. The family, plagued by terminal disease, financial disaster, felonious activity, infidelity, and violence, is forced--by a series of ever more fantastic occurrences--to attempt to deal with each other. That would be an easier task if they didn't loathe one another with a ferocity usually reserved for war criminals. It's not quite Jerry Springer-style tabloid TV set in Disney's Haunted Mansion, but the family members do muster the strength to insult, assault, and infect one another with abandon. With the exception of the family matriarch, Janet, they are unappealing and selfish, but without Machiavellian brilliance. Instead, they're inclined toward out-and-out stupidity, blinded by self-interest rather than enlightened by it. As they bumble through misadventure after misadventure, there seems to be no reason to cheer for them. Even Sarah, the family's shining star, has her dark side.True to Coupland's style, the book reads lightning fast. The author punctuates his narrative with clipped dialogue and punchy exchanges that advance the palpable sense of unease and tension running throughout. And amidst the acrimony, Coupland throws a genuine caper into the plot, involving Prince William's farewell letter to his mother,Princess Diana. Add to that the oppressive heat and the postmodern, pop culture junkyard of Coupland's Florida setting, and the entire book brews and builds like a roiling tropical storm.--S.

She faces pressure from both her less-than-understanding Cross family and her disintegrating Naught family, and everyone in between. When her brother-in-law's violent behavior leads to murder, Sephy provides a false alibi to save Jude, but doing so irreparably damages other lives. Second in Blackman's trilogy, this work presents similar themes with the same lack of subtlety that dominated the first work; Blackman's approach to communicating racism is to change instances of black disenfranchisement to white. The most popular white rocker is actually black; white performers must use the back doors to enter venues; popular desserts have racist names. Such a heavy hand leaves readers alienated from the dark history of racism. Jude and Sephy dominate the narrative, though occasionally other voices are included. Stiff language and murky motivation hamper the thin characters from generating emotional suspense. Jacqueline Woodson'sIf You Come Softly(Putnam, 1998) and Trudy B. Krisher'sSpite Fences(Random, 1994) address similar issues, but with rich characters and taut feeling.

In \"The Fair Jilt,\" the beautiful and treacherous Miranda is chaperoned in a convent while deciding which of her many suitors she will have. When denied her first choice, she is quick to exact her revenge. \"Oroonoko\" is the tale of a young African prince who is tricked into slavery and brought to Surinam. When he meets up again with the lover he believed was dead, he is doubly determined to live free or die. What is remarkable about these stories is the tremendous willpower of the characters. Aphra Behn's protagonists clearly reflect her own passion for life, a spirit which led her to write in a letter to a male colleague: \"All I ask is the privilege... to tread in those successful paths my predecessors have so long thrived in ... If I must not because of my sex, have this freedom, but that you will usurp all to yourselves; I lay down my quill and you shall have no more of me.\" Fortunately, Aphra Behn persevered and her work, like her life - unhampered by either modesty or apology - exudes a rare vitality.-- For great reviews of books for girls, check outLet's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14. --From500 Great Books by Women; review by Sonja Larsen", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The lost girls of the title could be a girl's hockey team and their coach/schoolteacher from contemporary Earth who find themselves on Ellerkan, a planet that seems to be stuck in a medieval society. But like Ellerkan, the story is not what it seems. The other lost girls trapped on this planet are the Androktones, genetically engineered clones designed and programmed for war.They are strong, fearless and viciously brutal. But they are not evil; they do what they do because they have to, they have no choice. And they don't age or die, they have to be killed. But the war was a long time ago, and the Androktones that survive are now old, tired, and not as perfect as they once were. And the fact that they are female means that they are still hunted by the Knights and Royalty of Ellerkan for the sport and pleasure they can bring.The Royal Hunts are a barbaric tradition as ancient as the Androktones themselves. But is it the hunters or the hunted that areevil? Rolf L'Epine, a tailorat the Court of King L'Hage is the first to question this.

In his famous 'fireside chats,' the president adopted a down-to-earth, fatherly tone, but when the occasion demanded it, he could thunderously deliver such lines as, 'this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.' A fine contextualization of Roosevelt's life and times.\" --Kirkus ReviewsAn uncommon portrait of Roosevelt's presidency, in words, photographs, and his own voiceThis vivid portrait shows a nation at its best and at its worst, through the lens of a president's words during the first presidency truly impacted by the media age. An FDR biography unlike any other, Together We Cannot Fail offers a new view of Roosevelt's transformation of an insular America into the world's most revered and feared superpower. An exclusive accompanying audio integrates with the biography to reveal in his own words how he led the nation through the Great Depression and World War II to its \"rendezvous with destiny.\"Historian Terry Golway brings alive how Roosevelt saved America from its worst fears and led the nation to victory in a cataclysmic world war and by doing so forever changed how Americans live and view themselves. Crafted from Roosevelt's own stirring words, this unique biography shows how he invented and established the practice of the media presidency with his famous fireside chats, the first presidential speeches broadcast nationally from the White House.For twelve tumultuous presidential years, Roosevelt regularly spoke to the American people, this man of wealth and privilege giving voice to the downtrodden's American Dream. The first in a long line of media presidencies, Roosevelt's innate ability to connect with the people remains the standard by which even the best of them-Kennedy, Reagan, and Obama alike-are judged. Roosevelt's words would define a remarkable presidency that faced and overcame the country's worst economic crisis and a war to end all wars.Together We Cannot Fail brings the president and his era to life like no other biography, combining the insight of noted historian Terry Golway with Roosevelt's own voice in audio excerpts from his most memorable speeches and chats.Kindle Edition with Audio/Video includes:Audio for 30 famous speeches", "related": [], "rank": 3124480, "title": "Together We Cannot Fail eBook", "author": "Terry Golway", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Local police, the Bureau of Land Management and the FBI stumble into each other in a counterproductive tug-of-war for jurisdiction in the ensuing investigation. Phoenix gets involved when BLM bureaucrats threaten to use the incident as an excuse to close Big Toe's economically vital museum. Reid Dorbandt, a homicide detective, who happens to have saved Ansel's life inMesozoic Murder, demands that she keep him apprised of the sting operation into which she's drafted to root out illegal fossil sales connected with the strange death. The cheekily appealing Ansel must summon extraordinary strength and native wisdom to battle greedy corruption, personal demons and the harsh environment of the badlands. Though several plot-thickening coincidences strain credulity, the snowballing pace will keep the reader turning the pages until the unexpected finish.(Apr. 11)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Personal Anecdotes: I, like many Anne Rice fans, loved her vampire stories. I am a prolific vistor to her web site, and I read the blogs faithfully. I read one blog where Ms. Rice responded to a multitude of fans begging for a Christian Vampire. Ms. Rice adamantly refuses to write more about vampires. To my mind this left a void to be filled. I love 'Joan of Arc', \"Dracula\", and all things Anne Rice. I thought, what could be cooler and fill this craving of her fans, than one of the most devout heroines in history. This is a delicate balance to achieve, taking a much beloved historical figure, and exploring a semi-dark side that in a whimisical mind could exist.

It is penetrating, concise, and uncommonly practical. Glaspey gives believers all the tools we need to cultivate a life of prayer. Read it. Apply it. And enjoy stepping into the presence of God.”—Jeff Crosby, editor and compiler ofDays of Grace Through the Year“We all need to be inspired to pray more, and Terry Glaspey’s book on prayer does just that. It is delightfully written and entertaining to read. I have known Terry for many years and have seen that he has the talent of a true writer. He also has a heart that longs for a closer walk with God and the assurance that his life is being lived in an effective and fruitful way. And he knows that none of this happens without prayer.”—Stormie Omartian, author of The Power of a Praying®series“We all know there is power in prayer, but it’s not always easy to exercise that power.

Glaspey shows us that prayer is not about religious ritual but about a familiar friendship with God. This book is filled with simple yet profound steps that will help every reader move toward a more intimate relationship with God and begin to see the world through His eyes every minute of every day.”—Sharon Jaynes, international speaker and author ofBecoming a Woman who Listens to GodandWhat God Really Thinks about Women “Writing with the winsome tone of an encouraging friend, Terry Glaspey uses a little book to explore a big topic: the often daunting challenge of prayer.25 Keys to Life-Changing Prayeris the perfect primer for someone new to prayer, and great inspiration for someone who desires to renew their prayers.”—Gary Thomas, author ofSacred Marriageand founder of the Center for Evangelical Spirituality “I’ve read quite a few books on prayer—from classic to contemporary—and this is the most practical and winsome book on prayer I’ve ever read. Rather than coming at me like a saint from the past whose prayer life and prayers are way outside my grasp, Terry Glaspey comes alongside and nudges me along, providing useful suggestions and illustrations that encourage me to be a much more purposeful and regular pray-er.

He'd outrun them.The story wrote itself once the characters were formed. In the end, two brave warriors meet in a life and death battle, their strengths equal. Who will prevail? In the typical western, the \"bad guy\" was almost always the Indian and would thus, lose. But, life wasn't always like that in the Old West. Sometimes, the \"good guys\" lost.

Complex psychological phenomena - such a love and hatred, selfhood and identity, and creativity - are shown to emerge from the fluidly shifting interplay of multiple motivational systems, always complexly embedded in a nexus of relational contexts.

These epics lie at the beginning of the Western canon of literature, and have had an enormous influence on the history of literature. When he lived is unknown. Herodotus estimates that Homer lived 400 years before his own time, which would place him at around 850 BC, while other ancient sources claim that he lived much nearer to the supposed time of the Trojan War, in the early 12th century BC. Most modern researchers place Homer in the 7th or 8th centuries BC. The formative influence of the Homeric epics in shaping Greek culture was widely recognized, and Homer was described as the teacher of Greece. Homer's works, which are about fifty percent speeches, provided models in persuasive speaking and writing that were emulated throughout the ancient and medieval Greek worlds. Fragments of Homer account for nearly half of all identifiable Greek literary papyrus finds. Period For modern scholars \"the date of Homer\" refers not to an individual, but to the period when the epics were created. The consensus is that \"the Iliad and the Odyssey date from around the 8th century BC, the Iliad being composed before the Odyssey, perhaps by some decades,\" i.e. earlier than Hesiod, the Iliad being the oldest work of Western literature. Over the past few decades, some scholars have argued for a 7th-century BC date. Oliver Taplin believes that the conclusion of modern researchers is that Homer dates to between 750 to 650 BC. Some of those who argue that the Homeric poems developed gradually over a long period of time give an even later date for the composition of the poems; according to Gregory Nagy for example, they only became fixed texts in the 6th century BC. The question of the historicity of Homer the individual is known as the \"Homeric question\"; there is no reliable biographical information handed down from classical antiquity.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The focus of his teaching has always sought to help people experience life with higher goals and purpose. In the past decade he has focused on aspects of marriage and family relationships in his study and teaching. His writings have been born out of a concern that was developed for people who came for marriage and premarital counseling as well as observing the struggles so many have in society. Many are divorcing not because marriage is bad, but because they don't know how to establish and maintain relationships. Many leave one marriage only to find they are taking their inability to maintain relationships into their next marriage. Some learn to get it right but many more don't. He has written the relationship series to give people fresh ideas to help them grow in their understanding of the other and to give instruction of how to implement them into practical living.

Working particularly with lupus patients, he has accrued vast knowledge of chronic illness, insurance and hospital administration. Here, in the voice of a caring doctor whose primary concern is always the welfare of his patients, Lockshin provides moving human case histories that illustrate current issues and dilemmas in American medicine. His prognosis is bleak, as he details how the personal welfare of individuals and their families is often ignored by a system obsessed with numbers and, ultimately, \"comfortable profits.\" Lockshin finds that, in particular, the elderly, the poor and those with chronic illnesses are not well served by the number-crunching approach of insurance companies and hospital administrations. He observes that limiting the number and kinds of tests and procedures, the length of hospital stays and access to specialists keeps costs down in the short term, but drastically reduces the quality of care and often ends up costing more later. In this enlightening and frightening book, Lockshin carefully considers all sides to his arguments and, finally, offers hope that beneficial compromise is still possible.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dreams are on hold, prayers seem unanswered, and life can feel hard. During these times it can be difficult to see God in our situations and trust him with the future.But one thing is certain, says Debbie Alsdorf: \"God longs to give us his peace just as much as we long to receive it. And there is no joy in this world like a mind at peace.\" With empathy and wit, she guides you through the book of Philippians, encouraging you to lean on God, to live one day at a time, to rejoice and not to worry, and to give thanks to God in all circumstances of life. The discussion questions and study guide make this book perfect for individual or small group use.If you yearn for confidence and peace, if you long to live fully in the moment in every season of life,A Woman Who Trusts Godis your pathway to a new perspective.\"Debbie Alsdorf reminds all of us that living in 'the meantime' is only a chapter in our lives. We can choose to resist fear, practice contentment, forgive others, and enjoy a new kind of confidence. You'll want to take a group of friends through this transformational study. I highly recommend it!\"--Carol Kent, speaker, author,Between a Rock and a Grace Place\"As a fellow recovering control freak, I find Debbie Alsdorf's common sense and biblical wisdom to be like stepping into a spa for the soul.

Written by a primate photographer who has accompanied Galdikas through Borneo's rainforests, this first entry in the Great Naturalists series introduces the famed primatologist and her passion. With Dian Fossey and Jane Goodall, Galdikas completes the primate research triangle whose participants were mentored by the late Louis Leakey. And like these contemporaries, Galdikas possesses remarkable determination. Orangutan research proves especially daunting: \"unlike the highly social chimpanzees, great apes . . . who travel on the ground, orangutans live alone in the trees and travel by swinging.\" Each day, Galdikas traveled far from camp, \"drenched by rain, caked with mud, and bleeding from leech bites\"; she endured \"mysterious infections,\" subsisted on canned sardines, and watched her scant belongings rot in the extreme humidity. In brief, well organized chapters and highly readable prose, Gallardo interlaces intriguing observations of orangutans with the life of their patient observer and rehabilitator. The book will rouse readers of all ages not only to a curiosity for primates, but also to admiration for those who brave adversity to eke out a larger understanding of the natural environment.

It kept me reading continually from the minute I started it. It is full of emotion, and you really live what the main character is going through. But more importantly, the wonderful truths that are contained in this book will really begin to change you.You will learn why you do what you do; why you react in certain ways and how to change them if they are bad; and how to live the kind of life that God intended you to live.This is a must read, and every home should have a copy of it to refer back to all the time!Joan – San Diego, CaliforniaWhen I read the Blessing Code for the first time, I didn't discover the treasure within it. But when I went through it a second time, I started to realize that this was an inheritance that was also given to me. The only thing I would have to do is to discover the treasures and apply them, like Bill. The Blessing Code book is with me every day. I always carry it in my bag to work. Over lunchtime I read the confessions or a bible passage out loud and I practise these principles with great joy. I can say: they work and they have brought also great peace and satisfaction to me. Whenever I need a word of encouragement or need to rise up in the Lord, I go back to the book and read it again for a while. For me this book is so precious and the Lord has spoken to me through these pages as never before. This book is so honest and true and will show every believer how to walk in the full potential of the Lord.With a thankful heart, Suzanne.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Maryn could hear the distant clanging of the blacksmith's hammer and barely-audible voices as she and her father picked their way up the steep incline leading to the gatehouse entry.\"Aye, this be as fine a fortress as the lad said 'twould be someday. Fergus, God rest his soul, told me his grandson spent these years building its defenses using the skill of some of the finest craftsmen.\"'Tis massive, Maryn mused. She wondered how many people lived behind its walls. 'Twas larger than the Maclean holding, and that one was three times the size of their own fortress. She tried to envision what it must have looked like after the massacre, but could not.\"You said the older man, Angus, died two years past? That must have been painful for Laird MacLaurin. Was he not the MacLaurin's mentor and friend?\" Maryn asked.\"Aye, he died of a lung fever. I heard the lad was desolate for quite a time afterward. I know not how he fares now, but we are bound to see for ourselves in only a short time.\"She had a vague memory of meeting Laird MacLaurin as a bairn, but the memories were interwoven with the fantastical bible story of David and Goliath she had loved so well at that time. She was having trouble separating truth from myth where the MacLaurin was concerned, and 'twas an added disturbance to her already frayed nerves to know of the barbaric violence that made up his early years.\"Papa, I think this scheme of yours will surely go awry. For, why would a man of Laird MacLaurin's wealth and renown marry a lass such as me? I can bring naught to this union; no wealth, no important alliances--and I certainly am not known for my courtly refinement.\" Her heart pounded in her chest as panic gripped her. She couldn't take in a breath. Her hands felt clammy inside her gloves. Oh, God. There was little doubt that this man would not only be appalled by her rural ways, but look upon her with only contempt once the truth of their need for this marriage was made known to him.Laird Donald patted his daughter's knee. \"You are as lovely and gentle a lass as the Highlands has ever borne--you must not worry on that score.\" Straightening in his saddle, he continued, \"And ease yourself over the whys and wherefores regarding the rest, daughter. Leave the details to me. I've a strong suspicion that you shall be Lady MacLaurin by nightfall, my dove.\"As they moved closer to the gatehouse, the drawbridge began to lower and the portcullis began to rise.\"Ah, I see the Maclean's missive arrived. We are expected, and glad I am of that,\" Laird Donald said.A stableman awaited them in the courtyard. The sturdy lad moved toward Maryn and attempted to help her dismount. \"Nay, lad, I must take care of my mare myself. She's quite particular and wants only me to tend her.\"\"But m'lady--\"\"Ease yourself. Show me the way to the stables and all will be well. I shall explain the predicament to your marshal, fear you not.\"\"Aye, m'lady,\" the lad replied and began leading the two travelers towards the stables.* * *Neither guest was aware of Daniel's presence as he stood watching the exchange a few yards away. Laird Donald's daughter was so covered up, he could not see more than an outline of her face. But he liked her voice; 'twas low and mellow. He wondered what other changes he'd find in the impish bairn he remembered. An image of an older version of the filth-covered lass came to mind--but with a much larger slingshot. He chuckled and shook his head. God's truth, 'twould be dreadful!Turning his eye then to the father, Daniel studied the man he'd met twelve years before. The laird looked much older than he remembered. And seeing the weary way in which he now moved, Daniel wondered once again at the reason for the hastily arranged visit. For the journey to this holding was a long one, and not easily traveled.As he made his way over to the stable to greet his weary guests, Daniel's eyes were inexorably drawn once again to the daughter. There was something in the lass's manner that he found alluring. She was of medium height and slight of build, but clearly a woman full grown.The fur-lined hood of her rose-colored cloak slipped down as she dismounted and she pushed it back further, revealing a long, thick mass of unbound hair. 'Twas darker than he remembered, and much more stunning. Where it had been a light cinnamon in her childhood, now it had deepened to an appealing shade of dark bronze. Was it as soft as it looked? A sudden impulse to run his fingers through the thick curls made them twitch.* * *Maryn turned when she heard someone approaching from behind and her gaze instantly snagged on a virile, auburn-haired warrior. Lord, the man was so tall! And wide! And he had the biggest hands she'd ever seen. But the green eyes...aye, those eyes she remembered well. This would be Laird MacLaurin, then.She'd heard a tale of his savage revenge on his own father and of how he'd become one of the strongest and meanest fighting men in the Highlands. She'd hoped that story was a magnified report, but now, with this first sight of him, she knew it must be true. Her heart tripped in her chest. Would she be binding herself to a massive brute with no tendencies toward gentleness or compassion?* * *Daniel stood transfixed. Where was the filth sprite of all those years past? Gone. And in her place, a goddess. God's truth, she was lovely--far fairer than he would ever have imagined her to grow to be.\"Good morrow, lad,\" Laird Donald said jovially.Giving himself a mental shake, Daniel turned to his guest and clapped him on the back. \"'Tis good seeing you again after so many years. I hope your journey was a safe one.\" Unable to deny the pull of her essence, his eyes settled once more on the beauty standing before him. \"I've had bedchambers prepared for the both of you and there is a light repast awaiting your arrival in the great hall.\" Buoyed on a wave of excitement, he took her hand. 'Twas small, dainty, with skin as soft as down. Her eyes, the color of new-combed honey, softened when he said, \"'Tis been too many years since last we met.\" His lips crooked into a smile as he teased, \"I pray you are not so inclined to fell me with your slingshot?\"A look of confusion flitted across her countenance followed swiftly by a fiery blush. Clearly, she had little memory of their previous meeting. His smile broadened even as his heartbeat quickened.\"Nay, laird, 'tis my wish that we be friends, not foes,\" she said. Her voice pulsed through him. Like soft, knowing fingers strumming tight, hot skin, it sent blood rushing to his groin. Not until her cheeks pinkened and she looked away did he realize he'd been staring at her.He coughed into his fist. \"Well, yes...That pleases me, as I wish much the same.\" He tipped his head in the direction of the keep. \"May I escort you to the great hall?\"Laird Donald shook his head, answering for his daughter. \"The lass needs to take care of her mare. Let us go inside and Maryn will meet us there when she has completed her tasks.\"Daniel reluctantly released her hand. \"Until later, then,\" he said softly. Turning, he walked with Laird Donald toward the entrance to his home.\"Your daughter has grown into a lovely woman,\" Daniel commented after a moment. \"'Tis surprised I am that she is not yet wed--is she?\"\"Nay, she is not. Tho' there is a very good chance that a fortunate alliance will take place quite soon.\"Daniel's spirits plummeted. \"Ah, I see.\"You have no right to have feelings on the matter, he reminded himself.* * *", "related": ["B00KY0YURU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 28.0}

Help for Victims of Child Sexual Abuse (Even if they are adults now),as a beginning self-help book for former abuse victims who want to understand more about child sexual abuse and begin changing its effects on their lives. It, like all her books, is available as an ebook and in paperback.Voices of Survivors, containing selections from the longer book, presents stories of former victims, along with other basic information about child sexual abuse. These stories form an especially powerful part of the self-help book. They let former victims know they are not alone, that others have survived similar experiences of abuse.Dr. Daugherty wrote her ebook,Child Molesters, Child Rapists, and Child Sexual Abuse,to help former victims, and the general public, understand more about how child sexual abuse takes place and what motivates abusers. It reinforces the idea that children are not abused because there is something \"wrong\" with them, but because there is something \"wrong\" with the abuser.A former National Science Foundation Fellow, adjunct university professor, and internationally respected expert on child sexual abuse, Dr. Daugherty and her husband, a retired attorney, now divide their time between New Mexico and Florida where Dr. Daugherty concentrates on her writing.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Rozan's memorable Lydia Chin/Bill Smithseries of mysteries, and the tough and taciturn private eye really comes into his own. Smith has cloistered himself in his remote cabin in upstate New York, where he escapes from his private devils by fishing, hunting, and practicing Mozart and Bach on his piano, when he is sucked into two local crime cases.The first involves Tony Antonelli, the brother of a young man whom Smith once helped out of trouble. Tony finds the body of a murdered local hoodlum in the cellar of his roadhouse. His brother Jimmy suspiciously goes missing and becomes the leading suspect. The second case involves a reclusive older woman (who turns out to be a world-famous painter). She asks Bill to track down some of her early works, which had been stolen from her studio. There's also a very nasty sheriff who hates Smith, a moderately tolerant state trooper who grudgingly helps, a corrupt executive of a babyfood company and his sad, dangerous teenage daughter, plus a crew of smalltime crooks who give the lie to the myth of rural safety. Lydia doesn't get called in from the Big Apple until quite late, and when she arrives she attracts stares in the local 7-Eleven \"as though she were a black-petalled orchid that had sprung up in the daisy patch. Back in the car, Lydia grinned, said, 'Not many Asians up here, huh?' 'Especially in black leather,'\" Bill answers.\"The plot might have one or two tangles too many for its own good, but as usual Rozan proves herself to be one of the best descriptive writers in the genre, bringing to indelible life everything from a modern painter's latest work, to a depressed countryside where the last stone quarry is about to close down and grind away a few more dreams.Other books in this award-winning series:A Bitter Feast,Concourse,Mandarin Plaid, andNo Colder Place.--Dick Adler", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Enforcement decisions by regulators are examined, along with considerations arising from US. GAAP and the SEC guidance that has been developed in the context of the use of IFRSs by foreign private issuers.The second part compares the two bodies of standards against each other, at an item-by-item level, in order to identify solutions under one set of standards to issues arising under the other. The author provides ready-made dual reporting tools to aid financial statement preparers in designing the structure of the financial statements under IFRSs, U.S. GAAP, and SEC rules and regulations, as well as to reconcile respective captions and the line items. Potential problem areas are highlighted through an examination of the subtleties and interpretations relating to the IASB-IFRSs, certain jurisdictional versions of IFRSs, and implications in SEC filings.Each chapter contains commentary sections, which highlight the similarities differences, and grey areas between IFRS, U.S. GAAP, the SEC rules and regulations, and other accounting jurisdictions.

These real-world case studies are generally short and to the point, and illustrate the most important topics presented in the chapter.Chapters that deal with the same basic concept use a consistent example.The same graphical and numerical model is used in Chapters 2 through 6 (the chapters that deal with trade theory and policy) eliminating the need to start with a new example each time.Examples that use actual numbers and graphsare presented on scales.This makes the various concepts and theories presented more concrete, accessible, pertinent, and the graphs easier to read and understand.Helpful learning tools reinforce key concepts.Each chapter includes a wealth of learning tools, such as Learning Objectives, Key Terms, Concept Checks, Summaries, Review Questions and Problems, and Internet links.Web resources keep you up to date.The Companion Website (www.wiley.com/college/salvatore) for this text presents additional examples, cases, and theoretical points and questions, as well as problems that can be answered or solved using the Internet.

Elements of those stories have now evolved into full-length books.  Momisms: Mama Never Told Me There Would Be Days Like This was Robinson's premiere project, mirroring the crazy things that happened in the Robinson household after the birth of her two children. Momisms was republished as an ebook in 2011 as Mommy Moments.  Robinson later stepped into the arena of inspirational fiction with her first novel, Brotherly Love & Betrayal.

The introduction provides a brief overview of Islam’s political development from the time of the Prophet to the present, and it ties changes in Islam’s political fortunes to the evolution of political thought. The introduction ends by outlining the themes used for organizing entries for this work: major themes (15 longer entries that focus on authority and religion—philosophy is strangely absent); historical developments (dynasties, geographical areas, and various religious interpretations); modern concepts; Islamic law and traditional society; and prominent personalities (mostly political and religious leaders but some philosophers). The work focuses on implementing ideas rather than on developing novel ideas.   A list of entries, contributors, political maps, and country statistics of Muslim population and percentage precede the alphabetical entries. There are cross-references and lists of additional references for those interested in further study. Although the geographical region covered includes the entire world, there is greater emphasis on Arabia and North Africa, the traditional heartlands of Islam. Areas where Muslims are a significant minority tend to be underemphasized. Although Shiite and Sunni perspectives are covered, as are premodern and modern developments, this work emphasis Sunni and postmodern developments.   A single-volume work that attempts to cover a subject area as vast as this one necessarily limits itself to providing only a cursory overview of the subject matter. Although the content may be suitable for high-school students, the reading level suggests that it is written for undergraduate and graduate students. Hence, this encyclopedia is a good place to start, but those seeking anything beyond a brief overview of the subject will need to obtain supplementary reference material. --Muhammed Hassanali", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Their superlative integration of the worlds of high culture and popular experience will enrich the study of English literature, society, and politics from the Reformation through the Enlightenment.\"Gary De Krey, Professor of British and European History, St Olaf College\"There is a big story here - how, between 1550 and 1750, London became a great world capital - but there are also a thousand small and even more wonderful stories about the men and women who walked the city's streets. Their experiences, their hopes, and their disappointments come vividly to life in this compulsively readable account.\"Lena Cowen Orlin, author of Locating Privacy in Tudor London\"This book is a must for anyone interested in London. It covers the period when London rose from being a quite important Northern European trading center to become the greatest international port in the world at the hub of not just the emerging British Empire but European and North American trade. The internationally connected city, at the center of trade, determined the character of the city it has become today, including the weight of its international finance and trade sectors, its globally diverse population and the worldwide influences on its heritage and contemporary culture.\"Ken Livingstone, first Mayor of London\"A compass to navigate in the dark, an A to Z of London's past, from beggars to kings, from Shakespeare to Dr Johnson; Bucholz and Ward have created a compelling picture of the Great Wen in all its premodern glory.\"Tim Hitchcock, Professor of Eighteenth-Century History, University of Hertfordshire, and Co-Director of Old Bailey Online\"[London is] a serious and remarkably successful attempt to describe how the city reached the cusp of 'modernity', how it emerged from relative obscurity in the middle of the sixteenth century to become, about 200 years later, 'the greatest city in Europe', with a population whose distinctive traits are recognizable to this day.\"Jonathan Yardley, The Washington Post\"Grounded in the latest scholarship and crafted in engaging prose, this wbook will instruct and delight generations of students and a broader reading public alike.  Highly recommended.\"Choice\"... I can give it a strong recommendation.\"Tyler Cowen, MarginalRevolution.com\"A fantastic resource for students and scholars of London's diverse and changing communities during the early modern period. Handsomely illustrated with maps, engravings, etchings, paintings and news-sheet covers, the book takes a holistic approach to its subject.\"Adam Hansen, The Literary London Journal\"...

I absolutely loved it and I can't wait for the next one in the series to come out.Carldeena is a wonderful character who is lonesome. Marty is a vampire who is living in a lonely world with a burden on his shoulders. Carldeena walked into the bar Marty co-owned with his friend Greg one night and turned Marty's world upside down. Then she gets bad news and that turns both of their worlds into a whirlwind. These two characters have such a connection from the very beginning it is amazing. I wish I had that kind of connection in my own relationship. Carldeena is so good and understanding to Marty about the burden he carries it is very touching.Ronna Gage did an excellent job on One Bite Away. I will be keeping this book on my shelf and will be looking forward to the next book in the series.   *********************************************Coffe Time Romance and More   Rating: 5 CupsMarty has been a vampire for more years than he wishes to discuss. He exists with the knowledge that he condemned the one he loved to an eternity in hell.

We all live in Hilmar, California. I have been an elementary teacher for twenty-six years and I always tell my students they can do anything they want to do and not to let anyone tell them differently. It wasn’t until 2001 that the urge to write returned and it came on with a vengeance. To date I have written forty-five novels. You will notice that in all my novels the characters have pets. That’s because I always have a multitude of animals in my life. Right now I have three dogs, a rabbit and two Russian tortoises. Under PDMusso, I have two fantasy novel series. Dawn of Destiny is part of the Hunters series and Recruitment is part of the Blood Badge series. Visit my website: www.pdmusso.com Under Peggy Dulle, I have several published mystery novels. In my Liza Wilcox Mysteries series: Death is Clowning Around, Apple Pots and Funeral Plots, Secrets at Sea, and Saddle Up.

With such diversity surrounding her from childhood, she still managed to grow up and develop a deep love of books. It was only natural that along the way, she would write them too. The Survivors: The Time of Chaos is her first published book. More will undoubtedly follow. Today, after many incarnations along the way, Gia Scott lives in Mississippi with her husband, three dogs, and two cats in a funny little house surrounded by very big and gnarly trees. Having reached that age of privilege, she can often be found in her garden, wearing peculiar clothes and tending her plants. When she can talk her husband into it, they enjoy going for road trips, looking for the elusive town of New Hope. In between road trips and gardening, she manages to fit in an internet radio talk show called the Dawn of Shades, interviewing a variety of people, including other authors, and promoting causes dear to her heart. In addition to all of that, she does maintain blogs on general topics, cooking & food, and camping, emergency preparedness & outdoors activities. She also helps with content for websites.", "related": [], "rank": 1794797, "title": "The Time of Chaos (The Survivors Book 1) eBook", "author": "Gia Scott", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.4, "rating_total": 22.0}

Absolutely. I write about the things that inspire me, both in this world and in realms only seen with the imagination. My heroines are sassy and strong. My heroes are sometimes shy. I have an obsession with music (and musicians) and a fascination with wings. I believe true love does exist, and sometimes it is found in the strangest, most unexpected places. I also believe that family and close friends are the glue that holds people together.  Above all things, I believe in being true to yourself and seizing the day. Life is an amazing gift.

Ari ponders the fate of a would-be liberator of fellow Jews dying at the Inquisitor’s stake, a poetic astronomer perishing in the Black Plague, a sophisticated (and posthumously famous) philosopher excommunicated by his synagogue, a pioneering female physicist committing suicide after her famous lover abandons her, a confused kinswoman boarding a death train bound for Auschwitz, an unswerving communist sent to prison by Stalinist overlords, and, finally, a twin brother perishing in a railyard accident caused by Ari’s own mischievousness. Yet in recording his family’s travails, Ari finds a healing power by breaking through the suffocating silence of forgetfulness, a power exceeding that of the Cabalistic lore zealously preserved by Moricz’s father and his forebears. A supple translation of the Norwegian original conveys the cathartic force of this masterpiece. --Bryce Christensen", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fruelund’s prose is muscular, descriptive, and often lyrical. His characters are varied, as are their situations and the places they inhabit. These settings give a strong sense of locale but not necessarily of culture or country. What amazes about the most successful of these narratives is how much emotion and information the author can condense into so few words. In “Milk,” a walk in the rain exposes the hostility between two brothers. “Chairs” shows the life of an elderly woman who has altered her environment to suit her physical frailty. A retired teacher invites a former student to a jarring—in more ways than one—visit in “Unsettled.” Short story readers as well as fans of literary fiction will enjoy this collection. --Ellen Loughran", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He grew up on a 270-acre working farm in southern Maryland where the cash crop was tobacco. After graduating from military school, he earned a co-operative degree in electrical engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology while working during alternate quarters for an electric utility company as a student engineer. After graduation, he was commissioned as an U.S. Army officer during the Vietnam War. To the chagrin of the Army brass, he and his newlywed Bahamian wife spent their first year of marriage in upcountry Thailand on an \"unaccompanied\" tour where Peter was the officer-in-charge of a remote communications site. After active duty, he worked full time as an aerosystems engineer helping develop electronic systems for the F-111 airplane while attending Texas Christian University at night and being the father of two young children.  After obtaining a MBA degree from TCU, he spent several years building and managing cable television systems in Maine and Florida. He and his wife, Therese, have been married for forty-eight years and have lived in the Jacksonville, Florida area for the last thirty-five years where they own a home inspection business. They have three grown married children who have their own successful careers and so far have produced three healthy grandchildren.", "related": [], "rank": 3182200, "title": "THE HUN'S PLUMBERS A Military School Experience eBook", "author": "Peter Hitt", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The Martin Cole Novels, centred on the fictional Devon town of Roselake. The books blend humour and crime mystery.  The Blackpool Novels are grittier, a new British noir .

Not to mention regular trips to India, where he has travelled extensively over the last twenty years and now regularly attends classical music festivals. He has two grown-up children, and his wife Christine is a writer of mathematics courses and textbooks.

In the trilogy (Reflecting Emmy [out now], Nara Gazing\n[out October 2013], and Shattering GiGi [out November 2013]), we meet\n18-year-old Emmy who though young is already a part of her family's business,\nthe business of capturing narcissistic souls into compact mirrors. Her current\nassignment is an easy one: to capture the soul of Nara, the most self-absorbed\ngirl in high school. But easy is never really easy, is it? Not for Emmy. What\nunexpected turn of events happens? What does the turn mean for Emmy's\nassignment? Where will this adventure lead her and those she meets? How will it\nall affect her position in the family business? Well, you have to read all\nthree short stories in the Mirror, Mirror trilogy to get those answers. What I\ncan tell you is that Wallach gives us a great character in Emmy. Her voice is\nstrong and clear from the very first paragraph, and because of that, you're\nquickly brought into Emmy's world. I found this trilogy to be a fun, charming,\nand sweet read.

Do they believe that a man who wishes to marry a man is less important than they? Do they believe he doesn't deserve the same happiness as they? Do they believe he doesn't deserve the same recognition, support, and encouragement from society?Or do those who oppose same-sex marriage do so because of the action?

Or is it the action itself, the act of a man marrying a man, that they oppose?I could continue along to a conclusion--but that would be pointless.

The story builds suspense and anticipation and it had me turning the pages nonstop... 4 and 1/2 stars from Manic ReadersForever Blue is a lovely little love story.

I came to Washington, DC, bought an Apple II Plus computer and learned how to program. In my first job out of college, I did economic consulting for clients such as the CIA, World Bank, IMF and the State Department. I only had one job out of college before starting my own business. I got a masters from John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) in Global Theory and History. After graduation, I backpacked around the world for a year and visited over 50 countries. When I returned, I started a software company named Gnossos Software. Gnossos Software was a database CRM software product company. I grew Gnossos Software to a few million in revenue and sold the company in 2004. I took a year off in 2005 and came up with 100 business ideas. In 2006, I started a few of them under the name Lifebushido. Lifebushido is focused on building a global network of people, working part-time from home, with flexible hours, using their unique talents. We have business, creative and social entrepreneurial ventures. We are global and 100 percent virtual. We have more than 100 staff members who all work part-time and refer to themselves as Ishidos. Our fantastic team provides part-time, virtual assistant and calling services to small business entrepreneurs with $100,000 to $10M in revenue per year. Best Agent Business is the primary revenue and funding source for Lifebushido ventures. Best Agent Business provides services to top real estate agents. Our target market is agents above $100,000 in GCI. In 2006, when I started Best Agent Business, I realized that out of 1,000,000 real estate agents, probably only a few hundred had sold over $1B in real estate in their career. We started to track down those people. I reached out and interviewed over 70 top agents and coaches and we published Billion Dollar Agent - Lessons Learned. Billion Dollar Agent was well-received by top agents and we continued to do research, and fund the research, with revenue from Best Agent Business. In short, Best Agent Business tests the business model theories from Billion Dollar Agent. It all works together smoothly. In the five years since publishing Billion Dollar Agent - Lessons Learned, we have conducted interviews with over 1,000 agents, completed over $1,000,000 worth of customer-driven research, built our Billion Dollar Agent Team to over 100 part-time assistants and callers from over 5,000 job applicants and worked with over 100 top agents as clients of Best Agent Business. We have over 1,000 pages of solid systems that we use to run Database Management, Lead Management, Marketing, Listing Management, Closing Management, Accounting, Calling, Agent Management, Agent Recruiting and Life Management teams. As Best Agent Business has grown, I have had over 1,000 30-minute phone call sessions with top agents doing over $100,000 in GCI. Detailed notes have been made during every single call. These notes have been fed back into our knowledge base and systems. We map out the patterns we see across different segments of the industry. Given the real estate crash in recent years, we delayed the next edition of Billion Dollar Agent because it would have been distorted by the crash, surge in REO and short sale business. For Billion Dollar Agent Manifesto, we decided to focus on agents doing more than $1,000,000 in GCI per year. We estimate this number to be less than 1,000 across the country or one in 1,000 agents. Since $1M in GCI is roughly $40 million in sales volume, someone doing those numbers for 20 to 30 years will get to one billion in closed sales volume for their career.", "related": [], "rank": 1399963, "title": "Billion Dollar Agent Manifesto - Executive Summary eBook", "author": "Steve Kantor", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When asked to write a few lines of copy for the back of a pantyhose package, she discovered a love for words that was irrepressible. After years of writing for business, she turned to works of fiction and never looked back. \"Storytelling is in my blood,\" Crosby laughingly admits, \"My mom was not a writer, but she was a captivating storyteller, so I find myself using bits and pieces of her voice in most everything I write.\"Crosby's work was first recognized in 2006 when she received The National League of American Pen Women Award for a then unpublished manuscript. Since that, she has gone on to win several more awards, including another NLAPW award, Royal Palm Literary Awards, the FPA President's Book Award Gold Medal and Reviewer's Choice Award and Reader's View Southeast Fiction Literary Award.Her published works to date are: Blueberry Hill (2014), Previously Loved Treasures (2014), Jubilee's Journey (2013), What Matters Most (2013), The Twelfth Child (2012), Cupid's Christmas (2012), Cracks in the Sidewalk (2011), Spare Change (2011), and Life in the Land of IS (2012). Life in the Land of IS is a memoir written for Lani Deauville, a woman the Guinness Book of Records lists as the world's longest living quadriplegic.", "related": [], "rank": 413370, "title": "Blueberry Hill", "author": "Bette Lee Crosby", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 5.0, "rating_total": 40.0}
