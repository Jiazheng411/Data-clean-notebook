Throughout, Seaward intersperses brief meditation and journaling exercises. Yet the book feels hollow. While Seaward touches on some profound Taoist principles—as one might expect, given the book's title—he fails to investigate these teachings in any depth. Instead, he uses them as a broad,a prioritemplate for an \"ageless wisdom\" held by generic \"wisdom keepers.\" He then cites examples of this wisdom from a wide range of other sources and traditions, including Native American spirituality, Joseph Campbell's writings, and DNA research. This lack of focus is exacerbated by the text's habit of substituting unsatisfying anecdotes for a probing exploration of a given point. The result is a superficial amalgam of sweeping generalizations, inspirational clichés (\"even the darkest night has bright stars!\"), sentimental stories of triumph over adversity and quotes from the likes of Mother Teresa, Einstein and Lance Armstrong. Some of Seaward's spirituality-based ideas for navigating stress may have dimension and weight, but his treatment leaves them feeling trivial.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Prud'homme, who first reported on ImClone for Vanity Fair, reminds readers of the bigger story, the one that set the financial hijinx in motion: ImClone's failed attempt to bring a potentially groundbreaking cancer medication, Erbitux, to market. This story tells of scientists like John Mendelsohn, who led the research into C225, the antibody at the heart of Erbitux, and patients like Shannon Kellum, a 28-year-old woman diagnosed with colon cancer for whom the medication was a \"miracle drug\" that added a few years to her life. She was one of the rare lucky ones; Prud'homme's reporting is especially strong when he delves into the seemingly haphazard way in which ImClone distributed C225 for \"compassionate use\" during the clinical testing period. The FDA's rejection of ImClone's \"scientifically incomplete\" test data was the immediate motivation for Waksal's crimes, but Prud'homme's portrayal suggests it was completely in character for the reckless social-climbing executive, described by acquaintances as a \"pathological liar\" who cared more about making money than about curing cancer. Prud'homme ends his compelling account with Waksal's sentencing, and even though he'll inevitably have to update the paperback to wrap up coverage of the Martha Stewart trial, it's well worth reading the book now to appreciate what's really at stake in ImClone's downfall.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When his father was stricken with Alzheimer's, Barry left a police career in Charlotte to return to his tiny Appalachian hometown of Gainesboro, North Carolina, to help run the family funeral business. Barry's loving, respectful relationships with his parents and uncle are part of what makes him such a compelling protagonist: family loyalty is the driving force in his life. In this adventure, Barry is preparing for the funeral of Vietnamese Y'Grok Eban. Y'Grok was part of the Montagnards, a fiercely loyal resistance group who helped save the lives of countless Americans during the Vietnam War--including that of Gainesboro sheriff Tommy Lee Wadkins. When someone attacks Barry and steals Y'Grok's body, the likable undertaker has more than embarrassment to worry about: several Montagnards are in town for the funeral and suspect a political motive for the theft.  And what will Barry tell Y'Grok's son? As Barry works with visiting Boston detective Kevin Malone to find the body, he digs up a lot more than he bargained for.  Another stellar entry in an outstanding series that deserves wider recognition: the family focus and rural North Carolina setting make it a natural for Margaret Maron fans.Jenny McLarinCopyright © American Library Association.

The claim that Bennett and other neoconservatives have made so much of--that America is in moral decline--has attracted a relentless new critic. Challenging the key terms in this widely accepted claim, Turiel argues that an authentic morality not onlycansurvive breaks with communal traditions but oftendemandssuch ruptures. Among civil rights leaders of the 1960s and among Arab feminists today, Turiel finds exemplars of pioneers who risk conflict to end cultural practices that lend to oppression the name of morality. Likewise, in the widespread refusal of contemporary Americans to accept inherited patterns for family and personal life, Turiel sees not the selfishness and narcissism lamented by Bennett and his allies but rather a laudable new willingness to consider fresh possibilities for individual autonomy and for social justice. Those who condemn America for its moral decadence--in Turiel's view--simply fail to realize that societies, just like individuals, mature in their moral perspectives.

After a few small successes, Leopold got lucky when he began investigating insider trading by aides to California's Gov. Grey Davis and stumbled onto the extraordinary scandal of Enron's manipulation of utility deregulation in California. By the time Leopold was pressured into resigning from Dow Jones in 2002, he was one of the few reporters who'd actually interviewed Enron president Jeff Skilling. He then rushed to publish a flawed exposé of the secretary of the army's Enron connections, seriously damaging his journalistic credibility. Disillusioned by the institutional biases of mainstream media, Leopold finally decided to freelance with independent, Internet-based news services. While there's a lot of lying admitted to in this scrappy memoir, from Leopold's hiding of his criminal past to his playing of sources to get his scoops, it's (probably) not an untruthful memoir—indeed, it might become required reading for aspiring journalists.(May 9)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Still, as Badgett, the research director of the Williams Institute for Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at UCLA, argues, the transformation of the policy landscape for gays and lesbians was nothing short of remarkable, considering the very real possibility of a constitutional amendment to ban it just a few years earlier. Despite her optimism about gay unions, however, Badgett sets out to examine their potential impact in the U.S., using European Union countries, specifically the Netherlands—where same-sex couples have had the right to marry since 2001—as her rainbow-hued road map. Badgett's cogent and comprehensive study of the societal implications of same-sex marriage is learned and persuasive; gays and lesbians who once again pick up their protest signs and banners might do well to bring along Badgett's book as well.(Aug.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the same year, Mr. John A. McKay of Woodstock bought a half-interest in the Record. In 1906, Mr. McKay bought out his partner and became the sole owner of the paper until 1918, when W. F. Herman, a former owner of the Saskatoon Star and Regina Post, came to Windsor and bought out the McKay interests in the Record. Mr. Herman immediately changed the name of the paper to the Border Cities Star.The Border Cities Star was born when W. F. Herman and Hugh Graybiel purchased The Windsor Record in 1918. Its first issue hit the streets on September 3, 1918. It was 16 pages and sold for two cents.The paper expanded into its current downtown building at Ferry and Pitt streets in 1927. It was renamed The Windsor Daily Star in 1935 following the amalgamation of several small communities. Its Crabtree press began operating in 1955 after an annex was built downtown. The paper was renamed The Windsor Star in 1959.Original owner W.F. Herman died in 1938, but the paper continued to operate under the direction of his wife, Adie Knox Herman, Hugh Graybiel and W.L. (Lum) Clark.In 1967, Mrs. Herman, Hugh Graybiel and Hugh's son Richard all died within six months of each other.In November 2000, The Star became part of CanWest Global Communications.The Kindle Edition of The Windsor Star contains articles found in the print edition, but will not include some images and tables.

War now threatens the land and Nations who once had strong alliances are now deadly rivals while drought and famine spread throughout the land.Kaplyn, Lars and Lomar escape the cave that has been their home for longer than they could possibly realise and head to the capital of what was once Allund's ally, Thrace. Upon arrival though they are all arrested and accused of being spy's for the Army of Allund which are descending on the city. To make matters worse there is also another army on their way, this one composed of Krell, Grakyn and humans from Trosgarth but are they allied with the Allund?.Dragon Rider introduces a darker mood to the series and a stronger sense of individual style, a slight departure from the tolkienesque feel with a distinct flavour all it's own (although I am sometimes reminded of Robin Hobbs Farseer series). The land and the people are in serious trouble while the evil Krell and Grakyn become bolder and more aggressive. There is some very strong character development, with all the principal protagonists reacting and changing to their own adversity while some of the new characters are instantly likable (like the young powerful mage Astalus). At the same time the group's friendship continues to grow while the new party member Turmarl is an strong character with a dark, tortured soul and the passion of a beserker.The plot itself moves forward quickly and keeps the pages turning, one of the real strengths of this series is the emphasis on plot and character development with less time spent on the long background, world building that can sometimes stall the flow of the narrative. There are enough twists and turns to keep the interest and as with Legacy of the Eldric, the novel is very well written with a flowing script that is both refreshing and easy to read.Dragon Rider manages to achieve the difficult task of improving on it's predecessor (no mean task) with a sweeping tale of high fantasy that will keep you hooked until the very last page. --sciencefictionandfantasy.co.uk/dragon-rider.htm", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Lewis has written\noften about the Hollywood scene, and is no stranger to celebrities and\ncelebrity doctors. Anonymous underworld \"businessmen,\" often sent\ntheir lady friends for treatment in his offices. That experience with known\nmobsters contributed to Lewis' interest in how gangsters, Hollywood, and\nWashington somehow connect in the American landscape. As an actor, Lewis appeared\non TV in As the World Turns, Love of Life, The Guiding Light, and trained at\nthe prestigious H. B.

No map, no wildly shifting points of view. Just tough guys and fantasy action and the human heart in conflict with itself.

Tito finds himself in Rome, singing in the house of Cardinal Lorenzo Fabiani. Chez Fabiani is abuzz with papal politics—Pope Clement XII's on his deathbed, and the two men most likely to replace him need Fabiani's support if they are to prevail. When Fabiani's mother's maid turns up strangled in Fabiani's garden, Fabiani covers up the crime, but Tito, worried he'll be falsely implicated should the corpse come to light, decides to get to the bottom of things. His investigation leads him into fascinating Roman subcultures—communities of goddess worshipers, who practice ancient paganism right under the church's nose, and church leaders who are more interested in natural science than theology. Myers (Interrupted Aria) litters the book with coy references to the castrato's surprising sex life, but leaves the details to the reader's imagination.(Sept.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It proved to be a winning bet.  Renee came up with her own brand of romance and erotic fiction, and in a voice that is exclusive to her.  Renee also enjoys working with crafts, making gemstone jewelry and working with children in her first grade classroom in Harper Woods, Michigan.  Writing is a perpetual passion for her and vows to never stop writing it.  Renee was born in Detroit, Michigan—right in the heart of the cultural district.

With its roots embedded in the history of three railways, Leaside has a unique industrial heritage that played a key role in the war effort during both World Wars, including its being the site of munitions plants, a wooden plane factory, and a base for the Royal Flying Corps. Leaside was also home to the Durant Motors of Canada, and later the Nash cars, Canada Wire and Cable, and the popular Thorncliffe Race Track. Did you know that Canada's first airmail delivery touched down in Leaside and that an Olympic calibre ski jump once operated in the Don Valley?

You see, my degree from KU was not in journalism, but in art history.\nUnfortunately, my father died when I was 21 so I couldn't make him eat his\nwords about that art history degree not being worth anything. I've had stints\nliving in Italy and in Japan. During all this time I've been putting words on paper,\ncreating fiction. My works don't fit into neat genres, unless that rather new\ngenre \"quirky\" applies. And each work is quirky in its own way. What\nthat means for me is that in each work is evidence of a deep search within\nmyself.

Of course yes. But we were not allowed to cohabit with them. Many think that thanks to their extinction we inhabit today this planet.The dinosaurs appeared 230 million years ago and they extinguished 65 milion years ago; it means they inhabited the planet during 165 million years. Our first ancestors appeared hardly 6 million years ago and they developed the capacity to walk in two paws 4 million years ago. But it was not more than 100,000 years that we become in what we are now, with a conscience of themselves, with the capacity to develop concepts and ideas, to show artistically and of inventing weapons and tools, etc. But, hardly for a little more than a hundred years to this date that we have damaged to the planet in an unusual and unlikely way. We have achieved what no alive being has made in the whole history of the life: To change the climate, to contaminate the air and the water of seas and rivers. We have destroyed immense quantities of forests. In a few words, we are putting an end to our home. It is as if we took an axe and it began to destroy walls, furniture and everything the rest of our own house. If I would do something like that, they would consider me as a lunatic and surely they would confine me for life in an asylum, isn't? However that exactly that we do daily with our planet and does nobody accuse us of crazy, truth? We admire the fossilized remains of the dinosaurs a lot, but it seems that the animals that at the moment share the planet with us they are not worthy of such an admiration, or at least not the enough. I should remember them that the biggest animal that has inhabited The Earth is today among us. No dinosaur of any time was bigger than this of the one that I speak to them. I refer to the blue whale that reaches a size of more than 90 feet and a weight of more than 130 tons. However, what we do to her? We hunt her unmercifully only to obtain some products (as the oil) and we waste most of her. And we don't only doing this with the blue whale, but with all the other ones. Inclusive, we kill the sharks to make with their fins SOUP! If the dinosaurs lived with us, we would probably find their meat or their fat would be a good business, and we would surely take their eggs to make soup, just as we make it with those of the marine turtle. I am not very sure if God ended to the dinosaurs so we can appeared in the planet or to avoid that we, with our own hands, put an end to them. Because at seeing that we make with the animals as the whales, the elephants, tigers and hundreds of other species, it seemed that instead of sending them a meteorite God sent to us to extinguish them.A tale of tyrannosauruses... and sixty five million years later, is a story with, besides having a good time to the reader, intent to form a conscience regarding the place that we the human kind occupy in the concert of the Nature, of the respect that we should keep her and the responsibility that we have before her. I promise you will have a good time and the end of the story goes to surprise you a lot.", "related": [], "rank": 3107488, "title": "A tale of tyrannosauruses... and sixty five million years later", "author": "Carl Cupper", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Ron grew up first in Southern Oregon then moved to Idaho Falls, Idaho where he met his wife Nancy.  They married in 1974 and have been inseperable ever since.  Together they have 3 children, Chris is the middle child, he has an older brother Jeremy and a younger sister Angie. As of this post, Ron and Nancy have 3 grandchildren.  God, Family, Country, job; that has always been the order of things in the Darling home.  Patriotic and anxious to share their views Ron and Nancy have always gone the extra mile to spread the word of how valuable our constitution is and how hard it is to protect it. They rarely miss an opportunity to thank those who keep us free...our brave military men and women, past and current.  In 1986 The couple and their then young children moved to Scottsdale, Arizona where they live today.  As a luxury home designer Ron has been featured in 2 design books and a home he designed was one of the most popular homes in a 2002 home show near Phoenix.   Writing is something that always interested Ron, but he never took the step of actiually starting something until inspired by his son's concept.  That concept grew into what will be a series of 5 to 7 novels that Ron hopes to finish within 3 years.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I did, however, find the love of my life there – a Scottish writer working in advertising. We set up house together, got married and had two boys. A little later, we moved over the Pennines to Cheshire, and settled accompanied by a wide assortment of animals. With my family, I have the type of memories where the sun always shines. I help my youngest son with his small business of sculpting, casting and painting all types of collectables. I love drawing, writing, daydreaming, caffeine, chocolate, cakes, comic books, horror and fantasy…any book regardless of genre, as long as it’s well written.  Talent is talent…so I don’t care whether the author is male or female. However, I do think the ladies have the upper hand with the fantasy-romance-horror-raunchy mix. Keep it up, girls!

As my Goodreads friend Kelly Tomblin said in her review for Horror-Web: \"Gripping you from the moment you open the book, the pace is swift and constant. Building up to an explosive ending, the suspense will wreak havoc on even the most sedated reader. Hot and thick, the atmosphere reeks of earth, blood, and decay. The astringent air carries with it a sense of malevolence, and resentment. No matter where you look, no matter how shallow you breathe, this town will touch you.\" {You can see why Kelly is one of my favorite reviewers. I read all her reviews.]So BAD JUJU lives again.

Several houses down, a lawn mower rumbled its distinctive hum. The breeze carried the light perfume of flowers along with the appetizing scents of charcoal and grilled burgers. Cars drove by, leaves rustled and birds chirped. In all ways, the street was alive with the normal sounds and smells of spring.Normalcy,Captain Seth Foster thought,was a type of heaven that most folks never really considered.Well, most civilians. He, on the other hand, had given the idea of normalcy a great deal of thought throughout his deployment in Afghanistan.He'd returned to the States less than a week ago, and today, Seth had driven to his parents' house in Portland, Oregon, for an extended leave. Four weeks of rest lay in front of him. His plan for every day of those four weeks was to engage in completely normal activities.Activities such as eating a home-cooked meal with his family, verbally sparring with his two older brothers, reconnecting with his parents and now, sitting on the front porch of the Victorian home he'd grown up in, enjoying a beer with the company of his brothers.Seth had anticipated this moment, this exact second in time, when life would—for a little while, at least—become ordinary again.Of course, he hadn't anticipated that his lamebrained brother had been keeping a secret for months. Or that Jace would choose this moment to reveal that secret, and in doing so, dispel all of Seth's plans for a normal visit home.Seth took a long draw from his beer before settling his gaze on Jace, the middle brother in the Foster clan. Their older brother, Grady, seemed as shocked by Jace's disclosure as Seth was but had wisely kept his mouth shut—though he hadn't left his brothers alone to battle it out. Nah, he'd stay put and watch over them, ready to jump in if what followed took a nasty turn.Keeping his attention on Jace, Seth said, \"I'm not going to kill him, Grady. Even if I was so inclined, the Air Force doesn't take kindly to fratricide.\"\"I figured that much.\" Grady stretched out his long legs. \"Still, think I'll sit right here for a while. Enjoy my beer.\"\"I'm not going to hit him, either.\"\"I would.\" Grady's tenor was flat. \"If he kept that type of news away from me.\"Jace cleared his throat. \"If either of you want to clock me across the jaw, go for it. But you should know I'd make the same choice today under the same circumstances.\"The temper that Seth had managed to contain flared into being. \"Watch it, bro, or I might take you up on that.\" God, he still couldn't wrap his mind around Jace's announcement.\"You're one hundred percent in this? There is zero doubt that Rebecca is pregnant?\"\"I'm certain.\" Jace raked his fingers through his shaggy black hair. \"I wasn't when I originally met with her. Which is partly why I didn't tell you then.\"Seth remembered asking Jace to look in on Rebecca Carmichael, a woman he'd corresponded with for nearly a year before their meeting the prior October. He'd been given a short leave from active duty to recoup from an ill-fated mission. After attending a funeral, he spent his time here, in Portland. It had taken several phone conversations, but Rebecca had finally agreed to meet for coffee.Closing his eyes for a millisecond, Seth savored the taste of the icy-cold microbrew. Coffee became dinner, which turned into drinks, which then became a weekend Seth would never forget. When he returned to duty, his goals for the future—which had always been absolute—shifted into something different than he'd ever seen for himself. A future he hoped might include Rebecca. He'd been all set to take it slow, to keep their relationship on the easy and familiar ground on which it had started, when Rebecca stopped writing. Concerned, he tried reaching her by phone, only to find her number disconnected.This remained the status quo until sometime in January, when Seth emailed Jace and asked him to ascertain that Rebecca was okay. Jace's response that Rebecca was fine, that her life had been busy but she would get in touch when she could, eased Seth's worry. When another month passed without a peep, Seth figured that was Rebecca's way of saying goodbye.He'd written her once more, wished her well and focused on the day to day. Every now and then his thoughts would return to her, to the future he'd barely glimpsed before it dissolved into dust. For the most part, though, Seth had pushed Rebecca out of his mind.Until now. Until faced with the possibility that she was pregnant withhischild.\"How do you know for certain?\" Seth asked, picking up the conversation where Jace had left off. \"Have you talked to her again? Seen her?\"\"I haven't, but…a friend kept tabs on her.\" Jace spoke quickly, as if worried Seth would interrupt him. \"I know she's pregnant. What I don't know is who the father is.\"\"What friend? You didn't involve Olivia or Melanie in this, did you?\" Grady asked, speaking of his wife and Jace's fiancée.\"If I'd told Olivia, I might as well have told you,\" Jace shot back. \"And you'd have gone to Seth right away, which is what I was trying to avoid. Nor did I tell Melanie. She wouldn't have approved of what she would describe as my…ah…kinglike attitude.\"Grady chuckled. \"She's called you out on that a few times already, hasn't she?\"\"You're one to talk.\" Jace glowered at Grady. \"Because talking Olivia into dating you instead of giving her the divorce she wanted was sounkinglike.\"Grady shrugged, apparently not bothered by Jace's statement. \"We didn't get divorced, so I'd say my methods worked fine. Besides, what happens between.\"Frustration roared through Seth's blood. On a different day, he'd love to hear every detail of his brother and sister-in-law's reconciliation. The couple had separated after their five-year-old son Cody had died in a tragic car accident. A drunk driver had lost control of his vehicle and smashed into Grady's, killing the boy almost instantly.It had been a horrible time for all of them. Seth hadn't believed that Grady and Olivia would be able to move beyond such an allencompassing pain. Somehow, though, they had. He was happy for them. And when he learned Olivia was expecting a baby in August, now only a few months away, he'd been even happier.Now, though, he wanted to hear about Rebecca and the babyshecarried.\"Howdid your friend keep tabs on Rebecca, Jace?\" Seth asked, dragging his brother's attention back to the current topic of conversation.\"It's like this… I hired an investigator friend of mine to—\"\"You hired a P.I. to spy on Rebecca?\" Seth was three seconds away from leaping out of his chair and strangling his brother. \"A little overkill, don't you think?\"\"All he did was employ Rebecca as his accountant and set up monthly appointments to see how she was doing. He didn'tspyon her.\" Jace pulled in a breath. \"Look, if she needed something, I wanted to know. But no one followed her around or snapped pictures of her.\"\"So you hired a P.I. to spy on her,\" Seth repeated, his anger growing by the second. \"Whether he saw her once a month or sat in front of her house every damn night, his goal was to retrieve information in a covert manner. Is that correct?\"\"Okay, yes.\" Jace planted his elbows on his knees. \"I know it was wrong, but I wanted to be in a position to help if she needed anything. I swear, Seth, my intentions were honorable.\"Seth gave a short nod, hearing the truth in his brother's words. \"You realize that you wouldn't have had to go to such lengths if you'd shared your suspicions up front? Dammit, Jace! If she is carrying my baby, I had a right to know the second you thought that was a possibility.\"\"Why?\" Jace countered, his eyes unflinching. \"She wasn't responding to your emails or letters. You couldn't reach her by phone.

My goal was to protect you.\"\"Protect me?\" Seth said, his voice dangerously soft as he deduced what Jace was getting at. \"You believed I wouldn't be able to do my job safely if I knew Rebecca might be pregnant with my child? Am I getting this right?\"Seth's job, as a pilot in the Air Force, typically didn't carry that much risk. And while his deployment to Afghanistan, where he was part of a planning cell, had placed him in a few precarious situations, his role there had also been relatively safe. Even so, his family worried.\"I wanted you to come home safe.\" Jace's jaw set in the stubborn line all Foster men were known for. \"So yeah, bro, I decided to wait until you were here to tell you. So you could focus on facts and not what-ifs. Why is that so wrong?\"\"Because it was an idiotic move,\" Grady said without rancor. \"Imagine if I knew something about Melanie that involved you and I kept that away from you?\"\"That's an idiotic statement,\" Jace retorted, also without rancor. \"I'm here.

With that growth has come the inevitable restructuring and reevaluation of its history and doctrine. Mormon and non-Mormon scholars alike have viewed Joseph Smith's religion as fertile soil for religious, historical and sociological studies. Many early attempts to either defend or defame the church were at best sloppy and often dishonest. It has taken decades for Mormon scholarship to mature to its present state. The editors of this book have assembled 16 essays addressing the substantial number of published works in the field of Mormon studies from 1950 to the present. The contributors come from various segments of the Mormon tradition and fairly represent the broad intellectual spectrum of that tradition. Each essay focuses on a particular aspect of Mormonism (history, women's issues, polygamy, etc.), and each is careful to fairly evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the books under discussion. More importantly, each volume is placed in context with other, related works, giving the reader a panoramic view of contemporary research. Students of Mormonism will find this collection of historiographical essays an invaluable addition to their libraries.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For too long agronomy has been used as a means to increase productivity of only a few crops responsive to high inputs.  By contextualizing the science economically, socially and politically, we learn of its potential as a system science that can serve more than the stockholders of major input providers\" –Professor Cornelia Flora – Iowa State University\"It has been a long time since there was consensus in agricultural development approaches.Contested Agronomylays out the difference between different practitioner groups and marks an important step forward in the continuing dialogue\" –Dr Tom Remington, Principal Agriculture Advisor, Catholic Relief Services\"Contested Agronomyshows how much both the technical questions asked by practitioners and the broader questions asked by supporters of and detractors from agronomic research have changed over the past several decades.  Moreover, it asks tough questions about the contested politics that drive particular research agendas globally.  Not only agronomists, but anyone interested in the future provision of food should read this book\" –Lawrence Busch, Michigan State University\"This book is a much needed contribution to the discourse on science in society and a challenge to agricultural scientists. Previously the invention of ‘political ecology’ has provided a focus for scholars from different academic disciplines to explore understandings derived from environmental science and to relate them to the needs of society. In this book we are presented with a much needed ‘political agronomy’ analysis which enables us to ask how we can make agricultural science respond better to the needs of society as we grapple with problems of future food security. I congratulate the authors in occupying the challenging interdisciplinary space of science in society and providing us with evidence to inform the debate on the complexities surrounding agricultural research and sustainable development\" –John Gowing, Reader in Agricultural Water Management, Newcastle UniversityA book for all those involved at the heart of agricultural research.If you think themes such as Biofortification and Conservation Agriculture are driven mainly by technical discussions, think again.  Development policy, vested interests and even religion may also mould how investigation unfolds.  The book’s main message: how to get Research back on course –Prof. Louisa Sperling, Principal Researcher, International Center for Tropical Agriculture", "related": [], "rank": 1494792, "title": "Contested Agronomy", "author": "James Sumberg", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Barton is the author of several fast-paced mystery and thriller series, featuring lively characters and lots of action. \"Miz Scarlet\" (Scarlet Wilson Mystery series) is a teacher-turned-innkeeper, who throws herself into danger with a feisty determination to make things right, relying on cohorts like \"Captain Peacock\" and \"Colonel Grey Poupon\" to help her solve the clues. Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans. It's the perfect human storm.\"", "related": ["B0082CIMCQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Opinion around the base is unanimous about Burke's guilt, and the attorney becomes the target of numerous death threats and attempts on her life. Keener's idealistic nature prevails over fear, pushing her to search for the truth, even after Burke is supposedly killed in a prison fire and she is ordered by superiors to close the case. Burke's mysterious return and collaboration with Keener allow the pair to uncover a widespread governmental conspiracy, dubbed \"Project Duplicity,\" that involves dangerous new chemical technology. Although the ending will seem too neat for some readers, Hinze (Shades of Gray; Festival, under the pen name Victoria Barrett) has a knack, as illustrated in Burke and Keener's complex relationship, for combining compellingly realistic characterizations with suspense and a romantic plot line.Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The six-week plan is simple, yet very revolutionary in the college admissions process. This book is truly one of a kind. As a high school guidance counselor of over twenty years, I thought I knew all of the secrets behind the college admissions process. \"Six Weeks\" revealed many practical application tips that I have never heard of before. This book is changing the way students apply to college. --Richard1961This is the book I wish I had when applying to college. \"Six Weeks\" effectively demystifies the college admissions process while providing prospective students with a simple six-week plan to acceptance. Many of the strategies highlighted in this book are exactly what we admissions officers would like to see on an application. In order to stand out, applicants need to create a brand, network, and write an effective essay. This book covers all bases in the college application process. As an admissions officer at a selective state school, I would highly recommend \"Six Weeks to Success.\" --Yale07I bought this book to help my daughter start off her senior year of high school. I didn't go to college so I wasn't sure how to help her. This book enlightened us both! It covered everything from the SAT/ACT to campus visit to extracurricular activities to alumni interviews. Very helpful! I didn't know that there could be such an organized approach when applying to college and I believe this will help her greatly in the admissions process. I also really enjoyed reading the guides for pre-law students and female students. This is certainly the best college admissions guide we have found so far.

But it started me\non a quest that has led to the writing of a book which might be more properly\ncalled a 'tome', and the planning of several more to follow.I now definitely\nbelieve Atlantis once existed. I acquired a library of books on the subject\nwhich expound countless theories of where, why and how and then came up with my\nown reality.As a writer does!\"Through All Eternity'amzn.com/B009MFQUBCis the first\nbook in the series. It's romantica, past life/time travel, paranormal, sexy -\nand did I say romance? It's a journey through all eternity.Taur of Nyalda came to me first, speaking through a crystal I was holding while meditating. A clear crystal point, somewhat battered, I'd named it the Warrior. The title Crystal Warrior was penned and an ancient story began to be revealed about a civilisation where a man's ability to rule and hold high office was dependent on his virility, stamina and overt studliness. In such a society love was deemed the essence of low breeding. Ruling Class women mostly accepted the beliefs of the time, but Gynevra of Poseidonia wanted more. She wanted love, she wanted it from Taur and she wanted his love for herself alone.And if she succeeds, can they teach the rest of the nation about the necessity for love before it is too late?The writing of the Atlantean part of the story took five years and then I shelved it for a couple of years. After some time it occurred to me that I had written the pivot of a time travel type story and so I set about writing the 'now' part of the story which held the reason for re-living the Atlantean lifetime and regaining powers lost as surely as the continent itself.It has been a 'tour de force' and the characters as real to me as my own family.And in the end I changed the title to \"Through All Eternity\" because there were other books out there with the same title.I was gifted with five other stories to follow, three of which really fired my imagination. So I will probably write these three.

This multimethod approach provides a strong empirical basis to inform an understanding of how politicians, staffers, policy analysts, advocates, the media, and the American public frame children's policy, and it generates rich, timely, and valuable evidence that can be used by child advocates to develop stronger arguments in future debates over child health, child poverty, child welfare, and education policy.\" —Social Service Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

By emphasizing construction with a priori built-in correctness, the book goes one decisive step beyond formal verification. The goal is ambitious but the authors fully deliver. With a minimum of formalistic overhead, they walk the reader through a series of carefully chosen examples and use cases, thereby gradually unleashing the full power of the methodology. The book's main merit, however, lies in the fact that it convincingly disproves the common belief that formal methods are not practicable in the \"real\" world.\" Jurg Gutknecht, ETH Zurich, Switzerland", "related": [], "rank": 2175933, "title": "Bruce W.

When Hester couldn’t face a Dublin audience, Dolly was forced to go on in her place and, much to her surprise, discovers that she loves acting and has a flair for comedy. As she learns to deal with lascivious managers and fellow actors, Dolly, who adopts the stage names Dora and Miss Francis, is soon playing to packed houses on Drury Lane. Among the audience is the Duke of Clarence (the future King William IV), with whom Dolly becomes involved in a romantic relationship that will last two decades. But while the plays in which she stars almost always have happy endings, Dolly will find that, in life, that is not always the case. In her latest richly detailed historical novel, which will definitely speak to fans of Rosalind Laker, Lightfoot fictionalizes the rags-to-riches-to-rags tale of real-life actress Dora Jordan, whose tragic life was filled with more drama than any play in which she starred. --John Charles", "related": ["B006WB7H3Y"], "rank": 1049507, "title": "The Duchess of Drury Lane", "author": "Freda Lightfoot", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's light and funny with an edge of danger. Blake and Ralph had some problems early on in their marriage now that they're \"poised between hip and a hip replacement\" (page 12, love that line!). They're looking for that little extra spice. Blake is looking for it in knock-off bags, while Ralph is maybe looking for spice outside of the marriage. Harris gives us quotable quotes one after another making this reader laugh out loud over and over again.THE CHANEL CAPER would have been hard pressed to take place anywhere but New York City. The action-packed, fast-paced run to the end fits with familiar image of The Big Apple. The ending was deliciously done like a scene out of the best rom-coms. The players may surprise the reader, but the promise of more is irresistible to this reader.Does it sound odd to call a murder mystery light and delightful? Harris gets the job done in THE CHANEL CAPER. I truly have nothing negative to say about this novel. Reading this novel was an exercise in self-indulgence best done with your favorite glass of something rare or much loved snack infrequently eaten (I did both). If you like light and funny cozy mysteries with wonderful heart, pick this one up today.--RabidReadersReviews", "related": [], "rank": 998307, "title": "THE CHANEL CAPER: A Blake Weston Funny Mystery (Strong, Savvy Women...And The Men Who Love Them Book 2)", "author": "Ruth Harris", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Campbell is the author of contemporary fantasy novels and paranormal short stories as well as the satire Jock Stewart and the Missing Sea of Fire (2009). The fantasies, The Sun Singer (2004, 2010) and Sarabande (2011) are set in the high country of Glacier National Park, Montana where Campbell worked as a bellman while in college.  The e-book short stories, “Moonlight and Ghosts” (2012) “Cora’s Crossing” (2012), and the three-story set “Emily’s Stories” (2012) are set in the Florida Panhandle where Campbell grew up. He began hearing Florida ghost stories on Scout camping trips in the pinewoods, swamps and other locations which are perfect for strange events. “Emily’s Stories” is also available as an audiobook. Campbell’s “Garden of Heaven” trilogy is being released throughout 2013: The Seeker (April), The Sailor (June) and The Betrayed (September). The series begins in Montana where protagonist David Ward grows up, and then moves to Florida’s Tate’s Hell Swamp, liberty ports and an aircraft carrier in the South China Sea, and Central Illinois.  Campbell’s nonfiction includes the Glacier National Park e-book Bears; Where They Fought – Life in the Swiftcurrent Valley and feature articles in “The Rosicrucian Digest.” “The Inside Trail,” and the National Park Service Glacier Park commemorative book, 100 Years 100 Stories.  His “Jock Talks” satire—namely fictional news stories about real and imagined events—appears in four collections: Strange People, Politics, Outlandish Happenings and (with Smoky Zeidel) Lightning Safety.  Campbell’s work has also appeared in “Nonprofit World,” “Nostalgia Magazine,” “The Smoking Poet,” the Atlanta “Journal-Constitution”, the Great Lakes “Bulletin,” “Future Earth Magazine,” “Quail Bell” and training and manufacturing trade magazines. His career has also included grant writing for nonprofit organizations. The first edition of The Sun Singer was a finalist in the 2004 “ForeWord Magazine” Book of the Year Awards and his Jock Talks…Politics is a 2013 Pushcart Prize nominee.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Selma Dabbagh  'Madhoun's depiction of the loving, claustrophobic, violent, beautiful, steadfast, endangered place that is Gaza is enthralling. - The Lady from Tel Aviv is an elegantly-written, intriguing, moving book. It is a surprisingly easy and enjoyable read, given the subject matter, but is also a valuable addition to the literature tackling themes such as Palestinian exile, occupation and homecoming. Whether one is looking for a striking piece of summer reading or a thought-provoking exploration of the Palestinian situation, this novel is a good place to start.' Electronic Intifada  The Lady from Tel Aviv lays bare the harsh realities of dispossession, exile and occupation ... What is on offer is a serious but quirky slice-of-life conveyed by Madhoun's inventive imagery, wry humour and prose that lurches from the poetic to parody - Poignant - The Lady from Tel Aviv is a mature, honest appraisal of the meaning of estrangement and belonging  -  and all the nuances in between.' Jordan Times    'It would be a mistake to approach The Lady from Tel Aviv as either an exemplar of contemporary Arabic literature or as a literary discussion of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It is both, but to start reading with that in mind risks constraining one's appreciation of the book as a novel. - The Lady from Tel Aviv has almost as many layers as baklava, albeit not all of them sweet - Clever and lyrical - The Lady from Tel Aviv provides insights that newscasts, documentaries and articles can't. And al-Madhoun has a message that is worth learning: no matter how intractable a conflict may seem, there is always a lady from Tel Aviv.'

She currently resides in Virginia. Her nickname is Kadi. She is remarried happily and she has a young son, whom she loves very much. She has published two short stories and a novel. Prior to writing a novel and prior to getting remarried, Khedidja's life was filled with insurmountable challenges. Kedidja was living with a partner who was both physically and mentally abusive ultimately sending her multiples times to the ER. Khedidja had little to no support to help her escape her daunting situation. With no family around, few friends, and no means of supporting herself financially, Khedidja felt trapped and unable to leave her dire circumstances. Through the aid of a nonprofit organization, Khedidja finally received support in her time of need and was given the resources necessary to change her life for the better. The first step Khedidja's charity took was to help her regain her self-esteem and the confidence to move forward in her life. The next step was to give Khedidja hope for a future with professional development, which enabled self-sustaining growth by finding a job. Once Khedidja could support herself financially, she was finally able to extricate herself from her terrible situation by getting divorced. She started going to school and now she is in a better position in life. Because of the support she received from nonprofit organizations, she no longer faces the threat of joblessness, homelessness, and poverty. They were able to help her transition in a way that made her feel secure and prepared her for the next step in her life. Her life is much better now because of their ongoing support and commitment. Their charity treated her like family and helped her regain the confidence she needed to survive and now thrive. Sometimes, one simple gesture - what may seem like a small gift to you - brings a smile and hope to those who are suffering. Today in order for Kadi to return the favor to the community, Khedidja is committed to providing help for fellow refugees and indigents through organizing and managing various fundraising events in her community. Funds from these events help supply adequate food, health kits, clothes, and safe drinking water. Khedidja has also written and published a novel. She has committed to use a quarter of all profits made on the sales of the novel to fund her nonprofit organization to continue helping others in need.", "related": ["B00HG2KNE8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

(...) It stands as a new and imaginative approach to the subject. H-FRANCE REVIEW This impressive study is based on Hoskins' personal knowledge of the landscape and local history, combined with the use of the chronicles and modern historical viewpoints. The author points out the difficult terrain and issues with logistical matters that impacted the expeditions. The work includes numerous photographs and maps indicating the path of the chevauchées. It is a fine addition to the literature on the Edwardian War. INTERNATIONAL HISTORY Well written and gives a lot of information. (...) All the essential information is there and the reader will gain insight into how the battle (of Poitiers) took place. MEDIEVAL WARFARE Hoskins' book is a valuable and insightful contribution to our knowledge of the road to Poitiers and the strategy of the medieval English chevauchée. His firsthand experience of the terrain, his understanding of tactics and strategy, and his careful use of the extant sources inform every page of the book, making In the Steps of the Black Prince a must for an historian of the Hundred Years War. DE RE MILITARI Another first-rate Boydell title. (...) I can think of few accounts of medieval warfare which read as well as this one. LONE WARRIOR  Hoskins' book is the product of a fascinating exercise and the author's approach can be of considerable value when dealing with differences between sources.

His home a rustic village sitting upon a cliff below an ever-stormy gray sky. And during the time of year when the frost clings to the roots of the trees, the northern lights can be seen glimmering off the far horizon. The small cottage in which Heimdall Thunderhammer was born sits on the far eastern edge of the village, mingled amongst the wharfs and jetties. From the time that he figured out how to set a hook and trawl a net, he voyaged out to sea on his father’s boat. While on the bounty, Heimdall learned to draw maps and to navigate using only sun stones by day and the placement of the stars by night. During the downtimes between catching fish and rigging the sails, his father and the other fishermen told him the tales of his ancestors and their gods. The moment Heimdall heard these stories and learned to read he knew that he would grow up to be a writer himself and weave such tales as he had heard on the swaying tides of his youth. It was while out at sea that the inspiration for his writing struck. He spotted two mice on the bow of the ship, both seemingly oblivious to the existence of the human crew. The mice were perched on the gunwhale, their gaze focused on the far horizon, with a sparkle of adventure glimmering in their tiny eyes. Where had they come from? And what great journey awaited them? When he asked those questions out loud, his father proceeded to tell Heimdall about the great beasts of the world, not only of the mice and other such forest critters, but of lions and dragons and similar beasts that Heimdall had never seen. And his father and the other fisherman told Heimdall of geomancy, the magic of such critters. Magic based on the six elements of nature. And so it was while pondering the adventures of those two mice and the hidden magic that they surely held that Heimdall realized his life’s ambition; Magefable. Heimdall Thunderhammer has spent the past ten years writing and illustrating Magefable. He enjoys crafting tales and sharing them with those who also love magic, treasure, and great adventures. He appreciates the opportunity to interact with his fans, so if you ever have any questions or comments, do not be afraid to contact him.

Many years later she spotted a a confession magazine on the grocery store shelf and began tapping out her own stories which were a joy for her to have published.

As a child, Camille wrote very bad poetry and dreamed of one day being a published writer. And a professional jockey. And a teacher. And a virtuoso French horn player. And a mom. She has given up writing poetry, but writes weekly newspaper columns and blogs regularly on The Hurricane Report. Camille has also taught school for 20+ years, and is the proud mama of seven beautiful children. Race horses and French horns aside, sometimes dreams really do come true! Camille understands that the circumstances of life can be difficult - sometimes even heartbreaking - but she encourages readers to cherish the flashes of joy and to celebrate the beauty in everyday life.

After several years spent overseas and working his way to executive positions in biotech, he returned to his true passion of storytelling. He now writes full time from his home in the San Francisco Bay Area. He continues to be haunted by a variety of creatures, including a wife, kids, three dogs, three cats, twenty chickens, a wayward rooster, and one very grumpy possum. They are all flesh and blood.  Except for the possum, which he's sure is the reincarnated spirit of Jack Torrance.

Death, or the lack of it, is central to the tale, and with this choice\nof subject matter, Fletcher is able to blend humour with some interesting\nquestions about old age.Fletcher captures\nthe glorious summer we always think of as the English past, but in his\nShropshire village, all is not well, and the failure of certain unreasonable\npersons to die off in good time is starting to play havoc with the local\neconomy.Wonderfully\ngrotesque and witty, this book both echoes a range of classic British film and\nwriting, whilst also striking out in new directions.Bryn (1st September\n2001)Review Editors\nNote:This review was submitted by Bryn, who was good enough to admit\nbeing an employee of Hollow Hills Publishing so it may be a 'little' biased.... but\nhey, we are grateful for all opinions, even those driven by ambition.", "related": ["B00FBDV6AY"], "rank": 1319868, "title": "Death Must Go On!", "author": "Mac Fletcher", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
