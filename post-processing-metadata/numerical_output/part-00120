Kingsley was born in Islington. She was the daughter of George Kingsley (himself a travel writer) and Mary Bailey, and the niece of Charles Kingsley. Her father was a doctor and worked for George Herbert, 13th Earl of Pembroke. Her mother was an invalid and Mary was expected to stay at home and look after her. Mary had little formal schooling but she did have access to her father's large library and loved to hear her father's stories of foreign countries. Her father died in February 1878. Her mother also died just five weeks later. Freed from her family responsibilities, and with an income of £500 a year, Mary was now able to travel. Mary decided to visit Africa to collect the material she would need to finish off a book that her father had started on the culture of the people of Africa.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His best friend is Chadric Kelon, son of the village miller. Together they have all sorts of high spirited adventures, but only in their daydreams. Life is rather mundane for Riyan and Chad. Tending sheep and grinding grain does not make for high adventure no matter how they might wish otherwise. Yet despite the calm in the little hamlet, Riyan has managed to acquire an enemy. Rupert, son of the village magistrate, is determined to make Riyan life miserable no matter what. To add insult to injury Rupert even gets engaged to Freya, the girl who Riyan suddenly realizes he loves. Riyan distraught by this sudden announcement decides the best thing for him to do is take his sheep to some high pasture. There he will have time to sort things out, get over his anger and find a way to stop Freya from marrying Rupert. Meanwhile, Chad along with Bartholomew Agreani devise a plan to humiliate Rupert, but it only makes things worse for Riyan. Change is in the wind. Up in the high pasture, one of Riyan's sheep goes astray. While looking for the lost sheep, he finds the lamb in a hole in the ground. Despite the trouble the sheep has caused him, Riyan also finds a coin which will bring him and his friends back to this same place a few days later. Riyan, Chad and Bart stumble upon an ancient burial tomb, which they later learn is the fabled King's Horde. Legend has it that this burial site holds a vast fortune. If Fate has brought them this far, Fate has also thrown them a curve. To gain access to the King's Horde, they must first recover the segments of the key that will open the inscribed portal. One fragment of the key they find within the ancient burial tomb in the hand of a long dead thief. Finding the other segment of the key will take them deep into hostile goblin territory and a place where even goblins fear to tread.Shepherd's Quest is a fun, well paced novel that any Dungeon and Dragons gamer would love. It has all the elements of the game rolled into an adventure story about young lads looking for riches, fame and adventure. Parts of the book do get rather bogged down with the repetitive finding of chests, crypts and such. Once inside goblin territory the story picks up the pace and moves the reader right along with the uneasy, uncertain air that makes goblin territory so feared. Brian Pratt weaves a true Dungeon and Dragons type of story with this first book in the Broken Key Trilogy. Gamers should love this trilogy! --Yellow30 Sci-Fi, FootNotes Reviewer, 08/29/2007", "related": ["B00B15Z1P2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dr. Roth's descriptions make clear the two-fold nature of his efforts: In the discussions with the \"time-outers\", he helps them to develop their inner strength through increasing understanding of themselves. At the same time he does not neglect the importance of providing limits and consequences for destructive behavior. Too often people feel that the one precludes the other.I like very much the deep respect for these \"time-outers\" that runs through the book. Dr. Roth's emphasis on the humor seems to be a reflection of that. These are never \"bad\" kids or \"wise guys\" whose behavior has to be reformed -- they are always children who need help to master behavior that hurts both others and themselves.I also liked the degree of involvement that a principal can have with his students and staff that this book reflects. This is a great model for leaders. --Jacquelyn Seevak Sanders, Ph. D., Former Director of the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School at the University of Chicago, and Senior Lecturer in the Department of EducationTales From Time-Outis a must-read for any special educator or child care professional working with troubled children. Dr. Roth masterfully demonstrates how to decode children's behavior, in particular their humor, to gain understanding of the student's psychological state and how best, in crisis situations, to respond to them in an effective manner. Moreover, Dr. Roth does not shy away from demonstrating how even an experienced professional can be caught in the power of a youngster s emotions and sometimes make inappropriate responses. --Robert B. Bloom, Ph.D., Executive Director, Jewish Child & Family Services of Chicago, and Former Chairman, Department of Special Education at the College of William and MaryThis is a delightful, wise and important guide for parents and teachers. It is a great book and fun to read as well. The examples in this book really ring true, and help us to see how we can help children. This book is must-reading not just in helping troubled children but in helping all children at school and at home. --Bertram J. Cohler, Ph.

The problem is that all of the students have magical powers except Ned, and he is unable to defend himself against them. After being abducted by an invisible airship, he learns that his uncle is a traitor and that he is responsible for Ned's lost powers. His captors are the highly feared Necromancers, sky pirates who steal supplies and children to run their airships. Two of his schoolmates are captured along with him and forced to use their magic to help fly the ship. Ned bargains with one of the Necromancers to save his friends, but Uncle Kelver casts a spell that accidentally removes everyone's magic. The children make it back to Leodwych with the help of mermaids, and everyone has to learn how to do things without magic. Naturally, Ned is the best person to teach them. Not particularly remarkable, this quick, light fantasy goes against convention in that magic, or the easy way out, isn't presented as the answer to everything. The plot and characters are simply drawn but will satisfy less-skilled readers.—Corinda J. Humphrey, Los Angeles Public LibraryCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I also suffered severe anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks early into the onset of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Hashitoxicosis). A common heart murmur I was diagnosed with in my teens called \"Mitral Valve Prolapse\", also worsened in severity of symptoms, with the development of these other health disorders.  My eventual receiving of diagnoses was a difficult process with proper diagnostic testing not being ordered by the first doctors I sought treatment from.

In fact, she is a fat, lonely child who becomes a fat, eccentric (though, she insists, brilliant) woman. Her mother is afflicted by vapors, her father by pseudo-intellectuality and her younger brother by the shyness common to boys who wear glasses. Since it is hinted early on that Father's proclivities are not wholly cerebral, his incestuous attack upon Lilian is not a shock, but his subsequent insults and vituperations, culminating in his having her committed, seem without foundation. Although he accuses her of behaving like a whore, Lilian remains a virgin throughout and indeed, once out of the asylum, lives chastely with a drunken cabdriver until he dies. This award-winning first novel by Australian writer Grenville promises more than it delivers. Lilian's story, however, often has the quality of a dream recounted while the dreamer is half asleep. This alone is a remarkable achievement.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His love for writing began as a ten year-old. He was an avid reader and enjoyed taking books home from the local library, the McKinley Memorial Library. He enjoyed reading the classics. This gave rise to his wanting to create literature. Early on, engrossed in the Science Fiction Novels of the time, Phil developed theories on space travel and Science Fiction themes. These were started and never completed and eventually lost due to distractions. Later in life he thought that children's books would be interesting to write. He developed several backgrounds for a story but again distractions and commitments caused this to never come to fruition. Most of these were lost. The Mason Woods is a work that he felt had to be done to preserve forever the way of life for young boys in the late 1930's and early 1940's. He also wished to document some of the hardships associated with immigrating to The United States and the difficulties that resulted while living as new immigrants in the United States. The background for this book was garnered from long discussions with his father and mother in their later years. The book itself was written in a three month period.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His narrator, Jack, travels through the often poignant moments that highlight his sixth grade year, at the same time describing his unpredictable family life: \"Since I was born, we had already lived in nine different houses. I hated that word 'renter.' It made me feel that I didn't really belong anywhere, like we had to pay people to put up with us,\" he says. Stuck between an older sister he emulates and a pesky if appealing younger brother, Jack always strives to do the right thing--often to land in trouble. His perspective is quirky but reliable, and often surprising. The first chapter, for example, describes Jack's three-year battle to fill his diary; when he can think of nothing to write, he begins to pack the diary with \"stuff\"--bugs, baseball cards, stamps and so on--but he concludes, \"I was covering over the empty white space of the pages in the same way I covered my eyes with my hands when I watched a monster movie.\" A bittersweet resonance filters the humor in these stories, and lingers most welcomely.

Donovan Grant was an air traffic controller until a post-traumatic stress disorder renders him unfit to continue in the profession. He lands the job as pilot for the exclusive Vai Kai resort in the Fiji Islands where trouble arrives in waves. First Donovan starts having inexplicable blackouts, in which he becomes uncharacteristically violent. Then he ferries in a group that includes actress Kelly LaBrecque and her movie producer ex-husband, Sheldon Larsen. Kelly informs Donovan that every person in their group hates Sheldon's guts. Finally, a hurricane knocks out the lights long enough for the first murder to occur and it looks like Donovan is the guilty party. Kelly, who seems romantically interested in Donovan, jumps to his defense. The novel is airy fun, carried by its two likeable and witty central characters. --manuscript review by Publishers Weekly, an independent organizationDonovan Grant was a pilot for the Federal government and witnessed something that made him psychologically unstable. Pushed out of his job, divorced and collecting a disability pension, he moves to an island in Fiji where he works as a pilot. Then murders start to occur and he has to figure out if he is involved. The excerpt is well written with a sardonic sense of humor. The character is believable as to what he is supposed to be. Unfortunately, murder is way overdone, although not remembering the murders is a slightly new twist. --Amazon Top ReviewerThe writing was very well done and I must admit that the author kept my interest throughout the entire \"two hotties and an old pilot\" scenario that was actually quite funny and really made the story interesting. I also kind of liked the scene at the soda machine. I can't say that I would actually purchase this book, due to its premise, which doesn't really interest me, but the writing was good and for those of you who would be interested in this kind of story, it would probably be a very good read. --Amazon Top Reviewer", "related": ["B006PV2Z9M"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 13, "rating_average": 4.2308, "rating_total": 55.0}

Set during one of the 20th century's most tumultuous decades, it tells the story of Anna, a lecturer in English from the University of Wroclaw, who arrives in Montreal in the fall of 1981. When martial law is declared in Poland, she chooses to remain in Canada, although emigration means abandoning her husband, an activist in the political opposition, and deserting her homeland as it reels from the shock of being betrayed by its own people. What follows is a bittersweet tale of Anna's marriage to a German émigré, a composer, and her journey back to Europe 10 years  later--after his death and the fall of Communism--to come to terms with her own departure and her second husband's past.Necessary Lies, which won the Amazon.com/Books in Canada First Novel Award, tackles an intriguingly volatile period of repression, recrimination, and reconciliation in central and eastern Europe (and in Canada's separatist Quebec as well). Stachniak is a lucid lecturer who deftly makes fiction from events that have been fodder for recent travel literature, such as Eva Hoffman'sExit into History: A Journey Through the New Eastern Europeand Irena Karafilly'sAshes and Miracles: A Polish Journey. Stachniak's strength as a writer lies in her skill in invoking place--its sights and smells and energy--and in juxtaposing a city's present with its complex past. Like an archaeologist or archivist, she delves into the layers of history to reveal the collective source of personal tragedy.But these strengths ultimately prove to be the novel's shortcoming as a work of fiction. Stachniak has a faintly irritating tendency (right from page 1) to engage in irresolvable arguments about whether Poland is part of central or eastern Europe. More significantly, she fails to render psychologically compelling characters, despite the potentially fascinating figures she draws upon. Furthermore, central confrontation scenes with Anna's Polish ex-husband and her second husband's longtime German lover miss the opportunity to sound the depths of betrayal. How unsatisfactory for the reader when the collision of two world views gets reduced to the banality of a co-owned apartment buyout.--Diana Kuprel", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Millard's background was as a scientist, and until 1980 he was a senior lecturer at the University of London, publishing over seventy scientific papers. He later became interested in the work of J.M. Hurst on cycles and channels in the stock market and as this interest grew, spent time carrying out research in this field. Following his landmark book 'Stocks and Shares Simplified', published in 1980, Brian wrote a further five books on the application of scientific methods to the stock market.

For reasons that began as 'perceived necessity' and are currently 'just because,' it's a pseudonym.

The latter being three credit hours short of major status, Journalism ended up being the minor course of study.Throughout a law enforcement experience that saw the rank of patrolman, records officer, investigator (which was a detective without the rank, pay, or shiny badge), evidence officer, photo technician, juvenile officer, and sergeant, writing remained a constant freelance hobby. Leonard hasn't ever had a book published before, but has been a publisher writer for many years.Caught in a sort of limbo in life and the chosen profession due to several issues; around this time, not many police officers would admit to being avid rock fans. He not only admitted it, but played in a couple of rock bands during this tenure.Due to that association, because he failed to see the absolute requirement to arrest anyone and everyone who found themselves in violation of some law somewhere, accusations of \"You don't want to arrest your buddies.\" flew.Not being one to back down, this led to a downward spiral. John Mellencamp said it best; \"I fight authority - authority always wins.\" In the long run, that's probably right. But if you don't do what you believe to be the right thing to do at any given time, that's something you can regret for a long time.Or should.", "related": [], "rank": 2137361, "title": "Real Cops Don't Pay For Lunch", "author": "Leonard Miller", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Beidel, PhD, ABPP, Professor of Psychology, Director, Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology, University of Central Florida, USA“This edited book is an excellent resource for graduate students in applied psychology programs and related fields.  The chapters, which are well written, concise, and informative, will facilitate their understanding and appreciation of the research process.” -Rex Forehand, PhD, University Distinguished Professor of Psychology, University of Vermont, USA“Drs. Thomas and Hersen have organized an excellent and extremely useful guide for students of applied social sciences interested in the translation of research to practice. The text is eminently practical, combining excellent reviews of basic research principles followed by real world application of these principles. I particularly enjoyed the extremely well balanced chapter on efficacy vs. effectiveness research, and I think it would be fun for both students and professor alike to participate in a course designed around this book.” -Ron Acierno, PhD, Director, PTSD Clinical Team, Ralph H.

The next thing Caleb knows, his brother is dead from an apparent suicide.  Caleb, an ex Delta Force captain, keeps his promise to David and infiltrates the commune where Lizzie is living.  Commando style, he takes her prisoner to his country home in upstate New York where he plans to deprogram her.  She recognizes him from David's pictures and she is surprised that Caleb has most of her things there.  She asks for her medicine, and he thinks she is using that as a ploy, until she gets a debilitating migraine and he learns what he has to do to take care of her.  Lizzie has the run of the estate because Caleb  has 'Lizzie' proofed it, but he underestimates her for she proves to be intelligent and determined when she sends an SOS.  During her imprisonment, Lizzie and Caleb get to know each other, but he can't trust her 100% even though his instincts tell him to.  Based on what David had told him, Caleb thinks David's death is her fault even though she tries to explain that they were only friends, and she is a virgin.   She asks him to call her Elizabeth, but he refuses as one more means to control her.  Caleb feels guilt over his growing feelings for her because she was a part of his brother's life and death; and she feels things for him she has never felt before.   When the barriers begin to break down, Caleb almost makes love to Elizabeth, but he is reminded of her treachery when he sees the tattoo that all commune members are required to have.  Elizabeth proves herself to Caleb after he suffers a reaction to a spider bite and later she tells him all about her relationship with David.  They infiltrate the commune, learn the truth about David's death, and narrowly miss getting killed.  And now Elizabeth is free to go, and she does.  After three months, Caleb can't stand it anymore.  He needs and wants Elizabeth and will kidnap her again if he must, but Elizabeth has had time to think about her hard hearted hero, and she knows what she wants.A Hard-Hearted Hero is Pamela Burford at her best!  Definitely two thumbs up!  A strong woman and a vulnerable hero make A Hard-Hearted Hero undeniably romantic! A great romance and a terrific thriller!  Pamela Burford is superb at building the intensity of both!Gloria Miller  --Copyright © 1994-97 Literary Times, Inc.

He learned the value of hard work by being raised on a farm in Wisconsin where he learned auto mechanics from his saintly grandfather who patiently tolerated him and his siblings always under foot. His most frequent comment growing up was “Why did you people settle here when there are much warmer places to live?” He confounded his teachers and most grown ups at a young age writing incredibly powerful algorithms for phenomenally underpowered computers at the dawn of the computer age. This is a skill he has employed throughout his professional career and still take great pride in (the confounding part mostly). At 17 years of age he made a deal with the US Navy “Teach me about airplanes and computers. Take me anywhere it doesn't snow and I’m all yours.” They kept the bargain and started him on a world traveling adventure that has continued far beyond his six-year enlistment. He continued his world traveling adventures as a businessman frequently logging one fourth of his time out of he country. He feels as comfortable abroad as he does at home and has developed an appreciation for a wide range of cultures and cuisines. He settled in Southern California after his service was complete and studied Engineering, Business and Finance at night while working at a series of start-up firms by day. He claims that growing up on the farm and the Navy have ruined his ability to sleep late and habitually gets up well before the sane portion of population starts their day. He wrote many technical articles with such titles as ‘Gamma Ferric Oxide is it really safe for the long haul?’ He was sited in the Time Life Books on Computers as an expert in magnetic storage. He has a portfolio of patents for esoteric technology that only a handful of people really understand and hardly anyone really cares about. He started writing fiction as an assignment for his last required course in his undergraduate degree. He wrote short stories for several years as part of an internet based writing and critique group before the internet was cool and email spam had been invented. He still lives in Southern California with his wife of twenty-five years who puts up with all his bizarre habits and unusual hours where he has a better computer infrastructure at home than most small companies have at the office.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

R.J., however, grew up in a well-off family and chose to be an actor. The two performers married in 1957; he was 27, she was 19. The so-called ideal couple's divorce three years later surprised the film colony. Each re-wed and divorced, then remarried each other again in 1972, \"this time for good.\" Embellished by gossip, the text nevertheless offers solid information about the two stars' careers.

Ljungquist's Introduction toEthan Frome and Selected StoriesWharton tended to measure her literary achievements against those of male writers; in her introduction, she further distinguished her efforts from previous treatments of New England by discounting her role as a mere recorder of the more superficial or external features of her setting. She thus emphasized the steps in the construction ofEthan Frome—that is, her role as a conscious literary craftsman. She noted that her initial conception derived from an academic exercise intended to polish her proficiency in the French language. Developed in Paris in 1907, the French sketch of \"Ethan Frome\" contained three characters (the male was named Hart) and achieved a length that encompassed two scenes, or vignettes, that survived in the published version. The fragment contained a triangular relationship among a husband, his sick wife, and the wife's niece, to whom the \"Ethan-character\" is attracted; but it lacked the structure that would give focus as well as depth to the narrative. Wharton eventually hit upon the device of a storyteller, but she did not choose one steeped in the lore and history of New England. Rather than a character like the herbalist and healer Mrs. Todd in Jewett'sThe Country of the Pointed Firs(1896), a native authority on the region's legends and values, Wharton chose someone from outside New England to narrate the story-a looker-on, an observer.In her desire for \"roundness\"—Wharton seemed to resort recurrently to the terminology of the \"plastic arts\" or visual media—she would supplement the narrator's perspective with those of her minor characters. The fresh, acute perspective derived from the narrator's growing insight and awareness would compensate for what he lacked in inside background knowledge of the Frome household. While the device of an observer might lend \"an air of artificiality\" to a tale of sophisticated characters, Wharton noted, this defect might be mitigated if the narrator brought a sophisticated perspective to a tale of simple people. Her narrator would thus serve as a kind of intermediary between the reticent and reserved villagers and Wharton's readers, giving \"voice\" to characters nearly inarticulate or resigned to silence.Wharton's use of an observer eases the reader's entry into Ethan's story. In the opening of the novel the narrator recaptures his first arresting glimpse of Wharton's central character, when he had been struck by Frome's physiognomy and bearing. Harmon Gow, who had driven the stage between Starkfield and other towns in the region's pre-trolley days, provides further background on Frome. From Gow the narrator learns of Ethan's age and of his reluctance to escape Starkfield because of obligations to care for his failing parents. The narrator also hears not only Gow's chilling comment on Ethan's endurance—\"Ethan'll likely touch a hundred\"—but also his opinion that Ethan's stay in Starkfield constituted a kind of imprisonment: \"Guess he's been in Starkfield too many winters. Most of the smart ones get away\". The narrator's interview of Gow develops the tale only \"as far as his [Gow's] mental and moral reach permitted\", and he hopes that the more educated, sophisticated Mrs. Ned Hale, with whom he is staying, will provide greater insight. He cannot cut through her reserve and reticence, however, even though she has more firsthand knowledge of the aftermath of the accident that scarred Frome's forehead. Implying a suffering too great for words, her only comment is: \"It was awful\".The narrator infers that he must piece together Ethan's story from different sources, and that consequently each retelling will be a little bit different. The meaning of the story, he infers, will be found even in gaps or silences after he has accumulated a succession of hints, suggestions, and clues that surround Frome. For all the narrator's curiosity about the Frome household, this technique gives his telling an elliptical effect, a sense that much has been left unsaid or not fully articulated. When the winter snows prevent the narrator's return to Starkfield after Frome volunteers to drive him to his business appointment, he is granted a night's shelter at the farm. Enveloped by the severe storm, the narrator experiences a \"soft universal diffusion more confusing than the gusts and eddies of the morning.\" In the \"formless night\" his disorientation temporarily intensifies, and \"even [Ethan's] sense of direction, and the bay's homing instinct, finally ceased to serve\". The narrator's perplexity and bewilderment imply a need to reorient himself, to jolt himself, so to speak, into a perspective that demands clearer sight and more acute insight. It is at this point that Wharton effects the transition back to the period of Ethan's youth. Although some critics have quarreled with the subjective nature of her narrator's perceptions, there seems little doubt that Wharton intended his narrative to be more than one version of events among others. Accordingly, it is a \"vision\"; in her 1922 introduction she noted: \"Only the narrator has scope to see it all, to resolve it back into simplicity, and to put it in its rightful place among his larger categories.\"", "related": [], "rank": 2078562, "title": "Ethan Frome and Selected Stories (Annotated) (Literary Classics Collection Book 89)", "author": "Edith Wharton", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His life has in many ways been varied and unusual. In 1960, after six years in Naval Academy he decided it was not for him. “While awakening for a duty, I was hit with this,” he says: “Now walk out of here!” And I left the Academy just three months before graduation.” He went to Moscow Film School, and began a successful career of a documentary filmmaker. He arrived in North America in 1973 and devoted himself to the study of comparative religious philosophy, the practice of meditation, Kriya, Yoga and Releasing. Traveling the world, he produced over 70 documentary films on a wide variety of subjects, including Great Siberian Adventure, Seal Hunters and Inside the KGB.  He lectured at the University of Economics and Moscow State University on Awareness, Responsibility, Releasing, and Freedom. He lectured at UCLA for the Ivy League Association of Southern California on The Psychology of Doing Business in Eastern Europe. He also wrote The Incredible Adventures of Kitto. “I always knew,” he says, “that my destiny was to write.” Beautifully illustrated by Anna and Nadezhda Balzhak with more than eighty original watercolors, this trilogy of fairy tales emphasizes to young readers that “every child is born to succeed.” His most recent book was a novel Gates of the Dead... a flight from grief in search of happiness; an enlightening adventure, a quest for a dream.

For years, I have had the first scene and the general plot of that book in my head. Friends tricked me in Nanowrimo in 2010. During one month, I wrote like mad. I advanced in the story not knowing more than the detectives.  At a moment, I got stuck. We were unable to solve that affair. That’s through exchanges with a friend that the solution came, that’s how Einstein entered the book and saved it. After that, I worked for months proofing, editing, rewriting, submitting to readers to check if it worked. I had three objectives. Be true to the game which meant I did not change the story written in November 2010. Describe the strange microcosm of a symphonic orchestra. Make the reading as easy and catching as possible.  I live with my family in a loft in Paris, I like to cook, garden, read, entertain, arts and culture. I write fiction, my life,my feelings, my city, poetry, haikus mostly. I also paint an take photos.

His latest volume, focusing on the potential for climate change caused by the sun, veers once again into global-cataclysm territory but is redeemed somewhat by Joseph’s rigorous overview of solar physics. According to the Moody Sun Hypothesis, Joseph’s own pet presumption about the sun’s temperamental behavior, random fluctuations in solar activity, from sunspots to flares, have literally shaped the course of history. For example, if not for sun-related plummeting terrestrial temperatures in the 1700s, the Vikings might have colonized North America ahead of Spain. Making frequent reference to a 12,000-year graph measuring solar activity, Joseph traces the past, present, and potential future of the sun’s influence on Earth’s climate, arguing that an impending solar spike will soon short out the electrical power grid for months or years. Most reputable climate scientists will probably scoff at Joseph’s predictions, but his lucidly explained solar lore makes for fascinating reading. --Carl Hays", "related": ["B00IVE3IUQ"], "rank": 336096, "title": "Solar Cataclysm: How the Sun Shaped the Past and What We Can Do to Save Our Future", "author": "Lawrence E.

His new book takes his particular approach to adoptive parenting and repackages it in a way that is more accessible to parents than some of his previous work.Bryan Post is an engaging writer. He is adopted himself and was a troubled teen, so he speaks from a place of personal knowledge. His experience and empathy for adoptive parents are what make this book work much of it covers the usual difficult behaviors that are discussed in other adoption literature, but you know he's been there and knows what it s like. His ideas are often challenging; he invites us to take on what he calls a Paradigm Shift in our attitudes to our children. He suggests that all behaviors come from a place of either love or fear and encourages us to understand the unconscious motivations behind our children s behaviors. He explains the Stress Model (TM) which is what drives our children s behaviors and makes them dis-regulated.He also covers the Four Levels of Memory, explaining that 90% per cent of our emotional memory is unconscious for example, and gives us insights into how difficult it is for adopted children to operate as a result. And, perhaps most importantly, he delves into the realm of 'Unfinished Business' that's OUR unfinished business, the baggage we bring to parenting based on our personal past experiences and expectations and dreams. His methods require us to look deeply into ourselves and our own motivations and possibly make changes ourselves. This is a challenging message and one which some people might find uncomfortable.I would recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with the demands of parenting adopted children wants to try something new. It is easy to read and the format makes it simple to target specific behaviors. --Adoption Today UK April 2010As a librarian who spent 27 years in the mental health field, I have watched or been involved in many, many situations where parents or treatment staff struggled with the slippery slope between a young person/child's behavior. Sadly more often than not, the situation quickly turned into a no-win one.I read this book with growing interest as I went from chapter to chapter. The author's description of individual situations, suggestions to frustrated parents and their subsequent reports of amazing behavior changes are exciting to read about. How well they work/will work by a parent reading the book and trying to follow them, I cannot say, but I am happy to add this to our library and know several parents who will be eager to check it out and try the suggestions.

She gives individual tone and rhythm  to each of the main characters, while keeping the passages of  narrative relatively uninflected. While this suits the author's  own sometimes dry writing, it means that listeners must get to  the second hour before the story truly gets underway. Since this  lengthy forepart fits almost entirely onto the first disk, and  each chapter is clearly marked as to track number on the  packaging, it is possible to simply skip ahead rather than give  up what becomes a delightfully lively listening experience once  the romance gets going. Because the reading adheres so entirely  to the print in spirit as well as in word, this is an excellent  choice for students who cannot access print or who would like to  accomplish college prep reading while undertaking other  activities.

It has only been in the past ten or so years that I have pursued the craft of writing with a greater degree of intensity.  I have written poetry, prose, novellas, short stories, and articles.  I have written pieces that have made people laugh, and pieces that have made others cry.  I don't limit myself to one genre; this is not for any philosophical reason - it's just that I'm interested in a great many things, which is reflected in my writing.       Photography has been an important element of my life for over thirty-five years.  I use a digital camera, the current coin of the realm for the photographic art, but have in the past used 35 millimeter (SLR and rangefinder), medium format, \"folding plate\" cameras (including my all time favorite, a 1928 Zeiss-Ikon Donata) and several pinhole cameras of my own construct.  Pinhole photography is still my favorite, even though I haven't done it in some time.  There is something raw and perfect about this most ancient of photographic techniques that carries with it a certain allure.       My other interests include performing on and building Native American style flutes (check my calendar for upcoming performances), Taoism, motorcycles (between bikes right now), mathematics, origami, soap making, designing Celtic knots, building pentatonically tuned wind chimes, and anything else that catches my eye.  I've had some people refer to me as a 'Renaissance man'.  That sounds a bit pretentious to me, so I'll just cop to something Albert Einstein said about himself:   \"I have no particular talent.  I am merely extremely inquisitive.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book will have you wanting to find a bat to knock some sense into Josh. You'll also want to shake Harry's teeth loose. But you will cheer when they finally find a way to make the love they feel for each other work. The sex between these two is as hot and steamy as a Louisiana summer night. The story is a continuous upheaval of emotions from joy to anger, satisfaction to frustration. Through all of this it is still a wonderful book and worth every punched cushion and whoop of joyOleta M Blaylock for Just Erotic Romance Reviews I really liked this book; it draws you in to the story. Josh is really very sensitive in the beginning, but because Harry hurts him so badly he leaves and hardens himself to the outside world. Harry loves Josh but fears what he will do to her heart and emotions if she gives him her love, so she settles for the next best thing, sex. A story full of drama, this book is sure to be a keeper and keep you reading it over and over again.Angel Brewer for The Romance Studio There are some wonderfully sexy scenes using bondage and submission, in which both Harry and Joshua work through their emotions.Anita for Romance Junkies", "related": ["B00G8UK2T0"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In school he always enjoyed writing and English classes were his favorites. He always excelled in them. He was never short of creativity, often using dreams as source material for his multitude of short stories. He started his first novel, \"The Book\" in 2006 when his best friend moved out of his house. Incorporating his feelings of anger and loneliness into written form he created the story of Miles (then named simply as Wolf) and his endeavors in finding himself and his own strengths while dealing with abuse and manipulation most teenagers never have to even think about. The original manuscript was never finished. It got lost and misplaced several times before ultimately being found in his closet one day while he was cleaning. When he read the unfinished manuscript (then only sixty pages long) he saw incredible potential in the story and decided to start it over from scratch, changing Wolf's name to Miles Jason Wolf and adding several new characters to push the story in different directions. The new first draft was finished in 2010 at just over 150 pages, but as he revised the story he added more character development, new plot twists, and tied some others together in different ways which turned his 150 page manuscript into an 830 page one by 2012. Surprised at this, he wondered if anyone would publish a debut novel that was so long. He submitted the manuscript several times to several publishing agents who ultimately denied him each time, but he never lost faith in his story and its potential. Ultimately, he decided to self-publish through Amazon, but decided to split his novel into a serial novel to make it easier to self-publish. Being so personal, the subject matter of his first novel walks a fine line from time to time, but he's never been one to mix words. He enjoys saying things exactly as they are and sees it as less time consuming and ultimately more rewarding. \"The Book\" may be his first endeavor, but its sure not to be his last. Look for more from this author, including parts two and three of \"The Book\" and a new novel which takes place in London as well as a short story anthology.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She loves going crazy on weekend nights with the hubby.

This makes sense like all dreams make sense - instant authenticity and urgent action.Many women and men around her are wounded. Her pulse races, but she's confident as she paces through operating rooms. She's the most experienced in her unit. She directs doctors and other nurses to patients with wounds of war: missing limbs, bullet-ridden torsos, shellshock and trauma.There's a small green tent, and Cass ducks inside. For some reason this case concerns her the most. Her heart leaps as her eyes adjust to the hazy dark. She feels a huge rush of both hope and despair when she sees her patient.He's on a cot, covered from the waist down with a light green sheet. From all appearances, he's sleeping peacefully. His figure is lean, still muscular although whatever caused the apparent coma has weakened him greatly. His chest rises and falls steadily. His dirty blonde hair, once cut high and tight, is growing out, like his beard. He has been there for quite some time.Cass responds to this patient differently than the others. Warmth fills her chest. Her cheeks flush. She falls to her knees at his side and places her hands on his, squeezing his fingers and hoping for a response. There is none. She drifts her fingers over his midsection, tracing the lines of muscle and trembling as she brushes the patch of fine hair leading past his navel toward the edge of sheet.She is devastated but determined. She fights back tears. She bites her lip, resolute, and reaches down for a cool, damp washcloth. She caresses the man. She doesn't simply wipe him with the cloth. Every movement is a loving one. All around his chest, dabbing a corner of the cloth around his nipples, gliding over each curve of his abdomen and hips, along each powerful arm, against each cheek, she slowly and carefully cleans the silent figure.His skin is damp and warm. His lips part slightly as he breathes harder. Cass purposefully allows her forearms to brush across him. Every point of contact raises her temperature and makes her thirst for more. She sees his pulse beating quickly in a vein on his neck. When she leans forward, her breasts press hard into his body, sending a thrill to her core. She slides back and forth, back and forth, feeling her tender nipples go stiff under her tight t-shirt and thin cotton bra.She grazes a fingertip over his lips, as if to say, \"Remember me?\"She kisses him gently to make sure hedoesremember. He's hot with unknown fever, his lips dry and cracked.When Cass completes the tour of his upper body, she hops up to check outside the tent. Nobody else is around. The compound is quiet. Returning to the man's side, Cass slowly pulls the sheet down to his ankles. Another hot rush swells in her chest and cheeks. She knows it's wrong. This is not part of her standard procedure. She can't get caught, she'll be exposed, they'll be exposed, and all will be lost...", "related": ["B00CB719H8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A cancer diagnosisleft Christine's mother fighting for her lifeand harboring a single wish: to see herbeloved little girl through grade school. Shelived more years than she'd dared hope for,but her decade-long battle with breast cancer,kept largely secret, cast a deep shadowover young Christine's life.At sixteen, left without a mother, Christinebegan carving her own path. Inspired by herparents' example of service—and drawing onfavorite childhood books about pioneerslike Marie Curie and Frederick Douglass—Christine set her sights on work that wouldhelp make a difference in the world. Yetshe bore secrets of her own that she wouldultimately have to face, coming of age in aworld where both women and gay peoplehad no choice but to fight for their dreams.Over time she met those obstacles, bothpersonal and professional, with more fortitudethan patience.In a strikingly intimate and forthright memoir,Christine Quinn demonstrates that life'schallenges can provide the fuel that drives usto be our better selves and, in turn, inspires usto reach out to those who need a helping hand.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Born into a privileged, progressive family during the Bengal Renaissance, he started writing when he was very young. In 1913, he became the first Asian to win the Nobel Prize. Tagore was a versatile writer who produced masterpieces in multiple genres, including autobiography, fiction, poetry, drama, satire, humour, letters and travel writing. He was also an accomplished artist. He composed the national anthems of India and Bangladesh. Although he did not engage directly in politics, he felt deeply about social and political issues. In 1919, he rejected the Knighthood conferred upon him by the British Crown, in protest against the massacre at Jallianwallah Bagh. Tagore was the founder of Visva-Bharati, a university based in Santiniketan in Bengal, where students were offered an eclectic international education, in an atmosphere in close harmony with nature. Some of his best known works are the poems of Gitanjali, novels such as Chokher Bali, Gora, Ghare Baire and Char Adhyay, plays such as Dakghar, Raktakarabi and Arupratan, the songs collected in Gitabitan, dance dramas like Chandalika and Chitrangada, and volumes of prose such as Sadhana and Religion of Man.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Winn possesses a deep passion for helping others become motivated to reach their highest levels of success. Her love of knowledge and willingness to explore her limitations led to an awareness of how subconscious beliefs inhibited her life in the areas of health, wealth and relationships. She has used that knowledge to alter her life and to assist others in their quest to fulfill their dreams.      Sherry overcame her fears and limitations when she contracted chronic pain at the age of 33 and was told by 17 different medical professionals there was no answer to her pain. Rather than succumb to defeat and listen to the doctors, she decided to find a way to health. Through realigning her energy, creating a more positive attitude and seeking out alternative medicine, she was able to find health and return to joyful living.      As an athlete, Sherry reached the epitome of all athletics—THE OLYMPIC GAMES. In both 1984 and 1988, she was a member of the United States Team Handball Olympic Team.      Sherry was a member of the U.S. Team Handball National Team from 1981-1988 participating in the Junior World Championships, the World Championships, the Pan American Games, the Goodwill Games and competing in over 100 international competitions.      In her collegiate career, Sherry was an Academic All-American earning a 4.0 GPA and was also the Valedictorian of the University of Charleston. She was a two-time Honorable-Mention All-American and was twice chosen as Most Valuable Player of her conference departing her collegiate career with 22 school records.       Coach Winn recorded 442 victories including ten national tournament appearances, a national championship and three trips to the Elite Eight. She was voted national coach of the year during the season she won the national title.      From Sherry’s experiences as a coach, athlete and chronic pain suffer; she learned that life is created through thoughts. With astute attention to her inner world, she created a change in her life resulting in greater success, happiness, health and joy.      She is currently an author, motivational speaker and success coach.", "related": ["B007TCCGB8"], "rank": 1764337, "title": "Creating Success: An Olympian's Lessons on Mastering Your Thoughts", "author": "Sherry M.

Ed., a life-long learner and teacher, writes about topics that transcend the self in order to guide others in what she has learned. She believes that learning and experiencing life is an art form, a gateway to transcend and express abstract dreams into concrete realities, having an opportunity to leave a unique impression on others, changing their lives by seeking answers to the same questions she has had in life--to question things for herself, to find alternative answers, to go back to nature, and encourages her readers to do the same in their lives.Carrie is a bestselling author of several books, including \"The Essay Tutor\", \"Bodymorphosis: A Mind and Body Curriculum\", \"Patience through Perspective\", \"Simplify and Beautify Your Life with Natural Coconut Oil\", and \"The Home Spa Book.\"In addition to writing, Carrie has served as an instructor and tutor of English and writing at Minnesota State Colleges and Universities. She has been featured at organizations such as Edge Life Magazine, Essential Wellness, Smarthinking.com, Educational Testing Service, Writer's Digest, and local community publications.It is important to realize our dreams and do what we love every day by manifesting those dreams into reality through the love from the heart. Health, happiness, and success are major components in life we aim to achieve and maintain. The purpose of Carrie's teachings is to guide others in achieving these goals, with a major component focusing on self-realization. She has spent much of her life studying and applying concepts of alternative healing, metaphysics, and self-realization utilizing her education background, in a calling to realize ways to take better care of the body, mind, and soul.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Just selected to the Manchester Counterterrorism Unit, Khan (half Scottish, half Pakistani) follows a tip from a secretive group that explores tunnels under the city about someone using fake ID. Turns out the man in question is from Mauritius with a new degree in chemical engineering and has been seen with his cousin, who’s suspected of brutally murdering a former British law lord in Mauritius. With the high-level Labour Party conference about to begin in Manchester, Khan reports her suspicions about a terrorist plot only to have them ignored by Superintendent Paul Wallace, her cruel and racially biased boss. Fortunately, Khan’s former boyfriend, Sergeant Jim Stephens, of the Manchester PD, who knows Wallace all too well from army service, believes her and has her back. Simms, author of the DI Jon Spicer series, skillfully builds tension in this procedural featuring an appealing protagonist, a persevering biracial woman in a man’s world. --Michele Leber", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It starts with a\nyoung boy stating that his mom just had a new baby, so he wondered what\ndifferent animals called their babies.If your interest has been piqued, you should pick up a copy of this\nlittle book. The photography alone is worth the price, as it is of\nexceptional quality for a children's book. The text is very minimal,\nwith your child's interest maintained by the pictures and the sometimes\nfunny sounding baby names. This would be a good book in which you read\nall the baby names the first time through, then gradually drop out a few\n at a time and urge your child to recall the names. It could prove to be\n very educational, as well as helpful to develop a good memory in your\nchild. The author did a very competent job of researching the\ninformation in this book, and it is sure to bring many hours of\nentertainment to both you and your child.It has got my whole-hearted\nrecommendation!Diana M. HockleyDavid Chuka has crafted an excellenteducational tool for small\nchildren. I enjoyed the way he \"cartooned\" the question and then put an\nendearing picture of the baby on the next page.

The Holocaust is treated as a separate 'war' within Hitler's many wars, with discussion of all the elements of how the extermination was carried out, the European attitudes towards Jews, and the ideology of National Socialism, demonstrating the historical context that allowed Hitler's ideas to prevail. The separate campaigns of the war are described concisely, with sections that address related issues, including later interpretations of each campaign's effect on the overall war. Each chapter concludes with a chronology summarizing the events described.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Being north of the Liffey we were 'real Dubliners'. By the mid 40's our Georgian and Regency terraces were advancing into decaying tenements but our wide streets were relatively traffic free and provided us children with an enviable freedom. They also provided hard-pressed Mammy's with hours of peace and quiet because apart from feeding any open beak that darkened the doorway the only time they saw their offspring was when they did a head count at bedtime. Even then it was not uncommon to find a cuckoo in the nest and one of your brood being scrubbed clean by a neighbour! By my 18th year I knew that I was part of a generation whose future would be on a foreign shore. Ireland, an impoverished country with a dismal economic environment and De Valera's deeply conservative theocratic government would not be able to meet either our aspirations or expectations in the furtherance of a career. Our exodus was rationalized by many families as a temporary expedient until things improved at home but I was realistic enough to know that my exile would be a long one. Early in the New Year of 1957 I 'took the boat' to start my nurse training in London's East End. Half a century later, after a long career in Public Health Nursing, and despite having Gypsy feet I have settled into retirement  there'.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Gillain explores Truffaut’s search for that secret as well as the more personal secret that eluded him, the ways his own films revealed his subconscious desires. Gillain was before her time when she wrote this psychobiography more than 20 years ago, examining how Truffaut’s childhood memories of abandonment inspired a succession of motifs in his films focused on distant mother figures for whom the characters search. Truffaut’s motto, that films were “ivory eggs” to be viewed but not broken into, reflected his sense that understanding interfered with the creative process. Gillain examines Truffaut’s works in pairs, contrasting their motifs with unconscious efforts to work out conflicts in his life, from his troubled childhood to his affair with actress Catherine Deneuve. Among the films she pairs and analyzes are The 400 Blows and The Woman Next Door; and Shoot the Piano Player and The Soft Skin. Truffaut fans will love this English translation of Gillain’s work drawing on the psychology and cinematography of the acclaimed filmmaker. --Vanessa Bush", "related": [], "rank": 1153297, "title": "Franois Truffaut: The Lost Secret", "author": "Anne Gillain", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

'Let's teach some Dickens at key stage three,' some argued. 'I can't imagine anything worse,' others said. 'Too difficult', 'too wordy', 'enough to put anyone off'. 'But the stories are great,' I argued. It's easy to see both sides of the argument. As someone who has dipped in and out of Dickens over the years, I have always been delighted by the actual reading of the novel, but sometimes it has taken a considerable effort of will to start the thing. Many are long, all are complex, and there is some truth in the assertion that they are too difficult-not for all, certainly, but for some children at key stage three, Dickens could sound the death knell for reading pleasure. There is a case, then, for a differentiated Dickens, and here, as with other literary classics, Real Reads provides a helpful solution. The series currently includes nine of the major novels: Bleak House, A Christmas Carol, David Copperfield, Hard Times, Oliver Twist and Great Expectations, The Old Curiosity Shop, A Tale of Two Cities and Little Dorrit. All follow the same format-a couple of pages introducing the characters with some delightful illustrations by Karen Donnelly, forty-seven pages of narrative and a 'Taking Things Further' section at the back. Like other Real Reads, too, the novels are not designed to replace the originals, but to complement them. The publisher's hope is that for some readers, the Real Reads are a springboard into the original texts; for others it is to broaden their range of cultural experience and introduce them to a world of wonderful plots and characters. What makes these retellings particularly appealing from a classroom point of view is that significant attention is paid to the language use characteristic of the authors. The novels are retold with some integrity to the original-that is that some of the cadence of Dickens is retained; that some of the vocabulary remains authentic, and that some of those seminal passages remain relatively unaltered. Take the opening of A Tale of Two Cities as an example, 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times; it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness; it was the season of wealth, it was the season of poverty. In short, it was a time very much like the present.' In short, it is very much like the original. The retellings go some way to preserving Dickens's characters and while there are of course casualties, the characters that remain are rounded and engaging. For Oliver we feel pity as he pleads with Sikes 'P-p-p-please don't make me steal,' in the face of Sikes terrifying whisper 'Quiet, vermin'. We long for Nancy to be saved by Mrs Maylie and feel the poignancy of her departure: 'You must take Oliver to safety. I must return to my life.' We sense the justice in Fagin's wait for death 'his face so distorted and pale, his eyes so bloodshot, that he already looked more dead than alive as he awaited his punishment.' Of course, we also feel the delight and relief as 'Oliver and Mr Brownlow walked hand in hand to their carriage.' Some of Dickens's humour is preserved: Mrs Joe is to be found bringing Pip up by hand and at the birth of David Copperfield, Peggotty's 'bosom swelled with such joy and pride that two buttons popped from her bodice and flew across the room.' The heartbreak remains too: 'As he wasted away over the next few days, Little Dorrit didn't leave her father's side. His spirit was like a maimed bird, able to think only of the place that had broken its wings. Finally, his spirit broke free of all earthly concerns. Little Dorrit wept bitterly. The 'Filling in the Spaces' section at the back of each book provides a helpful resource for teachers. Elements of the plot that have been omitted in order to contain the retelling in such a thin volume are listed here and can provide a useful point of departure to read some of the original text. There is some contextual material pertinent to the text, so for Little Dorrit we learn that Dickens's father was sent to Marshalsea Prison when Dickens was twelve and for Hard Times we can read about the rise of steam power and the way in which machinery in factories gave rise to mass migration to cities. There is also a two-page section called 'Food for thought' that provides points for discussion, themes, style and symbols and would neatly help shape classroom discussion and activity. In The Old Curiosity Shop, for example, 'Oscar Wilde said that Nell's death makes the reader laugh, whereas critics in Dickens' time were usually overcome by grief. Which is closer to your own reaction? Why?' would lend itself very well to paired, group or whole-class debate. Thinking about how the symbols of fog, hands, light and shadow and city and countryside match the action in Bleak House immediately suggests ways in which pupils might track language against action as they read. At the lower end of the price range for class readers, the excellent and durable quality of the books presents a good investment at GBP4.99 RRP for individual texts. -- Jane Campion English in Use", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She departs from Tokyo with her husband and three others in thesummer of 2010, exhilarated by the prospect of fulfilling a 30-year-old dream. But she isalso wary of difficult terrain, mechanical issues, and rumors of dodgy border crossingsahead.Instead of ending her journey in St. Petersburg, Russia as planned, Joseph and herhusband choose to continue riding as far south as Cape Town, South Africa (minus onestretch over which they travel by plane) to complete a year-long journey that spans50,000 kilometers through 30 countries. For someone so inexperienced, Josephdisplays courage in completing this journey, and her story will inspire thosewho have doubted their abilities but dared to follow a dream into the unknown. As a catalog of places, sights and events, Joseph's story will likely appeal mainly toreaders who would like to follow this route and motorcycle across Russia and throughAfrica, an \"unexpected jewel in the travel crown.\" Others will wish Joseph had wovenmore personal reflection throughout her story.

After a first job as a professional skateboarder, her career in television and comedy took off when she co-starred in The Kenny Everett Show on BBC1, starting in the 1980s – then the number one rated comedy series in the UK. It ran for eight years, immortalizing Everett’s infamously zany, anarchic and saucy comedy. Following her early work in the original Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and as a roving reporter for That’s Life!, she has worked between the UK and the US for a range of broadcasters including the BBC, ITV, Channel Four, Channel Five and NBC, and co-starred with names ranging from Emma Thompson and Rhys Ifans to Roger Daltrey and Leigh Francis. In 2012, she launched her own brand of 100% agave tequila, AquaRiva, which has already won international awards.

There was plenty of intrigue and just the\nright amount of action.  There was no gratuitous violence or gore in the\n action sequences, so this story could be read by ages young adult on\nup.  The writing seemed tight, had a flair of expressions from the\nhistorical period (musketeer era? 17th century France), and was free of\ntypos and well formatted for my Kindle - which is rare among many indie\nauthors.The story starts with two travelers looking for a place\nto rest for the night.  They choose a small inn inside the walls of a\nsleepy town, and soon after turning in for the night the mystery begins\nwith a faint whispering voice in the dark.  From there the suspense\nstarts to build, and soon the two main characters find themselves ...\nwell, I don't want to spoil anything for anybody.  So you'll have to\nread this story for yourself if you want to know what happens.If\n you've a liking for a little swashbuckling, some mystery, a little\nsupernatural elements, and a great deal of suspense...then read this\nnovella by TD Bauer.", "related": ["B00CJ11II6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

On a normal day, she would be found in her herb garden collecting spices for her kitchen or ingredients for her potions; in her huge eclectic Provencal kitchen with the big modern oven cooking pots and pans of food for her family of one husband and three kids (an ardent daughter and two boisterous sons) that'll probably last for weeks; in her library with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and an e-reader in her hands as she reads the latest short story erotic hit; or scribbling pages upon pages of different erotic lifestyles, searching for the one that feels like it was inspired by just the right mix of passion, storyline, and sex. She loves going crazy on weekend nights with the hubby. Aside from these activities, the rest of the time she'd be found in front of her laptop typing the latest Sandra Ross concoction for her readers.", "related": ["B00I25I2WS"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 14, "rating_average": 3.8571, "rating_total": 54.0}

It wasn’t until his mid-twenties that Ben persisted in teaching himself to read — and finally read his first novel. Ben emigrated to Perth, Western Australia in 1990, where he now lives with his wife Michelle and two adult children, Chelsea and Zac. To pass the hours working as a bricklayer, he would think about writing a novel. However, it took many years for him to pluck up the courage to turn his dreams into words.  His dyslexia, and informal knowledge of the English language and grammar, made his first book a real challenge. Luckily, he had plenty of people around him to help him on his journey. His love of scientific facts, futuristic possibilities, and fast-paced action infects his plots and writing style. He thoroughly enjoys pushing himself creatively, which means venturing into many types of storytelling. As a consequence, his catalogue is a mixture of sci-fi, speculative and horror fiction. Ben now has a growing number of novels to his name, and he fully intends to expand on that number.", "related": [], "rank": 1180022, "title": "The Eden Hole eBook", "author": "Ben Brown", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Littleton White is a retired educator, writer and mother of two, living in Atlanta, GA.  Since early childhood, she dreamed of writing stories that readers would fall in love with, but she put those dreams on hold to focus on her family and her career.  After 42 years in public education, she retired and finally plucked up the courage to put pen to paper with this, her first novel, Sophia.     She is also author of Finally, Free! Gwendolyn has been on a journey to transform the nagging background noise in her life.   She had tried every approach under the sun in an attempt to get better, with meager and discouraging results.  Then through a series of events, some of which she has related in this book, everything changed for her.   She always sought to explore her most profound depths and discover her place in this vast universe. Yearning to live a life of great inner peace happiness and self-awareness, she wanted to heal past traumas and leave behind limitations, whether self created or imposed.  Today, she is intrigued with the reality of her existence and how the events along the way have joined together in unique and potent ways to tap the potential within.  For most of her life she settled below the thresholds of what is possible for her to achieve.  She now realizes that her central problem had been the Upper Limits problem and now, this issue has been dissolved since she has found new levels of awareness.  Greater awareness is always possible and she is brimming with aliveness for more, more more!", "related": [], "rank": 3991402, "title": "SOPHIA", "author": "Gwendolyn Littleton White", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The awkwardness of the prose always seems to distract, and\nyet there are authors who use it with skill and grace. Suzanne Collins who\nwrote Hunger Games did it well, using the present tense narrative form to keep\nthe readers in the dark about how the plot ends. In the erotic world, author\nFelicity Brandon does it with skill and grace, though more from a personal\npreference than out of the necessity of plot. Even more incredibly, Felicity\nBrandon writes from a first person perspective, forcing action, dialog, and\neven description through the lens of a narrator, and not just an author's pen.\nAnd she does it well.Her latest short story, \"Customer Service\" is pure gold, balancing action, dialog,\nand description in a sexually tense and fascinating way. In it, Felicity\nBrandon introduces us to Polly, a beleaguered waitress dealing with the dreaded\ncustomer \"Rachel\" who wraps her arrogance and bad attitude around herself like\na cloak. Polly discovers a note with Rachel's phone number on it and a personal\nmessage. Intrigued, Polly calls and finds herself willingly submitting to the\ndominatrix, whose attitude doesn't change, even in the privacy of her own home.\nThe sex is steamy, the descriptions poignant, and the tension builds.\"Customer\nService\" is a short, fast read, filled with eroticism and romance that anyone,\nman or woman, would enjoy. I heartily recommend this tale and give it a full\nten out of ten rating.Michael Alexander, Author", "related": ["B00IC7DCU8"], "rank": 447790, "title": "Customer Service", "author": "Felicity Brandon", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He, however, came of age in Britain, after year long stays in Buffalo (U.S.) and Paris. Though he has lived in the U.S., the second time around since 1985, mainly in New Hampshire, he is very much a ‘Brit’ at heart, cricket an abiding passion. He started computer programming in 1969, and went to work for IBM when he was 20. Over the years he also worked for the likes of ITT, Wang and BBN, and was, for two decades, a leading authority on IBM networking. Writing, however, has been a consuming pastime since the early 1980s. His first book was published in 1984. Four further books on technology as well as over 350 technical publications followed. Around 2006, with IBM networking an oxymoron, he turned his attention to papal history, art and astronomy. He is the sole-author of twenty books. He has a Master’s in computer science, three daughters, one son and two Goldens. www.guruge.com.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The oldest of four children, Steve was raised in a household of very modest means. He didn’t like how he lived -- so, he learned early on to make money. He had a paper route, caddied at the country club, learned how to play drums, then he joined a band and made money playing at clubs and weddings. Still, he wanted more.This led Steve to corporate America, where he was an internal auditor for several companies. After earning his certified internal auditor certificate, he went to work for Arthur Anderson & Company, where he grew the firm’s client base and revenues by tens of millions of dollars. Steve also served as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of major companies, including Safelite Glass Corporation, Drug Emporium, Nationwise Automotive, Technology Services International and companies in the restaurant, convenience store and real estate development industries.Still, Steve says he wanted more. He also knew there was a limit to his potential as long as he worked for someone else.This led Steve to entrepreneurship and the ups and downs that choice brings with it, including some excellent success and terrible losses – until he developed the very system he now shares with audiences and clients the world over. It’s the same system he’s used to develop his own businesses into thriving profitable entities and to transform his life into a fulfilling, richly rewarding tapestry of consistent success.Now Steve encourages you to take a step for yourself, move into the inner circle and discover the exact steps he’s taken and today repeats again and again with his clients, within \"the pages of the first in his newest series of books, Building Profits Fast: How to Increase Your Profits by 30% or More in 90 Days or Less,\"", "related": [], "rank": 2571621, "title": "Building Business Profits Fast", "author": "Steve Pohlit", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His passion for writing came from his love of film and book, particularly the works of JRR Tolkien and Bernard Cornwell. Taking a confident but giant leap, he put pen to paper in the Spring of 2010 and produced an epic contemporary and historical fantasy called 'The Knowledge: The Children' - the first book of a trilogy. Based in Scotland and France from 16th century to present day, The Knowledge presented unedited and is full of intrigue, suspense, horror, fantasy; with narrative portraying a 'fly on the wall' experience. This is an ongoing project. David's second book; a series of novellas 'Madeline' was born out of the seeds of his imagination while writing The Knowledge. Basing his characters in 18th century France, his keen eye for historical detail and his refreshingly different style of writing has successfully and so vividly brought to life a past world. David currently lives in Fife, Scotland.", "related": ["B00H27G8XW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her non-fiction covers a wide range of topics from travel to politics, and her fiction is equally diverse. She covers mainstream fiction with darker topics, such as DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS, as well as family-friendly fare like her fun kids' adventure, COMIC SQUAD.Thanks to a steady diet of Harlequin romances as a pre-teen, Ginger always manages to find her way back home to her first love: genre romance. In 2011, she embarked on a new journey - to publish romance novels starring women who look more like the average American woman. She plucked plus-size characters from the supporting cast of most mainstream fiction and allowed them to star in their very own fairy tales. These \"Rubenesque\" romances have developed a following thanks to her best-selling GROUPIE series. Other titles, such as LOVE PLUS ONE, THE UNDISCIPLINED BRIDE and the highly-rated New Adult series, FIERCE, tap into the \"reality-TV\" preoccupation in American entertainment, which gives her contemporary stories a current, pop culture edge.Known for writing gut-twisting angst, Ginger is unafraid to push the envelope with characters that are perfectly imperfect. Whether rich, poor, sweet, selfish, gay, straight, plus-size or slender, her characters are beautifully flawed and three-dimensional. They populate these lavish fictional landscapes that teach us more about the real world in which we live, simply through their interaction with each other. Her goal with every book is to give the reader a little bit more than they were expecting, told in stories they'll never forget.", "related": ["B00LR1ANAS"], "rank": 721322, "title": "The Undisciplined Bride", "author": "Ginger Voight", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 22, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 99.0}

Amante de su ciudad natal, Madrid, vive en un pueblo de Salamanca de apenas treinta vecinos, junto a la persona que eligió para vivir su propia historia de amor. Su afición por la lectura comenzó una fría tarde de invierno, con tan solo 15 años, cuando aburrida hurgó en los estantes de la biblioteca de su hermana algún libro que le llamara la atención. Allí se decidió por “El jardín de las mentiras” de Eileen Goudge. Y desde ese momento que la romántica la envolvió con su encanto, quedándose hasta la madrugada inmersa en cuanta historia de amor cayera entre sus manos. Y por entre ellos, la escritura surgió también en ella. Muchos son los cuadernos de espiral donde sus ideas comenzaron a tener vida, plasmando en ellos, mundos donde los hilos de los personajes eran movidos a su antojo, siendo a veces ellos mismos los que guiaban los dedos para escribir sus propios destinos. Sus escritos son un enredo de personajes maravillosos, entrelazados unos con otros, con ciertos toques de humor y alegría, algunas tristezas y malos aciertos, pero con palabras y frases que llegan al corazón.

EROTICA and HORROR. I tend to mostly write in the paranormal genre so to have a collection like this with almost all of my paranormal erotics in it was awesome. This box set starts out with a vampire series that I did called \"Vampire Fetish.\" This series was fun to explore because I had just finished up writing an adult fiction series about vampires that was almost 3000 pages in length. In that one I had adult topics, but no sex. I was ready to turn some vampires lose in the bedroom. I also had built my own version of vampires in my adult series. In \"Vampire Fetish\" I stayed true to what vampires are normally considered as. The blood drinking, the viciousness, the overwhelming sexual needs. In it I weaved together the vampires and a murder mystery with two detectives who accidently found themselves in the middle of a paranormal investigation. I loved the storyline and the characters and I may expand on it again some day.Then I included two stand alone erotics in this box set, one called \"Switch\" and one called \"Wolves and Witches\". Both were fun to write as Switch allowed me to play out a fantasy with hot ghost hunters and Wolves and Witches allowed me to play around with reality as I weaved together a movie being made and reality into one. Both were fun shorts and very hot in nature.This box is finished up with one of my all time favorite series I have written in erotics, that of Hunter's Blood. Oh dear. Well, to begin with, \"Hunter\" is actually based on my muse Johnny Depp. I could not help it, I adore him. Now in this series I once again explored Vampires only this time it was more of a psychological mind trip than anything as Vanessa tried her best to navigate this world, her memory deceiving her and Hunter driving her mad. It is a HOT series with scorching sex scenes and plenty of humor as Hunter is a sarcastic ass. I so enjoyed writing it and I have already started the first novel for Hunter & Vanessa called \"Dog will Hunt\".

In the end he returns safely to his suburban life, having, of course, found all of his experiments somehow wanting. Berger writes so amusingly, particularly in the sequence about the comedian, that for quite a while he convinces the reader to overlook the implausibility of his thesis--surprising to find in so jaundiced a story--that it's best to take your lumps, eschew the glamorous, and be just folks.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Born into a poor but literary family in South Mississippi, she taught herself to read by borrowing (stealing?) her older brother's first grade reader and following her other siblings around asking them what the words meant. She has written several novels, but she became frustrated with regular print publishing and had almost given up on her dream of becoming an author. Since discovering independent publishing, she has begun dreaming again! Ledell still resides in South Mississippi with her husband and children. Her hobbies are reading (naturally), riding her recumbent bicycle, solving mathematical puzzles, baking, and teaching children at her church. Her novels are set near her home, with most of the action occurring in two fictional areas between the Gulf Coast and Hattiesburg: the town of Magnolia and a nearby rural community named Wisdom. Her novels may not be considered traditional Christian fiction, since she often has at least one main character who has been sexually assaulted and the abuse is dealt with frankly but not explicitly. There is, however, a strong theme of redemption and the foundation of self-worth that can be found in God’s love and in Christian relationships. Ledell's characters also have Christian values and self-discipline that determine many of their actions, they pray while running to help, and they attend church on Sundays. Although the first four novels have a continuing story arc, each is a stand-alone that leaves no cliffhangers and briefly retells anything you need to know if you haven’t read the previous stories. You can read TAKE MY HAND for Callie and Rick’s story, and ACCOUNTABILITY to learn more about Jon and Ruth. Aunt Shelby will finally turn the tables on her stalker in the fourth novel, tentatively titled Watch and Pray, which will come out in Fall, 2014. The princess stories will eventually be told in a storybook—or possibly a series of storybooks—for little girls, but there’s no deadline yet. Write to Ledell at ledellwalters@yahoo.com.
