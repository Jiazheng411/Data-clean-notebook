The procedures are applicable to well known problems in computational stochastic mechanics, such as the stability analysis of systems with random imperfections and the dynamic analysis of deterministic systems under stochastic loading. For the dynamic analysis of deterministic systems under stochastic loading, an efficient procedure based on the Karhunen-Loève representation of the response is presented.

The level of exposition varies greatly: a whole chapter is devoted to the elementary relationships of linear dimension, area, and volume, whereas the discussion of wave phenomena uses partial differential equations. There are occasional errors, such as the statement that a neutron star comprises \"billions of protons and neutrons,\" and curious terminology: the list of regular polyhedra repeatedly includes the hexahedron rather than the cube.

He sat beside her on the sofa, too close for comfort, and oozing the kind of blatant sexuality that weakened her defences. Power and determination had made him successful in business, but Lavender had no intention…''I don't have to go if you don't want me to, Mum.'Rachel had been lost in the intriguing love life of her latest heroine when Daisy appeared in her office doorway, but her daughter's words brought a crushing end to that imaginary world.'Oh, Daisy!' Rachel exclaimed, getting up from her desk to give the girl a swift hug. 'When did I say I didn't want you to go?''You didn't,' said Daisy, recoiling from her mother's embrace with all the youthful independence of a thirteen-year-old. 'But I know what you think of Lauren. I don't like her much either. And the last time I visited them they were still living in England.'Rachel sighed. She was always amazed at Daisy's capacity to understand her feelings. She wasn't always amenable. Like any teenager her age, she and her mother didn't always see eye to eye. But where her father was concerned, there was no contest.Daisy had known that his invitation to spend at least two weeks of her summer holidays with him and his second wife at their home in Florida could prove controversial. For the first three years of his marriage to Lauren, Steve had only seen his daughter a handful of times, even though Rachel had agreed to share custody. But suddenly, since Steve's move to the company's headquarters in Miami last year, he'd been eager to have her spend every holiday with him.Rachel hadn't voiced any objections. She wanted Daisy to know her father. But there was still a twinge of apprehension at the thought that Daisy might find life in the United States far more exciting than living here in Westlea, a quiet English country town.'Look, I don't mind,' she assured Daisy now, refusing to consider how she would feel if Daisy did decide to live with her father. Rachel's unexpected success in recent years as a romantic novelist had proved satisfying, but it certainly wouldn't compensate for the loss of her daughter as well as her husband.'Well…' Daisy still looked doubtful, and Rachel wanted to hug her again. 'If you're sure?''You'll have a lovely time,' said Rachel, unable to resist tucking a strand of dark hair behind her daughter's ear. She paused. 'I just wish your father hadn't arranged for you to travel across the Atlantic with some strange man.'Daisy laughed then. 'He's not a strange man, Mum,' she protested. 'I have met him before. When Daddy lived in London. He's his boss, actually. His family owns Mendez Macrosystems. Lauren really likes him. I know she thinks he's hot.'Rachel's jaw dropped. 'Hot?''Yeah.' Daisy stared at her. 'Duh. As opposed to boring? Honestly, Mum,' she grimaced, 'if you're writing for a modern audience you ought to know these things.''I know.' Rachel was defensive. 'But what makes you think Lauren regards this man ashot?' She pulled a face. 'For heaven's sake, she and your father have only been married for four years.''And your point is?' Daisy was sardonic. 'Oh, Mum, get real, will you? Women like Lauren are always on the lookout for the next good thing.'Rachel shook her head. 'I don't think we should be having this conversation, Daisy.''Why not?''Well… because Lauren is your father's wife.''You were Daddy's wife when she decided she wanted him,' pointed out Daisy shrewdly. 'Honestly, Mum, I don't know what you're worried about. If she and Dad get a divorce, you and he could get back together.'Could they?Rachel didn't answer her, aware that that option was no longer as attractive as it might once have been. Experience had taught her that Steve Carlyle was not and had never been the man she thought she'd married. Lauren Johansen hadn't been the first female to attract Steve's attention during the nine years of their relationship. She'd just been the richest, and the most determined.'Anyway, you'll get to meet him yourself before we go,' Daisy went on, reverting back to their earlier discussion. 'Mr Mendez, I mean. When he picks me up to take me to the airport.' She dimpled. 'Wait until I get back and tell Joanne. She'll be so hacked off. I can't wait.'Rachel groaned. '\"Hacked off\"? Daisy, what kind of language is that?''Okay, green with envy, then, is that better?' Daisy pulled a face. 'Like I say, Mum, you really need to update your vocabulary.''Not with words like that,' said Rachel a little prudishly, and then, realising she wasn't going to get any more work done that morning, she switched off her computer and followed her daughter out the door. 'Anyway, it's lunchtime. Do you want an omelette or a salad?''Couldn't I have a ham-and-cheese toastie?' asked Daisy wheedlingly. Lately, since she'd got her period, she was inclined to put on weight rather too easily, and Rachel was trying to wean her onto a healthier diet.'I suppose so.'Rachel was pragmatic. Daisy was unlikely to stick to eggs and salads while she was on holiday, so what was one sandwich more or less? Which reminded her, they only had five days before Daisy left for Florida. A depressing thought.Daisy was due to spend the following day with her grandparents. Steve's mother and father had never approved of their son's behaviour, and as Rachel's parents had died in a car accident when she'd only been a teenager herself, she and the elder Carlyles had always been very close. It meant Rachel would have a whole day to try and catch up with her deadline, which had definitely floundered since Daisy had accepted her father's invitation.Consequently, she was irritated when the doorbell rang just after eleven o'clock that morning. She wasn't expecting any visitors. There were no edited manuscripts on their way back to her for approval, so it was unlikely to be the postman. And her neighbours knew better than to interrupt her before twelve o'clock.Getting up, she went across to her office window and looked out. She was seriously considering not answering the door, but the sight of a powerful black SUV standing at her gate caused her to revise her opinion. Who on earth did she know who owned a vehicle like that?No one.And then a man stepped back from the shadow of the overhang and looked up directly at her window. A dark man, she saw, with hair cut so short it was barely more than stubble over his scalp. It was difficult to judge how tall he was from this angle, but Rachel got the impression of height and power, broad shoulders encased in an age-scuffed leather jacket.She stepped behind the curtain automatically, not wanting him to think she was spying on him, but it was too late. He'd seen her. The second peal of the bell proved it, and with a rapidly beating heart she left her office and hurried downstairs.As she unlocked the door, she wondered if she was being entirely wise. After all, she was alone here. She didn't know this man, and he certainly looked as if he was no stranger to trouble.But that was her novelist's imagination taking over, she thought impatiently. He was stranger, yes, but he'd probably picked the wrong address. He might be looking for someone. Julie Corbett, for example. Her flirtatious neighbour two doors down definitely attracted a lot of male attention. The kind of male attention this man had in spades.She opened the door a few inches, making sure to keep most of her body hidden. Her strappy vest and shorts were not for public consumption, not when she was sure her hips spread every time she sat down at her desk. 'Can I help you?'The man—she'd been right, he was tall: easily six feet, with a lean, muscled build—grinned at her. His face was darkly tanned, almost swarthy, with well-defined cheekbones, dark, hooded eyes, and a nose that looked as if it might have been broken at some time. He wasn't handsome, as the men she wrote about were handsome, but she had to admit that tough, masculine features and a hard thin-lipped mouth were infinitely more sexy. He was also younger than she was, she decided. But that didn't prevent him from embodying the kind of power and authority that made her catch her breath.God!'Rachel,' he said, shocking her still further by his casual use of her name. 'It is Rachel, isn't it?'Rachel swallowed. 'Should I know you?' she asked faintly, sure that they'd never met before, and he pulled a wry face.'No,' he said, his accent definitely not English. 'But I know your daughter. Daisy?'And when that aroused no immediate recognition, 'I'm Joe Mendez.'Rachel felt weak. This surely couldn't be the man who owned Mendez Macrosystems—Steve's boss! It didn't seem possible. Weren't company executives supposed to wear three-piece suits, and ties and lace-up Oxfords? Not black leather jackets over tee shirts and jeans, and sockless loafers that had seen better days.'I—Daisy's not here,' she said lamely, and Joe Mendez propped a hand against the wall beside the door and regarded her with the same look of tolerance her daughter sometimes employed.'I didn't come to see Daisy,' he said, glancing behind him at the SUV. 'Is it okay leaving the car there?'Which seemed to denote an expectation of being invited in. Rachel hesitated. 'It's a quiet road,' she said. Indeed, few unfamiliar vehicles entered the cul-de-sac. 'Um—what can I do for you, Mr Mendez?''Joe,' he corrected her evenly. He glanced pointedly over her shoulder. 'May I come in?''Oh…' Well, why not? she argued frustratedly. It wasn't as if he was a complete stranger, and she owed it to Daisy to be polite. She stepped back, remembering, as her bare feet protested the chill of the hall tiles, that she was hardly dressed for visitors, but it was too late to think of that now. 'Of course.''Thanks.'Joe stepped into the hall, immediately filling it with his presence, and, leaving him to close the door, Rachel led the way into a rather formal sitting room.

The country lane that led to the Manor House hadn't changed at all in the years since he had last seen it, and his hands were already moving on the steering wheel, ready for the turn, even before he glimpsed the gateway.The savage downpour meant that he could only take the steep, curving driveway in low gear and at a crawling speed but that wasn't something that troubled him. He had waited for this moment, planned for it, for so long that a few more moments didn't matter. The truth was that he was enjoying the anticipation almost as much as he expected to enjoy putting his planning into operation, and as the big sandy-coloured house came into view the sense of grim satisfaction that had been with him ever since he had left Athens deepened and darkened at the thought of what was to come.Inside that house Jessica Marshall was acting out her part as lady of the manor, unaware of the fact that her days in that role were strictly numbered—had, in fact, already come to an end. In a very short space of time the reality of her situation would hit home to her and he would be there to see her reaction as her world fell apart around her. The thought of that moment was something that made the long, tedious journey from the airport bearable, even in this appalling weather.'I think we're ready now.'Jessica spoke softly, stopping her stepfather's butler just as he was about to leave the room after ushering in the latest black-coated, sombre-faced arrival.'Would you ask them to bring the cars around to the front of the house? Is there a problem?' she added, blue eyes frowning slightly as Peters hesitated, looked a little concerned.'No problem, miss,' the elderly man explained. 'It's just that I think it might be best to wait a little while yet—until everyone has arrived.''Wait?'Jessica pushed a hand through the soft fall of her chestnut hair as she looked round the room, struggling to remember just who had been invited today. She couldn't think who, if anyone, was missing.'But everyone is here—aren't they?'Again there was that flash of a disturbing expression—one that crossed Peters's face and was gone in a moment. But Jessica had seen it and the feeling that it left in its wake was one of unease, a niggling sense of something she didn't know about—but felt that she should. Something that unnerved and worried her, setting her on edge like a nervous cat.'Not quite everyone, miss.''But who…?'Jessica glanced around the room, frowning as she completed another survey of the guests. Everyone there was elderly, like most of her stepfather's friends, and she couldn't think if someone was obviously missing from the list of people who should have been invited to Marty's funeral.'I can't think of anyone…''There is one last…' Peters hesitated over the right way to describe the person he meant. 'A person I was told to expect,' he finished awkwardly.'Told by who?''Mr Hilton—Mr Simeon Hilton.'Her stepfather's solicitor. So this person, whoever they might be, was known to Simeon Hilton. But why hadn't Simeon told her about him—or her—when they had had their last discussion about the preparations?'I'll ask…' she began when the sound of a powerful car's engine outside cut through her words, making her break off. The next moment the rich, purring sound had been silenced too as the car drew to a halt beyond the big bay window, just out of sight.'It looks as if our missing guest is here,' she told Peters, whose attention had been caught as well. 'I suggest you go and let them in now and we can get on our way to the church.'And she could find out who the missing person was, she told herself as she smoothed back a wayward lock of her gleaming hair that had fallen loosely around her face once more, tucking it behind her ear in an attempt to secure it. She'd fastened most of it back for today, but it seemed that one bright lock was determined to escape.The new arrival must be someone important, she reflected. Important enough for Simeon to have told Peters not to start without them. But if that was the case, then why hadn't he mentioned this expected arrival to her when they had been going over the details of Marty's funeral? She'd asked him to let her know if there was anyone she ought to take particular notice of.Out in the hall she heard the big, heavy oak door creak open and the murmur of voices.Male voices. So the mysterious arrival was a he after all. One small part of the problem solved.There was something about the tone of the voice that responded to Peters's greeting that grated on her, searing over nerves that were suddenly and unexpectedly drawn tight. Something unnervingly familiar that tugged on her senses and reminded her of…Of what?Of something just out of reach that she couldn't focus on or grasp at. The thundering sound of the driving rain out beyond the open door had blurred the words and made them totally incomprehensible so that, try as she might, she couldn't make them out. But they had stirred a memory she had thought was hidden deep. One that set her heart racing, brought her breath into her lungs in a sudden gasp, as she struggled with the clenching of her stomach in irrational response.There was no way this visitor could behim,she reproved herself. And there was no reason to panic over nothing. The strain of the past week was getting to her. The shock of Marty's sudden, devastating heart attack. The long, anxious night while he had lain in a coma. At least he hadn't suffered, and he hadn't lived long after that first attack, but all the same it had been a distressing, exhausting time. She wasn't surprised that it was starting to catch up on her. But it had to be just that which was playing tricks on her mind.Peters was coming back. As so many times before this afternoon, he paused in the doorway, clearing his throat slightly.'Mr Angelos Rousakis…' he announced formally and the sound of the name she hadn't even allowed herself to think of hit home like a blow to Jessica's face, making her mind reel in shock.Angelos Rousakis.No!It couldn't be—it just couldn't! She really had to be dreaming. Either that or the confusion of her thoughts had scrambled her brain so that she had got it wrong, hearing the name that was in her mind instead of…The sight of the man who stepped into the doorway, taking Peters's place as the older man moved aside, froze the thoughts in her head, wiping away her ability to think. She could only stand and stare, struggling to reject what she was seeing.There was no reason at all why he should be here. No reason why he should return to the estate that he had left under such a cloud almost seven years before, just about shaking the dirt of the land from his feet as he'd vowed that he would never ever return.But there was no denying the evidence of her eyes. The tall, powerful frame was too strong, too solid to be a figment of her imagination, the black-haired head held arrogantly high, the burning black eyes that swept round the room as if he was looking for something.Or someone.The sting of guilt and anxiety was so sharp that instinctively she shrank away a little, not daring to take a step back in case the movement drew attention to her, but unable still to control the instinctive response. But it seemed that the tiny movement was enough to catch his eye and that searching gaze focused sharply, his dark head turning in her direction as he took in her shaken face, the sudden loss of the colour that she could feel draining from her cheeks.In that moment she felt like nothing so much as a small, cowering field mouse that had been spotted by a circling hawk and was now frozen to the spot, simply waiting for it to pounce.It was as if the seven years since she had last seen him had been stripped away. She was eighteen all over again, burning with the deepest, hottest embarrassment of her life, and hearing a sneering, thickly accented voice saying, cold and clear, 'Don't delude yourself, child. I have no interest in you in that way at all. I don't play with little girls.'After that appalling last night, she had been so glad to know that he had gone, and she'd hoped never to see him again. So what sort of malign fate had brought the man she had once named the Black Angel back into her life at this terrible moment?But there was no way she could ignore the new arrival. He was looking straight at her, that arrogant dark head slightly tilted to one side as if he was waiting for her to make the first move. As was everyone else in the room, she realised, suddenly becoming conscious of the eyes that were turned in her direction. Of course, as Marty's only surviving family member, even if only by marriage, she was the one who had to greet every new arrival, as she had been doing for the past hour or so.Somehow she made herself move forward, stiffening her back, her neck, so that the threatening weakness in her legs didn't show. She was sure that the result was to make her look as if she was marching stiffly like a wooden toy as she crossed the worn gold- and burgundy-coloured carpet, the gathered crowd of friends and neighbours parting like the Red Sea as she moved towards the man in the doorway.And all the way across the room he watched her come. Those dark, dangerous eyes were fixed on her face as she walked towards him, the burning gaze never flickering, the dark concentration so fierce that she almost felt it sear her skin where it landed.What was he doing here? And why would he turn up now— at the worst possible moment?'Don't come back!' In the darkness of her mind she heard her own voice in an echo of the words that she had flung at him. 'Don't ever come back! I never ever want to see you again.'And, 'Don't worry, darling,' he'd said, the tone of the words turning the endearment into the e...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Balancing the tasks of managing staff, working with volunteers, providing services or spiritual assistance, and raising funds is a difficult and often frustrating endeavor. Faith-based organizations also have to operate in the secular world of funding, regulations, marketing, competition, and cash flow. All of these demands can tax even the best managers. Yet amazingly, until now, there were no professional resources geared exclusively to the concerns of leaders and managers of faith-based organizations. The first and only guide of its kind, Faith-Based Management arms you with the knowledge and skills you need to successfully manage your place of worship or faith-based service organization. Drawing upon his many years of experience as a trainer and consultant who has worked with hundreds of organizations nationwide, Peter Brinckerhoff explores the unique demands and common pitfalls that beset faith-based managers. Writing in a congenial, highly accessible style, he identifies the seven major characteristics shared by all successful faith-based organizations and shows you how to assess the strengths and weaknesses of your organization’s management in each category. Using numerous real-world case studies and examples to illustrate his points, he describes proven faith-based management strategies and techniques that you can put to work immediately in your organization. And he provides clear-cut, easy-to-follow guidelines on how to manage for excellence in all crucial areas, including staff recruitment and management, financial stewardship, leadership, marketing, strategic planning, and more. Faith-Based Management is an indispensable hands-on resource for leaders, board members, managers of places of worship, faith-based service organizations, and faith-centered foundations.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When Francesco Zurlo arrives to govern Otranto , he has to deal not only with unfriendly subjects but also with a stubborn son who dreams of fighting the Turks, and his only friend's infatuation with a much younger woman named Idrusa . Idrusa also speaks. The young widow of a fisherman she never loved, she carries on an affair with a Spanish officer under the watchful eyes of her neighbors .

The degree that cognitive processes, emotions, values, personality traits, developmental processes and other psychological variables are related to cultural variables, and questions of heredity vs. environment that have intrigued psychology since its inception, can be studied with cross-cultural methodology. In addition to definitions from all areas of psychology, this dictionary provides a comprehensive list of terms in cross-cultural psychology that will be useful to students as well as experienced researchers in all areas of psychology and social sciences. David Matsumoto, a leader in the field of cross-cultural psychology, is to be congratulated for this comprehensive dictionary and for the selection of editors from throughout the world who contributed to this volume.\"- James Georgas, Past-President, The International Association for Cross-Cultural Psychology\"An impressive achievement. More than its predecessors, The Cambridge Dictionary of Psychology takes into account that the way our psyche works and the way we study it depend on where we were born and raised. The plain language definitions make the book attractive for non-psychologists - it should be at the disposal of other social scientists who want to know what their psychologist colleagues mean, of journalists and other writers, and of any interested lay reader.\"- Geert Hofstede, author of Culture's Consequences\"Kudos to David Matsumoto and his team of 42 academic editors and 117 contributing scholars for this extraordinary work. By drawing from the entirety of psychology, worldwide, The Cambridge Dictionary of Psychology is both monumental and pioneering.\"- David G. Myers, Hope College, author of Psychology, 9th Edition\"The Cambridge Dictionary of Psychology is a thorough, up-to-date compendium of psychology's technical nomenclature. Crafted by an international team of experts, it gets high marks for accuracy and clarity. And consistent with David Matsumoto's great expertise in cross-cultural psychology, it is particularly strong in its coverage of non-Western concepts.\"- Wayne Weiten, University of Nevada, Las Vegas\"...This very comprehensive, interdisciplinary dictionary is notable for its quality and detail and shows the hard work of all those involved. Its definitions cover all areas of psychology from a global perspective that is not always evident in similar works; many of its entries are not found in comparable dictionaries. Its clearly written, easy-to-understand definitions will be beneficial to students and researchers alike... a great addition to any reference collection, including collections that already include the APA Dictionary...

She is disappointed when he heads off to the Jewish section, but it's 1960 in Canada, and that's the way things are. Alexandra and Jacob meet up again when school starts and begin dating, much to the dismay of her parents. They emigrated from Hungary long ago, but aren't willing to talk much of the past, or why they disapprove so much of Jacob. Alexandra begins piecing together clues bit by bit, but the whole truth finally comes out when a childhood friend of her mother appears unexpectedly, and Alexandra, raised Catholic, learns that her family is Jewish. The foreshadowing in this story allows readers to reach the truth long before Alexandra does, but her initial naïveté and later anguish ring completely true for a maturing young girl. Even the cover art of a girl with her hands over her eyes connects delicately on several layers as the story progresses and Alexandra grows up.

Freud innovó en dos campos. Desarrolló simultáneamente por un lado, una teoría de la mente y de la conducta humana, y por otro, una técnica terapéutica para ayudar a personas con afecciones psíquicas. Sus conceptos de inconsciente, deseo inconsciente y represión, fueron revolucionarios; proponen una mente dividida en capas o niveles, dominada en cierta medida por una voluntad primitiva más allá de la esfera consciente y que se manifiesta en producciones tales como chistes, lapsus, actos fallidos, sueños y síntomas.", "related": ["B00FUH1BTW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sometimes I looked at clouds in the blue sky through the window, as if I was occupied with the thought but at the same time it seems there was no thought at all in my mind. I appeared that I rode on those clouds, and followed the author into the time and space of this newly interpreted Chinese Taoist philosophy. The shining edges of the clouds seemed to reflect in colours the author s new angles, new views, and new conclusions. It let me to wander in them, enjoying the depth of the author s thoughts, and meanwhile I was enlightened and inspired. Floating clouds send out profound insights; the star light shows the root of Tao.I think, this book gives a new interpretative system, a unique in the field of Taoist studies. It is not only, as the author points out, an anthropological/psychological view, but also represents a new area and a new method in comparative studies of different cultures. It is a brand new modern interpretation of Chinese traditional culture. Due to his cross-culture life experience and training in natural sciences, he contributes significantly to the research and understanding of Chinese Taoist philosophy, and his creative achievement deserves my admiration.By Dullstone (Zhuoshi), an editor of a Chinese notable magazine, the original article titled Floating Clouds Send Out Profound Insights; the Star Light Shows the Root of Tao is in Chinese.--Publication on the InternetThank you for writing your book, A New Interpretation of Chinese Taoist Philosophy. I would like to write a long detailed letter of what it meant to me. But my eyes of seventy eight years aren t that good even with glasses. I have read some books on Taoism including Workbook for Spiritual Development of All People by Hua-Ching Nie , Thomas Cleary, Eva Wong. They are about Tao Teh Ching. My favourite is by John C. H. Wu. I read a passage a day from it. They were like going to school. Sitting in class is one thing, going outside, another. Not so with your book. Everything made it meaningful......Your insight into primary and secondary society was very interesting to me. .....I don t think you need a new edition but a companion novel or novels would be welcome additions. I would like to tell you how much I enjoyed your book. I still am..... Thank you again, I appreciate your book very much.A reader J.E.--A letter the author received and kept in fileComments by two readers:Your book is a fine change from other recent yearnings about Tao. Thank you for writing it and telling us a little about yourself. I cannot say which part I liked the most but your references to primary and secondary experience of society are valuable.By W.H. J. T.I too believe that Taoism is the most apt life philosophy for the 21st century. However, I believe that it is important to adapt the philosophy to our current level of awareness. While many of the traditional ritualized Taoist practices were appropriate to the Chinese culture during the early rise of Taoism, today we need to develop a \"New Taoism.\" This life practice, while grounded in the wisdom of Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, and other early philosophers must strive to develop and encourage practices that are sympathetic to humanity in the 21st century. While truth is universal and infinite, our experience of that truth is temporal and influenced by the culture and prevailing attitudes of our time. I look forward to visiting you site often.By W. C.--A letter and comments the author received from the readers", "related": ["B004AYCU7I"], "rank": 1686105, "title": "A New Interpretation of Chinese Taoist Philosophy", "author": "You-Sheng Li", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Coles sets in place an intriguing premise: what might take place should the Wizard Merlin need aid and call upon descendants for help, and the author then sets about spinning a tale certain to thrill the most discerning reader. Occupied with tumult, potent ingeniously interwoven plots within a plot, stratagems, snappy dialog, machination and wondrous creatures Merlin-sKinis filled with the elements of a first rate fantasy. Forceful motivations, treachery, friction aptly determined abound against a backdrop of sights and sounds, fragrance and sensation designed to draw the reader straight into the tale.

The book's hero, Barney Kadesh, to preserve his fragile sanity, conjures up Tobacco Brown, the most dangerous Civil War soldier turned cowboy loner since Owen Wister s Virginian. I am most impressed by the accuracy with which the character s psychosis is portrayed, exceedingly rare in any fiction. Stealing what he can from history, the author compels us across moonscapes of characters fully worthy of the early Thomas Pynchon s wacko-realism of V and Gravity's Rainbow. I am known as a tough, even stingy grader of medical description and of narrative fiction. On both, I must give Tobacco Brown nothing less than an A+. ----Lewis R. Baxter, Jr., M.D., Professor of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, University of Florida, Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry and Pharmacology, UCLAAn astonishing work of the imagination, filled with marvelously clever songs, ballads, and parodies of exquisite malevolence. You can hear the music in the language. Its two love stories are, in their turn, sensuous, emotionally wrenching, transcendent. The novel is hysterically funny and unpredictable. I can t wait to read it again! This work should not only be read, it should be taught. Tobacco Brown is a landmark. ----Robert Robin, NovelistThe excellence of Richard Shapiro's storytelling has given us, in Tobacco Brown, a fascinating and purely original work of modern American literature.

This book goes a long way in conceptualizing access to the general education curriculum for students with severe intellectual disabilities and operationalizing it within typical regular class activities. It is a valuable resource for teachers, special educators, parents, and related service providers interested in extending inclusive opportunities for students with severe disabilities.\"(Michael F. Giangreco, Professor 2009-08-13)\"A useful resource for all educational teams who plan for students with moderate and severe intellectual disabilities. In each chapter Downing summarizes current, key research and offers practical applications from her wealth of experience in schools. Readers who are new to planning for students with severe disabilities will find excellent coverage of the basics like systematic instruction, positive behavior support, and collaboration. Professionals with extensive experience will benefit from the new ideas for planning, including specific examples of adapting academic content, considering both family goals and state standards in planning, and using universal design for learning.\"(Diane M. Browder, Snyder Distinguished Professor of Special Education 2009-09-10)\"Anyone who reads this book will benefit from the dedicated career and expertise of June Downing encapsulated in a clear, practical resource.

Segil, president of the Lared Group, an international consulting firm, defines an alliance as \"a relationship that is strategic or tactical... entered into for mutual benefit by two or more parties having compatible or complementary business interests and goals.\" She goes on to explain the various diagnostic tools for verifying and testing potential agreements. Chief among these is her own \"mindshift method,\" for understanding different types of business personalities. An organization, she suggests, must decide where on the \"alliance pyramid\" to focus. Joint marketing and distribution is the simplest agreement; the most complex, a merger or takeover. Each step up requires greater risk, more human resources and higher costs. Knowing the place of partners in the corporate life cycle and their cultures and strategies is critical for creation of a successful arrangement. The author advocates the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis technique and presents a variety of considerations for companies contemplating an international alliance. At times the plethora of procedures here might appear redundant, but considering the high likelihood of failure, managers at both large and small companies could learn much from following the book's prescriptions.

I was in a creative bind, not knowing if I could make any money in this profession.Then I picked up an old book on how to make money as a photographer. It described 25 ways, using 1970's photos.But I got the idea. I realized that there were scores of ways to generate income as a photographer.And most of them required me getting OFF MY BUTT and CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY.Don't read this book as a checklist. Read it as an opportunity to stimulate your imagination. There are hundreds of ways to make money.

She told me of her long battle with drug addiction, and her victory through Jesus Christ. Because I'd been doing prison ministry and had become close to several people with addictions, I was extremely interested in her story. She told me she had written a book and asked me to read it. I don't usually read manuscripts from new writers because I get so many requests and I have so little time. My own writing schedule keeps me under the gun most of the time. However, I took a personal interest in her story because I worked with so many who seem to be fighting a never-ending battle with addictions, and I desperately wanted to see how she had been delivered. She sent me the book in manuscript form and I was struck by her strong sense of humor. The book made me laugh and cry as I saw the struggle of this woman who had so much potential, yet was completely in bondage to the drugs that had taken her over. She tells of how she felt compelled to spend her days digging (literally, with a shovel), looking for buried treasure that she pulled out of the dirt and dragged home. The thought of her junk collection was quite amusing, though it's sadly illustrated how Satan had buried her own potential, hopes and dreams, and those her parents had for her, and replaced them with his version of treasures-things that were filthy and useless and seemed like prizes to her. This is what addiction does. It turns our passions into dangerous obsessions, or potential into a hopeless waste, and our hopes and dreams into buried junk. But praise to God, he doesn't leave them there. When that bondage took Bette to places she didn't want to go, she was finally able to stop digging in the dirt and start digging through God's Word. God was faithful to keep His promise that, you will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart (Jeremiah 29:13). Bette demonstrates that Christ delivers, that he changes lives, and that he is faithful to hold you when you've truly surrendered to Him. I've maintained an e-mail relationship since that time, and her love for the Lord has blessed me. Her changed life and her new attitude are evidence that Christ has the key to unlock the gates of bondage. He is the One who restores the future and recreates dreams. In the Luke 4, Jesus said that he was sent to proclaim release to the captives, recovery of sight to the blind, and to set free those who are oppressed. Bette was one of those captives. She was blind but now she sees. She was oppressed and in bondage, and He set her free. For I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Jeremiah 29:11 -Terri Blackstock, Author of Last Light and Cape Refuge --Foreword (The Book & Bunk 51)--Terri Blackstock/Foreword(The Book & Bunk 51)This amazing life story of Bette Mae cannot be read without tears. It is a heartwarming, true story of a beautiful young woman who was involved in every form of sin, but snapped out of her devilish lifestyle and became a child of God. How? It is a must-read for a person who is still involved in prostitution, drug and alcohol addiction, gangs, extortion, and other sinful activities and wants to change and start a new and wonderful life in Christ -Henry Syn, Author, Evangelist --Back Cover (The Book & Bunk 51)--Henry Syn-- Author, EvangelistCalled to bring radical change and spiritual growth to addicts, Bette has shared her powerful story at women's groups, churches, prisons and been featured on radio broadcasts.

In March 2009 an innocent-looking Facebook post stated \"I've an idea for a book, who wants to help me write it?\" and, after a flurry of posts and emails, Marshall Buckley was born; very soon after, the result (which bears only a passing resemblance to that original idea) was The Long Second. With no publishing experience to speak of (one half of Marshall Buckley is a Sales Executive while the other is an IT Professional), The Long Second was sent out to the world in full confidence of securing an agent and a publisher in a matter of days. By some good fortune, the first was actually achieved, but the second remained elusive. Marshall Buckley now has a full two years' worth of publishing experience but is no closer to understanding the mysteries of the industry.

Most of their thirty year diplomatic career was spent stationed at Embassies throughout Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula.   In 1980, while attending a cocktail party at the Dominican Embassy in Bogota, Diego, who was serving as American Ambassador to Colombia, was captured together with a group of other foreign ambassadors. The terrorists belonged to a politically radical paramilitary organization known as M-19. In a departure from the usual turn of events, the hostages directly participated in the negotiations that eventually set them free. Ambassador Asencio was ultimately awarded the State Department’s Medal for Valor, and became Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs. After his tenure as Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, he was named Ambassador to Brazil at a most poignant moment, when civilian rule returned to that society. The Asencio’s upcoming memoirs, \"The Joys and Perils of Serving Abroad,\" also recounts Diego’s tenure as a member of the US-Moscow Investigating Commission, and as Chairman of the Commission for the Study of International Migration and Cooperative Economic Development. Having decided that there were too many retired ambassadors in Washington looking for interesting things to do, Diego and Nancy moved to Florida, where they have resident children and grandchildren. Governor Lawton Chiles promptly appointed him Executive Director of the Florida International Affairs Commission with a charge to coordiante the State's foreign trade policy. After a couple of arduous years he returned to private life, concentrating on consulting with American firms, including McDonald's and Coca Cola, on their Latin American operations. Nancy spends a great deal of her time reading, writing and painting, her passions in life. They live a few steps from the Intercoastal, across from the town of Palm Beach, with their Portuguese Water Dog Filomena, cat Tinkerbell and cockatiel Blanquita, all three refugees abandoned into their care.", "related": [], "rank": 2540501, "title": "Diplomats and Terrorists - Or: How I Survived a 61-day Cocktail Party", "author": "Diego Asencio", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This simple, but exceptionally easy to understand guide assists interested readers in learning the contents within keys, scales, intervals, chords, and chord extensions. The author provides readers with easily read and understood concepts, a simple layout, formatted pages, and a full introduction to the basics of music. A beginner music learner can easily become comfortable studying Basic Music Theory. The author starts with the very basics of reading and understanding an entire sheet of music, by giving a great explanation of what each particular item is and its purpose. For example: the music staff and everything involved with it; the treble clef, bar line, time signature, double bar lines, and measures. As the reader progresses in studying the book, Joe offers practice exercises with included answers. As the book comes to an end, the author provides readers with advice on how to play the measures with exercises specifically for different kinds of instruments.Not having much knowledge and understanding of music theory and structure prior to reading this book, I can confidently state I grasped the concepts being introduced, and gained exceptional knowledge on how to properly build scales, and learned the names for intervals and chords, and how they relate to one another. Joe Procopio has created a wonderful book chock full of valuable study information for anyone interested in learning about music, music theory, and music structure.", "related": [], "rank": 983690, "title": "Basic Music Theory", "author": "Joe Procopio", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After the First World War, however, he gave up legal work in favor of writing full time. He went on to complete some thirty books ranging from light-hearted farce to adventure thrillers. The Berry series established Yates’ reputation as a writer of witty, upper-crust romances, and he was also very successful with the thriller genre though the character Richard Chandos. As a consequence of his education and experience, Yates’ books encompass the genteel life—a nostalgic glimpse at Edwardian decadence and a number of swindling solicitors, and he regularly featured in bestseller lists and was greatly admired by both readers and fellow authors.", "related": ["B00EXRFLBO"], "rank": 1933529, "title": "The Berry Scene (B-Berry Pleydell)", "author": "Dornford Yates", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Among the botanical and anthropological observations, one catches glimpses of Sacks's inner life: his preoccupation with dualities, his nearly Victorian sense of modesty, his fascination with the world around him.\" —The New Yorker \"Like all the best journals, it has a rich immediacy, a sense that we share the moment of the author’s perceptions. Since Sacks is such a lovely writer, and he and his fellow travelers such fonts of knowledge about everything from Mexican history to Mayan culture to chocolate making to the workings of fern evolution, the book is a rare treat. . . . It makes you want to strap on your field glasses and catch the first flight south.\" –The Globe and Mail “Relaxed yet observant. . . . [Sacks’] thoughtful, sometimes wistful ruminations, no matter how expansive they may grow, are always rooted in the concrete details he has observed. . . . Those who read Oaxaca Journal will appreciate Sacks’ own diligence as an observer and his skill in translating the wonders of the material world into words.” —Los Angeles Times \"Oaxaca Journal whipped up my appetite for a visit to Mexico, as the best travel writing does.\" —The Providence Journal “The combination of his insatiable curiosity and rigorous scientific observation makes him an excellent travelling companion. . . . Mexico past and present emerges from these bursts of association and digression. . . . With so much of the world made superficially familiar by tourism, Oliver Sacks’s dogged pursuit of the exotic is especially welcome.

Steven Gregory not only talks about fairy tales we grew up with in the Western world, but also introduces us to interesting tales from other continents, e.g. Africa and Asia. I would recommend this book to everybody who enjoys fairy tales and who would like to learn more about how they are a mirror of real life and what lessons we can learn from them - from how you can turn being different into an advantage, and how you can win even if you are weaker and slower than your opponents.

Her hope is that, while reading this child of her imagination, you will agree in the importance of truth, realizing that to stray from truth brings unnecessary pain and, potentially, danger. The other key feature she finds to be essential in a book (or in a friend) is a sense of humor-laughter is not only good medicine but also a calorie burner! Finally, it is a pleasure for her to share her story with you, and she hopes it brings as much enjoyment to you in the reading as it did to her in the writing. Mandy is a nurse currently serving in the United States Navy, and none of her characters or ideas represent the navy or its members. While her permanent residence is listed as South Carolina, she resides wherever the navy sends her. In her own words, it is an honor and a privilege to serve her fellow soldiers, their families, and all of this great country, and her only request is that you pray for those who serve and for those who send their loved ones to serve so selflessly in this time of war.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However, while following the laws seemed to work quite well for me, nearly all of my friends were continuing to struggle to achieve bigger and better things in their lives. When they began to ask me how I am able to get whatever I set my mind to, it became clear that what I perceived as common sense was not only foreign to them, but was simply not mentioned in many of the law of attraction texts they had read. If it had been, it was presented in such a cryptic and intangible way that it was either overlooked or misunderstood.This was the main reason that I wroteReset Your Mindset. If my friends had missed these crucial points after all their studies, then surely other people who struggle to get ahead could benefit from this knowledge. The information presented in this book has made all the difference to so many people's lives.

Pines is a good friend to his friends and a dangerous opponent to  his enemies and when Muhammad appeals to Harry for help with a wrongly  accused friend it he is ready to help. The accused man has been found  unconscious in a locked room, sprawled on top of a model dead from  gunshot wounds and it's looking bad for him – but he insists he's  innocent. Harry begins to dig and it doesn't take long before the case  against his client begins to unravel and the violence begins.This is the second novel to feature Harry Pines (the first beingAn Ice Cold Paradise)  but already Holland has his character down , an almost old-school hero  of the Fleming mould, charming, witty, a magnet to beautiful women,  fortunately leavened with a healthy dose of wit, irony and a more modern  sensibility (he loves that cooking!) more Travis McGee than James Bond  perhaps.From the Victorian-style conceit of the locked room  crime to the careful pacing of the narrative you know that you're in the  presence of a masterful and confident storyteller, in full control of  his material, putting together an entirely satisfying thriller. Holland  doesn't mistake complex characterisation with complex writing. He keeps  the writing simple and pushes the story along. This is unapologetically  good storytelling.Which raises the question. Why is Terry Holland  self-publishing? Why isn't one of the big publishing houses running  with this series? The answer could be the hapless state of crime fiction  publishing in the US and the UK. It is now so hard to find a publisher  that is prepared to take on a new author and have the wherewithal to  push and promote that writer to the point where the whole exercise  becomes profitable. Publishers are rightly nervous of their profits but  it can be almost impossible to get that first break. On the other hand  it may be something to do with the changing face of contemporary  publishing and the new direct-to-market opportunities opening up for new  writers.Fortunately Holland himself gives some insight into his choice to self-publish. In an author's note he says:\"You  may have noticed that I published this book. As the industry has  evolved in the digital age, there simply is no other choice. Any other  form of publishing is like throwing money on the ground\" and elsewhere  he has written:  \"It's about control and profit. If I have more of the  first I gain more of the second.\"And in many ways he's right.  With the rise and rise of ebooks the publishing industry is undergoing  convulsions and one of the possible benefits of that is the emergence of  the valid self-published work. In the old order self-publishing was  synonymous with vanity publishing and the refuge of the half-literate  and the deluded. Agents and publishing house editorial staff were the  gatekeepers of quality, resisting the never-ending flood of  unpublishable nonsense, but as market conditions became tougher it was a  system that could also on occasion frustrate writers with potential but  without the immediate prospect of taking a large market share. Now the  prospective writer can, through the medium of ebooks and affordable  print-to-order systems, enter a market directly, without the mediation  of a publishing house, and offer their work in affordable digital and  hard copy versions.Terry Holland is a shining example of how  contemporary self-publishing should function. Notably he credits JT  Lindroos as editor, which is a clear indication that he has enough  perspective to realise the value of getting a more objective,  professional viewpoint before going in to print. And the book itself is  as professionally designed and produced as anything you would find from a  mainstream publishing house.  All told, Terry Holland has done a damn  good job. This is assured writing and great storytelling, an entirely  engaging mix of violence, sex, chicanery and cooking. Now all he needs  is a massive marketing budget to bring it to the attention of the  book-buying public!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

From New Orleans, Louisiana, Jesse is anointed by God with a unique preaching ministry that melts even the hardest heart with hilarious illustrations and strong biblical preaching. Having been in full-time evangelistic ministry since 1978, Jesse's primary goal is to spread the Gospel. He has become a popular guest speaker at church meetings, conventions, seminars, Bible colleges and Christian television programs across America. His anointed sermons point sinners to Calvary and motivate Christians to exercise their authority over the devil by realizing their position in Christ. Jesse believes that Christianity is not just something you talk about on Sunday; it is a day-to-day fellowship with the Lord Jesus. It is this close fellowship with Jesus that makes the impossible suddenly possible. Today, Jesse's entire life is devoted to reaching the lost as well as strengthening the Christian in their daily walk with Christ. Jesse's weekly thirty-minute television program has touched millions of lives through secular and Christian television with the Gospel of Jesus. His program can be seen weekly on Trinity Broadcasting Network and other stations worldwide. Through anointed biblical preaching, Jesse is bringing God's message of hope to our generation. A message that cuts through all denominational barriers, transcends human hypocrisy and frailty, and reaches the heart of mankind.", "related": ["B00EUQTTLG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As we delved farther into the book we learn about our inner voice. Too often we deny or ignore that voice as it attempts to direct us. A large part of changing is learning to let go of the past. If we hold on to past hurts we will stay miserable. Many are willing to place blame on fate rather than their own decisions. The author's purpose in writing this book is to assist the reader in \"evolution\" or change. He wants to see others grow, mature, develop and progress. He points out that evil and negative thoughts often come up in situations of love, such as if you love someone and they do not return that love. In Chapter 11 Rajappan discusses the effect negative emotions have on our health. From personal experience I can attest that he is correct in his assessment. A person can become physically ill from depression, jealousy, and hatred.\"The Illuminator\" is a small book with only 50 pages. The information that lies inside shows influence from the author's culture. While the author and I do not agree on everything, I do see great wisdom in this book. \"The Illuminator\" is written much like a work book. The end has space for recording coincidences. At the end of each chapter the reader will discover a rule that will assist in a journey towards change.

That single sentence when fully understood and experienced changes everything.We are on the crest of a new wave of consciousness in which millions of people throughout the world are waking up to their deeper nature and in doing so experiencing reality not in terms of discrete separate objects, but as an energy filled wholeness in which we are inseparably interwoven and interconnected.Our universe is alive and pregnant with love and light, yet so few of us experience it as such. As a medical doctor who has dedicated my life to helping others realise their potential I have come to appreciate that to be truly healthy, happy and whole we need to work with the universe and work with the laws of the universe. One of those laws is this - to experience vibrant health, to heal and to wake up to our deeper self we need energy to flow harmoniously within us, we need to open our body, mind and soul to the flow of the universe.Resistance to that flow creates suffering, a sense of separation and energetic stagnation the precursor state to ill-health and fatigue. Restoring flow as any energy-trained practitioner will tell you - is an integral part of the solution, as is learning how to befriend reality, welcome and work with our emotions and live with honesty, balance and humility.In this respect EmoTrance represents one of the simplest and most effective self-help ways to restore the flow of energy through our body-mind. I have used it personally and professionally for quite a few years now and I keep returning to it because it works for me.In this book you are going to be taking a journey into the wonderful, magical and enlightening world of energy and EmoTrance by its creator Silvia Hartmann. You are in safe hands. My tip for you is simply to be open-minded and above all else to use EmoTrance consistently that way you will discover its considerable benefits.Peace and BlessingsDr Mark AtkinsonDr Mark Atkinson is a medical doctor, founder of the Academy of Human Potential and Author of True Happiness--dragonrising.comFrom my first taste of EmoTrance through Oceans of Energy to Energy Magic and on to the extensions of Energy Dancing and Beauty-T, Silvia has had me hooked! As I read Oceans of Energy for the very first time in 2008 in a busy, crowded cafeteria those surrounding me thought that I was a mad woman as I exclaimed outloud things like \"this is fantastic\", \"holy s**t!\" and \"she's a genius!\".Silvia has been my hero since reading the first sentence. I am sad to hear that she will retire Oceans of Energy, but happy to hear that it is only because she has expanded on it. This latest venture, \"EmoTrance: Emotions, Energy, Information and Love\" goes beyond her previous work. This new book is so easy, so comprehensive and actually fun to read. Including a section for EmoTrance Exercises was a fantastic idea. I absolutely love the Relationship Game. I will recommend it to everyone! I will say it again, \"Silvia rocks!\"Patricia DancingElk,EmoTrance Master Trainer--dragonrising.comEmoTrance - Transforming Emotions is a MUST read for all who have any interest in EmoTrance.Beginners will find it an excellent introduction to the art and science of EmoTrance and a great way to learn it. Already the beginning, an explanation of human emotions, is a great way into the subject. Very accessible, concise and perspicuous.Experienced EmoTrance folk will find it a refreshing read and reminder. Especially in \"EmoTrance A-Z\" there are numerous insights and ahas to be found - like for instance the fresh and instructive presentation in the chapter on anger.I find an extraordinary flow to be in the writing that makes it easy to read and follow along - very smooth and at the same time very stringent, very logical, and very inspiring.Highly recommended.Detlev TeschCoach & Master EmoTrance Trainer, Germany--dragonrising.com", "related": ["B00CICSW44"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As her 21st was approaching, she came home and opened her own model agency, Portfolio Model Agency Ltd which became the top model agency in Christchurch. As the director of the model agency she produced many events, modeling competitions and fashion shows throughout the South Island - The Bendon Model of The South Competition and many more events. At 27 Ms. Stone sold Portfolio Model Agency Ltd to start her family. She then started working as a fashion stylist under Angela Stone Consulting Ltd.

More and more hunters are\nlearning better ways to find, grow and take white-tailed deer to provide better\nopportunities to take that buck of your dreams. ·Most\nsuccessful bowhunters scout year-round, not only on foot but by using trail\ncameras.·Today\nhunters have better green field plantings, mineral licks, deer lures, optics,\ncalls, bows, arrows, broadheads, sights and many-more hunting aids than ever\npreviously.·Wildlife\nresearchers continue to learn new information about white-tailed deer that can\nbe passed-on to hunters to create more-successful bowhunting experiences.·Genetic\nengineering is now able to produce bucks with antlers that will score 150 or\nmore on Boone & Crockett in 2 years.·Deer-management\npractices have shown us how to better manage the deer on the properties we hunt\nand produce more and bigger bucks.·The\nbows produced by PSE have gotten faster, smoother and more-forgiving and have\nbecome much-better tools to harvest deer.·The\nlearning curve for becoming a bowhunter also has changed dramatically. Only a\nfew years ago, we told beginning bowhunters they'd need to spend several months\nlearning to shoot accurately to be proficient enough to hunt. But with modern\nPSE bows, a person who's never pulled a bow can be shooting that bow accurately\nwithin 45 minutes. If he or she practices for a month, he often can be\nproficient enough to go into the woods and take a deer. As\nresearch, technology and equipment continue to bring more knowledge to the\nbowhunter, PSE wants to be on the leading edge of delivering this information\nto the world of bowhunting.", "related": [], "rank": 1592785, "title": "Bowhunting Deer", "author": "John E.

It is covered with Ironwood Trees, Palo Verde Trees, Barrel Cacti, Sage, Creosote bushes, and many other plants, along with large rocks and boulders that the local animals and birds use to burrow under, hide by and take shade under from the hot Arizona summer sun. Laura started photographing some of the animals who came to her yard, and soon, she was writing parts of this book to narrate the photos. She hopes that you enjoy the book, and she can be contacted at LLROOT@COX.NET!

Joan Graziano, who founded the all-volunteer Dunbar Community Library in 1992 and helped found the Dunbar Historical Society in 1995. Her financial support helped the society purchase the education center in 2006.\"Dunbar\" contains hundreds of photographs, many from private collections and never seen publicly, documenting Dunbar's development, from a drawing by Bill Rockwell of Dunbar Furnace as it appeared in 1854 to the Sheepskin Trail, officially opened in 2008 and the Dunbar Community Fest, started in 2002.In between, \"Dunbar\" traces business and industry, town scenes, tragedies, transportation, local folks and colorful characters, patriotism and faith, schools and organizations, pastimes and community pride and Dunbar today.Initially called Frogtown, Dunbar was settled in the 1790s and incorporated in 1883. The town's name honors Col. Thomas Dunbar, who led the 48th Regiment of Foot in the French and Indian War. He died in 1777.Industry came early to Dunbar. Iron master Isaac Meason started his first Union Furnace in 1791. Other furnaces established Dunbar as an iron-making center and kept the town prosperous through the next century.Dunbar contributed to the tremendous industry in the Connellsville coke region, vital to Pittsburgh steel. In 1895, 50 Semet-Solvay by-product coke ovens, which captured coal tar, ammonia, gas and light oil from the coal-baking process, were built by the Dunbar Furnace Company.Photos document the Dunbar Furnace Company, Semet-Solvay and the Pennsylvania Wire Glass Company and their employees, as well as other industries in Dunbar.Dunbar has known its share of tragedies, including an explosion in 1890 at the Hill Farm Mine that killed 31. Severe floods occurred in 1907, 1912, and 1954.Railroads and trolleys once rolled through Dunbar. Among the photos is a young boy stopping his bicycle to let the Brick Hill trolley pass.Photos of notable and colorful citizens make up the most fascinating part of the book.\"Snake Lady\" Ellen Smitley kept snakes, monkeys and rats as pets. She sits holding and surrounded by snakes. Chef Harold \"Baron\" Galand began cooking at 13 at the Lazy Hour Ranch and later became coach of the United States Culinary Olympic Team. Sen. J. William Lincoln was born in Dunbar and served in the Senate for 16 years. Sullivan D'Amico founded Pechin Shopping Village and quietly helped the community. Betty Knox was a legendary 19th century character who hauled grain on an ox to a grist mill, taking the same route daily, until she failed to appear in 1878. The skeleton of her ox was discovered in 1879; her body was never found. Irishtown resident Robert Melvin Martin drew a picture of Betty Knox based on an oral history.Dunbar residents have fought in every conflict since the Revolutionary War. An Honor Roll at the former Fairview School celebrates their service. Photos depict service members, parades, former Mayor Angie Graziano, churches and their congregations.No schools remain in Dunbar, but photos of the buildings, students and teachers preserve their history. Photos show the early years of civic organizations like the American Legion and Cub and Boy Scouts.\"Dunbar\" documents past celebrations like Old Home Week, sports teams and today's Dunbar Community Fest.Dunbar Historical Society Secretary Donna Myers said the society worked together to create this labor of love. \"We had a committee, different people contributed historical information. I wrote the introduction,\" she said. \"We didn't start this until the middle of February. We had it done by the end of April.\"We're very pleased by it,\" she continued. \"We were doing the (replica) coke oven and the book at the same time.\"Myers said the society has had information about Arcadia for several years, but until they established the education center, there was no space to organize the book.\"When we started with the building in 2006, the things we had were spread around at people's houses. We have 65 albums and I have another 5 or 6 that aren't done. The picture collection expanded and the book became more of a possibility because we had so many pictures.\"We're pleased with what we've been able to accomplish; we've got a lot of help. We've been lucky. Every time we have a need, it seems to get met,\" she said.Although a unique community in its own right, Myers called \"Dunbar one piece of the Fayette County puzzle.\"Members of the Historical Society will be selling the book at Saturday's Coal and Coke Heritage Music Festival, at Penn State Fayette, The Eberly Campus. They will sell the book near the Coal and Coke Heritage Center, which is at the library. Visitors can view a looping slide presentation of the replica coke oven project in downtown Dunbar.The society will sell the book at its education center in downtown Dunbar beginning at 10 a.m. at the Dunbar Community Fest on Sept. 26.

I literally started the book at\n10pm and did not put it down until 4 in the morning.I really\nhate engineering texts that are re-dressed into novel format. Luckily,\nthis book is not one of them. There is just enough engineering to\nprovide the needed framework for the story.I'm looking forward to the next installment.\"", "related": ["B00FC1JT86"], "rank": 1923982, "title": "Inherit the Sea", "author": "Studio Dongo", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He resists murdering both, and is determined to make a better life for himself. He soon gets himself involved in a business relationship with a rich man from Phoenix and fixing up an abandoned mountain ranch to resell. Dusty writes about the challenging life of a ranch owner after the war in a quickly changing Arizona. He writes about the movie industry finding their way to the mountainous area where they film the new rage, western movies. Between ranching, rodeoing and hanging with Hollywood starlets, Blue Roan Colt is a story you can't put down. It's Dusty Richards at his finest.

Jeff lacks focus.  He always seems to be daydreaming.   I cannot fault her on the assessment she had me pegged.  My mind was forever wandering to what was happening at the neighboring desk or outside, or much further beyond.  This character flaw followed me through my life. About two years ago, I was getting ready to turn in for the night.  It was late and I had to be up early for work the next morning.  After I clicked the television off, I found myself just staring at the blank screen. I could either spend years thinking about creating a story of my own and never knowing if I could, or I could sit down, begin to type, and see if I had it in me to create something.  I made a decision.  I sat down, that very night, and began to write.  For five months, I typed as often as I could, using up every spare moment I could find. Then I began my second book, then my third.  I think my technique improved to the point where my stories are interesting and readable, but I will leave that to the reader to decide.  Eventually I stumbled on Henry Pride. I say stumbled on him because he popped into my mind one day while driving home.  His face appeared in my mind and I knew I had to write Henry Pride.  I put aside what I was working on at the time and spent all of my energy developing Henry.  What he looked like, how he sounded, thought, felt, and how he would behave.  When I understood him, I turned him loose, followed behind him, and wrote down what he did.  I felt like nothing more than Henry's biographer.  I had no idea where the story would take me and often would be surprised at what happened. Writing has brought back that little grade four student who was always staring out the window but now, I have focus.  I write because I need to, it's who I am.  If my stories become popular that would be welcomed but I will continue regardless, even if only a few read them. My second book, Simon Fink will be published later in 2013.   One other quote has always stuck with me over the years...   “I write one page of masterpiece to ninety-one pages of shit. I try to put the shit in the wastebasket.” Ernest Hemingway   If an author such as Hemingway struggled to find the words, I can live with my own difficulties.   I will continue searching for my single pages, even though my wastebasket overflows.", "related": [], "rank": 4009080, "title": "Henry Pride", "author": "Jeffery David Paradis", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His father was a Methodist minister and his grandfather, a Professor of Agriculture. David, however, began his career with a degree in Agriculture at Durham University, England. With a newly acquired  farm in Scotland, David was surprised when God intervened and led him to become a Christian minister. After completing an MA in Theology at Cambridge University, David became a chaplain in the Royal Air Force for three years. He then moved on to pastor a number of churches in England including the Millmead Centre in Guildford where under David’s caring leadership, the church became a model for many UK church pastors. His time at Millmead was also his most fruitful in terms  of the library of his audio teachings. In 1979 David was released from the Millmead Centre to fulﬁll a wider international ministry. David now has an itinerant ministry predominantly to church leaders world wide. Millions of copies of his audio Bible teachings have been distributed to  over 120 countries. He is a writer and speaker of urgency, clarity and uncompromising faithfulness to the Scriptures. He is widely considered to be  one of the world’s ﬁnest biblical expositors.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Yet, what Oliver Payne shows, is how intelligent small changes that often ask little or nothing of people can be hugely effective even in the face of a global problem. This creative engagement with human understanding will change your mind and might just save the planet\" – Nick Southgate, Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, Behavioural Economics Consultant\"The most passionate and articulate hymn to sustainability since ‘An inconvenient Truth’\" –Mark Wnek, Advertising Professional and green entrepreneur\"Oliver Payne’s book is an eminently accessible guide to understanding people's behaviour and what you can do to influence them to change it.  Along the way you will discover that what people say they think can’t be separated from how they think, why context is crucial and that experimentation beats asking.  Beyond its importance to the topic of sustainability, whatever the concept or product, you will sell it more effectively once you have read this book\" –Philip Graves, author of Consumer.ology\"What strikes me most about Inspiring Sustainable Behaviour is how Oliver Payne masterfully brings together insights from a wide range of psychological research, weaving them into a coherent guide for communications for change. The book is both pragmatic and inspirational, shot through with powerful stories yet relevant to everyday practice\" –Dan Lockton, Warwick Manufacturing Group, University of Warwick, and author of Design with Intent: 101 Patterns for Influencing Behaviour Through Design.\"Changing our own behaviour is hard enough. Changing other people's is more difficult still. But the task has been made worse by some spectacularly wrongheaded assumptions about human behaviour which have infected business and government decision-making; in particular the idea that people are hyper-rational, endlessly cogitating individuals who make optimal choices regardless of how and when those choices are presented. If you want to join the fight against this insane, mechanistic view of human nature, you will find Oliver's book an essential and often-used part of your armoury\" –Rory Sutherland, Vice Chairman Ogilvy & Mather UK, author of The Wiki Man\"Nudging can be used for good or for evil. For far too long, the evil-doers have known about the tools for influencing behavior. Thanks to efforts like Oliver Payne's, that is all changing.

It always has.  Or maybe she's just a trouble magnet.   Like the time she taught all the kids in her kindergarten class how to lock the bathroom stalls and slide out underneath. Or when she became the first kindergartner in the school's history to get suspended, after starting a glue war to the tune of one carpet, ten emergency haircuts, fifteen shirts, three pants, and two pairs of sneakers.  Or was it three pairs of sneakers? Anyway, ten years later she came up with the bright idea to use her father's street motorcycle like a dirtbike and crashed it while attempting a spectacular jump over two logs, a lawn chair, her brother, and the family St. Bernard.  Brutus survived.  Her brother still has nightmares. The motorcycle was DOA.  Day, only slightly bent, spindled, and mutilated, spent most of that year grounded. Then there were all the times she wrecked the family car.  Her parents were not amused. The insurance adjuster was. Eventually, he started answering the phone, \"So, what's she done now?\" Nowadays, Day loves fostering dogs for the SPCA and playing The Sims 3 obsessively. Day also writes with equal obsession, and loves to play god with the fabulous characters and settings she creates, all within the confines of her computer world, of course.  Or so she claims! USA Today bestselling author, Day Leclaire is the author of more than 60 novels and is a three-time winner of both The Colorado Award of Excellence and The Golden Quill Award.  She's won Romantic Times magazine's Career Achievement, and Love and Laughter awards, the Holt Medallion, the Booksellers Best Award, and has received an impressive eleven nominations for the romance industry's most prestigious award, Romance Writers of America RITA Award.  Day writes romances which touch the heart and make you care about her characters as much as she does.

Yani knew she would be a writer at a young age. Starting with short versions of her own Tom & Jerry stories at only 5, Yani put her skill and talent to use in her grade school classes by writing other short stories to entertain her teachers and peers. Poetry became an interest to her at the age of 13 when she discovered her ability to free-style lyrical flows. Her first poem \"Incomplete Dream\" was published in University City's High School newspaper, but her rise to small fame in the school came after performing one of her best poetic pieces during a high school talent show, being the only student to receive a standing ovation. Her poem \"Why Tyrone Can't Read\" is still remembered by students and staff who run into her almost 13 years later. Yani has performed her poetry on the local hip-hop and R&B; radio station Power 99FM, and other open-mic nights throughout Philadelphia. Though her ability to combine rhymes and metaphors together comes easily, her desire to become a published novelist was stronger than anything else. She wrote A Thug's Redemption at the age of 15 and immediately began looking for a publishing company to sign her on after high-school. After numerous rejections, Yani was picked up by \"Publish America\" in 2007. Deciding that she would rather be self-published and develop a publishing company of her own, she purchased her rights back to A Thug's Redemption, and began making moves to become a self-published author. Though it has taken almost 13 years to get her first novel on the shelves of bookstores, finally the dream is being realized. A Thug's Redemption is now available for purchase. Yani now resides in the West Oak-Lane section of Philadelphia with her 2 children and still writes daily. She is also in school to become a Registered Nurse and enjoys reading, graphic design, playing the piano, and listening to music.", "related": ["B00GX6Q1XK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.75, "rating_total": 38.0}

This story is about survival, but it's also about human nature.  When the unimaginable happens, we are going to have to learn to get along with people who won't always agree with us. There won't be many survivors, so the new society will resemble the small town atmosphere that was common 100 years ago. Everyone will know everyone else, and we will all be dependent on each other to some degree. \"Mike\", the main character, starts out stubbornly independent but comes to realize that being a loner isn't a very good lifestyle.  Readers might wonder why the characters don't have last names, or why I didn't go into much detail about their physical features. It wasn't an oversight. I didn't want to give away anything that would indicate their race or nationality, so the reader will have to judge the characters by theiractions, not by what they look like or where their ancestors came from. They are all members of the same race - the Human Race. I think that attitude is going to be very important if we are going to survive. Maybe we shouldn't wait until then to start thinking that way.", "related": ["B00L826G5W"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 2.8, "rating_total": 14.0}

My name is Devon Wilcox and I am an entrepreneur, life coach and father. I'm also the author of several personal finance, money management and wealth acquisition books. Thank you for checking out my stuff. Here is a little more about me: As far back as I can remember, I've always had a drive within me to make money; starting from a small scale landscaping business I began when I was 14 to owning multiple franchise locations by the time I was 33. I've been motivated my whole life to never allow myself to be a part of the \"rat race\" and spend day after day stuck in a 9-5 job that I simply did not care about. When I was 18 years old, I had a crystallizing moment where I looked in the mirror and promised to myself that I would always be in control of my financial life and never be a slave to a paycheck. I have since kept that promise and today can proudly say that I have zero debt, a positive balance sheet and a happy, stress-free life. Many of the methods I have implemented to accumulate my wealth are often viewed as \"non-conventional\" and \"unsustainable.\" I'm here to tell you that those are simply the statements of non-believers, of lazy people, of sheep. The truth is that there are several methods to generate income, both passively and actively, that do not involve waking up and going to a job you hate every day. Surprising, right? Unfortunately, most people settle and choose to live paycheck to paycheck, constantly moments away from a financial meltdown, never attempting to create long-term wealth. My goal is simple; share with you the numerous proven methods that I, and the hundreds of individuals I have coached, have used to achieve financial freedom. I promise that my books will open your eyes to new ways to make money that have never crossed your mind previously. Your determination, along with the step-by-step guides provided in my books, will be your blueprint to a life free of debt and full of wealth. Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life. Devin Wilcox currently resides in Colorado with his girlfriend and his dog Max.

Reign of the Black Flame: The Waterglobe by B.B. Vayk is one of those gems. It is the story of Robert Ground, whose father gets killed by Fire - one of the elemental powers on the planet. Robert, who so far has been more or less a careless young man, is forced to become a different man. And he wants to know why Fire killed his father, and how the earlier death of his mother is involved in this, too. On his journey, he encounters Marian, whom he finds quite charming. Yet he does not know that she holds a dark and dangerous secret. She's out to kill him; she's also one of the most loyal servants of Fire. But will she change her mind about Robert? And what happens when Robert becomes involved in the war between the elements that started because Fire stole the Waterglobe?I am not a young adult anymore, but from experience I learned that books like Reign of the Black Flame: The Waterglobe by B.B. Vayk aren't just for young adults, but also for the young at heart and the people who still believe in magic - that really doesn't depend on your age. I found the story around the different elements, their war against each other, and how Robert and Marian fit into the whole picture exciting and enchanting at the same time. The words of the book draw you into the story and it's very easy to forget the \"real\" world around you. It's just the kind of book you need to take a break from reality. It's a fantastic read, and I hope for more from B.B. Vayk.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In addition to attaining a formal education in the classroom, she traveled extensively, getting a “real-world” education. Before the age of twenty, Cortney had lived in Australia and Argentina and traveled throughout Central America, South America, Russia, Scandinavia, and Western Europe. Exposed to a diversity of cultures and lifestyles from an early age, she was intrigued by the ways cultural and environmental conditions affected the psychological well-being of individuals, groups, and even entire societies. Her interest in psychology and issues of cultural diversity took academic shape as an undergraduate at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. Under the exceptional mentorship of Drs. Jaine Strauss (Macalester College) and Nancy C. Raymond (University of Minnesota), Cortney developed a strong interest in the cultural components of eating disorders, and undertook supporting research and clinical activities. After graduating magna cum laude from Macalester, Cortney entered the doctoral program in clinical psychology at Texas A&M; University to work under the mentorship of Drs. David H. Gleaves and Antonio Cepeda-Benito, who specialize in cross-cultural and linguistic issues in the assessment and treatment of eating disorders. From there, she completed her predoctoral clinical internship at McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School and joined the faculty at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) in 2006. Through her formal and informal learning experiences, Cortney saw the ways in which we lie to ourselves on a daily basis and the danger that it posed to our emotional well-being. Helping people understand themselves and see their own self-deception became a fundamental part of her clinical practice, research, teaching, and personal way of life.  Although Cortney received tenure at UNLV in 2012, she formally retired from academia in 2014 to pursue a career that would allow her more time with her family and more interaction with the general public. As Cortney moves into a new phase of her career, she hopes to use psychological research and clinical observations to help the public live more fulfilling lives by confronting their self-deception.

Other reviewers had this to say: \"The case in Night Shadows develops with structural underpinnings and plot machinations so advanced even the most savvy of mystery readers will 'raise an eyebrow' to the skill used by Cohen.\" -Gary Sorkin for Pacific Book Review. \"In Night Shadows, Cohen skillfully combines a unique creative imagination with a keen sense of investigative reporting, knowledge of police procedures, and an intuitive understanding of human nature...to draw the reader into the story.\" -Richard Blake for Reader Views. \"I cannot remember a time in the past decade when I picked up a mystery/thriller and was so surprised.\" -Russell D. James for Hollywood Book Review. \"As a lawyer, it's always been disconcerting how Cohen sets himself up as judge, jury, and executioner, but I know his readers absolutely relish the idea.\" -Kerry Donahue, Esq. \"This novel, ripped from the headlines, should serve as a wakeup call to what increasingly appears to be an epidemic of child abuse, teenage rape, and teen suicide.\" -Susan Violante, Author of Innocent War: Behind An Immigrant's Past, italianaustinite.com, blogtalkradio.com/vioradio.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
