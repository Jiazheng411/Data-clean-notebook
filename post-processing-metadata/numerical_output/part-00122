Buddy LeBlanc was born in the Louisiana bayou, where magnetic storms disrupt the effects of gravity and force people to anchor themselves to the earth with Velcro. As he grows up, things only get stranger, and matters come to a head when a sprawling conglomerate announces that it has bought out the bankrupt U.S. government. Totalitarian changes begin immediately, forcing Buddy—who has a gift for performing minor miracles and has been touring with the circus—to join up with his brilliant love interest, journalist Rhonda Jefferson, and a band of ragtag malcontents know as the Dreamers to organize epic protests. Murphy's political and social satire consistently hits its targets, but his storytelling is often disorganized and chaotic—he introduces extraneous characters and convoluted, unnecessary subplots at a frenzied pace and gets bogged down in some lackluster side plots involving Buddy's family. This could have been a brilliant novel with more narrative focus, but the lack of a solid story line makes it more of a cult curio.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In his introduction, Palau distinguishes between his titular \"pictures\" and \"portraits\" by explaining that some of the vignettes are more like pictures, or snapshots, of God's concern with \"short-term details,\" while others are portraits that demonstrate God's work in someone's life over a long period of time. Despite this distinction, each chapter is no more than four pages long, regardless of its scope. The brevity of these stories, as well as their feel-good subject matter (i.e., the much-needed check that appears in the mail, the mysterious stranger who disappears after doing a good deed, the urge to pray for someone at what turns out to be a moment of peril, etc.), makes this book palatable reading for those with the shortest of attention spans. Moreover, despite the author's unabashed evangelicalism he often focuses on born-again experiences and distinguishes between the saved and the hellbound his warm, folksy tone will probably appeal to nonevangelical readers. Sophisticated readers of all theological persuasions might suspect that Palau has taken liberties with these stories, perhaps even blurring the line between the truth and urban legend. Nevertheless, there is no reason to doubt his earnest desire to relay to a wide audience the amazing stories people have told him through the years. He does this very well, and even the most cynical reader will likely be moved.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Krispos opened one eye. It was still dark. It felt like the middle of the night. He shook his head. He did not like noise that woke him up when he should have been asleep. He closed the eye and snuggled down between his mother and father on the straw palliasse he and they and his little sister used for a bed.His parents woke, too, just when he was trying to go back to sleep. Krispos felt their bodies stiffen on either side of him. His sister Evdokia slept on. Some people have all the luck, he thought, though he’d never thought of Evdokia as particularly lucky before. Not only was she three—half his age—she was a girl.The shouts turned to screams. One of the screams had words: “The Kubratoi! The Kubratoi are in the village!”His mother gasped. “Phos save us!” she said, her voice almost as shrill as the cries of terror in the darkness outside.“The good god saves through what people do,” his father said. The farmer sprang to his feet. That woke Evdokia, where nothing else had. She started to cry. “Keep her quiet, Tatze!” Krispos’ father growled. His mother cuddled Evdokia, softly crooned to her.Krispos wondered whether he’d get cuddled if he started crying. He thought he’d be more likely to get his father’s hand on his backside or across his face. Like every farm boy from anywhere near the town of Imbros, he knew who the Kubratoi were: wild men from north of the mountains. “Will we fight them, Father?” he asked. Just the other day, with a stick for a sword, he’d slain a dozen make-believe robbers.But his father shook his head. “Real fighting is for soldiers. The Kubratoi, curse ’em, are soldiers. We aren’t. They’d kill us, and we couldn’t do much in the way of fighting back. This isn’t play, boy.”“What will we do, Phostis?” his mother asked above Evdokia’s sniffles. She sounded almost ready to cry herself. That frightened Krispos more than all the racket outside. What could be worse than something bad enough to frighten his mother?The answer came in a moment: something bad enough to frighten his father. “We run,” Phostis said grimly, “unless you’d sooner be dragged north by the two-legged wolves out there. That’s why I built close to the forest; that’s why I built the door facing away from most of the houses: to give us a chance to run, if the Kubratoi ever came down again.”His mother bent, rose again. “I have the baby.”In her arms, Evdokia said indignantly, “Not a baby!” Then she started to cry again.No one paid any attention to her. Krispos’ father took him by the shoulder, so hard that his flimsy nightshirt might as well not have stood between man’s flesh and boy’s. “Can you run to the trees, son, fast as you can, and hide yourself till the bad men go away?”“Yes, Father.” Put that way, it sounded like a game. Krispos had played more games in the forest than he could count.“Then run!” His father threw open the door. Out he darted. His mother followed, still holding Evdokia. Last came his father. Krispos knew his father could run faster than he could, but his father didn’t try, not tonight. He stayed between his family and the village.Bare feet skimming across the ground, Krispos looked back over his shoulder. He’d never seen so many horses or so many torches in his life before. All the horses had strangers on them—the fearsome Kubratoi, he supposed. He could see a lot of villagers, too. The horsemen rounded up more of them every second.“Don’t look, boy! Run!” his father said. Krispos ran. The blessed trees drew nearer and nearer. But a new shout was up, too, and horses drummed their way. The sound of pursuit grew with horrid quickness. Breath sobbing in his throat, Krispos thought how unfair it was that horses could run so fast.“You stop, or we shoot you!” a voice called from behind. Krispos could hardly understand it; he had never heard Videssian spoken with any accent but the country twang of his own village.“Keep running!” his father said. But riders flashed by Krispos on either side, so close he could feel the wind from their horses, so close he could smell the beasts. They wheeled, blocking him and his family from the safety of the woods.Still with the feeling it was all a game, Krispos wheeled to dash off in some new direction. Then he saw the other horsemen, the pair who had gone after his father. One carried a torch, to give them both light to see by. It also let Krispos clearly see them, see their fur caps, the matted beards that seemed to complement those caps, their boiled-leather armor, the curved swords on their hips, the way they sat their mounts as if part of them. Frozen in time, the moment stayed with Krispos as long as he lived.The second rider, the one without a torch, held a bow. It had an arrow in it, an arrow drawn and pointed at Krispos’ father. That was when it stopped being play for the boy. He knew about bows, and how people were supposed to be careful with them. If these wild men didn’t know that, time someone taught them.He marched straight up to the Kubratoi. “You turn the aim of that arrow aside this instant,” he told them. “You might hurt someone with it.”Both Kubratoi stared at him. The one with the bow threw back his head and howled laughter. The wild man did sound like a wolf, Krispos thought, shivering. He wished his voice had been big and deep like his father’s, not a boy’s squeak. The rider wouldn’t have laughed then.The rider probably would have shot him, but he did not think of that until years later. As it was, the Kubrati, still laughing, set down his bow, made an extravagant salute from the saddle. “Anything you say, little khagan, anything you say.” He chuckled, wiping his face with the back of his hand. Then he raised his eyes to meet those of Krispos’ father, who had hurried up to do what he could for the boy. “Not need to shoot now, eh, farmer-man?”“No,” Krispos’ father agreed bitterly. “You’ve caught us, all right.”Along with his parents and Evdokia, Krispos walked slowly back to the village. A couple of horsemen stayed with them; the other two rode ahead so they could get back to doing whatever Kubratoi did. That, Krispos already suspected, was nothing good.He remembered the strange word the rider with the bow had used. “Father, what does ‘khagan’ mean?”“It’s what the Kubratoi call their chieftain. If he’d been a Videssian, he would have called you ‘Avtokrator’ instead.”“Emperor? That’s silly.” Even with his world coming apart, Krispos found he could still laugh.“So it is, boy,” his father said grimly. He paused, then went on in a different tone, as if beginning to enjoy the joke himself: “Although there’s said to be Vaspurakaner blood on my side of the family, and the Vaspurs all style themselves ‘prince.’ Bet you didn’t know your father was a prince, eh, son?”“Stop it, Phostis!” Krispos’ mother said. “The priest says that nonsense about princes is heresy and nothing else but. Don’t pass it on to the boy.”“Heresy is what the priest is supposed to know about,” his father agreed, “but I won’t argue about the nonsense part. Who ever heard of a prince going hungry?”His mother sniffed, but made no further answer. They were inside the village by then, back where other people could hear them—not good, not if they wanted to talk of heresy. “What will they do with us?” was a safer question to ask, though not one, necessarily, with a surer answer. The villagers stood around under the bows of the Kubratoi, waiting.Then more riders came up, these leading not people but the village’s herds and flocks. “Are the animals coming with us, Father?” Krispos asked. He had not expected the Kubratoi to be so considerate.“With us, aye, but not for us,” was all his father said.The Kubratoi started shouting, both those who spoke Videssian and those who did not. The villagers looked at one another, trying to figure out what the wild men meant. Then they saw the direction in which the cattle and sheep were going. They followed the beasts northward.For krispos, the trek to kubrat was the best adventure he’d ever had. Tramping along all day was no harder than the chores he would have been doing had the raiders not descended on his village, and he always had something new to see. He’d never imagined, before, how big the world was.That the march was forced hardly entered his mind. He ate better on it than he had at home; the Kubrati he’d defied that first night decided to make a pet of him and brought him chunks of roast lamb and beef. Soon other riders took up the game, so the “little khagan” sometimes found himself with more than he could eat.At his father’s urging, he never let on. Whenever the Kubratoi did not insist on having him eat in front of them, he passed their tidbits on to the rest of the family. The way he made the food disappear earned him a reputation as a bottomless pit, which only brought more his way.By the end of the third day on the road north, the raiders who had descended on his village met with other bands bringing captives and booty back to Kubrat. That took Krispos by surprise. He had never given any thought to the world beyond the fields he knew. Now he saw he and his family were caught up in...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But Ellie is difficult to dislike. According to Mary Margaret, the girl's only flaw is that she's perfect. Still, when Mr. Mooney picks her for the part of Cinderella, it grates on Mary Margaret. When her mother suggests that she volunteer to be an understudy, Mary Margaret agrees, convinced that she'll end up as the lead. The story ends happily, with the protagonist learning that being perfect isn't easy and Ellie learning to relax a bit despite an overly critical mother. The scenes that Mary Margaret shares with her 13-year-old brother ring especially true. Although she appreciates him, she'd sooner annoy him than admit it.

When a badly mutilated body is found in a North End park, detectives Ed Fischer and John Nadeau suspect the grisly murder an isolated incident. But soon, more shredded corpses are discovered, and the detectives look into the connections that bond the murder victims together. Their investigation reveals that the dead all participated in an ill-fated anthropological field study to a remote village in India where children were being snatched in the night, supposedly by a treacherous monster. During the trip, two graduate students perished mysteriously, and, now 10 years later, the murderer seems intent on silencing eyewitnesses who could reveal new information about these suspicious deaths. As more bodies pile up, Ed and John begin to realize that their key suspects are not wholly truthful and no one, not even the mild-mannered professors, are who they claim. Vargulf is an entertaining diversion, though its narrative style is at times grating—it reads more like a description of a movie than a novel. There’s also a distracting discordance between what Garrity’s characters know and what information he offers his readers that renders the central mystery different for both—from the first page (or even, arguably, the book’s cover), readers understand that a werewolf is responsible the murders, but the author’s detectives spend most of the novel puzzling over the culprit. Thus, his two constituencies want two different things—readers want to know how this werewolf got to Boston and why it’s killing people, while the book’s characters only want to identify the beast. Because of this, the tension and suspense is lost. The climax for the detectives comes when they battle the werewolf in person, but the resolution for readers comes when the werewolf’s identity (as well as the story of his creation) is revealed. But despite its clichéd imagery and stilted dialogue, Vargulf melds the supernatural and the quotidian into a passable modern-day urban thriller.

With the nominal meaning of \"shield\" being a protective barrier, the subtitle of this book, Behind the Shield, signifies a look past the thin blue line and deep into the heart of the law enforcement officer.Today, stress and trauma in law enforcement are more prevalent than ever before.  Stress and trauma are produced not only from events in the field that police officers across the country face, but also from internal departmental events and policies that are actually responsible for the officer's employment and well-being.  Law enforcement men and women face daily challenges that most American citizens could not fathom.  It is during and after such challenging events that over-scrutinizing of officers and lack of support may be so prevalent and damaging.Excessive supervision, second guessing, and internal investigations, coupled with the specters of death and despair, eat away at the very physical and psychological foundation of the officer. The mental health of law enforcement personnel should be of the highest priority as it directly affects the quality of service and protection citizens receive and often demand.Readers of this book will learn what law enforcement officers really experience on a daily basis, including:How officers actually feel, from the inside out, while coping with the enemy within.How, in some departments, police suicides actually outnumber line-of-duty police killings, and why.How police families are torn apart from the results of stress and trauma.How a spouse lives with the burdens of loneliness and fear of the loss of his or her loved one.This book discusses the analogy of a breaking point that comes from the many stress and trauma factors inherent throughout police work. Personal experiences and reflections gleaned through honest responses to questions posed reveal officers' states of mind.  Finally, this book explores the coping mechanisms, supervisory goals and behaviors, and rehabilitation programs presently in place that enable the police officer to continue functioning as a public servant and protector.For as many heroes as are in law enforcement, there are those standing behind them ready to catch them as they fall victim and succumb to the tribulations within their profession.  They are the families, peers, psychologists and psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals who are dedicated to restoring the mental well-being of the officers they represent.  Many of these people, profiled in this book, today offer their professional services within established programs by working in support units such as critical incident debriefing teams, or volunteering as peer counselors.When the young adults, sometimes family members or neighbors, enter into the world of law enforcement, they are entitled to support, for they are the part of society that is sent forward to serve and protect.  This service comes with a heavy price.  These men and women are asked by society to lay down their lives so that others may live, work and play in peace, free from the harmful elements that detract from a safe environment.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But Israel did none of that; he kept his human dignity, optimism and hope. He never forgot that in him was a man of value and honour. When they were freed and the spirit of revenge came over others, made them drunk with hatred and wanted blood, Israel kept his spirit and soul. He went to Israel to follow his Zionist dream and start a family. He did not become a bitter man, but looked at the world with optimism, always moving with hope. He carried the pain of his story in his heart in silence until the day came to tell his story. This is the story of a man who remained a man in spite of everything.

The twist is that the anthrax is American made and contained in a bomb (Tranquillity) that was stolen from an American base in Turkey. President Charles Anderson, in order to bring an end to an unpopular war and win reelection, has authorized the use of anthrax weaponry in Asrtrakhan. Anderson is dominated by a cadre of former Special Forces operatives, The Medici Group, who are determined not to repeat the outcomes of the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan Wars. This cadre operates outside the law in an effort to protect their Administration and their power base. As part of the decisions to protect the Administration there is a breakdown in communication within the government agencies. Tranquillity is successfully smuggled by a terrorist cell through JFK International Airport into New York City. The terrorists, looking for explosives with which to build an IED, open the bomb, releasing the anthrax spores into Times Square. Cassandra Williams, the anthrax specialist for the Centers for Disease Control, daughter of one of the world s leading anthrax specialists and granddaughter of one of the doctors who developed Tranquillity at the Fort Detrick US Medical Research Command, is initially deployed to investigate the outbreak in Astrakhan. On her return to America she is immediately deployed to New York. A nearly universally fatal disease, pulmonary anthrax, of which (except for the outbreak in 2001) there have been two cases in America in the last forty years, suddenly develops as a plume of patients among the most vulnerable old and sick citizens in the city and ultimately throughout the world. It is Cassandra s job to figure out if this disease is contagious, if it is germ warfare, if it is linked to Astrakhan and finally to isolate the area from which the contamination originated. Meanwhile, Senator Richland Powell, the junior senator from New York has been notified that the wife of one of the terrorists has broken ranks and informed the New York Post of the existence of a second bomb. She reported that the terrorists themselves, including herself and her children, were infected. Ominously she reported that the terrorists are determined to deploy the second bomb from one of New York s tallest buildings. This deployment, if successful, would mean that millions of New Yorkers would die of the disease within a matter of weeks. Together Powell and Williams fight to find and stop the terrorists even as the military Cadre seeks to eliminate her and her father in order to protect the Administration.  This is a riveting book which captured my attention from the first chapter. It skates along the reality of what can happen when our President is not particularly intelligent and is dominated by very smart, very ruthless men whose solutions to problems are outside the law. It also creates a picture of what happens when we kill members of the families of people who, with no hostages to fortune, turn to revenge. It is first and foremost a medical detective story in which the interviews with patients lead to significant information about the origins of the infection and how medical detectives work to solve epidemics. It is also an action-adventure story with a nail biting ending 97 stories above mid-town. The ending has such a twist that I actually verbalized my surprise and dismay out loud. --Suzy Prudden", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At some point, I realized that the blog contained enough material for an ebook that you can keep handy when working with digiKam. And since the Amazon Digital Publishing Platform solution makes it ridiculously easy to publish an ebook and make it available through the Amazon Web site, the decision to turn the blog material into an ebook form was a no-brainer.Since it's relatively easy to update a digital publication, I expect the book to evolve and mature to the point where it becomes the definitive collection of digiKam tricks and tips.  And if you decide to purchase the current version of the book will receive all subsequent editions free of charge.The book wouldn't have been possible without the fantastic digiKam software and its amazing developers. Therefore, 50% of all book sales go to the digiKam project.  The book doesn't use any DRM, and it's released under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license, so you can read the book using any ebook reader that supports the MOBI format.

And that had created some problems for her and her family. As the youngest partner at Myrtle, Coppersmith & Cunningham LLP, Darlene usually got the least promising and least interesting cases assigned in the three-person law firm.But her job as a defense attorney meant everything to her. Even the smallest detail of the most mundane case got her professional juices flowing. Take for instance her current case. She had to force herself not to get too excited about it. There was something suspicious about her client. Something wasn't right about the burglary case, and it was driving her crazy.And then a witness had come forward and volunteered to testify on her client's behalf. It all seemed too convenient, she thought. It just didn't add up, and Darlene was determined to find out why.That's why Darlene had decided to fly down to Memphis and reinterview the witness. Though her partners didn't think it was worthwhile for Darlene to travel all that way just to nail down the facts in the case, Darlene disagreed.And so here she was in Memphis, trying to locate the alibi witness, the only witness who could testify that her client, Albert Frank, was somewhere else at the time the crime took place. A very convenient witness who had very inconveniently vanished without a trace.Darlene landed at Memphis International Airport, exhausted after having transferred twice on the trip from Baltimore. Having refused the peanuts and pretzels offered on the plane, she was hungry and a bit on edge. She'd never been to Memphis before, and the intensity of the heat and humidity surprised her, adding to her discomfort.She checked into the famous Peabody Hotel—known for its duck march through the lobby—and called room service for a pulled-pork sandwich and iced tea. She unpacked while she waited for her food to arrive. After she'd eaten, Darlene once again tried to contact Frank's alibi witness at the number she'd been given. To her disappointment, she got no answer, not even voice mail.With no word from her witness, she struck out the next morning to check on her client's story about where the witness lived. She took a cab to the address he'd given her in an upscale neighborhood in a cul-de-sac bordering Memphis and Collerville. She would have expected just about any neighborhood other than the quiet, pristine homes that screamed old-money wealth and power. Less sure of herself now, she knocked on the door, since she had not seen a doorbell.\"Come in,\" a slender gray-haired man in a black suit, white shirt and black tie said with a gracious smile. \"Not many people come here these days.\" He spoke haltingly, and she decided that he was part of the household staff, a fair assumption given the neighborhood. \"Have a seat,\" the man said as he gestured toward what she discovered was an elegant living room.\"Thank you. This heat is almost unbearable,\" Darlene said to fill the awkward silence. She used a tissue to wipe her forehead.\"Yes, it is,\" the man said. \"Would you care for some sweetened iced tea? I made it a few minutes ago. If you're uncomfortable, I can turn up the air conditioner.\"She leaned against the back of a tufted velvet chair and looked at the man. \"Thank you, but I don't care for tea, and the air-conditioning is fine. This is a beautiful house, but it must be very old. No one seems to build these kinds of houses anymore.\" Small talk was something she hated, but she had to engage the man in conversation if she was to learn anything about her client.\"Yes, it's old, all right. My grandfather built it. But I renovated it from roof to cellar about twenty-five years ago. Sure you wouldn't like some tea or iced coffee?\"\"No thank you. I was given this address and was told a young man, an alibi witness, lived here. But I see I was wrong, so I'd better be going,\" Darlene said, somewhat surprised that the old man lived in the home. \"Thanks for your hospitality.\"\"I wish you wouldn't go,\" he said as she reached for the doorknob. \"I've enjoyed your company. I don't get much company anymore.\"\"I'm sorry,\" she said as she opened the door. She turned to leave, only to find her exit blocked. She looked up into the eyes of a six-foot-three-inch boulder.\"Excuse me. I was j-just leaving,\" she stammered, taken aback by her sudden encounter with this immovable object.\"You aren't going anywhere,\" he said.\"Would you please get out of my way,\" Darlene said, letting him know that she was not easily intimidated.The man put his hand in the inside pocket of his jacket, took out his badge and flashed it. \"I'm Detective Michael Raines of the Memphis Police, and you don't leave this house until I say so.\"Darlene looked him in the eye. \"Really? I thought all the bullies in uniform were in Baltimore. Apparently Tennessee has some, too. How interesting! Now, would you please move aside? I have business to take care of.\"He raised an eyebrow. \"Go right ahead. Maybe you can walk through me.\"She stared at him, seeing him as if for the first time. Something flickered in his light brown eyes, and she responded, unable to do otherwise. She told herself to get out of there. But she stood rooted to the spot. His eyes said he would never release her. She shook her head as if to break the spell he had cast over her.\"I'm Attorney Darlene Cunningham, and you have no reason to keep me here. If you don't let me pass, I'll sue you, the city of Memphis and the state of Tennessee,\" she said, her mild manner dissolving into anger.His facial expression didn't change one bit. Realizing that belligerence would get her nowhere with Detective Raines, she decided to switch tactics.\"You haven't read me my rights, and you have to do that if I'm under arrest.\" Her voice took on a taunting tone.\"You are not under arrest, Ms. Cunningham. You are being detained.\"She leaned her head to the side in what she knew he'd take as a challenge. \"What's the difference?\" she said, clearly losing patience.\"Very funny, Ms. Cunningham, but you may as well have a seat, because you cannot leave this house until I say so.\"Darlene turned to the old man. \"You didn't tell me your name.\"\"My name is Boyd Farmer. Have a seat. At least it's comfortable in here.\"\"Is this guy your son? Oh, sorry,\" she said before Boyd could respond. \"You're too nice to have such an arrogant, obnoxious son. I really need to go.\"\"I'm sorry,\" Boyd said. \"He isn't going to let you go.\"She whirled around and glared at Michael Raines, and for her trouble she felt a peculiar thudding in the region of her heart. \"At least I deserve to know why I'm being detained,\" she said. \"What did I do?\" Realizing that her tone would only make him more adamant, she switched tactics again. \"You're unlike any detective I've ever met.\"\"What do you mean by that?\" His tone was definitely not friendly.\"Oh,\" she said, tossing her hair to the side. \"I mean, aren't police officers supposed to protect and serve?\"Boyd's laughter filled the room, but she avoided looking in his direction. Instead she focused on Michael Raines.\"Yeah,\" he said. \"Now, sit down and let's cut the comedy.\"Darlene did not like taking orders from a stranger, even one with a badge. She didn't move. \"You don't look stupid,\" she told him. \"You have to tell me why you're holding me here. It's the law. Tell me why I'm being detained, or I'm leaving.\" She tried to move past him.He grabbed her shoulders and glared at her. \"What are you doing here?\"She twisted her shoulders and moved away from him. \"I'm trying to get information that I hope will help my client's case.\"\"You'll have to prove that to me. This house has been under surveillance, and neither you nor anyone else can leave here. Get it?\"She'd have to come up with a different excuse. Getting back to her office in Maryland was paramount. The other partners already considered her trip to Memphis little more than a wild-goose chase, and if they discovered her present predicament… She didn't want to think of their reaction.\"I have to get back to my hotel,\" she said.He folded his arms across his broad chest and smiled, giving evidence that he could be charming when it suited him. \"Oh, so I gather you plan to leave Memphis.\"\"No, as a matter of fact I'm staying at the Peabody,\" she said.\"Really?\" he said. \"I'm sure it won't be a problem for you to stay here.\"\"Now, look here, you,\" she said, with all the softness of a wildcat about to pounce. \"You're going to.\" She stopped. His beautiful eyes twinkled like flashing lights, and she could see his difficulty in restraining his laughter.\"You're not one bit funny, and I'll have the last laugh.\"At that point, Boyd brought the tea along with a brioche and jam. \"This should make you comfortable.\" She thanked him. \"Detective Raines doesn't like tea, and I don't have any more coffee,\" he said.\"How long has he been here?\" Darlene asked Boyd, pointing to Michael.\"He's been here two weeks. That's why I don't have any more coffee. He's practically a coffee addict.\"She took a few sips of tea and looked at Michael. \"Coffee addict, eh? I'm glad to have at least some evidence that you're human.\"Something akin to pain flickered in his eyes, and she wished she could retract her words. It wasn't his fault that she'd stumbled into a house that was under surveillance. He was doing his job. Maybe if she appealed to his decency, he'd let her go.\"If I'm stuck here for any length of time, I'll lose my case.\" She told herself that she wouldn't beg, but that had sounded very much like a plea. She observed him carefully to see his response.\"But how do I know y...", "related": ["B00D1B4CTA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Today, the former, who also enjoyed a successful diplomatic and political career, is known primarily for Hitchcock's version of his novel THE 39 STEPS. The latter, under the nom de plume O. Douglas, is nearly forgotten. All her books are out-of-print, except for this audio version of THE SETONS, a gentle satire of pretentiousness and false values, about a Glasgow minister, his family, and his poor congregation before WWI. Gordon Reid gives a superb rendering of the milieu--vivifying a huge cast of characters and making each distinctive, deftly employing a number of Scottish accents, and infusing all with considerable charm. His narrative is the coup de grace. After listening for a while, one hears not him reading an old novel, but a benevolent and patrician lady of Edwardian sensibility beguiling us with her didactic tale, which extols the virtues of sincerity, humor, patience, generosity, and love.

The mother of Dorothea and Iris Crosby, identical twins in New York Society, dies after giving birth to them and their father dies soon after in a riding accident. The two cling tightly to each other, overseen by their befuddled older brother, George. After the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the teenage twins do wrenching work identifying burn victims. After several (chaperoned) trips to France, the twins, in their mid-20s, return to France as Red Cross volunteers when the U.S. enters WWI. When Iris falls in love with Southern Jewish aviator Maurice Aronsohn, Dorothea feels threatened. The two repledge their mutual loyalties, but the unhealthiness of their attachment becomes readily apparent. Seebohm's wartime Paris is particularly vivid; her prose throughout is concise and rich, and her narrative is peppered with period dialogue and epistolary correspondence among the characters. What doesn't come through is the sisters' desperation or the claustrophobia of their unraveling.

Corinne, Dowager Countess deCoventry, \"still\" ravishing at 24, has her fabulously entailed family pearls plucked from her throat by a rogue dressed as Robin Hood at a masquerade ball. She noticed that his hands were rough and he spoke with a French accent. Armed with this information, her three good friends?Lord Luten (the leader of the Ton, or fashionable London), Sir Reginald Prance (a witless dandy) and Coffen Pattle (agreeable and rich)?band together to track down the invaluable gems. Collectively known as the Berkeley Brigade (they all live on Berkeley Square), they ferret out a Drury Lane seamstress who provided the Robin Hood costume. She is obviously frightened and is later discovered strangled. Utilizing their best skills (mostly arrogant sneers, haughty smiles and bored drawls), the foursome discover the Robin Hood impostor, now also dead. A whirlwind farce follows, with interviews in glittering ballrooms populated with bejeweled women and rakish men. Enfeebled prose (\"She had hair like spun silk... her lips were ripe and red as cherries\") does little to enrich this hapless story by the author of over 100 Regency romances... and a few mysteries (Behold, A Mystery!, 1994).Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00K0XZX8G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's true that Barstaple was mean and small-minded, but surely he didn't deserve to die a torturous death by poisoning. Inspector Rafferty and his erudite compatriot, Sergeant Llewellyn, have plenty of suspects. Nearly every employee had a reason to hate Barstaple, but not every employee was clever enough to figure out how to dose him with deadly poison. As Rafferty and Llewellyn follow up leads, they begin to unravel a strange, ugly story. When the office gossip, one Amy Glossop, is murdered, the case breaks open. And even though he's pleased to have the case solved, Rafferty's pride is slightly dented because it is Sergeant Llewellyn who finally unscrambles the clues. An ingeniously constructed plot, deft dialogue, well-drawn characters, and a few humorous touches make this an enjoyably intriguing read and a nice addition to the Rafferty-Llewellyn series.Emily MeltonCopyright © American Library Association.

The doctor listened while Carla whined about her weight and how the sizzle had drained out of her love life. They both agreed that there didn't appear to be any major issues to explain the general funk. The psychiatrist suggested that Carla make some changes in her diet and lifestyle, maybe do some volunteer work, join the gym, talk to a dietitian. They brainstormed several options. Then, if all else failed, she'd prescribe a mild antidepressant.That's how Carla ended up in my office. I was one of her homework assignments—see a dietitian, when that flops—which, of course, she assumed it would—then go back to the psychiatrist for medication. But, like so many best-laid plans, Carla's life was about to take a 180-degree turn.A brief review of what she was eating made it crystal clear why she felt so bad and had gained 20 pounds. I concluded, \"You're eating junk. No wonder you feel like junk.\" Carla looked me straight in the eye and I could tell a light had gone on in her mind.\"It was one of those 'aha' moments for me. The statement was so simple, yet it really hit home,\" says Carla. \"I realized that since the baby was born, I'd fallen into this time mantra, telling myself over and over again that I didn't have enough time to work out, plan elaborate dinners or even bother with my weight or my looks. I was in the habit of grabbing quick-fix foods, like granola bars, chips or bean bur-ritos from a taco stand on my way to work. I still made dinner most nights, but I'd cut corners there, too. I was addicted to Marie Callender's frozen entrees and more than once the family ate boxed mac and cheese for dinner. Yet I told myself I was eating pretty good. Hey, my eating habits were no worse than anyone else's! I knew my food choices had contributed to the weight gain, but it never dawned on me that my slow but steady diet demise paralleled my slide into fatigue and depression.\"Carla is not alone. In fact, odds are you probably are just like her. Only one in every 100 people in this country meet even minimum standards of a balanced diet. I'm not talking optimal here. Just minimum!The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) developed a questionnaire to assess people's eating habits. It's called the Healthy Eating Index and it divides the diet into 10 categories, such as the amount of bad fat you eat, the number of servings of fruits and the amount of vegetables in the diet. A diet is ranked from 0 to 10 in each category. Eat the optimal amount of fruits, for example, and you'll score a ten in that category. Score perfectly in all 10 categories and you get 100%.Few people come close to a passing grade on the Healthy Eating Index. Americans consistently average a score of 52 on the scale of 0 to 100. In other words, we flunk eating. If our kids came home with a score like that on a math test, we'd ground them and hire tutors. Yet most people when asked how they rate their eating habits, answer that they think they do \"Not great, but pretty well.\" Virtually all of them are delusional!Have You Lost That Lovin' Feeling?As our eating habits took a nosedive in the past few decades, the rates of depression skyrocketed.Today, depression is a leading cause of disability, second only to high blood pressure. Almost 15 million Americans are battling serious depression. Another 3.3 million hide under the sad umbrella most of the time. About 7 out of 10 Americans are overweight, which increases their risk for depression. (As people lose weight, their mood improves.) Not only does depression undermine a person's enjoyment of life, but it increases the risk fourfold for other health problems, such as heart disease. It also is the fast track to Frumpville, since 7 out of 10 people battling the blues say they lost their mojo somewhere down the road. In short, you can't get to sexy if you are chained to the blues wagon.Most people turn to medication first to solve the problem. Antidepressants like Prozac are prescribed more often than any other pill besides the birth control pill. I am not saying thereisn't a place for medication when you're trying to \"fix\" depression, but drugs are not the Holy Grail of treatment, either. For one thing, up to 40% of people don't respond to these medications and even those who do, report the drugs don't erase the problem. Meds might make some people feel closer to normal or at least help them blunt the pain. But those drugs also can destroy sex drive, cloud thinking and kick self-confidence in the butt, which then undermines mood, leading to an even lower sex drive. Medication also comes with a few other nasty side effects, including fatigue, weight gain (up to 9 pounds a month!) and impotence. I'm not sure what is worse—the bad mood or the side effects from the drugs to treat it!A Mood MakeoverLuckily, Carla's psychiatrist felt it was worth her trying some life changes before she started popping pills. It worked. Once Carla fueled her body with the foods it needed to run well, her weight started dropping, while her mood improved.Like Carla, you can reclaim and sustain hope, joy, an upbeat attitude and a confident spirit by making a few simple adjustments to how you treat your body and your life…with not one single side effect other than improved energy, lower disease risk, a slimmer waistline and a return of that mojo!Let's get this straight right now. This is important, so listen up. You were not designed to be tired, depressed or overweight. It is not one of our basic survival skills. None of those modern-day problems would have served our ancient ancestors well on the savannah a million years ago. Our species survived because our ancestors were mentally and physically strong. A tired, grumpy, fat caveman would not have outrun a saber-toothed tiger, or would have been left behind when the tribe moved on. (Who's got time to give Ukluk a pep talk when the Ice Age is coming?) Depression and obesity are results of civilization, not genes. They are not \"normal.\" They are not instinct, destiny or inevitable.You also were not designed to eat Pop-Tarts, Cheez Whiz, white bread, potato chips or soft drinks. In fact, most of the more than 30,000 items at your local grocery store never crossed the lips of any of our ancient ancestors, dating back millions of years. The Pilgrims would not recognize our modern excuse for food, either. Even a Civil War soldier would be amazed at what we are putting in our mouths. In short, our eating habits have changed astronomically in the past 100 years, yet we are genetically identical to our ancient ancestors who evolved and thrived for eons on diets composed of fruits, vegetables, root plants, wild grass seed, wild game, seafood, nuts and a bit of honey.Processed foods—made with refined grains, added sugars, fat, salt, additives, colorants, stabilizers, preservatives and more—are as alien to your body as breathing carbon monoxide. Put junk into your body and guess what? You get fat, tired, obstinate, depressed, forgetful and cranky. And you end up with a team of physicians doing damage control.That's what had happened to Carla. The general malaise that had taken over her life crept up slowly and steadily as she turned her back on the foods that sustain a happy, vibrant, sexy life. Instead, she wolfed down processed junk. Eat junk and you will feel, look and act like junk.But—and here's the great part!—eat well and, I promise, like Carla, it will turn your life around. You'll be happier, leaner, more energetic, and you will feel sexier!!! The better you eat, the healthier and more vibrant you are. The healthier you are, the sexier you feel.Carla followed the diet advice I gave her that day. She slowly adopted the six rules from the S-Ex-Y Diet (the Sensual ExtraordinaryYouDiet) and within six weeks, she had dropped 12 of the 20 pounds she wanted to lose, had canceled the follow-up appointment with the doctor (\"Who needs drugs when you can feel this good with food?\") and even her coworkers noticed her newfound energy.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

There is a James Agee-like sharpness and alertness of observation in the images of tractors, cattle, Victrolas, boats, ancestors, awakening love. Norwood captures the fleeting insights of adolescence, the humiliations and victories of childhood, and inklings of mortality, in portraits achingly vivid, in riffs spare and honest, bringing the past alive in a fresh idiom.”   —Robert Morgan, author ofTerroirandGap Creek“In his new book, Norwood writes vividly and with concrete, true detail about lives forged here in East Texas.”—Texarkana Gazette“Nick Norwood’s newest collection is both beautifully restrained and intensely local. With impeccable craftsmanship, he delineates a farm, a family, neighbors: a place and a time. Yet something else is going on: the particulars of the poems gather a subterranean strength and by book’s end we are shocked to realize how attached we have become to another’s memories, how those memories have taken up residence in our own minds. This is the marvel of poetry, and Norwood achieves it with grace and intelligence.”     —Kelly Cherry, author ofThe Retreats of Thought: Poems", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This created a tendency to want to control the environment about him . . . to the good where Doug could lead others, manage social affairs, survive . . . to the bad where he was constantly creating to-do lists, where he had to stay on top of things and others to make sure life went OK . . . Doug went on his second Quest in 1998. Here, Raven came to him, in form and in Spirit. Raven told him that if he were to quit his job, sell his home and what he owned, and travel . . . that Raven would guide him, that Raven and fellow Spirits would show him wonders, sharing tales and songs, that all Doug had to do was give up control and follow . . . a wonderful world and life would be opened to him. Curiously enough, and surprising everyone who knew him, no one more than himself, Dog took Raven up on the offer. As things happen, when they are meant to, within a month Dog was on the road, Raven leading. Here, Coyote came, as well, and talked, and talked and talked . . . seeping into, and perhaps from within, Doug's own soul. It was Coyote who became an almost constant companion, raconteur of tales, a seemingly doppelganger who now flowed through Doug's life, past, present and future. The initial stages of this path ran quickly some 70,000 miles . . . since then, it has leveled off into a rhythmic cycle of family, travel, music and writing . . . coast to coast, border to border . . .

(Too common I'm afraid.) We had just completed a run of three productions which all featured large casts of 50+. Exhausted, I had decided that our next production of Snow White would be smaller than the three previous shows and so I set about to writeSNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARVES OF THE OLD REPUBLIC, (Also available on Amazon.) It was a fantastic little play I thought, just enough of the classic fairy tale to keep the kids happy with some modern references that adults would get. And the best part? Only 12 roles! It would be like a vacation compared to the grand epics I had recently directed.Then we held auditions.And 75 kids showed up! (That's what happens when you're the hippest joint in town!) So, I stood up in front of those anxious young thesbians and explained that while I appreciated their interest, we would only be casting 12 of them in the production.  You could have heard a pin drop as 75 little hearts collectively broke.So, I did what any professional Children's Theatre Director/Playwright/Drama Teacher would do in that situation.I went home and rewrote the play.I added more Badguys. I added Fuzzy Forest Creatures. I added Princesses. And I added Dwarves. Lots and lots of Dwarves. The result was a great big play called SNOW WHITE AND THE 47 DWARVES.If you are looking for a play that has a part for everybody, this is it!!!(Who says you can't please everyone?)", "related": [], "rank": 3104322, "title": "Snow White and the 47 Dwarves", "author": "L.

After failing to make the grade as a professional football player, he spent much of his early years traveling, hitch-hiking around Europe and North Africa and then heading to Asia. His experiences in Bangkok and India later inspired his thriller VENOM, and his adventures in the jungles of the Golden Triangle of Burma and Laos were also filed away for later, the basis of his OPIUM series about the underworld drug trade. He later moved to Australia and worked in advertising, before moving to Sydney where he freelanced for most of Australia’s leading newspapers and magazines, as well as working in radio and television. He started publishing in 1984, mostly humor and young adult fiction, but with the publication of VENOM in 1990, he became a full time novelist. He has published over 40 books in print. HAREM was an enormous bestseller in Germany and THE NAKED HUSBAND was ranked #9 in Australia on its release. AZTEC stayed on the bestseller lists in Mexico for four months. He is a bestseller in Europe and his work has sold into translation in 23 countries: Brazil, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech republic, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Indonesia, Korea, Macedonia, Montenegro, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Turkey. He lived for many years in the beautiful Margaret River region in WA, and helped raise two beautiful daughters with his late wife, Helen. While writing, he also worked in the volunteer ambulance service for over 13 years His marriage ended in tragic circumstances, a story he has told in ‘The Naked Husband,’ and its non-fiction sequel, ‘The Year We Seized the Day,’ written with a writing partner, Elizabeth Best. He travels regularly to research his novels and his quest for authenticity has led him to run with the bulls in Pamplona, pursue tornadoes across Oklahoma and black witches across Mexico, go cage shark diving in South Africa and get tear gassed in a riot in La Paz. He also completed a nine hundred kilometre walk of the camino in Spain. He did not write for over five years but returned to publishing in 2010 with the release of SILK ROAD, and then STIGMATA the following year.

Max and Sarah sense a connection to recent thefts of artworks newly restored by Bartolo Arbalest, who calls himself ``the Resurrection Man.'' After a series of eerie misfortunes, Arbalest has set up a tightly controlled atelier of artisans and restorers--all of them bodyguarded by patrician Carnaby Goudge. As mourners gather at the Protheroe home after George's funeral, a second murder begins to reveal the long-ago-in-India roots of the present carnage. The heavy-handed, near-parody plot is loaded with excess in all departments--myriad details of food, clothes, and furniture; arch dialogue; red herrings; fey characters; and, in the end, massive ennui.

Graham is a gasbag who repeatedly poses rhetorical questions that betray his overblown sense of his own intelligence: \"Have I not so far proved many things to you which you would not previously have believed?\" No, he has not. His arguments are mostly misdirections about the hypocrisy of British culture or sheer tautological hooey.

At the end of World War Two, when the author, as a young teen was searching the ruins of her town for other survivors, thrust upon her was a partial diary of a young girl, written by a teenager named Miriam, who died during the war. This teenager's diary propelled the author to research and tell this riveting collective memoir. Stefania is the daughter of Joachim and Helena, who she credits for having taught her \"to love my town and my people\". She is thankful to her husband Siegfried for being \"encouraging, offering wise advice and criticism.\"  Her historic, non-fiction book is based on years of research, interviews and her own harrowing experiences. Stefania Heilbrunn gives a vivid account of how the Nazis occupied her hometown in Europe and ruthlessly, systematically captured, tormented and killed almost all 14,000 Jews, living in her town with a total population of 30,000. Starting with Hitler's orders and the Nazi Occupation, the author details the travesties beginning with the over-crowding of the ghetto, the countless beatings and ruthless killings. She describes the heroic acts of those who fought back to survive, as the Nazis ordered mass deportations to the concentration camps, work camps and death camps, slaughtering thousands upon thousands. Heilbrunn describes the day to day banalities of evil, as well as the courageous acts of bravery and miracles that enabled survival to just a few hundred Jews of her town. Stefania wants her book to bear constant witness, and promote constant vigilance. She states, \"the young must know their past, in order to be ready and able to defend their future.\"", "related": ["B00J70Z8E2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It shows that their parents are nervous, too, via endearing artwork that conveys emotions through color and size. In the beginning, the young boy is drawn larger and much more robust than his mom, glowing with healthy color and moving with excitement and energy. His mother appears tiny and blue and timid, barely peeking out over the covers on her bed and curling up behind her son's backpack. When she is greeted by another parent, a rosy tint begins to show on her face, indicating she feels better about this new adventure. Then it's the son's turn to be small again, and the blue shadow of apprehension creeps across his face. His new teacher is kind, though, and he marches independently into the room, ruddy in complexion and strong-limbed. Poor Mom is blue as she waves good-bye and as she anxiously waits for her son at the end of the day. When they reunite, both are blooming with warm colors-until, that is, the little boy asks if he can ride the bus the next day. Humorously, the mom shrinks a tad and turns blue (and maybe a bit green). This sweet, endearing book provides an extraordinary opportunity for parents and children to share their mutual fears and reassure one another as the big day approaches.

There are some internet resources dealing with laser diode beams. However, these internet resources have not covered enough materials with enough details on laser diode beam manipulations and characterizations. A technical book concentrated on laser diode beam manipulations and characterizations can fit in to the open and provide useful information to laser diode users.Laser Diode Beam Basics, Manipulations and  Characterizationsis concentrated on the very practical side of the subject, it only discusses the basic physics and mathematics that are necessary for the readers in order to understand the subject. This book is intended to provide a practical guidance and reference to those scientists and engineers who are still new to laser diode applications, and to those undergraduate and graduate students who are studying lasers and optics. Readers are expected to be able to fast and easily find the most practical and useful information about laser diodes in this book without the need of searching through a sea of information.", "related": [], "rank": 2557887, "title": "Laser Diode Beam Basics", "author": "Haiyin Sun", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When she began writing novels after retiring from teaching, she decided to follow her own advice to her students: \"Write what you know.\"  Before writing the first of the Grisholm County Chronicles, Eileen cut her teeth - metaphorically speaking - writing ADRIANNA, which she published in 2006 as a gift and to honor one of her mother's fondest dreams - that her \"baby girl\" would become a published author. \"Where do you get all that stuff?\" her mother asked when Eileen read passages from ADRIANNA to her. She had no answer for her mother, though, and still doesn't know where she \"gets all that stuff.\" Now that the first three books of the Grisholm County Chronicles are finally into print as well as ebook, Eileen will be starting on Book IV, Swamp Fever, soon. Before she wrote the first word of Book I, she had sat at her computer and outlined the vague plotlines for eight stories and created a map of the imaginary county that would be the setting for all eight books. With each book she brings forth from that sketchy beginning, she knows she must have a muse...or someone who helps her along. When Eileen isn't writing or working on websites, she may be out walking her two little fur babies, Jett and Toto. She's the proud mother of four children who have blessed her with a total of ten grandkids and three greatgrandkids (so far). They're scattered from Florida to Georgia to Texas, and even as far away as Japan, but by the magic of the internet, she's able to hear how they're doing when they can't make it home to visit. Meanwhile, she enjoys her somewhat quiet existence in West Central Florida and plans to keep on writing far beyond the eight books of the Grisholm County Chronicles.", "related": ["B00ALQL3HM"], "rank": 2390239, "title": "Hearts Afire (Grisholm County Chronicles Book 3)", "author": "Eileen Register", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She quit her job at Bell Labs and went backpacking around the world for six months in 1985, a few years after graduating from U of M, Ann Arbor, with an MSE and from the University of Lowell (now called UMass Lowell) with a BSEE, magna cum laude. While in Hong Kong, she and her two traveling companions bought bikes to travel through China, and when they visited the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, they noticed a sign on a bulletin board announcing that the U.S. Marines were sponsoring China's very first triathlon. They all entered, and Lauren finished in 1st place for the women, and 10th place overall. (All the competitors, except for Lauren and her two fellow travelers, were Marines or embassy personnel from various European countries and the USA). Lauren and her husband Rubin Johnson live in southern California and have two sons, Richard and Miles. Lauren is still very active swimming, biking, and running. She prefers shorter distances, and therefore when her husband has entered Ironman triathlons (2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike ride, 26.2 mile run), Lauren has been content to volunteer instead. She also lifts weights regularly, but not nearly as avidly as when she was a competitive powerlifter and benchpress specialist in the 1980s. Her novel, Tri-Hard, reflects her knowledge of all the sports mentioned above, as well as her experiences as a volunteer, particularly in the massage tent, where competitors would rather frequently be transported by stretcher to the adjoining medical tent, especially when the race day was either very hot or very cold.", "related": ["B0077HCRE6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Chronicling Shannon's journey to Whiskey Creek, the novel tells the story of a Wild West lawman who is trying to figure out what to do with himself now that the West isn't so wild anymore. Chasing employment and fearing that he is rapidly becoming obsolete, Shannon winds up putting his life on the line to protect a town from a gang of outlaws. Bravery, or one last hurrah before he fades away into the sunset? Not even Shannon is sure. This exciting novel fills in an important gap in Shannon's life and is must reading for fans of the series, not to mention old-school western fans who like their stories told with no shortage of blood, guts, and glory.David PittCopyright © American Library Association.

My earliest memories of my father involve a rusty and leaking sailboat that we sailed from Edmonds to our beach cabin on the Kitsap Peninsula near Foul Weather bluff.  This is a place that I still dream about more than 42 years later.  I learned to pray and to face my fears and to adore the natural world at our beach cabin.Eventually the cabin was sold for an airplane and we lived in Edmonds with a beautiful view of Admiralty Inlet. We could see Point No Point and that was just a few miles from our old beach cabin.I spent seven summers from 1977 until 1983 in the San Juan Islands as summer staff for a YMCA Summer Camp.  Later I spent 6 years working as a waterfront director for a CYO Summer Camp from 1986 until 1991.All of my life I have constantly been aware of a giant natural wonder. The tides relentlessly come in and out every 12 hours. In South Puget Sound The water Rises and falls 13 feet or more twice every day. This is a lunar driven clock that cycles relentlessly. It will continue for a couple billion years. It is profound in that we are so temporary and it will continue and wait for none of us.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Painting has been a passion of mine since I picked up a brush early in life. I graduated from the University of California at Davis and had the honor of taking classes from known artists Wayne Thiebaud, Roy De Forest, and sculptor Manuel Neri. My favorite medium is a blend of acrylics and oils. For variety I add paper to the canvas to create texture. I enjoy painting on canvas or paper with acrylics or watercolors. My love for animals, the ocean, sailing and nature are the focus for the settings I paint. Painting is the visual interpretation and writing is the written picture. Both artists and writers paint, one with a brush and the other with words. I believe we have a common bond that holds both mediums together in a mix that is called creativity. It's in the sharing of our creative energies that we get the most rewards, so please feel free to view my website at www.maryborges.com to learn more about my paintings and art books.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When Giles Hawick, minister of the Crown, reports that his lawyer fiancee, Angela Morgan, is missing, chief inspector John McLeish of London's New Scotland Yard is assigned to the case. Initially, the inspector believes Ms. Morgan has run away with another man--perhaps her married boss and lover. However, the boss is still very much in evidence and so is his wife, who, McLeish learns, knew about her husband's infidelity. After Angela's battered body is found, McLeish includes the couple on his list of suspects. Heading this list is Hawick, a man McLeish considers capable of murdering a two-timing lover, and Angela's sister, who is in love with Hawick. The dead woman was sleeping her way to the top, McLeish discovers, and casually destroying other people's lives in the process. The inspector relies on sound police tactics to force the murderer into the open, and finds that the victim fell prey to the world's oldest passion--greed.

Jane goes far beyond an exterior resemblance as she mirrors John, reaching into deeper, more mysterious realms. “In my very first moments of being my brother, I was already getting us mixed up.” Even the book design, with its reversed-type running header, emphasizes mirroring. Their shared passion for drums lands “Johnny” work, and Jane soon experiences this complex sensation: “my body felt more like John’s than mine . . . how the things done to it might reward or punish my brother instead of me.” This becomes problematic when dental technician April comes on to Johnny, and, although Jane’s excited and attracted, she must lie to avoid having sex. Inevitably, romantic entanglement and pain result in Krughoff’s fast-paced read that’s as daring and provocative as it is entertaining. --Whitney Scott", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is a beautifully crafted narrative about the human spirit and the power that we all hold to triumphantly soar beyond our own demons. It is an engaging tale about love and hate, passion and pain, violence and weakness, redemption and forgiveness ... and in the life journey of all its characteristics it draws us in to sometimes taking sides and at other times to feel the pain of being helpless observers. It engages us intellectually and sometimes drains us emotionally. And then it gently lifts the carpet from under our feet to take us on a magical ride into the mystical world of sufism; and from up there we witness just how much of our own strengths and weaknesses we've swept under the carpet, under the ground, out of sight! SoPhia gives us the courage to reach out from that carpet ride and to take hold of our strengths which we too often fear to discover. Though set in a Muslim household, SoPhia, like the South African film, Material, has the kind of narrative and characters that we can locate in every community and every culture. Its tale about taking ownership for our own lives is in deed universal.

Cantwell is the pen name for the wife/husband writing team of Barbara and Brian Cantwell, of Seattle. We lived 10 happy years in Portland, Ore., where our Portland Bookmobile Mysteries are set, but have always had family in Seattle, so we spent a lot of hours driving back and forth on I-5 -- perhaps the most boring three hours of freeway you'll find (on a cloudy day when the mountains aren't visible, which is most of the time). So after Barbara started writing a mystery novel, we got to talking out ideas and plot lines as we drove, trip after trip, and it became a joint effort. And it was, well, a hoot. Barbara worked on the bookmobile in Portland -- including a run into the scenic Columbia River Gorge -- and served as librarian to pretty much all the off-kilter characters you'll read about in \"Murdermobile.\" She's the big-idea half of the writing duo. Brian, a newspaper journalist, helps rein it in to reality (but not too far), helps fill out details and tends to the editing. Along the way, between the two of us, it's like we've created our own Imaginary Friends in protagonists Hester McGarrigle, the librarian on wheels, and Detective Nate Darrow, the OCD-ish, trail-running detective who drinks his coffee with way too much sugar. We're having great fun crafting cozy mysteries that are a little quirky, just like Portland. These days we live on a sailboat in Seattle, when we aren't at our cabin in Washington's San Juan Islands collaborating on our next book (or cleaning out gutters, or chopping firewood, or chasing squirrels away from the bird feeder).

Chief Inspector Percy Peach figures the elder O’Connor was probably killed by a local rival, given the shady nature of his business. But Dominic had distanced himself from his elder brother, so who killed him? Logic would dictate that the two deaths were connected, but as Percy struggles to make sense of the case, he is confronted by a surfeit of suspects, from unhappy, unfaithful wives to vengeful crime lords, the head of a local prostitution ring, and even hit men from the Provisional IRA. A clever story filled with red herrings combines with slick dialogue and plenty of authentic procedural details to make this an absorbing read, but it’s the irreverent, clever, menacing, almost frighteningly competent Percy who makes this series a winner. --Emily Melton", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tolkien, the wonders of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and comics featuring the Justice League, the X-Men, and the Avengers. From there sparked the desire to become a writer himself. Already an accomplished storyteller, spinning elaborate tales that often were at the heart of games played with his friends, brother and parents, Reed went on to hone his writing skills in high school and college. Before he would set heroes and villains on harrowing adventures, however, Reed pursued a career in academia and then in management consulting, graduating with a B.S. from Iowa State University and a PhD at the University of Kansas becoming a nationally and internationally published marketing scientist. This hands-on knowledge of, and interest in, economics, politics and science help shape the research and political speculation that set Reed's books apart.   When Reed is not writing, consulting, giving seminars, or making presentations, he can be found hunting, fishing, hiking, and camping. Reed and his two-and four-legged family members live amid chew toys, flora and fauna outside Kansas City.", "related": ["B00EP4FMXM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Certain terms can confuse little minds and they require a bit more help to understand them. This book talks about 'immigration' in a delightful manner that is oh-so appealing to the kids and so very understandable.\nI genuinely loved the book. Books with pictures and colors are the best way to get ideas and concepts across to children. The concept that the author wants to convey is put in such a beautiful and colorful way. The illustrations lend vibrancy to the story as well. There is no better way to attract a child to a story book than with pictures and colors. The images are simple with minimal lines to make the child understand without any confusion. The illustrator of the book, Milena Radeva, has done a wonderful job and she deserves a special mention.\nThe author has managed to explain the concept of aliens very well. The highlight of the story book is the way the author has handled the theme - with simplicity and clarity. It's a perfect example of how a concept should be put across to a child. I would recommend every library, especially school libraries, buy a copy of this book because every child will enjoy it and also because it can be so easily understood.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is very readable and interesting. It is able to explain things clearly without being too basic for the more experienced reader…There is more 'content' and more different approaches and perspectives than in other crisis management books. Other books seem repetitive, dry and one-note by comparison.” (Stephen C. Betts 2013-01-03)“I LOVE the basic premise: that crisis management should be integrated with strategic management. That beautifully underlies the authors' preferred framework, which in turn drives the text's organization and content. Too often, courses and texts are developed in silos, with strategic management being separated from organization theory and organization behavior and so on…This text takes an interdisciplinary approach to a set of critical problems that managers must consider and resolve in order to protect the interests of their employees, organizations, and communities.” (Lucy A. Arendt 2013-01-03)“I think the level of writing and presentation is excellent.” (Karen M. Leonard 2013-01-03)“The book was easy for [my students] to read and understand. It also provided good mini cases…The exercises and mini cases were very useful. However, the overall readability for students is what I found impressive and why I chose this book over others in the market.” (Tami Moser 2013-01-03)“Overall, I found the Crandall, Parnell and Spillan book appropriate in scope (not overly broad and general, but also not clearly narrow and specific). They focused in on essential information for an introductory book on crisis management, and the reader should be well informed just by reading this book. The writing style was straightforward, concise and business-like, with a professional conversational tone. I liked it, and found it easy to read this book and to stay engaged with the material. I think students will find it interesting, comprehensible, and appealing to read.” (Marcia J. Kurzynski Lock Haven 2013-01-03)“This book offers a logical and theoretical framework for crisis management, depicted in a visual model that is explained with real-world examples. The book expertly blends theory with real-world application in a manner that simply makes sense. Such an approach is extremely valuable when planning for crises as well as teaching how to plan for crises...The chapters then have a very real-world approach so the amount of theory is perfect!” (Dana Moore Gray 2013-01-03)“Excellent! That's why I have selected it as my text. The incorporation of strategy emphasizes the importance of crisis planning. It covers most of what I have traditionally emphasized in my courses. I particularly like its structure, breaking the process into stages and internal and external landscape. The text also covers the entire process of crisis management from sources and early warning to recovery...It covers the sequential unfolding of crises and as such, matches the way I teach and consult on CM. Very nicely done!” (David X. Swenson 2013-01-03)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And oh my, this book is a diamond in the rough.Stone and The Flower Dragon is about Stone, Jake's dragon friend, explaining to Jack about the deaths of Elementals (epic dragons who are based off of an element and who can only be killed if their element is wiped off the planet) and the folly of mankind's selfishness, and stupidity. Stone tells of how an elemental, The Flower Dragon, made the mistake of putting too much trust in humans.This book is breathtaking, even for being only, what, 10 pages long? The plot is really deep, and you can apply it to real life. The truth is that there is not an infinite amount of resources in the world, and when humans use it all up, it affects not only people, but the whole world. This book portrays the ignorance we have of the environment, and our surroundings. It really makes you think.Since I have read this book, I really, really need to get my hands on Dark Peak - GoodreadsEssential reading -I loved this story. It tackles several issues head on and is narrated through the elderly voice of an otherwise ageless dragon... Global warming, genuine human quests, the disregard of nature for the fulfilment of profits are all discussed in the story. The pace is speedy and accordingly, my natural reading pace quickened. A good Xmas or birthday gift. I simply loved it! - iTunesGreat short story -I love the characters in Dark Peak and it's good to have another injection of them until the next book comes out. The writing is elegant, intelligent and mature - in short well written.

Houle is a middle-school student with an amazing imagination. When he approached his mother, author J.E. Taylor, with the idea for a trilogy about the son of Death, well she couldn’t resist the incredible story line William created and agreed to work with him to craft his idea into words. Thus Don’t Fear the Reaper was born. J.E. Taylor is a writer, a publisher, an editor, a manuscript formatter, a mother, a wife and a business analyst, not necessarily in that order.  She first sat down to seriously write in February of 2007 after her daughter asked: “Mom, if you could do anything, what would you do?” From that moment on, she hasn’t looked back and now her writing resume includes six+ published novels along with several short stories on the virtual shelves including a few within eXcessica anthologies. In addition to being co-owner of Novel Concept Publishing (www.novelconceptpublishing), Ms. Taylor also moonlights as a Senior Editor of Allegory (www.allegoryezine.com), an online venue for Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror.

For a\nfew years, I took part in a writing group. Every Tuesday evening we'd meet at\nsomeone's house or apartment, talk about writing, and try a few writing\nexercises. Usually someone pulled the writing topics out of a box. We'd all\nwritten a variety of topics taken from books and our own imagination and\nwritten them down on slips of paper for the box.On this particular evening over ten year ago (that's right),\nthe slip of paper taken from the box had one word-marbles.Marbles. Hmmm. I didn't want to write about a game of\nmarbles, mostly because I don't know how to play the game and that seemed\nobvious anyway. The sound of marbles came to mind. I heard the sound of marbles\nhitting a wood floor. I saw them clattering down wooden stairs. And I wondered\nwhy would marbles spill down a staircase? Someone dumped them on the stairs. I began to write.And I had to decide why someone would dump a jar full of\nmarbles? That the marbles were in a jar seemed a given. I don't know why. Well, someone would do this if she were angry, and so they\nprobably weren't her marbles. The marbles had to belong to someone else and she\nwas angry at this person.Who would that person be? Her brother. If you had access to someone's marble\ncollection, you were most likely in that person's house. And it made sense that\nthen this girl had to be angry at her brother because that's what siblings do\nwhen they're angry at each other-mess with each other's things.I kept writing.How old are they? Who is younger and who am I rooting for?\nWhy was she angry? She was 16 and he was older. And I was rooting for her. She\nhad every right to be angry with him. He was a terrible brother. He was a\nnightmare of a brother. Why was that?And time was up. I liked that beginning enough to keep working on it. And\nbefore too long I kept asking myself questions and each answer gave me more to\nwrite. The result is a novel.At one point it was very different. I gave that version to\nseveral friends, and so they might think they know this story, but I've changed\nit a lot. At one point the novel mushroomed to 130,000, maybe 140,000 words. I\ncut it down to 90,000 words. I added another 10,000 words. I cut a character\nand added a new character. I killed a character, and then brought her back.I had one ending. Cut that. Wrote a new ending. Cut that.\nWrote the ending that is finally in the book.The one thing that didn't changed was the marbles. All these\nyears later, they still open story. They still clatter down wooden stairs.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is an affirmation of the movement towards understanding AS in females, and a celebration of the culture of AS womanhood. Simone writes with passion, honesty and truth - sharing both the challenges and the joys of a woman's life on the spectrum through her own observations and the voices of other women. It is rich with stories and strategies to be read and re-read as reminders, mantras and as a map for embarking on the journey of being a woman with AS. Above all, it is a much-needed book about permission, empowerment, and as Simone so eloquently states, moving beyond the mutism.

A Levels and a stint at the City of London College in Moorgate where she underwent a Secretarial and Business Studies course, were designed to launch her onto the scene as an impressive PA. Marriage and three children somewhat deflected her from that career path although she did finally get to reshape her skills once her children were at school. She has wanted to write for almost as long as she can remember and her teenage years were filled with half started manuscripts usually based around Georgette Heyer's Regency romances. She continued to scribble away over the years, finishing half a dozen novels along the way - but these never seemed to find their way out of the large drawer into which she stuffed them in her study. Her debut novel, Cry From The Grave, is a crime novel - although there is just a touch of romance in there to keep the Romantic in her satisfied. People always wonder what gives an author the idea for their book, and for Carolyn it's the, 'What If', scenario. She is drawn to the idea of how dramatically our lives can change in an instant - due to some random happening that could never have been foreseen. But although her topics can be hard hitting, she veers away from darkness in her writing, and likes to have a strong, independent protagonist who wins out in the end.

December 28, 2013A fun book to read with your grandchildren. My nearly 8 yr old grandson found it funny and fun to read. It was perfect for his reading level (3rd grade). I learned, as did he, some interesting facts how animals communicate. We initially knew about how our pets communicate withus and each other, but we learn that animals have such instinctive abilities to love, protect and share with each other. We are lookinig forward to going to the zoo and observe the animals more carefully. No wonder we can hear the lion at the opposite end of the zoo. He is \"king\"!!! Super pictures that are fun to watch and perhaps imitate. Refreshing to learn something from a child's book about real animals with personalities and survival skills.*****Niki Bullas reviewed Talk to Me: How Animals Talk to Each Other   Fun and informative November 9, 2013  I really enjoyed learning new facts about animal communication. It's amazing what passes us by if we don't take the time to watch the world around us.. This book reminds us that it's not just about humans - we share this planet with so many other living creatures. And we all share the same emotions: love, fear, anger, compassion. I think the days have long gone when people thought, and truly believed, that they \"are only animals and of course they don't think or feel emotions!\" Thankfully!

I don't know why God has blessed me with such a wondrous gift—the all-consuming, joyful need to write—but I will be forever grateful. My writing path is as unique as my name. It started something like this:               \"You want me to do what, Lord?\" The same challenge repeated in my mind. Had it come from God, truly? Was it even possible to hear God so clearly in the twenty-first century? I don't recall the exact words, but I do remember the exact impression they left in me. I suddenly understood Moses's hesitation. God wanted me to do something I hadn't been educated to do and hadn't even thought of doing before now. Write. Novels. Now, this hadn't come from out of nowhere. It had come about through a series of specific prayers to God. Prayers like this: \"Lord, now that I've finished the one thing I know you put me on this earth to do, what's next?\"—The 'one thing' God had long ago requested of me was to raise our four sons as decent, godly men. And, through many long years, with lots of difficulties and equal shares of delight, the task was done. Both my husband and myself can now look upon our handsome, and very tall, sons, with pride. They are wonderful, and they love God. Done. Now what? So you see, my new-found writing career sprouted not in my childhood, or even my adulthood, but in my seniorhood (if there were such a word). Though I must admit, the roots of my passion do reach back to a childhood filled with imagination. I remember creating a constant stream of romances in my head, with the hope that each could one day be mine. Well, I'm happy to say, I am living my own romance story. I have a wonderful husband of forty years, and along the way came the four strapping sons, two daughters-in-law, two granddaughters and one grandson. So far. Now that our children are grown, my husband and I reside in Cowboy Capital of the World—Oakdale, California. I adore writing and am fully committed to it. I must say, the majority of that commitment is due to the reality that God directed my steps to do it. So, with that being said, I hope you enjoy my stories as much as I have loved creating them.

I've never bought into putting what I do in one genre or making stereotypical characters. Recently I was asked what genre my books were in and to tell someone what my characters were like. That's a hard thing to answer because when I write a story, I never care about what genre it may fall into or what people may think a certain character should be like. I care about telling stories and creating characters that are as complex as people are in real life. I love to tell stories that involve all of the joy and pain that we all go through in life. Sure, I write fiction, so a lot of it is unbelievable, but that's not the point. I want my characters to have a life outside of whatever they do for a living, and I want their love life to be as big of a part of their story as it is for us. I also want them to doubt what they're doing at times. I've never liked characters that were completely stoic all the time. I like characters who can love, fear, and overcome all in the same storyline. When I'm not writing books, you can find me doing all sorts of things. I love music and movies, and I take any chance I can get to travel and expand my own little world.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He kept right up next to us, ducking under to go\nfrom side to side, making us run back and forth across the deck. And then, once\nhe got tired of playing with his dinner, he submerged. Sonar pegged him at a\nstraight vertical from surface down to four hundred feet before he reversed and\ncharged back at the surface. If we were doing thirty-five knots, he was doing\nfifty or more with ease, straight into us. My\nGod... There\nwas a lot of that going around that day. Or might have been, had more of the\ncrew survived. That one hit split the ship in half. An entire cruiser, split\nstraight up the middle like it wasn't more than a popsicle stick, from one\nblow. And he didn't even take any damage. [Rubs\ngently on the curved upper jaw.] These\nthings were like tanks, and nothing we had could stop them. You remember the\nEnterprise, the Gerald Ford-class aircraft carrier? Yes,\nI-- Eleven\nhundred feet long. Carried close to a hundred aircraft. A hundred thousand ton\ndisplacement. Over four thousand crew, and armed with the best technology we\nhad ever produced. Yes-- Gone\nin less than an hour. Straight down to the bottom. And she was just the first.\nNot even her nuclear reactors going critical did more than kill a handful of\nthe leviathans that attacked her. Less than an hour and she was gone. [Pauses\nfor a long moment before pulling the tarp back over the skull. All trace of\nlevity is gone.] The\nseas are barren and our civilization's been toppled. And they saywewon\nthe war.", "related": ["B00K31USUS"], "rank": 1403545, "title": "Drake", "author": "Mike Kraus", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 32.0}

Much of the action centers on the evil, enslaved Cardinal Verselli and his maniacal assistant, the Benedictine monk Brother Igor, who commit heinous crimes under cover of darkness in order to satisfy their vampiric needs. Verselli, who was transformed into a vampire by the ancient goddess Dragona'ra, keeps order in his Vatican realm by sending all those who might betray his infernal secrets to an asylum on the outskirts of Rome, where they're lobotomized. Dragona'ra, like numerous higher-ups of the papal city-state, is engaged in organized crime and drug dealing, but she's also motivated by a deeper urge to preserve and expand her empire, which she believes is threatened. When her magic staffs are stolen, she travels directly to the Vatican, where she takes revenge by torturing and killing the incumbent Pope John Paul IV. A small group of people on the side of good—some human, some supernatural—must travel from Italy to China and back to circumvent the forces of evil, who have planted a symbolic, vampiric blackthorn tree in front of St. Peter's Basilica. This unrelentingly outlandish, gory novel moves quickly, incorporating aspects of the horror, spy-thriller, sci-fi and fantasy genres while also invoking elements of Roman Catholicism. It manages to be successful in all the genres it adopts, but it sometimes pushes the limits of believability. Similarly, the plot sometimes loses momentum amid its tangle of subplots and characters. That said, the overall story is often vibrant, disturbing and entertaining.A complex, fast-paced tale of crime, faith and fantasy set in a world in which \"[t]he Lord maketh darkness, just as He maketh the light.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
