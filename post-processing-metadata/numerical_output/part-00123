She avoids eye contact with others, stutters badly, is presumed to be slow at school, and likens herself to a stone, hard and strong way down inside. Taken out of school during ninth grade by her shiftless mother, she is dropped off at the rural New England home of Great-aunt Agatha while mother and her boyfriend depart for places out west. This lonely, virtually invisible girl both misses and resents her absent parent. The short, image-rich, first-person chapters echo Cornelia's anger and stubbornness as she describes her new living situation with the folksy, forthright Agatha. They argue, stop talking, and Cornelia even packs her bag to run away. What brings these unlikely companions back together is their grudging interdependence and Cornelia's recognition that nature-loving Agatha, locally dubbed the Crow Lady, has been as misunderstood as she. Cornelia begins to see her aunt's kindness through the eyes of Bo, a local girl whose nonjudgmental friendship helps Cornelia to grow. Subtle clues indicate that Agatha has been good at hiding the fact that she's illiterate, much as Cornelia has hidden the fact that she is a voracious reader. Agatha allows her niece to teach her to read using a butterfly handbook as a primer. The depiction of Bo's father as a fearsome, controlling man is the only false note in a novel that poetically portrays the human potential to fly after emerging from a cocoon of neglect.Susan W.

That's it! Toss back that glorious mane of yours and smile. Smile up at the child. She's your daughter, remember. Higher! Lift her higher! Perfect! That's beautiful, darling! Bea-u-ti-ful!'The gushing praise from the cameraman was as synthetic, Libby thought, as the relationship between herself and the giggling baby suspended high above her head. Like the nickname someone had given her at the outset of her career that had helped propel her up the ladder to supermodel status following a chance discovery at a small fashion show she had paraded in for a local charity.What did it matter to the Press and the public that she was weary of pretending? That behind the shining trademark of her heavy red hair, the clothes and make-up and the pure artifice in standing in a summer meadow, promoting an exclusive range of skincare, which purported to make her skin as soft as that of any baby's, she was still just Libby Vincent. Or rather Vincenzo, she thought with a pained mental grimace. An average girl from an average background, who couldn't run away from who she really was no matter how hard she tried, or from the far from average burden of guilt she carried everywhere.'OK! That's it! Beautiful, darling. Perfect!'With an indiscernible sigh, she brought her arms down and the child with them, mercifully relieved that the shoot was over. She didn't think she could have endured another second.The snowy fabric of her peasant skirt brushed her slender calves as she trudged back through the long grass. The baby she was reluctantly cradling crooned up at her, revealing two small white teeth, its little button nose wrinkling as it grasped her camisole with one tiny pink hand.Libby dragged air through her lungs, a longing of such intensity sweeping over her that for an endless moment she couldn't seem to breathe as she fought the urge to clasp the infant fiercely to her.Keeping a tight rein on her galloping emotions, her flawless features rigid as stone, somehow she made it back to the mobile make-up unit, where the rest of the team were waiting.'Here.' The emotion clogging her throat made her sound decidedly curt as she thrust the child towards its mother, while the baby, obviously sensing the tension in Libby, began to bawl, her eager little arms outstretched as the other woman took her, leaving Libby to spin determinedly away.'Isn't she a cutie?' Fran, a mature brunette with two growing boys of her own, couldn't help drooling as Libby approached, seeking only the seclusion of the huge green trailer behind them.Beneath the make-up that Fran had applied so expertly earlier, Libby's face felt like a tight, tense mask. 'If you say so.''You'd forgotten, Fran.' It was the cynical voice of Steve Cullum, one of the technicians who had once asked Libby out and received the same polite brush-off for which she was renowned with the opposite sex. 'Blaze doesn'tdomaternal. Or any other sort of relationship for that matter.'It was something the Press often speculated about. Her past. The lack of men in her life. Even, at times, her sexuality.\"Beneath the fire, is there only ice?\"one tabloid newspaper had printed after she had refused to give them an interview, share with them her views on love, on marriage, on children.And why should she? she thought bitterly now. These things were private. Which was why, unsurprisingly, they had never found out her real name, never been able to connect her with Luca.Anguish speared her as she thought about the boy she had married; about the tragic waste of life when he'd been killed in that car accident less than a year later. She had loved Luca; had had plenty of thoughts and feelings then. But that was a long time ago, before her emotions had been numbed by events and actions that were too damning even to think about; when loving had come naturally and she'd believed that happiness was everyone's birthright—even hers.Inwardly she ridiculed herself for her gross naïvety. Because of course that was before she had met the prejudice and disapproval of the Vincenzo family. Before she'd felt his father's tyranny; known the cutting censure of Luca's darkly commanding older brother.A prickly sensation lifted the hairs on the back of her neck as the disturbing features of Romano Vincenzo reared up before her eyes. A man who was lethally attractive and ruthlessly uncompromising. A man definitely not to be crossed. It hadn't just been mutual dislike that she had shared with Romano Vincenzo. It had been something more. Something much stronger and intensely profound that she had never been able to put a name to, and which she certainly wasn't going to waste any time wondering about six years on.It was all in the past, and over the years she had become adept at hiding her emotions, which she did now, crushing her unwelcome reverie beneath a bright smile as Fran asked, 'Are you coming to the party tonight, Blaze?''You try and stop me!' It was a first-rate performance she was giving and she knew it; knew also that it was one she would have to keep up until she could change, get back to the Porsche and slam out of there, away from the turmoil of her unwelcome thoughts; of memories—resurrected by a simple skin-cream commercial— which she couldn't bear to face. 'After a week of staying in every night, getting up at four am and coming here to be bitten by mosquitoes,' she forced out laughingly over her shoulder, 'I'm going to party till dawn!'* * *Well, what had he been expecting? Romano thought, standing there in the trailer, when Libby, not looking where she was going, almost collided with him. That she had changed?He caught her small gasp, felt her warmth and closeness and the pure femininity of her washing over him on a sensual wave.'Buon giorno, Libby.'His senses, normally so controlled, were leaping into overdrive, making his heart race, his voice take on a husky quality as he watched the colour drain from the smooth texture of her high, Slavic cheekbones, saw her lush red mouth open in a gesture of pure shock.'I'm sorry, Blaze…' Fran's voice followed her in, quickly contrite, breaking in on the whirling chaos of her thoughts. 'I meant to tell you. I'm sorry, Mr Vincenzo…' The woman's tone had changed in deference to the tall, tanned Italian hunk looming there in the aperture of her mobile studio and whose dark designer suit couldn't conceal the hard masculinity of the man beneath. 'I hadn't forgotten you were waiting…'Romano's sleek black hair gleamed like jet as he gave a curt nod before reaching around the stunned Libby and pulling the trailer's sliding door closed with a rattling firmness that blocked out Fran and the rest of the world.He hadn't changed, some small functioning part of Libby silently acknowledged. A high-profile entrepreneur, with that overall impression of lithe fitness and impeccable style, he still dominated any room he happened to walk into, still held sway over others with that bred-in-the bone confidence and effortless authority.'Wh-what areyoudoing here?' Struck by the ridiculous notion that her thoughts must have conjured him up, Libby found herself as she'd always been in this man's company, a mixture of tongue-tied nervousness and challenging rebellion. And then, as shock receded and rational thought took over, she was urging in a voice strung with blind panic, 'What's wrong? What is it? Is something the matter?'Some racing emotion darkened the long green eyes gazing up at him from beneath their rich mahogany lashes as they had done from the covers of countless glossy magazines over the years.'Not that I know of.'He saw her eyes close, the pressing of those long, feathery lashes against the alabaster skin a response he understood and accepted, though not without a measure of surprise.'How long have you been here?' Weak-kneed with relief— from this unexpected encounter with Luca's brother—Libby tried to get a grip on her errant thoughts.'Long enough.'His deeply-accented voice was as rich as she remembered it, his face as hard-boned and as classically structured, from his high intellectual forehead, straight nose and that forceful, darkly shadowed jaw to those penetrating black eyes that had always seemed to probe right down into the depths of her soul.Her nostrils flaring, guardedly she demanded, 'Why didn't you make yourself known?'His wide masculine mouth compressed, a mouth that could curl with disdain or make a woman's bones melt in the blaze of one smile. 'And miss watching the nation's loveliest model playing at doting motherhood?'His double-edged compliment hit home hard and she swept determinedly past him, the brush of his jacket as their shoulders collided sending a tingling friction across her bare skin.She gave a nonchalant little shrug, her feelings held on a throttle-tight leash. 'It isn't a role I'd normally have chosen.' In fact she had tried to refuse the job, but it was her agent who had warned her of the inadvisability of turning down such opportunities and who had won in the end.Something flickered in Romano's eyes beneath his midnight-black lashes.'Is that why you handed the kid over like she was a sack of potatoes?''Did I?' It was hard trying to pretend he wasn't unsettling her when even to her own ears her voice was shaking. 'I thought I was being careful.'The firm mouth tugged downwards. 'As careful as you were when you handed over Giorgio?''Giorgi?' The name escaped her like a helpless little plea. He'd said there was nothing wrong, but something had to be because in all these years he had never chosen to patronise her with so much as a social call. 'He's all right, isn't he?'It was only a heartbeat before he answered, and yet it seemed an eternity.'That hasn't worried you for the past six years. So why should it suddenly concern you now?'She couldn't tell him how much she had grieved for the baby son she had been forced to hand over so cruelly; how much she ached to see him, know him, her concern for his welfare and her need to be with him an excruciating pain that t...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

D. McKinney creates a powerful and compelling debut novel, Dancing In The Dark. This marvelous dark romantic fantasy is filled with vibrant characters who resonate with the reader--a criminal profiler, his vampire mistress, and a vicious serial killer--along with an eccentric, colorful supporting cast. The author weaves a rich tapestry reflecting the faded elegance of New Orleans in all its decadent glory. T. D. McKinney presents the sinister twists and turns of a serial killer's mind with accuracy and flare. This is an author who really did their research. It shows in the wonderful details of criminal profiling. Dancing In The Dark has a future as a best seller, and T. D. McKinney is an author to watch.\"--John Douglas, New York Times best-selling author of Mindhunter, Journey Into Darkness, Man Down, and many others\"With a protagonist that might have been lifted straight from the life of legendary profiler John Douglas, Dancing In The Dark delves deep into the mind of Special Agent Jack Niemzcyk as he discovers that there is more than just criminals hunting humanity in the night. Frustrated by a case that seems to be going nowhere and leadership that seems determined to thwart him at every turn, Jack starts his own private investigation aided by New Orleans Homicide Detective Remy Lambert and Baby, the Queen of New Orleans. What begins as business rapidly becomes personal. Baby and Jack's spiral into love and lust is a delicious treat both for the jaded FBI profiler and the reader. Dancing In The Dark has so many twists and turns that by the end of the book, you're panting for more. Hopefully, it won't be long before The Shield and the Darkness Book Two appears to satisfy the craving for more of Jack and Baby.\"--MeriBeth McCombs, Professional Reviewer", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Brenton remembers that the main power chip was still live when they pitched the machine into the Grand Canyon, and the friends believe that the powerful component has never been recovered. The kids decide to retrieve the chip, but discover that two old adversaries are also interested. Ronnie, the school bully, wants to build a similar contraption, and con-man Richard Milner has a more sinister scheme in mind. When the children's teacher proposes a treasure-hunting expedition into the heart of the canyon, the four are excited, but they find that Ronnie and Milner have the chip and are also after the Egyptian artifacts that are rumored to be hidden in the park. Slightly darker than the first book,Returnalso has some welcome touches of humor, particularly concerning the online religious cult the kids start as a prank. There is a lot going on here–lost Egyptian hoards, Japanese gangsters, even model rocketry, but it all comes together. The unconventional and challenging narrative consists entirely of excerpts from police interviews (conducted after the treasure-hunting expedition, when one character is killed) that depict the action from multiple viewpoints.

D. Gann continues to be one of the most controversial figures in technical analysis, many of his theories have been successfully adapted by several generations of traders.In this fully revised and updated Second Edition of Pattern, Price & Time, expert technician James Hyerczyk presents an accessible overview of Gann Theory, its basic principles, and its proper application to real markets. And while Gann's concepts are a prominent part of the book, Hyerczyk adds some of his own original ideas to the discussion and offers insights into using technical analysis to trade today's Forex, futures, and equities markets.Written with both the expert and aspiring trader in mind, this reliable resource skillfully examines the key elements of technical analysis—pattern, price, and time—by highlighting the proven trading techniques of Gann, and explores how these three elements can help you anticipate market movements and make more informed trading decisions. Unlike other analysis or trading disciplines, Gann analysis can be used in conjunction with other popular trading tools such as pivot points and candlestick charts.  In fact, Pattern, Price & Time, Second Edition is written so that the reader can use Gann techniques to complement most trading strategies. The procedures highlighted will enhance a trader's ability to make sound market decisions because it teaches the importance of balancing analysis with the right amount of pattern, price, and time.Opening with a brief introduction to Gann, his theory, and the importance of having accurate data and charts, Pattern, Price & Time, Second Edition moves on to address other essential issues associated with this discipline, including:Building swing charts using the minor trend, the intermediate trend, and the main trendUsing horizontal support and resistance levels to find balance points in the marketCalculating Gann angles for different marketsUnderstanding the various ways that time can be used to determine tops, bottoms, and changes—from the most difficult method (natural cycles) to the most popular method (the squaring of time)Combining pattern, price, and time into an effective analysis and trading toolAnd much moreAfter the first edition of Pattern, Price & Time was published, Hyerczyk received criticism that he was holding back on Gann's secrets. This couldn't be further from the truth, and in order to prove this, Hyerczyk points traders, who want to study the metaphysical aspects of Gann analysis, in the right direction. Hyerczyk also reveals what he believes is the source of Gann's Law of Vibration and, in an effort to further enhance your trading performance, includes a link to the TradeStation code for his trend indicator. This will allow you to create swing charts in the same manner as W. D. Gann.To profitably trade today's markets, you can't rely on pattern, price, or time independently. You must apply a combination of these three elements to improve your analysis and trading—and with the Second Edition of Pattern, Price & Time as your guide, you'll quickly discover exactly how.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Xavier Torturo, a quiet but ambitious seminarian in rural Italy, gets entrusted with an ancient occult text about the translation of powers from the dead to the living. Soon thereafter, a relic of Saint Anthony disappears from its shrine, and Xavier—coincidentally?—shows the power to heal by the laying on of hands. Combining his newly developed talent for miracles with secular skills of blackmail and manipulation, Torturo secures his ticket to the Vatican, where his underlings' excesses and his own past indiscretions ultimately precipitate his swift and gruesome downfall. Connell paints a scabrous portrait of the Vatican as a site of absolute power that corrupts absolutely, but there's little to his story that hasn't been seen in more inventively plotted works. Its transgressive spirit notwithstanding, the novel is a highly moral tale of sins avenged and wrongs redressed, played out in a setting reeking of incense and decadence.(Dec.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Solid reads by lesser known talents include Sarah Cortez's poignant Houston story, \"Montgomery Clift\"; Jessica Power's gripping \"Preacher's Kid\"; and Bobby Byrd's bone-chilling El Paso ode, \"The Dead Man's Wife,\" more horror than noir. Some will wonder why the editors missed genre writers known for their Texas settings such as Sandra Brown, Jon Land, Jan Grape, Scott Cupp, Bill Crider, Laurie Moore, Nic Pizzolatto, and Lewis Shiner.

As the special United States envoy for Afghanistan, Mr. Dobbins was responsible for finding and installing a successor to the Taliban after they were toppled in 2001. During the 1990's, Mr. Dobbins hop-scotched from one trouble spot to another as he served as special envoy to Kosovo, Bosnia, Haiti and Somalia. So when he offers a critique of the Bush administration's nation-building effort in Iraq, it is worth paying attention. Now out of government, Mr. Dobbins, who has worked for Republican as well as Democratic administrations, does not have a partisan ax to grind.New York TimesPolicy recommendations contained in this study should be taken to heart and then further researched and refined for future use.Graham DayJames Dobbins' 'America's Role in Nation-Building' must become essential reading among Washington's bureaucrats and in all six American war colleges. The author, an experienced nation-building (or reconstruction) practitioner, and his co-authors have written a no-nonsense, spare, well-analyzed and lucid volume that illuminates the path for those engaged in this difficult and thankless, but necessary mission. The authors cover two successes, Germany and Japan; two abject failures, Haiti and Somalia; Bosnia, a 'mixed success'; Kosovo, a 'modest success'; and one case too early to tell, Afghanistan.

He was converted to Christ at the age of 19 and then felt called to the Gospel ministry, but the doors of opportunity for study and ministry did not open immediately. He then got a job in a bank. When he was 21 years old, he left the bank and went to college, graduating as a mechanical engineer. He continued as a professional draftsman for a while, then he became a teacher of the blind. Later, failing health compelled him to give up his teaching career. After a prolonged rest, he became a manufacturer. When he was converted he had become a member of the Episcopal Church, but in 1882,he became a Baptist and was ordained as a Baptist minister two years later. He went directly from business into the ministry. His first charge was at Kennett Square, Pennsylvania; his second pastorate was at Fox Chase, Pennsylvania, where he remained for 20 years. He was not a premillennialist at the time of his ordination, but his study of the Scriptures, with the help of some books that fell into his hands, led him to adopt the premillennialist position. He began to make large wall charts, which he titled, \"\"Prophetic Truth,\"\" for use in the pulpit. These led to his being invited to teach, in connection with his pastoral work, in two Bible institutes. During this time he published a number of prophetical charts, which were widely circulated. When World War I broke out in 1914, he was called on for addresses on The War and Prophecy. Then God laid it on his heart to prepare a work on Dispensational Truth (or God's Plan and Purpose in the Ages), containing a number of charts with descriptive matter. He spent three years of his life designing and drawing the charts and preparing the text. The favorable reception it has had since it was first published in 1918 seems to indicate that the world was waiting for such a book. Because it had a large and wide circulation in this and other lands, the first edition was soon exhausted. It was followed by a second edition, and then, realizing that the book was of permanent value, Larkin revised it and expanded it, printing it in its present form. He went to be with the Lord on January 24, 1924.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His search takes him to Cliveden, the home of the wealthy Astors. Edward doesn’t know it at first, but his fiancée, journalist Verity Browne, has been asked by the Communist Party (of which she is a member) to get close to the American ambassador, Joseph Kennedy, who just happens to be a guest at Cliveden. Murder and mayhem quickly ensue, and it’s only the quick thinking of Edward and Verity that keep both of them from being added to the list of victims. This is the ninth in the Corinth/Browne series, and it’s a real corker. Roberts juggles fictional and factual characters nimbly, seamlessly inserting his two leads into real events.

I had gained the weight slowly over ten years or so. I've always loved food, but I was disconnected from how it made me feel. And, looking back, I had many obsessive food behaviors. I ate when happy, when depressed, when bored...I'd eat cheese as a snack before going to bed and wondered why I burped so much.I drank a lot of coffee and twitched in my sleep.I ate a lot. Some good food, some bad.I tried to lose weight through exercise -- I ran 4 times a week or so while smoking 3-4 packs a day.My weight bobbed up and down.My knees hurt.My sickness landed me in the hospital for a couple of weeks, followed by a few months of recovery. My near death experience highlighted my need for a spiritual life -- at the time, I had none. My legs were weak and I was completely out of shape. I needed to do something. I was grateful for being alive and wanted to continue that condition.My girlfriend (now my wife) suggested I go to a yoga class with her -- so I went. I had no real desire -- no expectations for myself. The only thing I had on my mind was that a lot of women did yoga, so I probably would be out of place. I didn't know it at the time, but I was completely unattached to the result. I just did it.It was fantastic.I started doing yoga regularly and really felt it was changing me. I started to eat differently. Gained the willpower I had been lacking. As I physically opened myself, the weight fell into place.My stress level lowered. How stressed had I been, anyway? I think I was in a constant state of stress.I was not doing a strenuous practice. But I did it every single day. I have to admit -- I thought that's what everyone did. Like music lessons: I would go to class, learn some things, then try them at home. I didn't realize this wasn't always the case. Also,I wasn't a \"natural.\" I couldn't sit comfortably. No range of motion. Things others did effortlessly, I considered impossible. But I did it anyway.I put myself on a new eating regimen which progressed all the time. Got addicted to various foods, and unaddicted again. This time there was a difference. I was aware of it. By practicing yoga every day the awareness came. The desire for awareness came, too. I wanted to know more and more about food. How much and what did I really need to eat?The pounds came off. My diet evolved into this beautiful thing. I got rid of most of my addictive behavior. I enjoyed my practice. I got into my spiritual self through reading and meditation. Just bowing at the end of my practice and thanking the universe for letting me be alive changed me.Awareness of more subtle aspects of my health and nature continue to reveal themselves to me. A taste of peace can effect your entire self. Developing regular practice gave me that. That is how I lost the weight.Now I continue on my path, sharing the little I discovered with others and trying to continue uncovering myself. I still have my food weaknesses. I still eat too much sometimes. I still stress sometimes -- but it feels different than before.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a first novel it shows much promise of great works to come. The writing style is atmospheric, chatty and comfortable. It will appeal to those who lean towards wiccan principles and earth worship. The story begins gently towards an incremental crescendo of heightened emotions in an all too believable tale, which adds to its allure. The use of archetypal characters woven into a modern supernatural tale works well in this case. The artwork on the cover of the book invites you into the mystery to stay awhile, and with the right production team it would probably make a good drama for television. --Jade AshcroftHow to start...this book is wonderful. From page one you are drawn into the story. Ceri has expertly brought together history and fantasy to spin a fantastic tale, as good as any bard from the time of our ancestors. Ceri weaves a tale of two souls entwined through history and reunited in the 21st century but followed by the same malignant energies that destroyed them both in ancient times. More of the plot I dare not disclose but if, like me, you love stories encompassing old world history and the addition of modern mystery then this is a must read! I haven't been able to put it down! To do this book justice it must be read.

A large number of articles can be counted as landmarks of American letters and intellectual life. Agree with it or disagree with it, Commentary cannot be ignored.

He was born in Philadelphia August 12, 1859 and died June 1936. A public school education was all the academic training he had. But, as a young man, he was hard working , consecrated and sought the best God had for him. He served as assistant secretary of the Philadelphia Young Men's Christian Association in 1884-86 so efficiently that he became state secretary for the YMCA in Ohio, serving from 1886 to 1895. In this period he developed a quiet style of devotional speaking which was quite the opposite of the powerful forensics which dominated the pulpit style of that period.      \"Gordon then took four years to visit the mission fields of the Orient and to tour Europe on speaking missions. His quiet manner, simplicity, illustrative quality and gentle spirit won for him a great following wherever he went. \"Quiet Talks on Power\" was his first book, published by Fleming H. Revell in 1901. Gordon was then forty-two. His \"Quiet Talks on Prayer\" followed in 1904, \"Quiet Talks on Service\" and \"Quiet Talks about Jesus\", in 1906. The demand for his books had grown so great that he could produce two in a year and follow thereafter with one series of Quiet Talks each year until 1915 when the first World War disrupted everything. After the war he resumed his Quiet Talks in books but not at the same speed. Altogether he produced twenty-five books, twenty-two of which belonged to the Quiet Talks series.      \"An incessant and tireless itinerant, Gordon never lacked for opportunities to preach. He never called himself a preacher, preferring the title of lecturer. In a real sense he was unique. His manner of speaking, never dull, always illustrated by parabolic stories, had gripping power to hold the attention and stir the heart.\"", "related": ["B00DDHE1BG"], "rank": 24216, "title": "Quiet Talks on the Crowned Christ of Revelation", "author": "S.

She was an adorable ball of fur and I was truly enamored with her; but she cameduring a \"high stress\" period in my life. I was very selfish and self centered. The only thing that I was concerned about was me. I did not have any restrictionsin life. I was single and I lived alone and could come and go as I pleased. But with the addition of Chloe came responsibilities. One responsibility that I hate inparticular is house cleaning. I could no longer leave items lying around because they would soon become her chew toy. My every decision from that moment wasaffected by another living creature. The bottom line was this: I had to grow up.My after-work excursions to the mall, dinners with friends, impromptu errands, etc. all ended abruptly because Chloe needed to be fed, walked and loved.There was never a time that I resented Chloe. Initially, however, there was resistance to change on both ends. I really did not feel like taking the time to give her the attention she needed and deserved. And Ms. Chloe was determined to live life with me on her own terms, which meant she would get the time and attention she both needed and deserved.If Chloe was mad at me, she made sure that I knew it. I punished her by sending her to her kennel, but that was no punishment at all, but a joy. In those first fewmonths she loved the kennel because it kept her away from me. When she was really angry, Chloe would defy me by using my bed as a bathroom and destroying select items of clothing (usually the most expensive ones). Our relationship deteriorated into a battle of wills. The problem we both faced was that we had each met our match in the other. At one point, the constant conflict became so unbearable that I gave her away. Our parting lasted for two days. I was miserable without my Chloe. I think she felt the same. Both humbled by our \"separation\" we gave living together another try. After many months of compromise and adjustments on both ends, we fell in love with each other. Five years later, Chloe and I understand each other better than we ever have. It's amazing the things andevents that God will use to teach you about yourself. And daily that is where I have found myself. In the midst of watching, teaching, or disciplining Chloe; simultaneously the Lord was doing the same to me. It was as if I were looking in a mirror at a four legged version of myself. What an ego booster! At least she iscute, that is a plus.This book is my attempt to share those lessons that God taught me through my \"parenting\" Chloe. I hope the following \"snapshots\" from my life with Chloebring you joy and laughter. But more importantly, I hope they afford you the opportunity to be transformed into a better and more complete you, as they did for me. To that end, at the close of each chapter I have provided \"challenges, lessons, and nuggets\" which are designed to encourage you to apply, learn from, and think about (respectively) the principles introduced in that chapter.Who knew that a dog could teach you how to love and live a better life? At least she is cheaper thantherapy...then again, maybe not.Enjoy,Judi & Chloe", "related": [], "rank": 4014912, "title": "The Chloe Chronicles Life Lesson's I Learned From My Cocker Spaniel", "author": "Judi Mason", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Mr. Washington allows the reader to feel emotions on various topics and his first book \"JUST SPEAKING MY MIND, Spoken Word Poetry Vol.1\" has maintained a five star rating from the readers as it continues to touch lives all across the country. He has performed poems from this great book at many venues. \"Different Last Names\" is a poem from the book which has brought tears of joy and comfort as the author describes the pain and heartache many children who are raised in households today experience by having a different last name from the rest of the family. He also has tantalizing poems such as \"Poetic Love Making,\" in which the author compares his passion for writing poetry to love making. Mr. Washington has a great new book promoting self love and self respect for daughters of all ages entitled \"LETTERS TO MY DAUGHTERS, Poetic Affirmations of Love From A Father\" which has had a very powerful effect on not only the youth, but adult women as well. The book reminds them of the love and support of their fathers and the special bond that only a father and his daughter shares. He is a father of three daughters and feels that affirmations of love from a father can be very instrumental in building good emotional, mental and social health for daughters of all ages.", "related": ["B00J13R550"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In 1961, 15-year-old Bobby Ward's parents' marriage is disintegrating. Bobby moves in with Grace and his frequently absent seafaring grandfather, Cap. A devoted Roosevelt Democrat without formal education who quotes Shakespeare, Rousseau and Locke and admires Gandhi, Grace is an ardent community activist. But when the civil rights movement comes to her Methodist church in the form of nonviolent protest by blacks, Grace disappoints her grandson by not taking a stand. Bobby is bewildered by what he sees as her lack of bravery, and he also wonders about Grace's \"weird spells,\" which his parents never explain. Though the narrative occasionally rambles, Ward, who won the PEN West Award for his novel Red Baker, fashions many quietly beautiful moments?for instance, when Bobby finds Grace meditating in a sari on the roof of her garage. As Bobby learns about \"the thin line between passion and insanity,\" the leisurely disclosure of the secrets in Grace's mysterious past culminate in a moving revelation that's well worth the reader's patience through some awkward dialogue. Family photos add intimacy to the text. (Mar.) FYI: CBS-TV is planning a movie of Grace, starring Carol Burnett, for 1998.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 2231814, "title": "Grace", "author": "Robert Ward", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As the fur trade monopolies and the crown and even other competing lands stood in their way. For once over there, one had to learn not only to survive the harsh new climate, they had to find peace with the natives who lived there and to keep a look out for pirates, especially those of the English! For France might have claimed the land to the North, the English in the middle, the Portuguese had the south-yet all constantly wanted more! Yet, the majority of this New World at that point in time was unchartered and fearless men such as Samuel Champlain and Louis Hebert took that tentative step in exploring beyond each horizon that stood before them.. What would stop the average person-only drove them further in sheer determination and perseverance. In such ground walked upon and endured-heroes are made and heroines as well. These two men looked not only for their dreams in unchartered territory but Champlain and Louis Hebert both saw the potential for this incredible new land and sought to log down all they could learn about Arcadie for others to make their dreams a reality. With a thoughtful pen Champlain logged down careful and detailed maps and added locations as to the game found in those regions explored but of other potential places for habitation as well. This knowledge was extremely vital for the future settlements. These were people with dreams who would learn to fight and survive incredible odds to reach their goals and gained not only that but laid the foundation for our history where many followed. This novel follows them from France and then to Arcadie by way of modern day Nova Scotia to the Port Royale settlement to Kebec or modern day Quebec City. They learned that once there it was almost impossible to get back to France and if they needed help of any kind? Well, they survived against incredible odds for the author along with thousands of others would not be here if they did not make it. The Hebert family was the first family from Europe to successfully settle and farm in North America. Not much is known about them and most information is only found in dry textbooks and small articles. The author was inspired to find out as much as she could about these incredible people for many reasons. She had discovered their very existence when researching her own family genealogy and was amazed at the wealth in history she had found. She grew up in Massachusetts and was saturated in tales of the Pilgrims from England. Yet, in this group of very brave people from France she had found people who had settled in the New World decades before the legendary pilgrims. In fact Louis Hebert and Samuel Champlain were even close to the area in which the Pilgrims later settled in on Cape Cod 16 years before!!!! The settlement of Port Royale as well as other settlements by the French were well underway before the Mayflower even placed an anchor down in Plymouth Harbor! In her research she found incredible stories such as that of the Hebert family and many, many others. In her research on these amazing people, she had found only dry documentaries and faded periodicals and most of it in French. So, the author began her quest bringing this history into other languages for others to enjoy as much as she. Her novels are written in a historical fiction format so as to tease the reader into wondering if all of it actually happened. Granted, the research is intense and thorough and very little was left to the author's imagination, in finding such a rich resource of heritage. The author launches this book as the first in her series about incredibly brave and tough people who led the foundation for Canada as we know it today. True and epic adventures abound in this incredible tale that brings to light people that should be heralded for their courage and determination. The lessons they learned stood the test of centuries and are gladly retold and passed on for the reader to enjoy and give way for much thought of all endured. The author was determined to bring to light the epic lives of people who shaped the way for others in realizing their dreams and fighting hard for it. A good tale to keep close to heart today in even these times. One must never forget all they went through for dreams beyond the horizon. Take a note from those amazing people and use it for your own inspiration-the author did for hers.     You can learn more about her at her official website at sharondnovels.com and on Facebook @sharondnovel and about her paintball business on Facebook as well @slabcitypaintball", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The constant \"friend or foe?\" vibe coming from Sam kept me on edge and helped me ride the rollercoaster of emotions with Loretta as she tried to figure him out. The climax of the murder mystery was exciting and unpredictable. The romance between Loretta and Sam was slow building and let my imagination wander to all sorts of possibilities between them. If you are looking for an engaging story with twists and turns plus tender romance, I highly recommendWinter's Journey.\" 5 Stars Literary NymphsReviews", "related": ["B00JBLKWHU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Well worth reading.\" -Michael Böhner, journalist and member of Red Reporters, Berlin, Germany\"Wilm takes me back to a trip to Nicaragua in 2007, around the time when Ortega was inaugurated. There were things I didn't know or understand, which Wilm explains quite well. The black-and-red vs. pink flags, the use of apparently useless disguises, the waving around of weapons that weren't charged, the euphoria of the old Sandinistas for Daniel Ortega vs. the criticism of the young... His methods are original, and many of his conclusions surprising. Wilm's curiosity for individual biographies shaped by historical processes is contagious.\" -Marina Einböck, oral history researcher, Vienna, Austria\"All in all, I found the book interesting and enjoyable. Some of the information I knew, much I did not. The personal interviews and photos are a very good thing. A book about this stuff would be very dry without them. I think it will mean that more people will be willing to take the time to read about this, which is a good thing.\" -Phil Hughes, long-time Nicaragua solidarity activist, Estelí, Nicaragua\"I like some of the conclusions, and others less so. It's a good piece of investigative journalism.

Rather than attempting a sweeping and methodically exhaustive approach, Harline investigates the topic episodically, portraying, for example, a medieval English Sunday in one chapter, a decadent fin-de-siècle Parisian Sunday in another, and a 1950s American Sunday in the last and longest chapter. Along the way we also visit the earliest Roman Christians; a Dutch Reformed family in the 17th century; some battle-weary soldiers during World War I; and England again during the interwar years. Harline is a marvelous storyteller, combing the diaries, popular periodicals and letters of the various periods to bring the people and their times to life. There are some surprising revelations; until the fifth century, Sunday was a day of worship but also one of work, as early Christian leaders were anxious to distinguish it from the Jewish Sabbath. And Sunday has sometimes given rise to unlikely leisure pastimes: in Holland 400 years ago, it was the preferred day for courting; and in America today, it seems sacrosanct for professional sports. Harline's engaging and wonderfully written popular history deserves a wide readership.(Mar. 27)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the 1980s he encountered many temporary émigrés from Eastern Europe - including Russians, Romanians and... Poles. They were visitors to his father's team that pioneered wind energy in the UK. Conversations with them would range far and wide, from the flaws in Capitalism to the evils of Communism, from the corrupt West to the post-Communist \"Wild East\", from Keynes to Marx and Engels. Little did Jonathan know this would stand him in good stead when, at the age of 25, he'd meet a variety of Eastern Europeans on a course at Oxford University, and fall in love with one of them - a Pole. After qualifying as a lawyer in 1997, Jonathan married Marzena in Cracow, Poland, and they spent the next two years getting to grips with Warsaw. Jonathan worked for a renowned and very Polish law firm; Marzena completed her doctorate. In 1999 they returned to England, where Jonathan could continue to practice in English law. He is now UK Legal Director of a large motor manufacturer moonlighting as an author, or maybe the other way around. Marzena works in consumer affairs. They live in Buckinghamshire, England, where they are slaves to two girls, three fish, and various generations of ipod.

In 1893 she married a Baptist missionary Walter Stapleton.  Walter was a Baptist missionary in the Congo, known to the Congolese as ‘Mangwete’. Edith travelled to Congo with him in 1893 where she became known as Mama Mangwete.  Missionaries at that time rarely lived long and Walter died in 1906.  In 1908 Edith became remarried to another Congo missionary colleague, William ‘Mokili’ Millman and became known as Mama Mokili.  Their daughter, Litwasi, was born in 1909.  Edith was to spend forty four years as a Congo missionary and throughout these years she would write copious letters home for her friends and Baptist supporters and for her two daughters whom she heartrendingly had to leave with foster parents in England.  These letters and notes were chronologically assembled by her husband, William 'Mokili' Millman.    Jane Marshall is the daughter of Litwasi, the daughter born at Yakusu to Mokili and Mama Millman.  Surrounded by the love of Africa from a child, Jane gained an Honours Degree in History with Special Reference to Africa from London University (QMC/SOAS) in 1967.  This study instilled in her the need for Africa to retain, recapture and nurture its history - and that all first hand eye-witness documents were of special importance.  Hence, when Jane discovered the fragmented typescript of her grandmother’s experiences, she reassembled the fading typescript, laboriously typed it into an ancient 1970s computer, added appropriate original photos, and, over the years, transferred it to floppy disc, to CD, to print and recently to Kindle.  'Mama Edith:  Letters from Congo' by Edith Millman and Jane Marshall  was originally published by AuthorHouse in 2009 as ‘Mama: Edith Rebecca Millman Tells in Her Own Words of Her Remarkable 1893 Journey into Congo's 'Heart of Darkness' - and How, as 'Mama', she Gives the rest of her life to the Attempt to Spread Christian Light.’     Jane has now reformatted and republished her original 2009 version as  ‘Mama Edith:  Letters from Congo' (published by Createspace).  It is now  Volume 1 of the 'Mission and Tradition in the Congo' Series  which she has edited, formatted and published  (All available in Kindle and  paperback format).", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In doing so, she gives the English reader a chance to see how deeply each of these poems works in relation to the ones that precede and follow it. In other words, her translation reveals the sensibility not just of individual poems but of the poetic collection itself.The Ainkurunuru, with its exquisite haikulike poems, is, by any standard, a major South Asian literary text, eminently worthy of a good poetic translation into English. Martha Ann Selby is one of the finest translators from Tamil, Prakrit, and Sanskrit in this generation. She has a wonderful ear for the deft turn of phrase in English and is a very sensitive and erudite reader of Tamil. She has opened up the Ainkurunuru to the worldwide audience it deserves.In Selby's exquisite translation, the Ainkurunuru can finally speak to an English-language audience. In these brief, densely packed verses, all the varieties of desire, erotic longing, jealousy, anger, infidelity, and domestic romance find their own natural landscapes. By rendering the entire anthology, Selby enables an appreciation of both the evocative individual poems and the subtle gathering architecture of the whole.The book is most heartily recommended to all, not just to specialists in Tamil literature...(Jaroslav Vacek, Charles University in PraguePandanus1900-01-00)", "related": [], "rank": 2446551, "title": "Tamil Love Poetry", "author": "Martha Selby", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

On returning to the UK, after a short spell in Dorset, he settled in Wales in 1935 where he lived for the rest of his long life. Those are the bare bones of his life. In some senses they seem unimportant when set alongside his extraordinary writing career. Not only was output prodigious, it was like nothing else in English Literature. Indeed, George Steiner has made the bold claim that his works are 'the only novels produced by an English writer that can fairly be compared to the fictions of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky'. And even that doesn't touch on their multifarious strangeness.John Cowper Powys wrote compulsively: letters, diaries, short stories, fantasies, poetry, literary criticism, philosophy and, above all, novels poured out of him. He also wrote a remarkable autobiography. In addition to hisAutobiographyhis masterpieces are considered to beWolf Solent,Glastonbury Romance,Weymouth SandsandPorius. But his lesser, or less well-known, works shouldn't be overlooked, they spring from the same weird, mystical, brilliant and obsessive imagination.John Cowper Powys is a challenging author with an impressive list of admirers. In addition to George Steiner, these have included Robertson Davies, Margaret Drabble, Theodore Dreiser, Henry Miller, J. B.

Professor Lurie covers Taft's career up to the point when he achieved his life's goal: the Supreme Court. The book is a superb achievement-a major study of an important and often misunderstood figure in American political and legal history.\" -Lawrence M. Friedman, Stanford Law School\"This well-written and engaging account of Taft's relationship with Theodore Roosevelt and his career up to 1921 (the first volume, of a planed two-volume study of Taft) constitutes a significant revision of the literature. Lurie demonstrates that Taft was, as he claimed to be, an important  'progressive conservative' who achieved and protected more 'progressive' measures than had Roosevelt, while simultaneously defending the Supreme Court's role and authority.  A tour de force.\"  -Peter Karsten, University of Pittsburgh\"In this pithy and engaging study of William Howard Taft's political career, Jonathan Lurie argues convincingly that Taft was more progressive than previous historians have recognized and that Taft accurately characterized himself as a progressive conservative. Lurie demonstrates that Taft's vision of a vigorous federal role in promoting the public interest inspired his progressive policies on tariff reform, conservation of natural resources, labor, federal administration, and antitrust enforcement. By explaining why Taft's presidency was much more than a mere interlude between the progressive presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, Lurie's superb book should kindle greater appreciation for Taft among historians and general readers alike.\"  -William G. Ross, Cumberland School of Law, Samford University\"For too many years, William Howard Taft's one term as president has been dismissed, along with him, as a failure, overshadowed by the two men who came before and after him.  Jonathan Lurie's lucid re-examination of Taft's presidency will give everyone pause for thought, and historians will have to take another look at the Taft White House in terms of Taft's own description of himself as a 'progressive conservative.' A very well done book.\" -Melvin I. Urofsky, Virginia Commonwealth University\"This insightful book by a significan scholar will certainly provide scholars of the US presidency with a very valuable source.  Essential.\" -Choice\"Lurie has written extensively and authoritatively on legal, military, and constitutional subjects.  With Taft he has chosen a biographee very suited to his own talents.\" -Walter Nugent, The Journal of American History\"...a fine work of scholarship.\" -Ryan P.

The pioneering self-help book on depression delves deeply into the meaning of each symptom of depression as a pattern for emotional need.

Disguised as a young boy, she rides away from home, only to encounter outlaws in the act of killing. One of them, Royce Wilkason, accidentally knocks her off her horse, discovers she's a woman and not a boy, and takes her to his ranch. Since he believes her to be spy for those trying to destroy him, he can't let her go. When the man claiming to be her fiancé, arrives, Kris, a ranch hand, takes her away to safety. While there, the romance between Royce and Cora heats up, and they make love, but the danger is still out there. Through their investigation, they learn that Donavan is the man trying to take Royce's land. They get the proof and once Donavan and his helper is in jail, Royce and Cora are free to pursue their love. I enjoyed this book. I liked both Royce and Cora, as well as the secondary characters. Rosa, the housekeeper, is a wonderful cast member, as are all the ranch hands. This was an enjoyable and intensely sexy read. The author has created several interesting and beautifully described settings. The reader feels both Cora's doubts and, in spite of them, her intense attraction to Royce. The author has done a good job in creating the antagonists, Donavan and Olivia, as well as the most interesting saloon characters. There is an occasional problem with point of view, as well as with transition between settings, sometimes creating confusion. The culmination of the search for the truth is especially exciting, and the special romantic ending very enjoyable. I enjoyed this and would read more by this author.\" --Jaye Leyel,The Romance Studio", "related": [], "rank": 2697165, "title": "The Outlaw's Lady (Siren Publishing Allure)", "author": "Gina Duncan", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is about reaching out to those in need and being available to help in a practical way. Not flinching from the difficult and challenging. John and Yvonne have not had an easy life, but a life filled with challenge and reward. Thanks John for a fine book and one which challenges me to live according to my beliefs. --Don ThomasThis book was inspirational and moving. I was elated at times and also misty eyed as I was touched by the actions John and his wife. What an amazing life and what a wonderful book to not only leave for his family, but also with the world. I was inspired many times over by the story shared. It really was a joy to read. --Brian PalmieriThe Waltons from New Zealand\" is a well-written collection of personal stories, some which are amusing to read as are others tragic. But underlying each experience shared, whether happy or sad, is John's faith and a steadfast belief that the successes and challenges faced throughout his life have been part of a greater spiritual plan. While I'm not religious, religion is not foreign to me. Regardless of where you sit with religion and spiritual values, this is an enjoyable read. John's life stories provide an inspiring insight into his family's rich history. I'm pleased this opportunity presented itself to me, and would encourage you to buy this book. --Steve Field", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Picker is definitely one such character. Picker is such an interesting, astute, and unpredictable antihero, but he's very likeable. He's sarcastic and irreverent, but I still wanted to be best friends with him.I absolutely loved this book. All of the characters were so colourful and unique and they really made this novel as great as it was. It was also enjoyable to learn about antiques throughout the novel. Antiquing is something I've never been interested in before, but the plot revolving around art and history in combination with antiques was a genius idea.The plot was entertaining and involving and draws the reader into Picker's world effortlessly. Even though there are some elements of the unbelievable in it and the plot does get a little convoluted at times, the book comes together nicely in the final act and I was really satisfied with its resolution. However, it did take a little time to adjust to the format of the chapters with one chapter taking place in the present and one in the past. Luckily, it does not detract from the book at all.I give this book four and a half stars. It could be a five star book except for the minor spelling and grammar mistakes. One pass with an editor would make this novel incredible, but even as it is, it's highly recommended. Scott Soloff has written a gem of a novel with an extraordinary protagonist, intriguing characters and an engaging plot.

It should go without saying that this website and my other writings contain scenes of an explicit adult nature. I'm a discreet soul, though. I have a respectable day job, and a loving, and very accommodating, long-term partner. I have to be discreet about what I do, and also, I have to be careful about what my friends tell me at the girls' club, source of a lot of the stories that creep into my work.

His most enduring work is the short story sequence Winesburg, Ohio. Writers he has influenced include Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck, J. D. Salinger, and Amos Oz, among others. Anderson's first novel, Windy McPherson's Son, was published in 1916, followed, three years later, by his second major work, Marching Men. However, he is most famous for the collection of interrelated short stories, which were published in 1919, known as Winesburg, Ohio. He claimed that \"Hands\", the opening story, was the first \"real\" story he ever wrote. Although his short stories were very successful, Anderson felt the need to write novels. In 1920, he published Poor White, which was rather successful. In 1923, Anderson published Many Marriages, the themes of which he would carry over into much of his later writing. The novel had its detractors, but the reviews were, on the whole, positive. F. Scott Fitzgerald, for example, considered Many Marriages to be Anderson's finest novel. Beginning in 1924, Anderson lived in the historic Pontalba Apartments (540-B St. Peter Street) adjoining Jackson Square in New Orleans. There, he and his wife entertained William Faulkner, Carl Sandburg, Edmund Wilson and other literary luminaries. Of Faulkner, in fact, he wrote his ambiguous and moving short story \"A Meeting South,\" and, in 1925, wrote Dark Laughter, a novel rooted in his New Orleans experience. Although the book is now out of print (and was satirized by Ernest Hemingway in his novel The Torrents of Spring), it was Anderson's only bestseller.", "related": [], "rank": 23091, "title": "Triumph of the Egg, and Other Stories", "author": "Sherwood Anderson", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Even though I explained to him, that his siblings were bigger and will soon he would be able to do all that stuff, Ken many times end sad.I realized that Ken did not like losing, well probably the majority of us do not like to lose. But The truth is that we often lose in order to learn and to succeed. That is the mission of this tale, Teach our kids that failure is not so bad, it's just a way of teaching that we must try harder to be better.My youngest had 5 years, when I wrote this short story. But this is a story I repeat over and over to all of my children. With the largest we continue working to overcome the defeat (because he gets very sad when he lose), but due to this story and its teachings he started to dare to try new things or do things he find difficult.In addition, Ken has learned to play for fun, has learned to strive to the end. Whenever there is an opportunity of repeating snippets of this story,  I say it again because it is important that they learn from their failures. As a mom is quite important that my children learn the importance of keep trying, continue learning and keep fighting.", "related": [], "rank": 476618, "title": "Children's books about Perseverance.

Anna Mendel joins the resistance and Ingrid Brecht becomes a guard at Ravensbrück and Auschwitz. After fifty years of being an American rabbi's wife, Ingrid reaches out to Dr. Anna Mendel for help during her deportation hearing - an unexpected event that brings back the haunting memories of the past. Has time succeeded in softening the hearts of these two wounded women who used to be the best of friends? Can Ingrid get away from her past as Lagerfuhrerin in Brecht? And will Anna ever know the reason why she was released from Auschwitz in 1945?It may seem, at first reading, that D.A. Chadwick is simply telling a story about the other side of Hitler's Nazi Germany but there are actually interesting details in \"The Good Nazi\" that get through your heart. Human kindness has never been explored so really and emotionally in novels lately. The book is truly a blessing to the human race. There is no denying that Chadwick has great talent when it comes to storytelling. In this book she gives you one of the most astonishing journeys of your life and still sees hope floating in the air, no matter how impossible the whole situation may be. She remains a true master of her craft by keeping her readers hooked till the end. She is a reliable writer and \"The Good Nazi\" deserves to be recommended highly.readersfavorite.com/book-review/11701", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As I lay back on my couch in exhaustion, it came to me that most of the women that I'd read about were stunning. Oh, some were shy and covered up, but they ended up stunning. Among the twenty, there were only two where the heroine was plain and stayed that way. I remembered those two, both by Ruth Ann Nordin, the most because it showed women who triumphed through strength of spirit and a strong will. That's where the seed came to write this novel about a strong Texas woman from a small town who strikes out to demand everything denied her in her horrible past; dating, necking, dancing, respect and maybe even love. She doesn't need to be rescued by the hero, so much as he needs to be guided by her to become a better human being. I like strong women and I think they make the best heroines. I hope you enjoy Cally's journey as much as I did.

The authors solidly ground their work in empirical research, and do a brilliant job providing both an overview of the relevant literature as well as research-based recommendations for intervention.\" —Gail Hackett, Ph.D., provost and executive vice chancellor for academic affairs; professor, counseling and educational psychology, University of Missouri, Kansas CityResearch indicates that approximately forty percent of all college students never earn a degree anywhere, any time in their lives. This fact has not changed since the middle of the 20th century.Written for practitioners and those who lead retention and persistence initiatives at both the institutional and public policy levels, Increasing Persistence offers a compendium on college student persistence that integrates concept, theory, and research  with successful practice. It is anchored by the ACT's What Works in Student Retention (WWISR) survey of 1,100 colleges and universities, an important resource that contains insights on the causes of attrition and identifies retention interventions that are most likely to enhance student persistence.The authors focus on three essential conditions for student success: students must learn; students must be motivated, committed, engaged, and self-regulating; and students must connect with educational programs consistent with their interests and abilities. The authors offer a detailed discussion of the four interventions that research shows are the most effective for helping students persist and succeed: assessment and course placement, developmental education initiatives, academic advising, and student transition programming. Finally, they urge broadening the current retention construct, providing guidance to policy makers, campus leaders, and individuals on the contributions they can make to student success.", "related": ["B006FQX9AG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The\npictures also show the postures, which is helpful to the novice. The exercises\nare also divided into body weight exercises, isometric exercises, the\nalternation superman exercises; and the other exercises can also be tried by a\nbeginner, thanks to the author's explanatory notes.This is a book that teaches you how to be strong\nmentally as well as physically. I particularly like the chapter on meditation\nand how to ease away your negative thoughts. The importance of the quantity and\nquality of sleep is discussed and also the diet that is required to be agile\nand fit.

He offers the reader a deeply moving account of a personal friend's journey with depression from the onset of his symptoms until it resolved.He addresses contextual, causative and curative factors.  He includes well-researched answers to the questions asked about the treatment of depression including diet and nutrition.This is a very valuable resource on depression.Dr Joel Robertson, Pharm.D.

It may be regarded as a classic love triangle. There one girl, Angelique Baptiste, who is taking a break from bedding guys while she tries to sort her life out, and two men, both tough and attractive. There is police colleague Mike Harper and ex-Seal Liam Nash, the latter with a whole host of skeletons in his cupboard that he finally laid to rest. However, he ran out on Angelique a year ago and is one of the reasons she has had to get counselling from a therapist and take drastic measures to get her emotional life back on track. A gritty, heart-rending subplot make this book much more than a simple romance. There is a special power in this story and it quickly becomes absorbing.The book is a spin-off from the author’s hugely successful 'La Fleur de Love' series and uses characters who have appeared in previous stories. This is a strategy Lori Leger uses to great effect as it is intriguing for readers. It also lends a sense of familiarity as you read. There are plenty of interesting secondary characters in this enjoyable story, such as Tanner Collins, whom you hope you’ll come across again, may be very soon too. The author’s style is conversational and easy, with a humorous touch. For example, she gives us two endings - a sweet one, and a decidedly hotter one too! She creates sensual situations as skilfully as she builds tension and intrigue and is a polished, accomplished author.http://readersfavorite.com/review/7292", "related": ["B00HCI5CII"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 44.0}

Memories someone might not have known he was giving up.And every memory carries a scrap of a soul.Opals are brittle. Drop one, it chips. Heat one, it cracks. If you feed it too many memories -- too much life -- it shatters.When an opal shatters, it releases its store of memories. If not collected by the living, they fade. Lost forever. Dead.If the rare living opal shatters, the memories bursting out of it carry rich stores of life along with those fragments of soul. Life seeks a way to live on. If a sufficient quantity of unanchored life finds an emptied body, the body rises.The risen body hungers for more life than it has, and instinct drives it to feed on the life and the blood of the truly living.Remember Dresden? Every opal in that doomed city shattered during the firestorm, each releasing its life into the maelstrom. If Himmler's magicians had succeeded in controlling the vampires that rose three nights later, the Russkies would never have reached Berlin.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Many people think the Ice Age was one long chunk of time of severely and brutally cold weather and that would be wrong.  The climate and weather varied a great deal and the climate could change from hot to cold in as little as a decade and could last from a decade to a thousand years before changing back.  The\ncoldest period during this Ice Age occurred from 22,000 BP to 18,000\nBP in Europe. Prior to that it was cold and dry with many warm and\ncold spikes that lasted a decade or a hundred or a thousand years. These are called D-O Events. This story takes place during one of these warm spikes, which was\nonly a few degrees colder on average than today. Not brutally cold. Plants, animals, and\nhumans needed to continually adapt to the abruptly changing climate\nand landscapes. Grazing herds of herbivores followed the grasses,\nlichens, trees, and sedge's they fed on, predators followed the herds\nand humans followed them all.If Cro-Magnons were given a shave,\nhaircut, shower, and modern clothes we would scarcely notice them if\nthey passed us on the street. They would look like us because they\nare us. They would be more robust because they were not sedentary,\nthey lived a very active life and had a balanced and varied high\nprotein diet. Their world was teeming with animals and mega fauna\nwhich they learned to hunt, and they became the apex predator in a\ndangerous world filled with other predators. Recently scientists have discovered these people had a robust diet which also consisted of plants, wild vegetables and fruits and the idea that they were only carnivores would be not correct. They were tall,\naveraging five foot nine inches to six feet, with some over six feet\nsix inches. It is not until the last few decades that humans have\nbeen as tall and that is because of our recent improved nutrition.\nTheir average lifetime was thirty-five years, though some individuals\nreached their mid-sixties. They were far healthier and lived longer\nthan the farmers who followed them in the Neolithic who were a good six inches shorter and the average lifespan was 22 years..", "related": ["B007F1W686"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.1667, "rating_total": 25.0}

To those three Cs one might add a fourth: comparative...Leyland undoubtedly makes good on all four Cs. His written style is admirably clear, conversational and free from jargon. The chapter discussions are punchy and never too drawn out. The arguments and accounts of abstract principles are brought to life with highly topical examples from the UK and beyond...What may seem an unlikely additional plus, given the book's aims, is its ambitious coverage. Just about everything one would expect to find in a much meatier, more advanced textbook is touched upon. It is the perfect companion for overseas students attempting to compare the UK constitution with their own. It will be of immense interest to anybody with a general interest in UK law, politics and history. Stuart Lakin Times Higher Education November 2012 Reviews of the 1st Edition ...Leyland has produced a slim guide to the constitution of the United Kingdom that is both highly readable and impressively thorough. It deserves a place on undergraduate reading lists as a precursor to a more theoretical examination, and given a very reasonable price one hopes that many students will feel able to purchase their own copy. They will certainly find it worth their while. C. J. S. Knight The Cambridge Law Journal 66 (3), November 2007 ...provides an excellent discussion of the legal basis of parliamentary sovereignty. Alexandra Kelso Parliamentary Affairs Vol. 61 No. 3, 2008 Signposting is clear and helpful. Bibliographies are to the point...The prose is clear and authoritative. The reader's tour of Britain's constitutional history is efficient. The parliamentary process, including the passage of bills through Westminster, is described accessibly and with concision. The classic texts of constitutional analysis - Dicey, Bagehot, Jennings and the like - are introduced and their contribution summarised. And the radical reforms of the Blair administrations are recounted effectively...a valuable introductory survey.

Through this thrilling experience unfortunately Christopher's drug taking and party life-style spiraled out of control which led to full blown alcoholism and cocaine addiction. After a gravely dark rock bottom, Christopher cleaned up aged 21 (summer 2004) and began to soul-search. This led to a deep exploration of the human mind and roads to emotional well-being and self-realization. This has been accomplished  through intense self-education and with the invaluable help and guidance of  enlightened spiritual mentors. It was at this time that Christopher discovered the wonderful inner peace that the art of meditation could bring while spending time with monks in Thailand. Dines \"retired\" from the electronic dance music industry in June 2006 to give public talks on inspirational ideas and spiritual awareness and create personal development and meditation workshops and courses. Christopher is the author of \"A Ticket to Prosperity\" and \"The Mystery of Belief: How to Manifest Your Dreams\" and \"Manifest Your Bliss: A Spiritual Guide to Inner Peace\".", "related": [], "rank": 2676102, "title": "Manifest Your Bliss: A Spiritual Guide to Inner Peace", "author": "Christopher Dines", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Their father, Declan Burke, who fled Ireland 40 years earlier, understands it as a threat to his life, and sure enough, Declan is shot and wounded at the wedding. While Monty struggles with his own hopes of reconciling with his ex-wife, Brennan and his siblings search for the truth about their father's past and harbor suspicions that could shatter their large, tight-knit family. Emery tops her vivid story of past political intrigue that could destroy the present with a surprising conclusion.(May)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

My name is Lance Hodgdon and I am a storyteller. I don't know why that is. It is just a part of me that I can no longer deny. Not that I ever tried all that hard to deny it, but now, late in my life, I have decided to embrace that fact rather than relegate it to the back shelf where I put all unimportant things in my life. I am also a teacher, a retired teacher, I should say.  My journey, thus far, has been fairly uneventful, but that's not to say I am disappointed with my lot. I grew up in a small town in Western, Maryland. My father, who was a biology teacher, would often take me camping with some of my friends at one of the many state parks in Garrett County, Maryland, usually New Germany State Park. While camping, we spent each night clustered around the campfire, listening to stories my father would tell us, usually about his life as a boy in Maine. Those stories fueled my imagination and during the day, my friends and I spent the day acting out the stories that had so enthralled us the night before. When not camping, my friends and I would often gather together on a summer night and tell each other our dreams from the night before. Scary nightmares were much preferred, the scarier the better. If the dreams were not eventful enough, however, we turned to our imaginations to spice up the story, as it were.Those days are long gone, but I can still recall some of those stories. Years later, as a high school English/journalism/yearbook teacher, those stories morphed into new tales that were told to my classes every Friday, the last 20 minutes of class. These stories were told serial fashion, and often continued on for several months.

Forced to turn to the stage to support herself and her child, Mary is surprised when her acting draws the notice of the Prince of Wales. As it turns out, however, the prince is more interested in Mary than in her rendition of Perdita from A Winter’s Tale. Mary soon finds herself giving up everything—her career, her marriage, and her independence—for the prince’s declaration of undying love, only to find that a royal’s word is like pie crust: easily broken.

He grew up in a tiny village in Kerala, South India with no electricity. With his parents far away in Oman, he lived with his overbearing grandmother and aunt, and felt deprived of love. His aunt filled his mind with wild, ghostly tales that made him tremble in the dark. But he was gifted and alert. “Everything looked magical to me at that age,” he says, and he watched rapt as a local healer relieved his mother’s heart disease with “sweat therapy” and as the pharmacists miraculously pulled down just the right medicine from the myriad on their shelves. He writes lyrically of days spent swimming in the river and playing with improvised toys, as well as escaping an angry elephant and surviving a train wreck that killed almost everyone else in his rail car. He excelled in medical school and hoped to become a surgeon, until a wrist fracture limited his hand movement and turned his path to internal medicine. Soon he emigrated, first to England, then to a small town in frigid Western Canada, and finally to the palm-lined streets of Los Angeles. He established a practice, thrived, and raised a family. When diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma at the height of his career, Joseph leaned on his profound faith in God, and he learned that the greatest asset one can have in such an extremity is the loving care of family and friends. His wife, son, and daughter were always there for him, around the clock, and he describes their devoted attention to him.  A bone marrow transplant is a harrowing experience, and he went through two. His fortitude in dealing with the grueling treatments is heart-rending and inspirational. Joseph was devastated when he was forced to stop practicing medicine due to his weakened immune system. He found comfort in writing down his innermost feelings and memories. This cathartic exercise developed into his memoir, which he soon realized might resonate with people enduring various challenges in their lives. He reached his goal of finishing this task before his 60th birthday.  At his birthday celebration, he delivered a speech thanking family and friends who had stood by him through good times and bad. The following week, a bout of flu turned into pneumonia and he died six weeks later.  Despite his extreme trials, Joseph’s faith remained unshaken, and he left a legacy of courage and fortitude to all those he touched. His family has fulfilled his wish of publishing his life-story.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

To make matters worse, her mother, an aspiring author, has a serious love interest that makes her even more scatterbrained than usual. Lou feels quite left out as she heads off to the first day of school, only to discover that she and her best friend are not in the same class. The year that follows brings the typical junior-high trauma of trying to figure out who your friends are, which boy you want to be with, and what to do about your crazy parents. Luckily, Lou is able to expand her horizons and meet some new people, which leads to The Perfect Summer. In this book, she vacations with a friend at an amazing beach house while her mother is on a book tour. The friendship drama has settled into a nice group of girls she enjoys being with. That just leaves the boy situation, which is complicated, since Tristan is back in her life. The stories are entertaining comic and will speak to some middle-school girls, but the art is rather flat and boring.

He's a storyteller who places his readers in action-filled\nmoments.

But through Blake's eyes, readers quickly learn that places like\nCharlotte, NC can be as gritty as they come. It's in these streets of this oft\noverlooked world where Blake portrays murderers and thieves alike as believable\ncharacters. Without judgment, he weaves humanizing back stories that serve up\ncompelling reasons for why a drug dealer might choose a life of crime. Readers of his work, speak\nof the roller coaster ride of emotions that ensues from feeling anger at\nempathetic characters who always seem to do the wrong thing at the right time, to\nkeep the story moving forward. In terms of setting, Blake's\nstories introduce his readers to spaces they may or may not be used to -\nstreetscapes with unkept, cracked sidewalks where poverty prevails, times are\ndepressed and people are broke and desperate. In Blake storytelling space,\nmorality is so curved that rooting for bad guys to get away with murder can\nsometimes seem like the right thing for the reader to do - even when it's not. Readers who connect with\nBlake find him to be relatable. Likening him to a bad-boy gone good, they see a\nstoryteller who writes as if he's lived in the world's he generously shares,\nreadily conveying his message that humanity is everywhere, especially in the\nunlikely, mean streets of cities like Charlotte.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 4.8889, "rating_total": 44.0}

The Huntington Saga Series has seven novels:  The Governess (Volumes One, Two, Three; and the Trilogy); Pirate Bride; Elspeth Was Her Name; and Creighton’s Daughter.  Look for these books in the coming months ahead.   The Governess—Book One: Volume One reached #1 on Amazon.co.uk in the Religious & Inspirational Romance category less than one month after being released.  In that same time, it reached #24 on Amazon.com in Religious Romance in the USA.   The Governess—Book One: Volume Two reached #1 on Amazon.co.uk in the Religious & Inspirational Romance category in ten days after its release.  Both volumes of The Governess reached the Top 20 Best Sellers in Amazon’s Religious Romance in the USA in Volume Two’s first two week’s release.   And The Governess—Book One: Volume Three reached #1 as well, to Ellise’s delight.

Almost 40 years later, 11-year-old Roberta McKinnon, self-proclaimed genius, is dreading a long, boring summer. Instead, mysterious lights appear in the sky, and sightings occur throughout the following weeks. Roberta is fascinated by the UFO, but she is also obsessed with defeating a fellow science fair enthusiast and exacting revenge on her 13-year-old brother, fixations that find rich parallels with the supposed aliens above. Pelletier effectively depicts a small town with no cell phone reception but plenty of drama. In addition to aliens and vengeance, Roberta’s best friend runs away to prevent her dad from remarrying, the chief of police resigns over the UFO controversy, and Roberta’s beloved grandfather suddenly passes away. Roberta’s arrogance can be grating at times, but she is smart and resilient enough to handle whatever life on earth—and elsewhere—has in store.

I am from Algeria, from a quiet city surrounded with green mountains called Batna. It’s been 6 years since I came to Dubai and I have never wanted to go back! I worked in fields like retail, fashion and business management and currently I am working in the recruitment sector. I have hobbies other than writing and drawing like reading, swimming and traveling. Actually I wrote this book back in 2007 in my country in a small internet café where I used to work. Yes! And I totally forgot about it after been rejected by many literary agents. I forgot about the book but not about the dream! For years it was just a draft saved in a flash memory, until I came to know about Createspace! In this book I speak about imaginary events that definitely can be linked to real events in our real life. I wrote the book in English even though it’s my third language because I was inspired by English works, like Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings which made me think in English all the time I was writing Zalakar. This is the first volume in the story and two maybe three others will follow; the story in my head grew so much bigger than just an idea to the point that I couldn't contain it in one book. In this book I talk about greed, betrayal and selfishness as much as I talk about love, altruism and real friendship; things that happen to me in real life and to people close to me, with my mother being the most inspiring person alive.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Robert P. Mitchell was a “reverend,” he sang opera for over forty years. He appeared in fifteen productions with New York’s Amato Opera Company alone, and in numerous productions with fourteen other “minor league” companies in the NY-NJ metro area. His most prestigious appearance occurred on Saturday, January 31, 1987 as Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly with Opera Classics of New Jersey at the Orrie de Nooyer Auditorium in Hackensack, New Jersey, with Maestro Anton Coppola conducting. The author was the only non-Metropolitan Opera or non-New York City Opera singer in the cast. That performance led to singing with the late Maestro Alfredo Silipini, then Artistic Director of the New Jersey State Opera.  Rev. Mitchell was born in 1939 in the small village of McVeytown, in south central PA. By the time he was ready for school, the Mitchell family had moved to the north central Pennsylvania town of Lock Haven. He grew up there, graduated with honors, and attended both Lock Haven State Teachers College and Mansfield STC before he went to New York City to begin serious operatic studies at the Mannes College of Music. On the day he registered, he met his future wife, who happened to be on the other side of the registration desk. They married in 1962. In 2012 they celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary. They have two sons and three grandchildren, and now live in the scenic Delaware Water Gap region of northeastern Pennsylvania.  In addition to his singing career, Rev. Mitchell worked for The New York State Employment Service, the T. J. Lipton Company, and Scholastic, Inc., the New York-based educational publisher. From 1968 to 1998 he enjoyed a career with Scholastic as a manger, first in the Personnel Department, and later in Marketing Systems Management.  The author holds a B.S. degree in Voice and Opera from the Mannes College of Music, and a Master of Divinity degree from the New Brunswick (NJ) Theological Seminary. He and his wife co-pastored a church in the Hudson Valley for seven years following his retirement from Scholastic. He holds certificates in Direct Marketing from New York University, and is a Certified Interim Minister. He currently serves as Pastor of the Pleasant Valley Presbyterian Church in Brodheadsville, PA.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Considering how important her presence ultimately\nwas, I think seeing both sides of the coin really adds a lot to the full\n story.The second and longer tale, \"Happily Ever Afterlife,\" came from my\neditor's insistence that I needed to show the wedding ceremony of\nSarah's father. I wasn't keen on the idea of sidetracking events of the\nbook too significantly with this, until it occurred to me that it\npresented a fabulous opportunity to write a \"Home Alone\"-style comedy\nadventure with Anna Nigma squaring off against a pair of hapless\nwould-be robbers.Both tales are enjoyable on their own, but as a companion novella to the\n events inFidelis In Aeternum, I think the two books perfectly\ncompliment one another.

It hits all the crucial points about grooming and the inner thoughts of the victim. -- Sue Atkinson, author of Climbing out of Depression This book is beautifully written but shocking and tragic in content. It is difficult to read and it is very difficult not to break down when reading it. This story... will remain with me for a very long time. -- Baroness Elizabeth Butler-Sloss GBE This book is unique. Written through the eyes of a child, it brings out so clearly the gamut of emotions - delight, confusion, fear - that the child experienced, as well as how she attempted to disassociate herself from all of it. It shows just how devious the \"Uncle Georges\" are: how their grooming behaviour draws in the child who longs to feel special and loved, to feel grown up. I strongly recommend this emotionally charged and challenging book to anyone who has experienced child abuse and to the many people in all walks of life who are trying to understand the devastating, long-term suffering caused by it. Child counsellors and psychotherapists will find it especially useful. -- Pauline Pearson, Churches' Child Protection Advisory Service This extraordinary book captures the deep emotions without bombarding the reader with sordid details. It has helped me to understand how children and their families can be groomed so effectively by skilled and determined paedophiles; and why and how those who have been hurt in this way can cover the events so deeply and for so long. -- Andrew Billington, Director of the Jack Petchey Foundation I was in a different family in a different country, in a different room with different wallpaper, but I recognize the maze of distortions, collusions and concealments that build into a high security prison. When someone begins to visit her prison with the gift of permission, then healing begins. I was able to get past my own reticence about reading about trauma because Goodbye Pink Room is written with the clarity and incomprehension of a child of God; she held my hand but did not push me. This book gives courage and fuel to all survivors by its powerful message, that it is grace that opens the bolts of a prison.\" -- An adult survivor, still a victim Powerful, sensitive, moving, honest account of a girl's experience of sexual abuse, this book presents a forthright challenge for anyone working with young people, presenting an alarming reality that cannot be ignored. -- Childrenswork magazine I was hooked from page one and devoured it avidly. I was constantly awed by the restraint with which the author hinted at the depths of Rose's suffering and the blindness of those who should have been protecting and encouraging her. Having been taken inside Rose's head and heart as she learns to dissociate in order to survive, I was grateful for the final chapters with their movement towards a way of living with the totally \"un-liveable-with\". This is truly an extra-ordinary book - hyphen deliberate.I shall be recommending it to colleagues and clients for many years to come. -- Alison Balaam, Counsellor MA (Cantab), Dip Humanistic Counselling, BACP Accredited Counsellor (2004) This book highlights how parents can actually make a child more vulnerable to grooming and abuse. Parents fail to see the real threat nearer to home. Anyone currently involved with children, or helping adult survivors of abuse, would benefit from reading it. -- Eileen Hurst, Social Worker So well written... a powerful message that I believe the church needs to hear. People who have read Pathway Through Pain know Jane's gift of describing truly and honestly how things really are. -- Angela Newton, Counsellor This book IS extraordinary. Very powerfully written. No wonder it took fourteen years. -- Alison Kidd, MA, PhD This book is a real gift to those of us who were oblivious to what we can now learn through it. I had no idea of the immensity of the horror of abuse until I read this book. I found it intensely moving. It conveyed so much of the agony of it. And there is so much abuse about: people need to know the horror. Although I could hardly bring myself to continue reading it, I could not put it down either. Jane has an extraordinary gift for describing in words the indescribable. ...That little girl with her sincere, eager faith. No wonder adult survivors say that life after abuse is peppered with such internal pain. This book explains why and I've never read such a clear explanation. Rose was paying the cost not twice over, but a lifetime over. This book has brought an inkling of understanding to me in my safe life. Thank you. Thank you. -- Eliza Treasure, an \"ordinary\" lady in her eighties As a GP I see many people like \"Rose\": they come to me because they need help. This book is a most remarkable story and achievement. It enables me to understand what's going on inside them; how experiences might have felt for the child, and how they still feel for the grown-up. And the big questions: Where was God when it happened? Where is He now? Jane addresses them without any flimflam. It ends so very honestly and powerfully. It's a truly amazing book. -- Dr Jenny Durandt, General Practitioner This is one of the most important books published in the last thirty years. The writer has disappeared, leaving the child to speak so clearly and naturally with precision and power and the beauty of devastating simplicity. -- Right Reverend Donald Allister, Bishop of Peterborough This is essential reading for all those who don't \"get it\". -- Elizabeth Hall, National Safeguarding Officer for the Church of England & Methodist Church", "related": ["B00FD7JC9U"], "rank": 3492691, "title": "Goodbye Pink Room: Rose's Story", "author": "Jane Grayshon", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And now that her father is running for mayor, things are getting a little hectic around the house. Then, she notices the new neighbor, Cam, skateboarding, and she's soon infatuated with him. As their friendship and relationship grows and Cam teaches her how to skate, things get a little complicated. Everyone in town, including her parents, is against skaters, so Jessie and her new friends are getting in trouble for skating where they aren't wanted and getting blamed for things they didn't do. Now, Jessie and Cam are determined to prove to the community that they're not the troublemakers everyone thinks they are. And Jessie is determined to make this relationship with Cam work, but could someone be getting in the way?There is something cute and refreshing about a blossoming teen romance that has nothing to do with supernatural beings or a dystopian world, and that is one thing that instantly grabbed my attention about Skateboard Blues. It's simply about a boy and a girl falling in love, which everyone can relate to. Jessie is such a completely relatable character; I felt like I was reading about my teenage self. Not only is it about a new love, but it's also about a group of skaters trying to prove themselves to their community.", "related": ["B00J7R2NR0"], "rank": 2396578, "title": "Skateboard Blues eBook", "author": "Sydell Voeller", "category": "Teen & Young Adult", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
