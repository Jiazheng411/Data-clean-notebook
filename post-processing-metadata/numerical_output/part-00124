Major Yanaba Maddock, medically retired with severely damaged lungs after military action aboard a space station, is pressured into acting as a spy by her employer, the sinister Intergal corporation. Colonel Giancarlo, local head of psychological operations, seeks evidence that colonists on the bitterly cold and inhospitable planet Petaybee are abducting company geological survey teams, engaging in illegal genetic engineering and plotting rebellion. Yana finds the locals charming, helpful and uncannily effective as healers; their home remedies salvage her ruined lungs. As the company and its forces move in to quell what they perceive as rebellion, Yana casts her lot with the Petaybeans and geneticist Sean Shongili, the man she has come to love. Perceptive characterizations and a vivid depiction of a nurturing culture integrated with nature make up for the somewhat hackneyed plot.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Marzipan \"Marzi\" McCarty, a 20ish California art school dropout, writes quirky comics. Marzi's also the night manager–barista of Genius Loci, a Santa Cruz coffeehouse decorated by vanished muralist Garamond Ray to hold in elemental Evil. The wild adventures that Marzi concocts for her cowpunk character, Rangergirl, start coming true after her artsy friends become obsessed with freeing weird gods. When the Outlaw, a representative of everyone's worst fears, busts loose from its surreal corral, the Desert Lands, it's up to Marzi, the new artist-guardian, to save the whole shootin' match from disaster. Pratt's simplistic message, glimpsed sporadically behind clouds of neo-hippie jargon, self-consciously naughty language, outdoor sex and nasty violence, is pretentious and even a little naïve—that art can trap our fears and hold them at bay. Like too much marzipan, it all turns cloying mighty fast, pardners.(Dec.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Thus he provides readers with a series of essays or character sketches in which he plays a supporting role. Some of the players in the first of three sections, \"Vermont Boyhood,\" will ring bells with fans of Peck's \"Soup\" stories (Random). In \"Early Manhood,\" he looks into his time in the army and his work experiences, including stints in a paper mill and in advertising. \"Florida Years\" features interesting personalities–an old man living in a shack in the woods with his dog, a waitress at a small diner, Jamaicans in the sugar-cane fields of Florida. These are folks to whom life has often been less than generous, but Peck has found in them wisdom, tenacity, and tenderness. The final chapter, \"Just As I Am,\" is a compilation of Peck's words to live by. There is humor, as one might expect, and a good deal of near-heartbreaking pain, along with a dollop of hokum here and there. Because Peck has not written of his life as a writer, these essays are as likely to appeal to readers who have never heard of him. Perhaps they are more likely to appeal to adults than to teen readers who may not yet have lived long enough to see the strength required to live an \"ordinary life.\"–Coop Renner, Hillside Elementary, El Paso, TXCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Chief among them is the far greater amount of children and adolescents one counselor can reach; by creating a more responsive school environment—consisting of teachers, parents, and others who can make decisions that children cannot—the counselor can positively affect all students who pass through that environment. However, making consultation effective requires a high level of knowledge and skill.School Counselor Consultation: Skills for Working Effectively with Parents, Teachers, and Other School Personnel represents the most comprehensive resource available for understanding the entire consultation process. Unlike other consultation books that focus on theory, School Counselor Consultation emphasizes proven practice techniques. These include:What to say to parents and teachers about referring students to the school counselorWhat to ask teachers to assist in formulating successful interventionsHow to make the most of parent conferencesHow to plan for, execute, and follow-up on consultation sessionsA five-step approach to conducting an individual consultationHow to plan and present psychoeducational workshops to parents and teachersThis hands-on resource also features many forms and checklists—including consultation record forms, a sample agenda, surveys, and a crisis management plan—that you can use in practice. In addition, four appendices cover Adlerian theory, the American School Counselor Association and American Counseling Association Codes of Ethics, and how to best use this book to build consultation skills.Consultation offers one of the most time-effective and beneficial services a school counselor can provide. A valuable resource for both students and practicing counselors, School Counselor Consultation is the most complete and up-to-date guide to the challenging yet highly rewarding consultation process.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He came to creative writing at an extremely young age; his first 'book', Lambkin and the Men with Guns, was written on the day of President Kennedy's assassination: Rob's mother supplied him with crayons and sheets of scrap paper to keep him occupied during a family dinner-party while the grown-ups were watching the news from Dallas on television! He often wonders whether he is the youngest person who can recall that particular day. After studying French and English literature at University, Rob spent two years teaching English abroad and several years working as a tour manager taking tourists around Europe, including escorting railway tours in the UK, France and Switzerland.

So she takes Ralph himself, and he repays her by being his own irritating self. He knocks over the ant farm, scatters chalk dust and, worst of all, grabs the school bell and rings it. Readers will be cheered by the cat's awful antics, but even though the spirit of the book is all in fun, the image of a teacher crowning anyone--even a rotten cat--with a dunce cap after making mistakes on his ABCs is less than good-humored.

Keith's mother understands her son so well that she invites Bran to stay over (\"I'd rather that you knew there was some place where you could feel comfortable\"). Keith acts just as cool when his mother trots off for a vacation with a man she hardly knows. In this pat treatment, potential conflicts are small: the characters don't experience school and neighborhood bullying or violence; their biggest fear is group ostracism because girls are jealous that Keith gets Bran.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00JDXTNGC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Award-winning narrator Sean Pratt tells the tale straight down the middle, making it hard to discern which character to trust--which is on the up-and-up and which is crazy. Pratt doesn't make the main character sound like a hero, which he's not. But Pratt gives him enough dignity so that he doesn't sound like a coward either. He's just a guy who can't live with his actions. Intriguing premise, memorable ending. Pratt's rhythmic reading, his storytelling, is so compelling you'll wish the book were longer than an hour.

Texas in 1874 is still soaked in post-Civil War bitterness: roaming bands of outlaws and family feuds stoke the flames of violence. Rusty now owns a farm in south Texas and hopes to marry sweet Josie Monahan and settle down to raise a family. The Monahans, however, have some trouble. Their youngest daughter has run off to marry a no-good cowboy, one of the sons of the bank-robbing, horse-stealing Bascom family. When she escapes from the Bascoms and returns home, the outlaw clan comes to take her back or silence her forever, but Josie is murdered by mistake. Grief and the need for revenge overwhelm the usually cool Rusty, and he sets out after the wrong man. Aided by his pals Andy Pickard and Len Tanner, he tears across Texas on a manhunt. Andy and Len carry badges, so any murderous, thieving varmints who cross their path are left full of bullet holes, and it's all legal-like. When Rusty finally corners his prey and learns the truth about Josie's killing, an unusual showdown more than evens the score. Kelton is a master storyteller who offers more than just blood and gunsmoke. The right blend of action, drama, romance, humor and suspense makes this a handsome addition to his ongoing saga of the Old West.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Frank O'Connor famously said that is was possible for a bad writer to write a good novel, but only a really good writer could write a decent short story. Vickers's first collection proves beyond doubt that she's a really good writer.' Frank Cottrell Boyce, Guardian 'A deceptively wild, seamlessly well-crafted collection' The Times 'Beautifully simple with a devastating emotional climax ! with the collection, Vickers proves herself a formidable and astute chronicler of the psychology of love' Sunday Times Praise for Salley Vickers: 'Salley Vickers is a writer whose subtle intelligence and unobtrusive command of narrative I always enjoy. She sees with a clear eye and writes with a light hand, and she knows how the world works; and these qualities are much rarer than they should be. She's a presence worth cherishing in the ranks of modern novelists.' Philip Pullman 'If you enjoy the work of Marilynne Robinson, Penelope Fitzgerald, James Salter or Anita Brookner, you should be reading Vickers. All these authors reflect, with grace and gravity, on life's moments of sorrowful epiphany.' Michael Dirda, Washington Post 'There is something rare and special about Vickers as a novelist. In exploring the connections between faith and imagination, art and redemption, religion and science in an intelligent, unusual but very readable way, she manages to touch something buried deep in all of us. It gives her work a quietly compelling quality.'

Blazina, a male-psychology expert, is a compassionate guide. While some territory has already been mined by others, his effort serves more ably than most as a practical instrument for improving relationships with men, through unpacking the secret shoebox, a metaphorical place where men store their most private wishes, fantasies and pains; making enlightening suggestions for helping the notorious Peter Pan become an adult; and providing examples of how women—often unwittingly—emotionally castrate the men in their lives. Mars and Venus are nowhere in sight as Blazina embraces commonalities between the sexes in this respectful and deeply healing book.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The idea of evil--that deliberate knowing choice to do harm (which our conscience is meant to detect)--seems to be something we don't believe in. Scientists explain that it's predetermined by particular genes or by a brain lacking in certain functions. Many religions say it's an affliction caused when an evil spirit possesses us. But aren't we all born with free choice, and aren't some of those choices, evil?

He became the most considerable figure in modern Australian literature, awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1973. The great poet of Australian landscape, he has turned its vast empty spaces into great mythic landscapes of the soul.

Technically brilliant, he is one modern novelist to whom the oft-abused epithet 'visionary' can be safely be applied.

I also suffered severe anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks early into the onset of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Hashitoxicosis). A common heart murmur I was diagnosed with in my teens called \"Mitral Valve Prolapse\", also worsened in severity of symptoms, with the development of these other health disorders.  My eventual receiving of diagnoses was a difficult process with proper diagnostic testing not being ordered by the first doctors I sought treatment from. These types of issues were inspiration for me to become proactive in my own health care and to self-educate myself on these health disorders, which I have done extensively since 2003.

People spent insane amounts of money on them every week, but they really didn't need to.Those weekday morning visits often added up - $5/day works out to be $1300 per year.  That's positively cringe-worthy!Why I wrote this book:A few years ago, I opened a company that sells travel mugs and coffee tumblers and I knew that I wanted to help my customers save even more money by learning to make their own cold espresso drinks.And thusly, my book was born.I've written this book to walk you through the process, step-by-step, to make your own delicious iced coffees and frappuccino-style blended drinks.Who I wrote this book for:This book is specifically written towards those of you who aren't necessarily interested in learning the perfect grinding, tamping, and shot-pulling techniques of traditional espresso -- you simply want to be able to make a delicious drink like the one you get from your local coffee house.If that is you, then I truly hope you enjoy this book.

Imagine her in wigs ala Jane Fonda (think Klute), Cher (think long and curly), and others. Empathize as she struggles to promote her art and cheer her successes. Be amused by her encounters with fame and celebrities (more photos). Get a feeling for her home life with supportive husband Marty. Travel with them and picture Esther entertaining a bus full of travelers in Europe with her singing. Plus, there are Esther-savvy tips on health and life in general, and you'll even find a few delicious \"Tai Chi Kitchen\" recipes from a friend.  This book is for you if you're ready to be cheered by Esther's different take on life. She hopes that it will inspire you to become a bit more \"unleashed\" yourself!

She has a reputation to uphold—one that doesn't involve sleeping her way to the top of the television production food chain. All of that changes, though, when she meets the big boss, Keir Southhall: award-winning director, owner of One Leaf Studio and recently divorced. The attraction between the two is undeniable, and against Ryan's better judgment they begin dating in secret. After revealing themselves as a couple to their co-workers and families, Ryan's on-set boss, Glo, becomes angry; Ryan's sister disapproves; and Keir's two grade-school–aged children want nothing to do with Ryan—pulling them both in a number of different directions. The romance between Ryan and Keir, though passionate, has little suspense behind it—the couple connects early on—and Ryan's willingness to throw her relationship rules out the window further dulls the conflict. What's left is a series of mundane confrontations stretched to fill out entire chapters, including some wishy-washy stabs at the emotional fallout from Ryan's husband's death, a theme that fades in and out of the novel without much emotional depth.(Dec.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Before pursuing a writing career, Christine studied history at Trinity College Dublin, and went on to complete an MA in medical history. She specialises in social history, and uses elements of her research when world-building in her fantasy series. On graduation Christine worked as a freelance journalist and ghost writer, covering areas from personal finance to film. Deciding that fiction was more fun than fact, she started writing her first novel at 22. Deciding to self-publish due to the poor economic situation she set up her own company, Mermaiden Media, and released her first novel through it when she was 24. The book, Storms In Teacups, went on to become an international bestseller. Christine writes contemporary fiction for women and urban fantasy for adults and teens. One of the best things about writing full time is that it retrospectively justifies all the time she spent reading when she should have been doing something ‘more productive’. When not writing, Christine enjoys reading, watching films, good television series, cheesy pop music and strong cocktails. She has an expensive cosmetic habit and thinks the espresso martini may be the most underrated invention of all time. In 2009 at the age of 22 Christine was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, a disorder of the central nervous system. The main symptoms are extreme fatigue and widespread pain. While the illness has had a large effect on her life, she tries to get on with things as best she can.", "related": ["B00457VKIA"], "rank": 2108132, "title": "Storms In Teacups", "author": "Christine Murray", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 3.3333, "rating_total": 20.0}

Lawless, in Becoming a Candidate, has masterfully tackled the puzzle of what stimulates ambitions for political office. She challenges us to look beyond the standard explanations that center on the structure of opportunities for political office to consider broader professional, social, and political influences. This is the first study of its kind to separately explore the differences between nascent ambition, the first germ of interest in holding office, and expressive ambition, the actual choice to run for office. The innovative research design allows a glimpse into the thoughts and feelings of thousands of men and women holding careers in law, business, education, and politics, careers that serve as common stepping stones to political office. By exploring how their experiences shaped their perceptions of politics and public office, and how these views evolved over time, she enlightens us about the future of political leadership in America.\" - Cherie Maestas, Florida State University\"The hard work of systematically measuring the origins of ambition for public office has been beyond the ken of political scientists - until now. In Becoming a Candidate, Jennifer L. Lawless successfully tackles one of the toughest research problems in modern politics - tracing the origins of political ambition and learning how potential candidates act on it. This book is the first effort to delve systematically into the choice to become a candidate, and it does so successfully with a combination of rigorous analysis and rich narrative. All students of campaign politics must have this excellent book in their personal library.\"  - Keith Gaddie, The University of Oklahoma, author of Born to Run: Origins of the Political Career\"Using survey and interview data, Lawless analyzes factors that influence nascent political ambition in order to predict why people decide to run for political office. Summing Up: Highly recommended.\" -J.E. Walsh, Azusa Pacific University, CHOICE Magazine\"Becoming a Candidate provides an extensive and unmatched look at the development of political ambition. This book makes significant contributions to our understanding of candidate emergence, representation of race and gender, political socialization, and why who seeks office matters for the functioning of American democracy, making it a must-read for scholars working in these fields.\" -Melody Crowder-Meyer, Sewanee: The University of the South, American Review of Politics", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At Millie’s insistence, the Fewings family delves into Tamara’s disappearance while trying to determine who could be the child’s father (Tamara has refused to reveal the father’s identity). When Millie receives a card from Tamara that contains a clue to where she may be hiding, the family sets out to find her, leading to tragedy.

As a reformer, Calvin was concerned with the renewal of the face of the church as a whole, not with the founding of a new tradition.

In the story, 'Take After,' Archie loved his son and expected Will to do as he said, but it wasn't until an unexpected, almost life-threatening accident happened that Archie's eyes really opened. It was then that Archie realized how important his roll as a father was. \"The prisoner of truth is as constrained, nay more so, than the prisoner of misfortune,\" this is a portion of the advice from a surprising conversation in 'The Last Best Hour' that gives hope to a prisoner who is facing hopelessness in the awful place where he is awaiting his hopeful freedom. Why would a carousel be so special to someone that they would have to take a ride on every one they saw? In the story 'Painted Ponies,' Jesse found the answer to this question one special day when his mom showed him a video that Jesse didn't know existed. Then he understood. In her book \"Painted Ponies,\" Tammy Rainey gives readers three stories that are short, fun, quick and easy to read. If you enjoy reading, but just don't have the time to read an entire book, this is a nice book you should try. It can be read in one sitting, or you can read each story separately, but whatever you do, you will enjoy these stories and find hope, encouragement and contentment as you read. And if you have young adults around, this would be a great read for them as well.", "related": [], "rank": 4301193, "title": "Painted Ponies", "author": "Tammy Beth Rainey", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I have a degree in Early Childhood Education from Kennesaw State University.  I teach Pre School part time and write the other part along with taking care of my family and the house, so not a lot of spare time. I have been married to a wonderful man for ten years.  We have two amazing children ages eight and five.  Most of the time my life is a mix of chaos and complete nonsense that is both invigorating and exhausting.  In short I absolutely love it! I was born in Dalton, Ga.  I still live in Georgia in the little town I grew up in.  Although I always said I wouldn’t stay, I just couldn’t leave it. I write because I enjoy it.  It allows me to escape from the normality of life and weave romantic stories the way I choose.  I love strong men with a soft center, just like a tootsie pop.  I admit that some of my heroines are sappy, but I also like strong quippy women as well.   I like to vary my characters in attitude and personality, so you never know what you might get when you open one of my books. I admit that when I started writing I thought it was crazy how authors said that their characters ‘speak to them,’ but now I understand.  The story unfolds in the mind and the characters build themselves and the events in the story.  So… I really don’t know exactly what will happen in the story until it is finished.  Of course I have an idea of what I want, but it may or may not turn out that way in the end.   I enjoy hearing from you.  I do read emails and I try my best to reply if necessary.  I would love to hear your ideas and all about the types of books you enjoy most.  Who knows, you may give me a great new book idea?   amandaanderson2@tds.net", "related": ["B008FATPFI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 3.6, "rating_total": 18.0}

Even those who chose to scour the book for snatches of her famous father, the  painterLucian Freud, were  struck by its comic strengths, compressed narrative, and preternatural ability to convey  incidents and events that were well beyond the five-year-old narrator's comprehension.  But when Freud's second, darker novel,Peerless Flats, was also drawn  from life, some began to wonder if she was not forever condemned to repeat her past.Summer at Gaglowis her fine response to these doubters, even though a certain  paintbrush-wielding pater is very much in evidence. The book opens in Germany in the  summer of 1914, when the Great War's hostilities are still in the future. But at Gaglow,  the Belgard family's summer estate, hostilities are rather more in evidence. In a brief,  beautifully written chapter, Freud fills in the clan's jealousies, secrets, and subterfuges.  The three girls are always furious with--and surprisingly cruel to--Marianna, their mother  (who takes comfort in her fleet of whippets), and rather in love with their governess.  Fräulein Schulze, on the other hand, is secretly involved with their 21-year-old  soldier brother. Freud has a keen eye for instability, and a gift for expressing it indirectly.  In 12 pages, she delineates several lives and the prospect of millions of deaths.The second chapter opens with a short, sharp shock--cutting from the past, and the third  person, to the present: \"Sometimes while my father painted I stared up at the huge  beast of my body, my gargantuan breasts, my widened thighs, and tried to find the  charcoal outline of my former self.\" Within a few pages, however, the connection is  made as the artist tells Sarah that, as descendants of Marianna Belgard, his maternal  grandmother, they are entitled to some property in East Germany. From then on, Freud  alternates between Gaglow and London. In the present, Sarah strives to learn more of the  family history that her father has done his best to forget. In the past, war and lies take  their toll. Throughout, the reader is always in the enviable position of knowing slightly  more, and of wanting to fill in the silences and obviate certain deceits. Though it would  be wrong to callSummer at Gaglowpanoramic, it is a kaleidoscopic,  unsentimental, and always unpredictable exploration of home truths.--Kerry  Fried", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And I am of an opinion\nthat disinformation campaigns have been launched against individuals and entire\nsectors of the population, to greater or lesser effect, as a control system. I\ncould have gotten lost attempting to write this novel with all that I had read\nand researched. What I wanted to do was tell a story about a young man who has\nto deal with some real weirdness going on in his own back yard.

In 1976, late in his writing career, the editors of Country Gentleman magazine boldly proclaimed Stuart America s Most Famous Chronicler of Rural Life. At that time, nearing the end of a five-decade writing career, Stuart had published nearly 60 books, including biography, autobiography, essays, and juvenile works as well as poetry and fiction. These books have immortalized the Kentucky hill country that inspired his writing. Thousands of his short stories, articles, and poems appeared in America s most widely read magazines, journals, and periodicals. His frequent literary appearances from the 1930s through the 1970s made him an American icon and a famous writer throughout America. Stuart also taught and lectured extensively. His teaching experience ranged from the one-room schoolhouse of his youth in Eastern Kentucky to the American University in Cairo, Egypt.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

B. Cooper soon after the event and at first, just as a mental exercise to past the time, and later as an exciting project to flesh out the story, he developed a fictional character who could qualify as the man. His experience flying in the U. S. Air Force, as a fixed base operator and aircraft salesman, and as an insurance salesman provided him with insight into the circumstances that might lead an intelligent respectable member of society to commit such a crime. As a businessman he experienced frustration with the system and became disenchanted with the establishment as did many others who grew to maturity in the sixties and early seventies. And like so many of us he experienced love with its emotional highs and lows. He uses all this to give us a great story of just what might have motivated this man who has avoided detection all these years and his elaborate planning for the crime.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although Reinhertz, a self-described \"American housewife/part-time graduate student,\" attempts to explain how the early participation of women in Sufi tradition was later forbidden for political reasons, she fails to establish that women were ever truly embraced by the Sufism of Rumi's time. Nonetheless, historical explanations and translations of Sufi poetry are quite effectively juxtaposed against transcribed interviews of contemporary women in the author's religious community. As expressed in their words, religious insights are not only illustrative of Sufism, but are also poignant moments of triumph in lives filled with searching and hardship. Mary, a victim of childhood polio, could not endure the hours of sitting still that she says most spiritual practices require. In the practice of Sufism, she discovered an interaction with the divine in the sema (turning). \"When I found the turn, it met both of my requirements: to move and to embody what I was experiencing, the devotional and the relational sense of it.\" In describing their experiences, the women of Rumi's path frequently combine the language of Sufism and Islam with the language of other religions. Not only do these interviews constitute valuable records of the development of Sufism, but they also form a compelling argument for the syncretic and inclusive character of contemporary Sufism.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I hope you give these stories a try. They have a different feel from many sci fi stories. Some are funny and ridiculous; others -- well at least those touched my heart when I wrote them. Don't feel sorry for\nme. I've been this way my whole life. I can't help thinking up vicious games to\nthe death with aliens who look like characters from the toddler game\n\"Candyland.\" These stories are like a disease -- only one you wouldn't mind\ncatching.  A few months ago, I\ndecided to write Sylvan Barnet, Tufts emeritus professor and co-editor of a\ntextbook I have used for a number of years, which is the most-adopted for\ncollege composition and rhetoric classes in North America. I asked Sylvan if he\nwould be interested in looking at \"Perfect Stranger\" for the section of the\ntextbook which included a debate about the morality of genetic manipulation.  Sylvan did not think\nthe story would work in the textbook, as the fact-oriented essays it typically\nuses are about 500 to 1,000 words long. But he kindly included it in another\ntextbook that uses fiction to teach composition.  I have thought many\ntimes both before and since, about the contribution that Sylvan and his\nco-editor and fellow teacher Hugo Bedau have made to the world. Together, they\nhave taught hundreds of thousands of students to think. That is no small thing.\nHugo Bedau is known for staunchly opposing the death penalty on humanitarian\ngrounds, much like science fiction's Terry Bisson. These amazing, brilliant people inspire me.  I've dedicated a few\nstories to people over the years. \"Mad for the Mints\" is dedicated to my\nbeloved friend Jim Blaylock. Altoids mints cost me a tooth and gave me a story that a lot\nof people say is their \"favorite.\" Any time a writer can combine \"curiously\nstrong peppermints,\" Mad King George, crazy German guards demanding to know \"Wo\nbist das mints?\", a talking horse named Phutatorius, and a couple of\nmint-addicted aliens marooned in Hampton Court maze, it's a good day for that\nwriter.  There's no reason to read unless you love it. These stories were made with love, and I hope that's what shines through.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Hapless hero and first-person narrator Edgar Allen “Poe” Rutherford has a life in shambles. He flees to Maui for some desperately needed R&R; at the invitation of his lifelong friend, Doug Foxx. The destination is Lahaina, an old seaside town with a thriving artist colony. The town should be idyllic, but it’s a vipers’ nest: Everyone seems to have a tangled past, and all the artists hate one another. No one is more hated than the most successful artist, Doug’s girlfriend, Lauren, who has superior talent but no original ideas, so she steals other artists’ ideas and outdoes the originator. Early on, though, Lauren is stabbed to death, and Doug is caught red-handed. He flees the scene with Lauren’s blood all over his clothes, and to make matters worse, the two had been arguing heatedly just before she stomped out of an art show. Despite the overwhelming evidence, did Doug actually murder his girlfriend? Poe intends to find the real killer and set his old friend free. Enter Poe’s love interest: Detective Alana Hu of the LPD. Things get off on the wrong foot for Alana and Poe and their uneasy relationship, but love sneaks up on them both. The rest of the cast fills out nicely: Nick James, who was planning to sue Lauren for the theft of his ideas; Xavier, “the pharaoh,” who channels Egyptian royalty while living in the pyramid he built; William Kelly, sculptor, who lives with a bimbo in a treehouse; and Bernard Henderson, photographer and terminal alcoholic—all have their reasons to want Lauren dead. How many islanders will die before Poe figures things out? The straightforward plot moves along briskly toward a conclusion that is impressively ingenious and surprising.

Oh, you don't do that? It started in high school, I wrote a serial romance novel in a black and white composition book one chapter at a time. As each chapter got finished the book would get passed around to all my friends. They loved it and couldn't get enough. Except one of them left it behind after class one day and the only name on it was mine. I ended up in the Vice-principal's office trying to explain that it was fiction. In his defense, it was written as a journal. He couldn't believe I could know that much about sex and relationships if I hadn't done any of that. I told him he needed to watch more TV. After years of stumbling around in more jobs than any other two people I know, I'm back to writing and loving it! I recently quit my day job to write full-time. Scary! Thrilling!! I am more difficult to work for than my old boss. Who knew? I write for women looking to inject some contemporary romance into their busy lives. To that end my work tends to clock in at about 40- 50 thousand words or about 200+ pages. Short enough that you can read it in between everything else you do but long enough that I can develop the characters a little. Reviews are crucial for a self-published writer so if you review one of my books on the site you got it from send me the link. As a thank you for taking your time I'll send you the full cover art from that book. You can have your own collection! Be sure to check out my blog (Thoughts) for information you can use to be Smart, Sexy, and Fun, along with the latest going on in my world.

Each chapter is built around a particularly rich body of personal materials that reveals the thoughts and actions of a pair of correspondents. . . . McMahon has provided an exceptionally developed picture of women’s agency during this time of social, cultural, and political development. Hers is historical research and textual analysis at its best, persuasively argued and elegantly written.\" --Marilyn J. Westerkamp,The Journal of Interdisciplinary History(April 2014)\"Mere Equalsintroduces us to newly independent Americans who engaged in a conversation that has as much significance for us today as it did for them. In the wake of the Revolution, they asked themselves if women who now had the opportunity for more advanced education were men's intellectual equals. And if they were, did they have the same right as men to claim economic and political power? Should older ideas about sexual difference and gender hierarchy be abandoned? Lucia McMahon takes us into the lived experience of a generation who grappled with the implications of women being considered equal to and simultaneously different from men. Bold and innovative,Mere Equalsaddresses a debate that remains crucial in the twenty-first century.\"—Mary Kelley, Ruth Bordin Collegiate Professor of History, American Culture, and Women's Studies, University of Michigan\"Mere Equalsfeatures an overarching narrative about the emergence of an idea of mere equality and its demise and reformulation into separate spheres. Lucia McMahon cleverly shows this process unfold over time (1790 to 1840) and over the seasons of her individual subjects' lives.\"—Catherine Kerrison, Villanova University, author ofClaiming the Pen: Women and Intellectual Life in the Early American South\"InMere Equals, Lucia McMahon explores the intellectual lives of middle- and upper-class white women in the early republic. While we know about the growth of educational opportunities for women in this period and about the somewhat fluid situation as regards women's ability to participate in politics, McMahon does signal service in showing the meaning of intellectual equality in the private lives of ordinary women.

He is best known for his contributions to the modern alternating current (AC) electrical supply system. Tesla's patents and theoretical work helped form the basis of wireless communication and radio. His many revolutionary developments in the field of electromagnetism were based on Michael Faraday's theories of electromagnetic technology.[4] Born to Serbian parents in the village of Smiljan (now in Croatia), Tesla was a subject of the Austrian Empire by birth and later became an American citizen.[5] Because of his 1894 demonstration of short range wireless communication through radio[6] and his contributions to the development of alternating current, the successful system in the \"War of Currents\", he is widely respected as one of the greatest electrical engineers who worked in America.[7] He pioneered modern electrical engineering and made numerous groundbreaking discoveries. In the United States during this time Tesla's fame rivaled that of any other inventor or scientist in history or popular culture.[8] Tesla demonstrated wireless energy transfer to power electronic devices in 1891[9] and aspired to achieve intercontinental wireless transmission of industrial power in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project.[10] In the 1930s, towards the end of his life, Tesla became reclusive, living alone in a New York City hotel room and only appearing occasionally to make unusual statements to the press.[11][12] Because of his pronouncements and the nature of his work over the years, Tesla gained a reputation in popular culture as the archetypal \"mad scientist\".[13][14] He died penniless and in debt on 7 January 1943.[15][16][17] His work fell into relative obscurity after his death, but in 1960, in honor of Nikola Tesla the General Conference on Weights and Measures for the International System of Units dedicated the term \"tesla\" to the SI unit measure for magnetic field strength, and since the 1990s, Tesla's reputation has experienced a comeback in popular culture. In 2005, he was listed amongst the top 100 nominees in the TV show \"The Greatest American\", an open access popularity poll conducted by AOL and The Discovery Channel.", "related": ["B0077T493Q"], "rank": 1874997, "title": "The Strange Life of Nikola Tesla", "author": "Nikola Tesla", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I enjoyed reading it and it gave me some wonderful insight in to myself and my relationship with God. It's definitely worth reading. --Kelly Carpo****Reviewed by Mamta Madhavan for Readers' Favorite:  A Woman of Substance: Growing Spiritually Mature in an Immature World by Lilliet Garrison is a motivating book which reiterates our faith in God. The world we are living in is rampant with strife and confusion. The book gives readers tips on how to grow towards spirituality and discover what God has willed for each one of us, to set goals in life and become confident and purposeful. The book tells readers to surrender to God and seek a meaningful existence away from the emotional drama. The book serves as a guide to those who are looking for empowerment in their lives.The current trend in society is to fall into self-defeating behavior, negative thinking patterns, and low self-esteem that leads to psychological problems. The book speaks about channeling our energies and thoughts in God's direction to end up being more confident. And by confidence, it means the correct type of confidence. It also gives us meaningful quotes from the scriptures. The book stresses the importance of God throughout and it is an inspiring read during good times and bad times. It is a book that will help us reflect about ourselves and our relationship with God.The book is written with a lot of clarity. The author tells us how the lives of transformed people are blessed with light and how they have the power of the Holy Spirit. The book stresses the topics covered in the Bible. The simple prayer in the end is a gift to readers.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She writes stories (as in short) that fans have asked for and for the exercise of trying something she may not be comfortable in writing.  It expands her horizons to write outside her comfort zone.  She likes creating whole characters as well as ‘quickie’ stories where she never names the participants and the reader places themselves in the story.  As her short story readers read and realize the depth of the longer stories and then get introduced to her books she hopes they come to love the characters she has developed.  She has found writing to be a multiple personality experience, these characters live inside of her mind and to exorcise them from her brain she put them down on paper (not literally).  That way, they are preserved for all time.  She is ALL of her characters and yet, NONE of them.  The feedback she has gotten from her readers is amazing, the vested interest in the stories and books, she doesn’t think anyone can NOT love hearing how a story made them laugh, cry, and fall in love, how they felt a similarity in their own lives, how they relate.  It really makes the reader a part of the story they are reading.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her mother's nose was always in a book while she was growing up, and this piqued her interest in reading. Soon she became an avid reader like her mother, immersing herself in fictional lands and characters' lives. Then the day came, when she was about 11 or 12, that she wondered what it would be like to create characters of her own. Her junior high school years were filled with as many creative writing classes as the school would allow her to take, joining every short story contest she could and placing one of the Top 3 spots in the class every time. During her teen years she began writing short horror stories for the mere pleasure of it. The short stories soon made way to her first full-length novel, \"War,\" which she completed when she was just 18 years old. The novel revolved around a young girl coming of age during the advent of the Civil War. Her taste for horror and suspense never left however and soon her novels evolved into historical gothic family sagas. Angela's novels and short stories have been compared to the likes of V.C. Andrews, James Patterson and even the great Shirley Jackson. Angela now lives in the Seattle area with her husband, stepdaughter, and Yorkshire Terrier. She's an avid supporter of The Friends of the Seattle Public Library and is often found at the semi-annual sales with a suitcase and a ton of books in hand. Her favorite authors include Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Thoreau, and Kate Morton. Her other interests include Opera, theater, history, and genealogy. Angela's dream hobby is to become an antique book collector.", "related": [], "rank": 1439985, "title": "Aeterno (The Thorne Family Saga Book 3)", "author": "Angela Darling", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And as a peanut butter addict - I will definitely\nbe putting this one to the test.I thought the author did a great\n job of pulling together a solid resource for us smoothie drinkers - and\n hopefully he'll introduce some smoothie newbies to the joys of great\ntasting drinks.\" from Nancy Hendrickson.Here is another great review that comes from a smoothie drinker that has beaten cancer two times by using juicing:\"As a guy who's juiced his way to beating two cancer bouts, and as a guy\nwho LOVESsmoothies, I consider myself a fair critic on the art...and\nthis book is art, the art of the blender.  Don't miss it!  Loved it.\"\nby L. J.

As the stepdaughter of black-market slave-smuggler Zachary Tremayne, the delectable Erin is a social outcast and thus suitable prey for an invitation to become the mistress of plantation owner Ryan Youngblood. Erin huffily refuses. But when her mother, Arlene, learns of it, she goes to Ryan and insists he turn the proposition into a proposal, and he obliges. Erin consents in hopes that as Ryan's wife she can help her mother escape the abusive Zachary and further her own secret plans to help runaway slaves. But Arlene, who is one-quarter black, is sold into slavery by Zachary in revenge for the marriage of his stepdaughter, whom he desired himself. When Ryan's strong-willed mother learns of Arlene's status, she sells off her troublesome daughter-in-law as well. Things are looking grim for Ryan and Erin as Hagan blithely scampers through a sequence of humorously impossible events, reuniting the lovers and arranging a happy ending for everyone who deserves it.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00ECYVVQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

June Wood chronicles the history of the Nechako River and its region, covering the construction of the Kenney Dam, which changed forever the flow of the river and its tributaries; the controversial Kemano Completion Project, which threatened to doom the river further still; and the subsequent battles to protect the river and the communities affected by its altered flow. She also delves into the aftermath of the devastating mountain pine beetle epidemic that severely harmed the economy of the region.An active participant in many of the fights to protect the Nechako River, Wood is one of the most qualified people to speak on behalf of the land she calls home. She passionately introduces a river whose once forceful flow has been weakened to a mere trickle and sympathetically relays the harsh realities of environmental ruinboth to the river and the forest through unnatural and natural causeswhile weaving in her personal narrative of the land that holds her heart.Craig Hooperarrived in Vanderhoof, BC, in 1973, having accepted a job as assistant forest ranger with the BC Forest Service. His passion for the outdoors and concern for the future of the Nechako River led him to become a very active member of the Nechako Neyenkut Society, one of the groups that sprang up in opposition to Alcans Kemano Completion Project. Craig is an avid historian and is particularly interested in First Nations history and culture.", "related": [], "rank": 4966342, "title": "Home to the Nechako", "author": "June Wood", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her spiritual experiences there were so compelling and profound that she returned home to San Francisco, sold everything, and went back there to live. Over the course of eight years, she traveled back and forth, studying and participating in the shamanic practices of the ancient Inca traditions. Her experiences are exciting, portrayed here with a great deal of honor and respect, and her writing is compelling. The result is a fine addition to the growing genre exploring indigenous spirituality. Nealson was a practicing psychotherapist and teacher for 15 years when, on turning 40, she decided to live for one year alone in a mountain cabin surrounded by nothing and no one. Her book, a poetic diary of that year, was written four years later. Nealson has structured her work around the eight holidays of the pagan calendar. She reflects on thoughts and ideas concerning those holidays as well as revelations about the details of living remotely. Her work is not a linear portrayal of the facts but rather a poetic and reflective glimpse of a heart and soul. It is gentle, gracious, and profound. Both works are highly recommended.?Gail Wood, SUNY College at Cortland, N.Y.Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The pages with text also feature questions, such as What have you seen floating in the water?

Following this, he served as editor of T. L. Osborn'sFaith Digest, a magazine that reached over 600,000 homes each month.Don has penned many works, particularly ones on the power of the spoken word and praise. His writings have been translated into almost twenty languages and have exceeded twenty–five million in worldwide distribution. Additionally, Don has recorded scores of audio series. His daily radio broadcast, launched in 1961, has been released into eighty–nine nations worldwide.Don raised five children with his first wife, Joyce, who died in 1991. In 1995, Don found lifelong love again and married Debra, an anointed teacher of the Word. They have ministered worldwide and have lived in British Columbia, Canada, and in Blaine, Washington State.In September 2009, Don and Debra (also an ordained minister) founded a new church in Vancouver, British Columbia, where they continue to serve as pastors.

Book one introduced the intimidating captain, Kahm Derian, as well as his Viidun friend, Shanks. Book two colors their personalities dynamically. We get to meet Shanks crew, three giant and bearish and combative figures with highly individual attitudes. It's hard to choose a favorite chapter in this book (let alone a favorite book in the saga). Learning the rules and regulations for the most popular sport in Harrowbeth―Mallawum Ball―was fun and interesting. I smiled all the way through the first game Eena was exposed to, and how her competitive nature truly erupted throughout that game! The rivalry that buds between the Viidun captain, Shanks, and Queen Eena is a little shocking but compelling. It is a surprise to discover a deeply-intertwined past for the three main characters―Eena, Derian, and Ian―accounting for the antagonistic rapport between the men. I love how the dragons become more essential to the story, and how they receive names and ancestry while their purpose begins to slowly unravel. But if I had to choose, I'd say my personal favorite aspect of this book was getting to know Kahm Derian in a whole new light. It reveals another side to the man that endears him to Eena, and quite possibly to readers. This story will have you day-dreaming about Eena's adventures whenever you haven't the time to be reading about them!", "related": ["B00D37UHH8"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This second book follows the characters as they try to find safe havens, and it features Columbus on his journey across the Atlantic to the New World. Gafni has done a tremendous amount of great research, which shows so keenly in her novels through the detail and care she takes to convey the era and locales.

She's a native Floridian, born and raised and she's as American as the apple pie she learned to make about ten years ago. At thirteen, her family moved to Alabama and as the years turned into several, she traveled to many countries around the world, including the Middle East. She fell 'in love' with love at a young age and continues to believe that love really does conquer all...or at least leave her blessedly happy by the end of a book. She adores alpha males...the my-way-or-the-highway-take-no-prisoners kind of heroes, especially when they screw up and land themselves in 'hot water' with the heroines. Her husband of ten years is her personal hero, forging a path of true love along the road called life.

July 17, 2013By Jenny VanderVeurFormat:Kindle EditionThe reason that I read this story to begin with is because my son would not stop raving about it. He was going on and on about Sybil Ludington and the role she played in our country's fight for freedom. When I informed him I had never heard of her he encouraged me to read the book. I am very glad I did! Not only does this book do an amazing job of introducing an overlooked hero of the Revolutionary War, but it teaches readers about change and the power of attitude. I am very grateful my son brought this excellent story to my attention. I will definitely be telling everyone I know with children to get it.", "related": ["B0088HTJ9U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 24.0}

I used Edinburgh University library for much of my research (thanks to them) and have credited in the book the material I found useful, particularly in relation to the First World War. The book is entirely fiction and the characters are entirely fictitious. That said, it was inspired by the story of my mother who came to Derry, Ireland from Scotland when she was just three and was brought up by her great aunt, apart from her sisters and brother who remained with their parents in Scotland.  The book flits from Ireland to Scotland (and also England) and is the only 'family saga' I have written but my other books have a predominantly Irish / Scottish flavour. I make frequent use of dialect (usually Scots) in almost all my books as I find it adds to the characterisation. I like to think there is also humour in my books but they are serious too. A common theme is the bonds between mothers and their children and indeed this is the predominant theme of  'Hidden Histories'. I don't believe entirely in happy endings but I do like to think my books are uplifting. Without being overly didactic they are also moral tales. I believe writing should have a purpose beyond entertainment and that it should make us think. Although it is very different from 'Hidden Histories' another novel of mine - 'The Years' - is about personal responsibility and forgiveness and that is present here too.", "related": [], "rank": 3899847, "title": "Hidden Histories", "author": "Alexis Scott", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He typically writes heroic science fiction and epic fantasy with a dark, surreal humor. He also explores and photographs the modern ruined buildings of Japan, known as haikyo (AKA urbex), driven by a childhood spent re-enacting the adventures of Indiana Jones and the Goonies in the fields behind his house. Now that he's grown up, this kind of 'exploring' may seem a bit of a silly thing to do (as one friend pointed out- 'they're just dirty old buildings'), but the appeal of photography, travel, and yes, still adventure, keep him coming back for more. Some of the 70 or so locations he's visited include abandoned theme parks, military installations, ruins of the sex industry, and ghost towns. - He has contributed haikyo articles and photography to books, web magazines, encyclopedias, print magazines, and is featured in the award-winning haikyo documentary movie Silent Visitors. Michael was born in Manchester, England, to an American mother and British father. He was raised in Bolton, where as a kid he wrote snippets of fantasy stories and explored the horse's field behind his house. Nothing much has changed since then, except the snippets became full stories and the horse's field got a whole lot bigger. In his childhood summers he visited his family in Kentucky, where he learnt how to make s'mores, enjoyed night-time hay-rides, and worked in his uncle's bike shop. In his late teens he worked at a summer camp for disadvantaged kids in Massachusetts, and after graduating high school in the UK he went (glutton for punishment, yes) to high school again, in Indiana, on an exchange program for two semesters. It was there that he first took creative writing classes, and started work on his first novel (which is now maturing on his hard drive like a fine wine). He also took a Greyhound trip around the country (six days and nights on a bus), which reinforced his thirst for exploration. Now he enjoys the odd game of squash and badminton, working out in the gym, going to ruins, and of course writing stories and novels. He lives in a central Tokyo apartment with his wife and their pet King Frog, and works as an English lecturer at university.", "related": ["B00K31USUS"], "rank": 177565, "title": "Cullsman #9", "author": "Michael John Grist", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She is a successful business owner, motivational speaker, and author; she began to write at the early age of eight years as a method of coping.

Alexandria is also a member of the NCA (National Children Alliance). NCA helps communities ensure that children are not revictimized by the very system designed to protect them. Alexandria has also joined forces with RAINN (Rape Abuse & Incest National Network). RAINN carries out programs to prevent sexual violence, help victims, and ensure that rapists are brought to justice. My Pain Is My Legacy is a refection of a woman's thoughts on life, as half-child half-adult. This book holds the innermost darkest secrets that have clouded the woman's heart, body, and soul. This book contains the key to releasing all the past pains and allowing the inner child's voice to be heard. Every time this story is read, it helps the inner child to finally rest in peace. Based on a true story but written as f ction, you will discover what a world looks like from the eyes of an abused child whose voice was left unheard. And you will experience the reward once the pain is released. I always looked for love in everyone I allowed in my life. At the beginning of this book, I was lost. I thought everyone loved and looked at life as I did. At the end of this book, I learned life and I found everything I ever needed and wanted within myself. I am finally free and loving and spreading self-empowerment wherever I go, and it feels good. Most importantly, my inner child is at rest.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When his creative simmer turned to an imaginative rage, he embarked on a voyage with no anchor and no horizon. He stepped aboard knowing that this journey will be for the rest of his days. He still looks to the stars to find his way. The navigation can be plodding but the bearing is clear. Joe is now a full author, by way of children’s literature, Science Fiction, Non-fiction, and Urban Fantasy. Ever pursuing the itch that he can’t possibly scratch, he is constantly stretching his boundaries, honing his craft and fighting mortal enemies such as avoidance and procrastination at every turn. Whether it is a beloved stuffed seal, a hard-nosed orphan stuck on the raw streets of a future time, or a pre-apocalyptic vampire turned human, he is fantasy intermingling with the future. Joseph continues to live with his wife and beloved son in Rhode Island, center of the creative universe.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is elegant, thoughtful, creative, meticulous, unsettling, irresistible, and required reading for both scholars and citizens.\" -James Morone, John Hazen White Professor of Political Science and Public Policy, Brown University, and author ofHellfire Nation,By the People: Debating American GovernmentandThe Heart of Power: Health and Politics in the Oval Office.\"Weaving history and crisp analysis, Professor Field brilliantly helps us to understand how government's massive roles in policy, payment and regulation have created the exigencies of the American health care system and its marketplace.

Our task now, as Field shows, is to improve, not sunder, this relationship.\" -- Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, Robert L.

Field reminds us that the idea of a national health plan isn't anything new. The book's central premise is that the government created the health-care system, often in hidden ways, and without it, we would not have the system we have. Though Field's investigation is compelling, his subject is vast and daunting.

For all its violence, Koryta's story features a tone that hovers between sanguine and bloodless, but Thor, Perry, and the big cats nevertheless act out a tale of chilling moral ambivalence.

Shaw has always been drawn to the creative arts and all things spooky, even as a young child. Good grades eluded him in art class because no matter what the subject, he would always add a skeleton, pumpkin, witch, or bat into the mix. Why? Because he loved Halloween more than any other holiday and his mother has the picture of him at four years old kissing his carved pumpkin goodnight to prove it! After high school, he attended community college for a business management program, but dropped out several weeks later when he found the drama club. He devoured every theatre and literature course the school offered, making Dean's list several times. But, it was a creative writing course that changed his fate. It was there, in a small classroom with about twenty students, where he finally figured out what it was he wanted to do. He was going to write books. Books with spooky things in them. Upon his acceptance into the Odyssey Writing Workshop run by Jeanne Cavelos in the summer of 2008, he spent six weeks with the best authors and professionals in the business. He learned the art of how to tell not just a story, but a great story. He learned that the cozy mystery genre was his strength. A few years after the program, he had finally crafted his mystery series idea. The Vivienne Finch Magical Mysteries is the result of this hard work and he couldn't be more proud of the result. He lives in Elmira, NY and is hard at work on the next book in the series.", "related": ["B00LNLVQ9Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.8333, "rating_total": 29.0}

Coffee, attended Spiro High School graduating in 1984. At the time I was the third child of five and then with the move to Oklahoma, the third child of seven; with three brothers and three sisters. My father died at age 43 and my mother is still alive. I attended Carl Albert Jr. College in Poteau, Oklahoma and also Westark Community College in Ft. Smith, Arkansas and then continued my education at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, afterwards. I'm a divorced father of two daughters and adopted a son as well as two-step children from the marriage. E. Lynn Harris has always been my inspiration for writing and he too at one time attended the University of Arkansas and taught there also. Not only do I write books, I write songs and am a self-taught piano player whose mother has a strong religious background as did I when growing up. I got my musical start in church at the age of four just like so many others before me. I was at church seven days a week if the church doors were opened and at one time served as minister of music. Although no religious affiliation as of now, I still recognize God as the head of my life and my past experiences whether good or bad are what drives me to write and to accept the cards that I have been dealt. I wrote several stories and tons of songs by the time I graduated high school and recently wrote the lyrics for a song that I was hoping Brad Paisley would have selected to be recorded for his latest album and sent them to Paramount Studios in Nashville, TN. Unfortunately as fate would have it, the 2013 audition that I was to compete in concerning the Voice in Austin, TX July 12th and 13th I wasn't able to make, due to unforeseen circumstances. As of now, I have completed the manuscripts to five books, The Barber's Shop, Storm, Storm II: Taken by Storm, Storm III: S", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Masters is a retired USAF Sgt. SERE Instructor. He spent over 20 years within the strict discipline of the military and he was good at it what he did, more than good really. He was an exceptional member of the United States Air Force. He thrived. Then came retirement.  J. Masters tried out several professions after retiring from the military, but he never found anything that fit his personality so well as the SERE field. Then his wife, several years his junior, graduated and Masters decided that it was his turn to tackle homemaking and child-rearing full time while she became the bread-winner. And tackle motherhood he did. The results of his applying military principles to household life were at times ridiculous, at times fruitless, and, most times, comedic. Day after day, Masters discovered that there was something infinitely more challenging than performing pre-jump checklists and surviving enemy interrogation (no enemy interrogator is quite as effective as a child asking all the whys of the known universe)- housewifery (as he so aptly coined) was the most challenging role he'd ever played.  One day, Masters sat down at his computer- the house finally quiet with the older kids at school and the younger kids napping- and started typing (rambling really). Every day, he penned the hilarity and chaos of household maintenance.  From Macho2Mom, in all its randomness, will have you laughing, crying and truly appreciating the greatness of mothers all over the planet.", "related": [], "rank": 3113701, "title": "From Macho to Mom", "author": "J.
