Based on massive archival scholarship and elegantly written, his study focuses on American and British roles and asks why a stable European security system could not be consolidated between the Versailles Treaty and the advent of Hitler. Ultimately, he argues, it fell to London and Washington to help Paris and Berlin overcome distrust, nationalism, and impatience with the slow pace of mutual concessions. High stakes, alas, could not guarantee success, but failure was not foreordained. There are important lessons here for the Middle East and other regional conflicts. In the end there are no outsiders.\"-Charles S. Maier, Leverett Saltonstall Professor of History, Harvard University\"Historians have usually seen 1924-29 as no more than a temporary lull between the two storm periods of imposed \"peace\" settlements and bitter conflicts in 1919-23 and the Great Depression, destruction of Versailles, and rise of Hitler in 1929-33. Patrick Cohrs argues in this massively-researched, detailed study that the Dawes Plan, London Conference, and Locarno treaties of 1924-25 constituted instead a new Euro-Atlantic peace settlement and international system and established a new European concert. Under combined British-American aegis, both France and Germany adopted the spirit and politics of productive mutual compromise. What stunted and finally undermined the system was above all the failure of both hegemons, especially America, actively to support and develop it. Everyone who wants to understand this era, as well as the origins of World War II and the workings of modern international politics, must come to terms with this highly controversial but often illuminating and persuasive interpretation.\"-Paul W. Schroeder, Emeritus Professor of History and Political Science, University of Illinois\"This is an ambitious book with a challenging thesis. It re-examines British and American policy towards Europe in the 1920s sympathetically, arguing that policy makers in both countries made a serious effort to promote peaceful solutions which reflected their values as well as national interests. The conclusions, which are well-documented, offer an important new interpretation of the period.\"-Jonathan Wright, Christ Church, University of Oxford\"Cohrs takes a refreshing and well-balanced perspective, striking a reasonable compromise between a variety of historical approaches... his study not only reveals a wide range of primary sources that bring to light a  convincing revisionist interpretation of the early inter war period, but it also makes an important statement about the climate of international relations at the time... it is a masterpiece of research and one that should  significantly change the way we see the inter war period.\"-Journal of British Studies\"Cohrs marshals an impressive amount of evidence for his assertion by mining archival resources in both public and private collections in the US, Britain, France, Germany, and the League of Nations. The primary research is backed up with a command of the voluminous secondary literature on this period.\"-Frederic Krome, American Jewish Archives/Hebrew Union College\"This is a highly original and thought-provoking book. Patrick Cohrs, adopting a systemic approach to his subject, argues that the Anglo-American agreements of 1923-5 laid the foundations for a stable peace in Europe and inaugurated an American-dominated Euro-Atlantic system that lasted until it was disrupted by the unprecedented world depression. ... Cohrs' challenging thesis forces one to reconsider the process of European stabilisation in the 1920s, and to reassess the nature of the American contribution to its limited success.\"-The English Historical Review\"In this opus magnum the author has re-examined extensive archival holdings and private papers and ... with an assured grasp of his subject provided an original interpretation...\"-Historische Zeitschrift\"...as well as making a significant contribution to the scholarly debate about the 1920s, Cohrs' book also serves as a useful reminder of the difficulties that attend peacemaking, and the long-term commitment that is required to make it succeed.\"-Times Literary Supplement\"Patrick O. Cohrs offers a major reinterpretation of post-World War I international history... Much of the best scholarship on [this period] focuses on either European or transatlantic relations. To his credit, Cohrs combines both in his study of the Euro-Atlantic order. He places Locarno diplomacy of 1925-1929-the new European concert-within a transatlantic framework.\"-American Historical Review\"Cohrs convincingly argues that we are wrong to view the 1920s as a decade of false dawns simply preordaining a decade when much worse was to follow. The book is especially important because a study that includes the American dimension to what many scholars have tended to view exclusively from a European perspective is long overdue.\"-History\"...Patrick O. Cohrs has contributed a mammoth study... In this fine revisionist work, Cohrs argues that European and American policy-makers... were able to create a viable transatlantic international order in the 1920s, which constituted an important accomplishment in the history of international relations and was not inexorably doomed to fail.\"-Peace and Change\"...there is no doubt that specialists of twentieth-century history, diplomatic history, and international politics, as well as scholars interested in research on the two world wars will find in it a lot to stimulate their reflection. All university libraries should naturally have a copy.\" -Antoine Capet, H-Diplo\"...a provocative thesis....a book well worth reading...\"--Carole Fink, Ohio State University, Journal of Modern History", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At 23, Asif Murphy has become the reluctant head of the family that includes brooding Lila, a year younger, and 19-year-old Yasmin, whose Asperger's requires Asif to enforce a strict schedule. Asif, however, shares Lila's complicated feelings for this girl who so monopolized their mother's affection and time, resulting in \"a childhood of uneven treatment without the satisfaction of actual neglect.\" The two turn apoplectic after learning that Yasmin will be featured in a TV show about living with autism, but are both too busy to notice when their sister's perspective begins to change. Told in first-person sections, these chapters form the basis for Yasmin's show, point to Farooki's title, and reveal the book's somewhat faulty heart. Basing a novel around an autistic child is less than inspired, but Farooki rises above the clich√© to deftly depict how family can encapsulate strife while also being a form of salvation.

Uruguay.  Era hijo del vicec√≥nsul argentino en Salto quien descend√≠a del caudillo riojano Facundo Quiroga. Desde peque√±o vivi√≥ acontecimientos tr√°gicos: a los tres meses de edad, su padre muri√≥ de un disparo accidental de su propia escopeta en su presencia.  En 1891 su madre se volvi√≥ a casar ‚Äîesta vez con Ascencio Barcos‚Äî, y Quiroga estableci√≥ profundos v√≠nculos afectivos con √©ste. Sin embargo, tras cinco a√±os de matrimonio, Barcos, que sufr√≠a una par√°lisis provocada por un derrame cerebral, se suicid√≥.  M√°s tarde Quiroga termin√≥ en Montevideo la ense√±anza secundaria. Adquiri√≥ formaci√≥n t√©cnica, en el Instituto Polit√©cnico de Montevideo, y general en el Colegio Nacional. En 1898 se enamor√≥ de Mar√≠a Esther Jurkovski, que inspirar√≠a dos obras suyas: Las sacrificadas y Una estaci√≥n de amor. Por esos tiempos Quiroga comenz√≥ a colaborar en el semanario Gil Blas y estableci√≥ amistad con el escritor argentino Leopoldo Lugones, que fue una de sus principales influencias.  Hacia 1900 Quiroga se fue a Par√≠s tras recibir la herencia de su padre. Al volver, fund√≥ el ¬´Consistorio del Gay Saber¬ª, un laboratorio literario donde se ensayaron nuevas formas de expresi√≥n.  Tras la aparici√≥n de su primer libro (Los arrecifes de coral) murieron dos de sus hermanos v√≠ctimas del tifus. Ese mismo a√±o su amigo Federico Ferrando, que hab√≠a recibido fuertes cr√≠ticas del periodista Germ√°n Papini, decidi√≥ retar a duelo a aqu√©l. Quiroga se ofreci√≥ para preparar el rev√≥lver que iba a ser utilizado en el duelo y mientras revisaba el arma se le escap√≥ un disparo que mat√≥ a Federico.  Abatido, Quiroga cruz√≥ el R√≠o de la Plata en 1902 y fue a vivir con Mar√≠a, otra de sus hermanas. En 1903, acompa√±√≥ como fot√≥grafo a Lugones en una expedici√≥n para investigar unas ruinas de las misiones jesu√≠ticas. La visi√≥n de la jungla marcar√≠a su vida, seis meses despu√©s compr√≥ unos campos de algod√≥n en el Chaco. El proyecto fracas√≥. Y, sin embargo, en 1906 decidi√≥ volver otra vez a la selva y comprar otra finca.  Por entonces Quiroga se enamor√≥ de una alumna suya ‚Äîla adolescente Ana Mar√≠a Cires‚Äî;y le dedic√≥ su primera novela, titulada Historia de un amor turbio, se cas√≥ con ella y la llev√≥ a vivir a la selva. En 1911 Ana Mar√≠a dio a luz asistida por Quiroga a su primera hija, Egl√© Quiroga, en su casa de la selva. Sin embargo, ella no se adaptaba a aquella vida y le pidi√≥ Quiroga que regresaran a Buenos Aires. Ante la negativa de √©ste, Ana Mar√≠a se envenen√≥ en 1915.  Durante 1917, Quiroga vivi√≥ con sus hijos en un s√≥tano de la avenida Canning, alternando su trabajo como diplom√°tico y la escritura de relatos publicados en revistas. La mayor√≠a de estos fueron recogidos en libros, el primero de los cuales fue Cuentos de amor de locura y de muerte (sic, t√≠tulo sin coma), que tuvo gran √©xito de p√∫blico y de cr√≠tica. Al a√±o siguiente apareci√≥ Cuentos de la selva, colecci√≥n de relatos infantiles protagonizados por animales y ambientados en la selva. Quiroga dedic√≥ este libro a sus hijos, que lo acompa√±aron durante ese per√≠odo de pobreza.  Hacia 1927, hab√≠a decidido criar y domesticar animales salvajes, mientras publicaba su nuevo libro de cuentos, Los desterrados. Se hab√≠a obsesionado con Mar√≠a Elena Bravo, adolescente compa√±era de clase de su hija Egl√©, que cedi√≥ a sus reclamos.  A partir de 1932 Quiroga vivi√≥ en Misiones con Mar√≠a Elena y su tercera hija. Por entonces le diagnosticaron hipertrofia de pr√≥stata. Agravada su dolencia, Quiroga viaj√≥ a Buenos Aires y all√≠ descubrieron que ten√≠a un c√°ncer de pr√≥stata avanzado. Recluido en el hospital supo que en los s√≥tanos viv√≠a apartado un paciente con deformidades similares a las del Hombre Elefante. Quiroga exigi√≥ que el paciente ‚Äîllamado Vicente Batistessa‚Äî compartiese habitaci√≥n con √©l.  El 19 de febrero de 1937 y en presencia de Batistessa, muri√≥ Horacio Quiroga tras beber un vaso de cianuro.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Foreign Languages", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The novel follows Reggie Dipwipple through aPolice Academy-esque crash course in spy know-how and history of the SNACKS program, a.k.a. Sublime Nemesis Against Cabal Knaves Supreme (sworn enemies of GUTTER: Gouging Ulterior for Terror, Trafficking and Egomaniacal Rancor).¬† Through his course work and on his first assignment, Dipwipple and the reader learn a great deal of trivia and true spy history.¬† Author Dipwipple's(How to Be a Comedy Writer without Really Succeeding, 2011, etc.) primary technique relies on a constant barrage of jokes, which may exhaust some readers.¬† There are a few cringe-worthy puns and jokes you've heard before, but a healthy serving of intelligent comedy and longer setups usually keep the reader's attention on track.¬† Although the digressions almost always entertain, they can feel pointless when there's no plot to move the story along.¬† No one here is who they seem (even Dipwipple the author has an alias), so character development would seem difficult. Yet the author accomplishes plenty with the goofy material, providing the reader with flawed but fun characters and real bones beneath the comic exterior.¬† The laughs never stop, but this one's more fun house than thrill ride.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It has always been a goal of mine to take my writing skills from press releases and ad copy to another level - novel work. My first novel, Invisible Justice, was inspired by a dream in early 2009 and was completed that summer. Brute Justice is the second book in this YA series. Likened by readers to X-Men and Heroes, the Justice series is a contemporary take on teenage super heroes. After a bit of prodding, I took a break from the Justice series to start a darker young adult novel entitled Misery's Fire, a storyline my husband dreamt one night and passed along to me. Misery's Fire is a crime thriller detailing the life and death of Grant Williams and his subsequent experience in Hell. When his demon caseworker, Angelo, couldn't break his spirit, he exacted his revenge by sending Grant back to the fiery pits of high school. He finds himself in a new - and much younger body - with nothing but a backpack and a school uniform. Grant must learn to survive not only life on his own, but also the horrors of high school - cliques and chicks included. The storyline covers some heavy topics for teens - gangs, drugs, bullying, violence and death. While the topics are dark, the story is delivered with a sarcastic wit that creates a lighter tone and allows the reader to emotionally connect with the main character, despite his transgressions. My day job... I am the Director of Development for a regional law firm in Indiana where I oversee the business development and marketing campaigns. My responsibilities include managing the public relations efforts, corporate identity, web site, advertising and external communications, client entertainment and special events, contributions and sponsorships, and market research for our firm's six offices.

Mellow Molly is as laid back and easy going as they come.  Quinn, on the other hand, was on the fast track to success until his train got derailed.  Sharing a month of sun and fun, Molly teaches Quinn to relax.  And Quinn discovers that there's more to the easy going Molly than he first thought. In August, Patricia Ryan takes over the beach house and brings in a new couple.  Sally Curran knows exactly what she wants out of life- safety, security and a man with a future.

His dream to restore old houses hinges on restoring the decrepit beach house.  But Sally proves to be a distraction Tom doesn't want to walk away from.

My early years were spent alone, so I had the opportunity to imagine anything and go anywhere I wanted in my mind, and loved to read and place myself in the book.  I am the only one of my siblings that went to college, and have worked in numerous fields and at one point, was the first female ‚ÄúTraveling‚Äù sales person in the state of California. I started writing when I was very young; it was a way of making a crazy world straight in my own mind.  I was given a good set of values by my parents; all people were to be treated with dignity and respect, unless they proved otherwise.  Accept those different from me, they could teach me more life lessons, and they did.  I am proud to stand up for those I feel are being persecuted or bullied.  I‚Äôm not afraid to say what I think, regardless if you agree or not.  I try to bring that ‚Äòtruth‚Äô into my writing.

Though the occasion for this sojourn was to celebrate in grand style the birthday of a dear friend, my mood was understandably somber and I could not shake the dark omnipresence of death. In this atmosphere of sadness and gloom, one evening in a restaurant in the Latin Quarter near the Pantheon I observed a table of a dozen diners--all, except one, American students. The one exception was also an American, a man of at least twice their age. The man could only have been their professor, and their dining together a celebratory event during a study abroad term in Paris.I knew this scene well because the year before I had taken such a group to study in London. My students all had come from University of Hawai'i, where I taught at the time, some having never before left the islands. As might be expected, a few had problems adjusting to a new culture and a very different climate--it was January when we arrived and spitting snow. My job was to help them through these adjustments and¬†to ensure that each returned to Hawai'i alive and well. All did, thankfully. But I had heard horror stories from previous terms.Glancing at the dozen students dining together that evening in Paris, my perceptions still clouded by gloom, I began to imagine the worst: What if one of them turned up dead in some tragic and shocking way?This bleak question followed me through my last days in Paris, until I finally tried to answer it in the form of a Surfing Detective mystery. Then I encountered a problem. Why would Kai Cooke investigate a death in Paris? He didn't speak French. He'd never been to France. And his normal sphere of operations was the six inhabited Hawaiian Islands. My PI was therefore an unlikely detective to take the case.I was stuck. Until I saw two connections between him and the proposed victim: Ryan Song, like Kai, would be from Hawai'i and he would be a surfer. Then I pieced together a scenario in which Kai would investigate Ryan's death some months later, upon the request of his parents. And due to the Songs' limited means, Kai would conduct his inquiry without ever leaving the islands. No trip to Paris. That meant a challenging case. How would the PI reconstruct a sequence of events that occurred months earlier and seven thousand miles away?Another, lesser, problem was the matter of length. From the beginning I had conceived the case of Ryan Song as a short story rather than a novel. This would mark, in fact, the first time I had attempted a Surfing Detective mystery in this compact form. When I began to write, the case kept growing and growing--beyond the bounds of the short story, but not reaching the length of the novel, or even the novella. So what did I have--a long story? I was pleased to rediscover the termnovelette,whose length is midway between the short story and novella.Novelette describes wellHanging Ten in Paris.The advantages of this form are three: it invites us to see Kai Cooke working a case in more depth than we could in a short story; it has the focus and brevity that allows us to read from beginning to end at one sitting; and, finally, it offers those unfamiliar with the series the opportunity to become acquainted, with little time or expense", "related": ["B00J1M9W98"], "rank": 679741, "title": "Hanging Ten in Paris: A Surfing Detective Novelette (Surfing Detective Mystery Series Book 4)", "author": "Chip Hughes", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I've heard of everything from taking the offending toys and/or clothes and holding them for ransom (tried it myself--it didn't work very well) to tossing the clothes onto the drive way so the kids would have to pick them up on their way in from the bus after school. I'm not sure that one worked for the frustrated mother, either. Well, in Holly Remkes' tale of The Gunny Sack Man, we learn about two little girls who are always making messes. When their mother gets totally frustrated about their inability to keep their room clean for five minutes, she tells them about a man who comes to kids houses to check and see if their rooms are clean. If it's a mess, he'll sneak in while they're gone and eat all of the toys and clothes on the floor. If their room is clean, he'll leave them each a treat or other present under their pillows. When asked about her first book, Holly states her mother told her the story of The Gunny Sack Man when she was a little girl, and she has used it with her own children, finding it a great way to motivate them to take care of their own messes. The rhyming text perks the ear and cute storyline are bound to interest all of your little ones to take care of their things in record time. You can learn more about the book and the author, or order a copy of your own at Holly's Web site. The Gunny Sack Man is a 64 page, full color picture book. --Heather Justesen\"I like to clean for him!\" --Rudy, age 10\"He looks like an old man. He is wrinkly because kids saw him. He carries a big, huge sack and has a cane and candy and toys. He is sometimes mean and sometimes nice. I love him to come.

Avant4 stars - Wry and Funny - Much Better Than This Amazon Site Description MightSuggest.The stories in this book are smart, funny and wry - presented in a deadpan, cluelessstyle that highlights what a doofus the narrator is and what a subtle and accomplished storytellerthe author is.In his head Lance Sidesaddle is an 1850's cowboy - honest, true, straight and noble. He alsofancies himself as a private detective, so what you get is a sort of noir take on old-fashionedcowboy conventions. But, Lance isn't too bright, and through a combination of denseness,misguided zeal, and self-delusion, he never quite gets a handle on what's going on around him.So, actually what you get is a noir cowboy detective Don Quixote.Now, that is very hard stuff to write. Lance has to be clueless and yet sympathetic. It's hard tojuggle that kind of character, and I admire the author's skill.An accomplished and amusing collection with an honest, cheerful and refreshing hero.

In many ways Krishna's teachings here build upon and go beyond those of the Bhagavad Gita, for his auditor Uddhava is more advanced in his understanding and spiritual capacity than was Arjuna. Rosen here provides an accessible rendering of the Sanskrit original along with his own commentary, drawing upon the teachings of the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition. Students of Indian religious literature, devotees of Krishna, and Hindus of every persuasion will find valuable insight in this important work.\"(Richard Davis, Professor of Religion and Asian Studies, Bard College)", "related": [], "rank": 2638917, "title": "Krishna's Other Song: A New Look at the Uddhava Gita", "author": "Steven J.

My family immigrated to the states in the late 60's and I've lived here since. I've always loved writing and have written quite a few things mostly for my own pleasure, and I just now started looking into publishing my work. I started by publishing a small anthology of some of my poems or stories here at Amazon, as well as a sci-fi novel that is the first in a series. The second part is out as well. Right now I'm working on the third part. I'm also working on a book called: Zen and the Art of Massage. It's a spiritual book not a technical how to book. I have three videos on my author's page here at Amazon. The first is me working out with the chucks in my backyard on a hot Texas summer's day. My character in The God Inside is proficient with the chucks so I thought I'd add that video. I have another video which is me talking about my books. There is yet one more video that is me reading the first chapter in the upcoming book Zen and the Art of Massage. I'm a massage therapist and have been practising for the past 17 years and one day I'll get it right! 8) I live 30 minutes south of Houston in League City TX with my 3 indoor cats and outside I have possums racoons and lots of squirrels for company. I enjoy kayaking, (Lots of places for that around here. It's known as the Bayou city...) riding sport bikes, the occasional windsurfing, and never ending battle of the bulge and trying to get in shape. I used to be a bodybuilder back in the 80's and it kind of fizzled from there...8) I have worked in a lot of different fields ranging from pizza delivery driver to cook, to teaching English as a foreign language, teaching Greek, Interpeter, selling ladie's shoes, private security, bodyguard, delivery driver, etc.... Something about working for someone else though has never agreed with me. I guess you can't fire yourself, that why I like to work for myself. 8) I speak fluent Greek, a bit of Spanish which I learned from ex wife's family, a little German, and you can catch my accent when I mispronounce words like sheets and sheep.... I'll let you guess what sheet sounds like when I pronounce it...8) In my line of work (massage therapy) I've learned to replace sheets with linens.

But he knew a good deal when he saw one--so he jumped at the offer made by James Agee, a writer atFortune, to use the best new equipment available to illustrate a series of articles on white Southern tenant farmers in 1936. According to Jerry Thompson, Evans' former assistant and author ofThe Story of a Photograph, the results enabled Evans to visually define a critical period in American history--whether he intended to or not. (The Evans-Agee collaboration eventually producedLet Us Now Praise Famous Men, which did not sell well in either man's lifetime but has become a photojournalistic classic.) In the stark image most often associated with Evans' work, a young woman in a simple housedress stares down the lens. Ellie Mae Burroughs has a face that speaks volumes: of struggle, strength, and world-weariness. The story of how she came to pose for this iconic portrait leads Thompson to thoughtful, informed ruminations on the craft and purpose of creating art. \"In good poetry, and especially in Evans's pictures, both the tenor and the vehicle matter,\" he writes. \"Evans's best pictures are fact and symbol at the same time.\"--Mia Lipman", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 3.875, "rating_total": 31.0}

Rather, well-drawn characters help to avoid some of the stereotyping of Appalachians prevalent in most of the literature of Cooke's day. In addition, the novel is a historically significant text: although Cooke's novels have long been out of print and few scholars have examined her writing, in her lifetime she was both popular and critically acclaimed, and her writing covers nearly fifty years in American literary history. Furthermore, this novel both anticipates many current feminist issues and gives us a chance to see how personal feminism can shape a writer's work. Finally, the novel deserves our attention because it examines industrialization and changing roles in Appalachian society at the turn of the century. The Power and the Glory is an important publishing event for scholars of Appalachian fiction. It should serve as an exemplum of early twentieth-century novels that examine the effect industrialization had on communities, individuals, and, in the this case, on women and children.\"--Journal of Appalachian Studies", "related": [], "rank": 65466, "title": "The Power and the Glory", "author": "Grace MacGowan Cooke", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

While these three men have known one another separately for a long time, it was not until they were all three together in Heiligenkreuz, Austria teaching students from eastern Europe and central Asia at Haus Edelweiss (TCMI) that the three men sat together for the first time and shared their concerns for the health of congregations and the health of its leadership. We are convinced that a healthy leadership builds a healthy congregation. From these conversations over coffee came the idea for this series, designed to strengthen the health of elders as the congregation s leaders.While individuals were assigned their own chapters to write, the final form of each chapter was reviewed and reworked by all three authors sharing a common table, typically in Indianapolis, Indiana. Hence, the work is a tri-authored resource for the equipping of congregational leaders who serve as elders of the Church.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It never worked again.At the age of 12, he took his first computer apart, an IBM PC, inspected each piece to figure out what it did, and then proceeded to put it back together. Fortunately for his fragile ego, it continued to work after the violation.He spent his formative years learning everything he could about computer technology, the world of online communications (as in bulletin board systems, years before the commercial Internet was even a thing) and networking. He parlayed his knowledge into a career in his early twenties, along with raising a family of three children with his beautiful wife.When opportunity struck, he entered into the world of cable broadband, first as a broadband technician and eventually management. Having his first taste of true high speed Internet access in the late 90s and early 2000s, this only proved to fuel his passion and desire to interact with people, eventually leading to venturing into the world of podcasting, albeit late to the game.More can be found at his website, donovanadkisson.com", "related": ["B00HG78RKA"], "rank": 1149486, "title": "Podcasting Year One", "author": "Donovan Adkisson", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

De Neufville and Scholtes present a powerful and innovative new way of thinking about this persistent challenge. It should compel any engineer, planner, or policy maker involved with mega-projects to rethink how we conceive future systems and how we develop strategies for their realization. It is a significant advance.\"--Gregory B. Baecher, Glenn L. Martin Institute Professor of Engineering, University of Maryland(Gregory Baecher)\"De Neufville and Scholtes convincingly show us that enhancing flexibility in engineering design can help us a lot to improve our performance. Anchored in their research, the book is an easy read because both authors are also excellent pedagogues who take the reader step by step through some difficult materials. This book is a real must read for anybody involved in big scale projects.\"--Arnoud De Meyer, President and Professor, Singapore Management University(Arnoud De Meyer)\"This book is an important reference for those involved in planning infrastructure or building projects. It uniquely tackles the fact that uncertainty hangs over our planning of infrastructure development. Frequently we don't appreciate that building flexibility into future use may create the best value. The authors bring together the theory with practical examples to create a book which will help to reshape the thinking behind our approach to investment in our built environment.\"--Michael Haigh, Managing Director, Mott MacDonald Middle East and South Asia(Michael Haigh)\"Forecasts are a necessary part of planning major capital projects. The problem is these forecasts are almost always wrong. It is very important to recognize this truth and even more important to shield projects from the potential downsides of an uncertain future by building in flexibility. Professors de Neufville and Scholtes have provided a clear and practical guide, well supported by specific examples, on the science of identifying, justifying, and implementing flexibility in design.\"--Lloyd A. McCoomb, President and Chief Executive Officer, Toronto Pearson International Airport(Lloyd McCoomb)\"With this book, de Neufville and Scholtes have tackled the issue of flexibility in engineering design head-on, producing an essential companion for current and future engineering leaders. It is both a motivating and practical analysis of the power of flexibility to intelligently manage risks and seize the benefits that, in my long experience, are inherent in all major projects.\"--Ray O'Rourke, KBE, Founder and Chairman, The Laing O'Rourke Group(Ray O'Rourke)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It contains a photograph of a young woman's buttocks adorned with a butterfly birthmark. Ben recognizes the mark and says the photo must be of Sue Ellen Timberlake, the child of a soap millionaire kidnapped some two decades previously and never found (a case Lloyd wrote about in his bestselling Great American Kidnappings ). Another murder keeps H.J. interested and in danger as Ben maintains efforts to keep her safe.

The theme was not just found in Independence Day celebrations, which emphasized the nation's birth in warfare, but it was also seen on battlefields, at which casual travelers, visiting officials, misty-eyed veterans, and tourists confronted the nation's wartime heritage. According to Thomas A. Chambers, in this solidly researched and clearly written tome, such onlookers contoured the nation's public memory as much as any patriotic oration or celebration. Chambers has moved the debate about public memory into new territory. This is a valuable book that demands respect from historians of the early republic.\"‚ÄîJournal of American History\"In the engagingMemories of War, Thomas A. Chambers does a great job of analyzing tourism at some of the most significant early battle sites in U.S. history. He skillfully shows the political consequences of the personal experiences of battlefield visitors. Tourists at historic sites, as well as scholars interested in military history, memory, and cultural history, will find this book appealing and satisfying.\"‚ÄîSarah Purcell, Grinnell College, author ofSealed with Blood: War, Sacrifice, and Memory in Revolutionary America\"Chambers explores how and why key American battlefields became memorials and tourist attractions, and the potentially powerful psychological and emotional effect these sites can have on visitors evoking the past. . . . His descriptions demonstrate first-hand knowledge of each place as well as deep research into primary sources. Fascinating and original, this is recommended to scholars and informed readers of American military and cultural history.\"‚ÄîLibrary Journal(15 November 2012)\"Thomas A. Chambers has written a fascinating account of the motivations, methods, and discoveries of Americans who visited their earliest battlefields, and how this ultimately evolved into the preservation movement. His narrative is engaging and meticulously researched, with perceptive analysis.\"‚ÄîDavid F. Riggs, author ofEmbattled Shrine: Jamestown in the Civil War\"This fascinating study is ideal reading for the ongoing sesquicentennial of the Civil War and bicentennial of the War of 1812.

He studies all of the top comedians and tries out his jokes on everyone, be it his classmates or the customers at his Uncle Frankie's diner. He hopes to enter the Planet's Funniest Kid Comic Contest even though just the thought of it makes him a nervous wreck. Readers learn that humor for Jamie is a means of survival-things aren't easy for him. He doesn't like to talk about why it all happened, but he had to move to a new city, to live with \"the Smileys,\" his very unfunny aunt and uncle. At Long Beach Middle School, he is treated horribly by the resident bully. Steve Kosgrov is not only a notorious meany, but is also Jamie's new adoptive brother. Steve gets his kicks by locking him out in the cold and leaving him stuck in a sand dune unable to move. Jamie isn't able to move because he uses a wheelchair-he can't walk at all. The grimness of his situation is relieved by two good buddies, his encouraging Uncle Frankie, and his ever-present ability to see humor in every situation. Patterson's tale includes twists and turns that make for an engrossing read. Readers will be on Jamie's side all the way, cheering him on in the comedy contest, and also to win the girl of his dreams. Line drawings are sprinkled throughout, adding more humorous details.-Diane McCabe, John Muir Elementary, Santa Monica, CAŒ±(c) Copyright 2011.

Nevertheless it took its toll and a few years ago she realised that she couldn't continue. She needed to start writing again.Zoe aims to write popular books, which have complex characters and themes that get under the reader's skin. She finds her experience of working with people on the edge of society an inspiration for her fiction.She has a liking for books in which reality and fantasy meet. Her favourite books include Master and Margarita (Bulgakov), One Hundred Years Of Solitude (Marquez), Good Omens (Pratchett and Gaimon), Jane Eyre, Bull From The Sea (Renault), Fludd (Mantell) and Woman Who Waited (Makine).

She then progressed to interior design/decorating and space planning of commercial and residential properties. During this time, she also sold a line of hand-painted clothing and home goods, created jewelry and a \"safe\" garment for women to protect their money and credit cards while out shopping or dining--also allowing them \"hands-free\" movement.

All of these influences carry over into my mainstream and historical fiction. My family saga, Keeping the Family Peace, centers on the lives of a Navy family in the last part of the 20th century. I have the seeds for a Revolutionary War story germinating on my hard drive. (That degree in U.S. History is going to come in handy.) My current work-in-progress follows 12th century soldiers through the ordeals of the Third Crusade. Sometime soon, I hope to turn my eyes outward once more and write about galaxies far far away.

Souranoff's artistic career began early, with her first paying gig at age 5 or so while singing Happy Birthday to the milkman when the delivery came that day. Her ties to her Russian culture played an integral part in her outlook on life, as she was raised Russian Orthodox, a religion that strongly opposed same sex unions. She began expressing herself through writing only after she came out at the time her first partner left the relationship. It was heartbreaking, being out, alone, unsure and unsupported, so she picked up a pen and paper and began to write.  Only after a string of life threatening ordeals which resulted in a diagnosis of PTSD, did a light shine through the clouds (an Old Soul entered her life) and the discovery of a supportive Writers blog site which fostered creative blogging and encouraged her to continue writing, did Helen find the Full Moon Muse, or should it be said, the Muse found Helen. Those initial creative blog entries were three years ago; she's been writing regularly ever since. Over the course of her professional life, Ms. Souranoff has held a string of differing occupations. Starting out as a newspaper delivery girl, she moved onto other teen jobs such as gardener, cleaning lady, short order cook, busboy, bellhop, PBS operator and host.  She solidly moved onto the entertainment industry with The San Francisco Children's Opera, Locals 16 and 134 with concerts, live theatre and motion pictures. She has spent years with managing and producing live concerts, recordings and other programs as well, while simultaneously employed with a community college firstly in charge of evening operations of a media services department then progressing into management and direction of the theatrical program. Registered with SF/LA Central Casting, she has appeared as a background actor for some television and movie scenes. Ms. Souranoff has a blog where she has been known to visit during the full moon phase. She resides in the Santa Cruz Mountains of the beautiful state of California, USA with her partner Saira, 5 cats, 1 dog, a bird and lots of fish. Perpetually reinventing herself, Helen plans to continue on her new path to film making as well as keeping her goal growing as a creative writer. Being constantly reminded that she acts (and looks) way too young for her age, she takes that as a compliment and intends to keep enjoying being fresh at heart for as long a possible.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Not that that bothers me. I am, after all, a huge horror/slasher/gore movie fan. Reading it isn't much different than watching it... The descriptions are fantastic! The city, the people, the creatures, and the battles were extremely well written and I was able to visualize everything that was described...Brooke did a wonderful job of creating a new, strange world and transporting the reader there without coming across as unbelievable. The...author wrote with so much raw emotion during certain scenes that I could feel everything the characters felt. And who doesn't love a book that can really make you feel for the characters like that? Personally, I felt...based on how the story is structured, that much narrative is probably needed. And while there was a lot of action scenes, they felt a bit clunky to me at times...  Overall, it was a quick read with a plot that was easy to follow. I'm glad I had the opportunity to read it.

He decided to utilize his knowledge and passion in teaching to satisfy a long time desire to disprove the axiom ‚Äúthose who can‚Äôt do, teach!‚Äù He wanted to make a statement that this wasn‚Äôt true for those dedicated to the teaching profession. In 1983 Oreste returned to school for a post-doctoral degree in Marriage and Family Therapy. Subsequently, he directed two Marriage and Family Centers, Allegra Counseling Centers that were successful. He continued to teach for about ten years during this time. However, Oreste began to experience a great hunger and desire to write and retired as a professor- psychotherapist to write full time. He has completed three books: Sin Is Necessary, Illusion vs. Reality---Sounds Within and Without, and is completing Intrigue in Rome. Dr. Rondinella has traveled extensively in the last twenty-five years and conducted research and interviews that contributed to his books. As of October 1, 2003, Dr. Rondinella has resumed his independent practice of marriage and family therapy including individual psychotherapy.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a child, I poured my heart out into a journal, under the covers with a flashlight, rather than face the demons of my dark bedroom.  As an adult, I went to the University of Alaska and earned a B.A. degree in English Literature because I wanted to know the authors through their words, as fiction, I believe, is a corridor to the writer's soul.  In college, I edited our periodical, \"Permafrost\", a wonderfully eclectic mix of poetry, short stories and free assocation writing.  Later, I earned an M.S. degree at the University of Wyoming and became a Speech/Language Pathologist for twenty-five years.  During that time, my passion was spending time with children who were diagnosed with Autism, as well as teaching children of all ages to read and write.  One of the characters in my book, \"Second Chances\", is a child with Autism, who shows his family that what they perceived to be a disability, is actually a gift.  My two children, ages ten and twelve, are prolific writers and readers themselves, but are most passionate about horses, spending most of their time riding and caring for their beautiful mares, Allegro and Heads Up Penny.  They event and trail ride and have sleepovers in haylofts with their horse loving friends.  Hay in the hair is typical in my house, but it's considered socially acceptable because we live in the mountains of Vermont, where the natural world and all its extraordinary elements are what you eat, breathe and love.  Someday, I will take my children and their horses west, to see the grandeur that I recall from childhood, when my father took us camping in the rockiest of mountains and the lushest of valleys. Until then, I ride, I write, I read, I mother, and I love this moment, right now, when I am talking to you through words on a page.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The Walker family‚Äîfather George, teenage Jeanette, and her older half-siblings Hester and Sam‚Äîare haunted by the disappearance of Jeanette‚Äôs mother, Grace, presumed killed in a bombing. The young adults of the household are bullied by George‚Äôs aunt, Ethel, who rules with an acid tongue and cruel punishments, though she comes across as less fearsome than Francis likely intended. Danger and romance seemingly lurk around every corner, as Jeanette gets mixed up with a rough crowd and Hester is taken in by a lothario. Francis makes some questionable plot decisions, particularly involving an assault on Hester, yet signals a growing sense of hope by suitably pairing off each Walker child, and saving a whopping revelation about Jeanette‚Äôs mother for the very end. --Patty Wetli", "related": [], "rank": 211474, "title": "Memories Are Made of This", "author": "June Francis", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I also dreamt of heroes and villains and the women that inspired the best and worst in them.It seemed like every book I read as a teen was a classic bodice-ripper. Wimpy-virgin-heroine always making bad choices and getting herself in trouble, cue the macho hero, yadda yadda yadda. Those books are what inspired me to write my own stories, not because I loved them, but because I constantly found myself tossing them aside and fuming. I would think of all the ways the story would have been better: if she had just picked up the sword and stabbed the bad guy when she had the chance...I LOVE writing, and I love the new direction that fiction has taken over the last decade. So many amazing, strong female leads now! And so many new writers that finally have a voice in the indie publishing community.I was blessed with a wonderful husband who supports my passion for writing and reading, and who really helped me focus my desire to publish my work. When I'm not busy enjoying my daughter and husband, I'm usually developing a new story idea, or sneaking in a bit of free time with my favorite authors.I'm a bit of a hermit, they called it being \"shy\" when I was a kid, but I love hearing from fans. I also love ferrets, hiking, chili dark chocolate, strong coffee, nursing mamas, and rain.‚Äã", "related": ["B0041KKMG2"], "rank": 1784974, "title": "Asherah: the Bar'axus Bridge Chronicles (Book Three)", "author": "Aimee Roseland", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Although they follow a definite pattern (as is the case with episode's)\neach episode is written as a stand-alone story in its own right - so don't be\nafraid to 'jump in' anywhere along the line.Aviemore, the small town at the centre of\nthe story, is very much a real place and certainly worth a visit if you are\never in Scotland. Indeed, most of the places mentioned in the stories are in\nfact real places, though the names may have been altered for privacy's sake.\nThe green lochan for instance is a fantastic place for a picnic - and it is\nactually an opaque green colour. Do fairies really wash their clothes there?Although these episodes are categorised as\ncontemporary romance, I have to admit that there is as much action and\nadventure included, especially in the later stories. Contemporary romance it\nseems, is a little more 'gritty' these days than Sally and Robert would be\nhappy with - the Highland idea of morals a little more adverse to 'getting you're\nkit out' perhaps! Subsequently 'adult' content is only included where it actually\nplays a part in the overall story - if you're looking for gratuitous hot and\nsteamy sex scenes - these stories are perhaps not for you!I have visited and stayed in Aviemore many\ntimes, and continue to do so whenever I get the chance. It is a quiet peaceful\ntown, surrounded by spectacular mountains and beautiful highland scenery. - Ideal\nfor long walks and planning the next Sally book! This Highland town is popular\nboth in summer and winter for the many outdoor pursuits available; with Skiing\nin the¬†Cairngorm Mountains, being the\nmajor draw over the winter period.Through these stories, I invite you to share\nand experience (albeit vicariously) the life of Sally and Robert, along with\ntheir growing family; as they settle into life in the highlands of Scotland. Encountering\nadventure and tribulation as well as love and romance - even murder mystery ! -¬†life's twists and turns ensure that drama\nand intrigue, are never far away from the Lindsey household.", "related": ["B00B8RJNU2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He spent most of his childhood with his grandmother Efrosinia Verkhusha, a village healer.As a teenager Vladimir occasionally visited Father Feodorit, a priest of the Trinity-Sergiyev Monastery. Later he was shown there the picture ¬´The One and Only¬ª which he described in his second book before the picture was revealed to the world.Vladimir started an independent life early and left the parents' house at the age of 16. Since 1974 he lived in Novosibirsk and worked as a photographer with Novosibirskoblfoto, a service company.At the beginning of Perestroika (reforms of the late 1980s) he was the president of the Inter-Regional Association of Siberian Entrepreneurs. In 1994-5 he organized two large-scale trade expeditions with a fleet of river steamers along the River Ob along the route Novosibirsk -- Salekhard -- Novosibirsk at his own expense.

He is someone who cares about the people around him, who wants to improve the society we all live in, who hopes on a daily basis to leave the planet a little better than it was the previous day and who is cognizant that the impact he has on the world is minimal. Tilting at windmills is a major part of his character as is a deep love for all those who need to be loved. In his own mind he is a complex, multi-layered, unique character in the kaleidoscoping drama of life. Most of my writing deals with social issues that I feel need addressed.   My feelings are generally worn boldly on my sleeves and that is how I address social issues.   Parents that travel or are deployed, domestic abuse, feelings of alienation, bullies, blindness, stepmothers, the demise of pets are all things that I have addressed or plan on addressing in my books.    My target market is children.   This is most likely due to my personal unwillingness to accept all aspects of maturity.    What kids feel and understand is often grossly underestimated.   I have hopes of providing kids with some help in dealing with social issues that many of them face.    Most of all I hope to write things that kids will want to read.   As our society becomes more and more technical there is one old skill that is increasing in demand, the ability to read and to comprehend what you read.   The ability to read a book certainly provides you with the ability to read a technical manual or to read the text on a LCD screen whether it is on your computer or your cellular phone.   Reading for enjoyment not only broadens the mind, it can decrease stress and make life more enjoyable.   Success is measured in many ways.   I felt successful in my working life whether it was slinging baloney, teaching or fixing computers.   When I had a 7 year old approach me and tell me she loved my book I truly felt I was an author.  My goal as an author isn‚Äôt selling a lot of books.  My goal is to touch children‚Äôs lives and help them live life a little better.    Education: B.S.

That sounds clich√©, I know, but it's very accurate. The book is\nextensively researched, and the historical accuracy, from what I could tell, is\nincredible.¬† The idea that a woman\nworking in an alms house as a healer could be a witch, seemed\npreposterous.¬† Naturally, she was my\nfavourite character. ¬†Full review:¬† alyssalinnpalmer.com¬†Mike Dixon has taken a childhood\ncuriosity, delved into the history and then created a story that engages and\nentertains as it gives a feel for the times.\nWhat you won't find in Wolf Wood is a story that has clearly defined\ngood and bad, right and wrong: each character tries to show their reasons for\ntheir actions and, while those reasons may not be particularly tasteful, they\nare there.¬† This was a fun read, engaging\nwith lots of ideas, action and characters to enjoy and follow. ¬†Full review:\niam-indeed.com¬†I enjoyed the writing in this story\nand it pulled me back to keep reading.

He spent most of his professional career in New England, working in computer manufacturing and distribution. After he retired in 2009 near Phoenix Arizona, he needed to utilize his pent-up creativity and turned to writing fiction as an outlet. In the last two years, he has published five novels in the Scott Tucker Series. Dick continues to display his ability to craft diversified and thought-provoking short stories. Eleven competition entries came in first, and were published in an anthology with over thirty other authors. He continues to enter competitions and has won several times this year, and those stories will be published in a second anthology in 2014. Dick writes the kind of novel he would like to read. He feels if a reader doesn‚Äôt finish one of his novels, he has failed that reader. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Very interesting characters and the well thought out plot just wouldn't let me put the book down‚Ä¶‚Äù His current Scott Tucker series consists of five novels, all involving a serial-killer, or killers. Each novel creates a personal need for Scott Tucker to get involved and help solve the murders. The first novel starts while Scott is attending Harvard as an undergraduate and the others continue following his graduation. Dick uses his knowledge of New England, along with his experience as a Real Estate Broker, member of the National Guard, and business analyst to weave suspense-filled novels that are designed to be ‚Äòpage turners.‚Äô ‚Äú‚Ä¶great suspense/mystery that will draw you in and won't let you go until the last page is read‚Ä¶‚Äù As a former certified project manager he uses many of his analytical and planning skills to design and structure plots that create interesting stories. His writing style has been compared to best-selling author Robert B. Parker, who also writes about New England in short chapter format.

Climate is commonly thought of as the expected weather conditions at a given location over time. People know when they go to New York City in winter, they should take a heavy coat. When they visit the Pacific Northwest, they should take an umbrella. Climate can be measured as many geographic scales - for example, cities, countries, or the entire globe - by such statistics as average temperatures, average number of rainy days, and the frequency of droughts. Climate change refers to changes in these statistics over years, decades, or even centuries.Enormous progress has been made in increasing our understanding of climate change and its causes, and a clearer picture of current and future impacts is emerging. Research is also shedding light on actions that might be taken to limit the magnitude of climate change and adapt to its impacts.Climate Change: Evidence, Impacts, and Choicesis intended to help people understand what is known about climate change. First, it lays out the evidence that human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, are responsible for much of the warming and related changes being observed around the world. Second, it summarizes projections of future climate changes and impacts expected in this century and beyond. Finally, the booklet examines how science can help inform choice about managing and reducing the risks posed by climate change. The information is based on a number of National Research Council reports, each of which represents the consensus of experts who have reviewed hundreds of studies describing many years of accumulating evidence.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science & Math", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They've all been intimidated by her height, her brain and her\n take charge attitude and weren't worth the distraction from her goals.\nHowever, moving to Montana has introduced her to a whole new type of man\n and suddenly she's eager to try out all she's been missing. When Eric\nFrost comes home for a visit, Nikki finally has a chance to live a few\nof her fantasies. He's big, strong and definitely dominant. Plus Nikki\nknows he's only in town for a few weeks so that works with her no string\n fling idea. But will she really be able to keep it casual once his\nbrother Matt joins in, especially with both brothers looking towards a\nfuture with her.I loved this book! Eric and Matt are two incredibly hot cowboys, and the\n chemistry between them and Nikki is incredible. And oh man the sex\nscenes, I'm surprised my computer didn't melt as I was reading them. But\n I think what makes them even better is that they are written into a\nreally great story. You actually get to know the characters and the\ncommunity that they live in. You find out what makes them the people\nthey are and find yourself caring about their lives. I also loved the\ntouches of humor in the story that just make it all seem that much more\nreal. This is the second book in the Climax, Montana series but it can\neasily be read as a stand alone novel.

Thorough reporting and brilliant writing combine to make FACTORY MAN an exciting, fast-paced account of a quintessentially American story that affects us all.\"‚ÄîLee Smith, author ofGuests on Earth\"Beth Macy sees twists and subtleties that other journalists can't see, and she writes about the world around her with grit, honesty and remarkable grace.

She is a great American writer. She sees everything, all the precious detail. A few years back, as the world was collapsing around us, she did a story on the temp who was answering phones at a hotline for those in financial hot water. The temp was this immense hero in all these ways that nobody else would have ever recognized. Of course, Macy never called her a hero. She just let the story do the work.\"‚ÄîRoland Lazenby, author ofMichael Jordan\"John Bassett's story has everything. An extraordinary dynasty, a relevant and inspiring message, and one of the best heroes I've read about in years. It works on every level, from the most personal betrayal to the realities of the global economy, from the struggle of one worker in a small Appalachian town to the future of our cultural as a whole. Part of me wishes I'd found John Bassett III, because this is powerful stuff, but it's obvious the story is in excellent hands with Beth Macy.

For it was in 1717 that a ship, the Whydah went aground, reportedly carrying a fabulous treasure. In the 1980s, three salvage groups went head-to-head, competing to find the wreck. The controversy over the salvage got hot at times and I thought there might be a book in their story. I was working for a newspaper at the time.  I developed my own detective, an ex-cop, diver, fisherman, and PI named Aristotle ‚ÄúSoc‚Äù Socarides. He was more philosophical than hard-boiled. Making his first appearance in ‚ÄúCool Blue Tomb,‚Äù the book won the Shamus award for Best Paperback novel. After many years in the newspaper business, I turned to writing fiction and churned out five more books in the series. Clive Cussler blurbed: ‚ÄúThere can be no better mystery writer in America than Paul Kemprecos.‚Äù Despite the accolades, the Soc series lingered in mid-list hell. By the time I finished my last book, I was thinking about another career that might make me more money, like working in a 7-11. Several months after the release of ‚ÄúBluefin Blues,‚Äù Clive called and said a spin-off from the Dirk Pitt series was in the works. It would be called the NUMA Files and he wondered if I would be interested in tackling the job.  I took on the writing of ‚ÄúSerpent‚Äù which brought into being Kurt Austin and the NUMA Special Assignments Team. Austin had some carry-over from Soc, and another team member, Paul Trout, had been born on Cape Cod. The book made The New York Times bestseller list, as did every one of seven NUMA Files that followed, including ‚ÄúPolar Shift,‚Äù which bumped ‚ÄúThe DaVinci Code‚Äù for first place. After eight NUMA Files I went back to writing solo. I wrote an adventure book entitled, The Emerald Scepter, which introduced a new hero, Matinicus ‚ÄúMatt‚Äù Hawkins. I have been working on the re-release of my Soc series in digital and print, and in 2013, responding to numerous requests, I brought Soc back again in a seventh Socarides book entitled, Grey Lady. My wife Christi and I live on Cape Cod where she works as a financial advisor. We live in a circa 1865 farmhouse with two cats. We have three children and seven granddaughters.

This parallel story line could have muddled the plot but, on the contrary, it succeeded in enhancing the narrative. This novella is an easy and enjoyable read, and it is a prelude to the author's next book, Pollianah Got Married.

While I hadn't read the first book, it was easy\nenough to grasp the ideas once I read into the first few chapters. The\nwriting style was unique and different, first showing us flashes of\ndreams and then broadening to showcase whole passages and moments. It\nwas both captivating and something that I haven't really experienced\nlately. Emari has been living (dreaming?) her life as a rock star, but\nas always, life does come back to haunt her. She is still reeling from\nNick and how he left things, and there is a lot of interesting back and\nforth between the two. Sabre is one of the titular Dream Weavers and it\nis his weave that Emari has been living in, and he and Nick are at odds.\n However, the three need to team up in order to stand up to Thomas and\nWilliam, who are causing all kinds of trouble.I love the kind ofpseudo-scientific supernaturalquality that Williams employs regarding the manipulation of memories. There was anInception-esque quality to the story, but enough unique ideas and cool thoughts that made it really shine on its own. The mind is a mysterious\nplace, and dreams and memories are one of the remaining types of mystery\n left on Earth. Williams continues to tap into this in her series and\ndoes so with aplomb and skill. Emari is a very genial character, and she\n has the type of clever mind that makes you really respect a character\nas well as like her. William's writing style is a lot stronger than many\n in theYA genreso this was quite the pleasure to read.", "related": ["B00I25I2WS"], "rank": 1469508, "title": "ROCK STAR - Dream Weaver Novels Book 2", "author": "Su Williams", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.6667, "rating_total": 28.0}

RecordsUniquely, The Punk Rock Las Vegas Survival Guide is written for both participants and spectators and even for the voyeur like myself looking on enviously from afar. It embodies the best of punk and of bowling: the DIY ethos of punk with the equally vibrant sport for all ethos of 10 pin bowling. Putting the 2 together in Las Vegas is, as author Bob Oedy states, a stroke of genius. This book is your insider's guide to the controlled explosion of good natured bonhomie, both of the pit and the lanes. --Robbie Fields aka Posh BoyThe Punk Rock Las Vegas Survival Guide gives the reader insight that would take the average bowling tournament attendee years to figure out.

Dr. Jay Earley\nhas created an online program, Self-Therapy Journey, and booklet to help us\nunderstand and modify common eating patterns, such as emotional eating to soothe\nourselves, self-berating thoughts about overeating, and \"zoning out\" so that we\naren't aware of what we eat.¬† No other\nweight management program exists that even attempts to address these core\npsychological patterns.¬†The system includes an evidence-based psychotherapy called\nInternal Family Systems, which is user friendly and includes mindfulness and\nmeditation. This makes Self-Therapy Journey a comprehensive interactive online\ntool for managing weight.¬† If you can't\nafford individual therapy and want help on your own time-frame, this may be the\njourney for you.--Denise Ray, MSW, LGSW¬†¬†Even though you may be interested in working with one\nissue of concern (such as overeating), Self-Therapy Journey creates an\nengagement with yourself that has far-reaching healing potential.¬†The\ndynamic mapping and stages of this system allow us to safely move through the\nmaze of our inner complexity in a step-by-step manner.¬†Using\nSelf-Therapy Journey to Stop Overeatingoffers detailed instructions for taking this thorough, in-depth, computer-assisted\njourney. It¬†also provides a good introduction to Internal Family Systems\nTherapy and the Pattern System.As a\ntherapist, I expect that Self-Therapy Journey will prove to be very helpful for\nboth users working on their own and those working with a professional. It\noffers a continuity of inner work, a clarity of steps, and an important\nfourfold mind/emotion/social interaction/behavior integration.¬†It was\ndeveloped for whole-brain, multiple intelligences, so your strengths will be\nengaged and you will develop new skills and understandings. This is a breakthrough\nin self-directed psychological work, making personal transformation available\nto a potentially large audience. ¬†--John\nCardwell, MSW¬†¬†Self Therapy Journey\nis a unique tool, giving you the power to take charge of disordered eating. You\ncan be confident of getting to the root of the issue, not just dealing with the\nsymptom--excessive weight gain--but the emotional roots.¬† You are not judged\nbut rather given a sense of hope. Anyone who has struggled to gain control of\ntheir eating will recognize the different patterns involved--the Indulger, the Food\nController, and particularly the Foggy Pattern, which seem to be conspire\nagainst us being able to tackle eating issues. With Self-Therapy Journey, you\ncan be confident that no stone will be left unturned. You will see the dynamics\nof the different parts and their roles in your internal struggle. With this\nunderstanding, and with the help of the bookletUsing Self-Therapy Journey\nto Stop Overeating, you can have true hope of finally regaining a\nhealthy relationship with food.--Alison Watson, BA\nHons Counseling, MBACP", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
