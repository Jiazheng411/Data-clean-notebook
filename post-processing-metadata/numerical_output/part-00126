Abby Ryzner, a 13-year-old Goth, has vanished, and the last person to see her alive was her former best friend. Emma switched schools and distanced herself from Abby and a fantasy game the two of them had played for years after a traumatizing episode in which she was labeled a freak. With mixed emotions, Emma joins the search. Chapter titles provide a grim countdown of the passing days. Emma feels caught between two worlds–that of her new, fashionable friends and Abby's punk-looking companions who are into D & D. As she begins to hang out with Abby's friends, including Ski, a guy she can talk to, Emma finds herself, once again, absorbed by role-playing games. Knowing Abby was trying to set up a challenging, live-action game, Emma and Ski descend into the bowels of an industrial plant, armed only with flashlights against a scary, pitch-dark maze of tunnels with gurgling pipes. To their horror, they discover the truth about Abby's disappearance. The two mysteries keep readers guessing. Emma, the narrator, gradually gains strength to surmount shameful memories and learns to accept her own uniqueness. She also makes peace with Abby's family, after showing compassion and imagination in helping resolve the puzzle of their daughter's whereabouts.–Susan W.

The 10-year-old concocts grand plans that never quite come off as intended. His climb up a tree requires the Jaws of Life to free him, a first for the Washington, DC, fire department. His essay on head lice wins him the Homework of the Week award and his mother's consternation. When Adam and his friend Sam catch a snake, Sam's baby sister carts it around at night and drops it in her parents' bed. Adam struggles with the right idea for his science project; his experiments with plaster of Paris (never pour it down a drain), diapers, and mosquitoes produce typical Melonhead disasters. The final invention will entertain and educate readers. This is the first book in the series, a spin-off of the author's \"Lucy Rose\" books (Random). It is laugh-out-loud funny, rivaling Stink and Fudge in its troublemaker quotient. Adam never quite understands consequences until it is too late, but young readers will see potential trouble ahead while appreciating his ingenuity. The capital setting and a unique cast of secondary characters round out this strong chapter-book offering.—Caitlin Augusta, The Darien Library, CTCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

High school English teacher Rebecca Leighton leads a calm, even boring life in a quiet Connecticut town until an anonymous stalker begins threatening her. Her tormentor paints her skylights black, destroys her garden and laces her tea with LSD. Though the police say they can't help, one enigmatic detective is drawn to both Rebecca and her case. Could Ray, the strangely secretive man with whom she has just ended an affair, be the source of these horrifying pranks, or is the culprit his troubled son, who blames all his misery on his father's girlfriend? Further complicating Rebecca's life is the depression and strange behavior of her best friend, Agnes. By the time Rebecca discovers the identity of her stalker, her sedate existence has been permanently altered, in some ways for the better. Marlowe successfully depicts the danger and mental instability that lie just beneath the surface of small-town life, and her narrative style is smooth. However, her story lacks the vividness of character and degree of action needed to build an atmosphere of terror.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's a great story, but Anderson has trouble staying out of its way; he continually oversells in an effort to persuade readers for whom Grange is an unfamiliar name that he was as big as Babe Ruth or Jack Dempsey. The effort is unnecessary: the significance of Grange's status as a wholesome star athlete entering the unseemly world of the fledgling NFL speaks for itself, as does the amazing success of his manager's efforts to cash in on Grange's fame. (Between the Bears and various endorsement deals, they made roughly $500,000 in two months—over $6 million in today's dollars.) At times, the account feels like a solid magazine piece that's been stretched thin, reducing a genuinely transformative moment in sports history to an episodic highlight reel.(Dec. 29)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Other law enforcement officers are soon murdered. A possible link to the killings is a mysterious mansion purportedly built by investor Harold Schwartzman, who may have bought up bars in Brighton's \"Helltown.\" Looking for someone trustworthy, Copp turns to detective Delilah Turner, who seems genuinely worried about the killings, but may also be less than truthful about reasons for her visits to the mansion. A romance ensues, but it is just a punctuation mark in Pendleton's ( Copp for Hire ) gripping story, as more cops and ostensible bystanders are slaughtered.

She has three grown sons, three gorgeous granddaughters, and one perfect great-grandson. Her first published work was a poem in a Junior and Senior High School anthology, many years ago. Since then her articles have appeared in leading children's magazines. \"Secrets I Have Kept\" is her first published novel.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sutherland, Ph.D. She is a Registered Nurse with a Master's degree in psychiatric nursing from U.C.L.A. and a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Texas, Austin. As a professor at a large state university she was the principle investigator on numerous research grants. Two of the most significant were the Department of Health and Human Services grant funded for $493,000 which focused on minority women and men and their educational needs titled Affirming At-risk Minorities for Success (ARMS). The second grant funded by the Texas Research Development division for $43,000.00 examined the needs of White and Hispanic women in recovery from substance abuse. This research titled Women in Substance Abuse Recovery: Measures of Resilience and Self-differentiation was published in the prestigious Western Journal of Nursing Research. Sutherland has 33 articles published in juried and refereed journals and books. Her love of writing caused her to venture beyond the boundaries of academic publications in the genre of non-fiction New Age texts, historical novels and short-stories. In 1989 she published the mystical and self-help non-fiction book Abraham the Initiator on Spirit, Will and Ego, soon followed by The Gnostic Practitioners Workbook. Sutherland s 2001 historical novel, Mary Magdalene Disciple of Christ, is based on the translation of ancient codices found in Nag Hammadi, Egypt in 1945 revealing Mary Magdalene s significant contribution to the development of early Christianity. In 2003 her short story Pallet in Front of the Stove was published by Moondance receiving positive reviews.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book's narrow scope is justified, since mountain bikes require different criteria for fit and riding technique than their road-going cousins. Sloane flies off on some interesting tangents, e.g., providing advice on how to signal passing airplanes with a tree limb if lost in the wild. On the whole, though, his guide is a useful addition to the literature and is recommended for public libraries. Maintenance is another matter. Mountain bikes are, after all, bikes, and therefore if you can maintain a road bike you can do the same to a mountain bike. The focus of Sloane's New Bicycle Maintenance Manual (S. & S., 1981) is general bike maintenance. Practices covered include keeping brakes and frame safe; adjusting derailleurs (including index systems); lubing and repacking bottom brackets, hubs, and headsets; caring for chains and freewheel, pedals, saddles, handlebars, cables, tires; and trueing and building wheels. While the information here is adequate and Sloane's writing is clear, the same coverage can be found in a number of standard sources libraries may own (e.g., Glenn's Complete Bicycle Manual , LJ 7/73; Bicycling's Complete Guide to Bicycle Maintenance & Repair , LJ 5/1/86; and Anybody's Bike Book , LJ 11/1/90). Recommended for collections lacking one of the above. (Illustrations not seen.)-- Thomas K.

He’s envisioning destitution for his family, and desperate times call for, well, robbing the bank that hired him to design its security system but outsourced the code writing to India. Dan has friends, also programmers, in the same situation, and they agree to take part. His slick plan is to rob only the safe-deposit boxes held by a brutal Russian mobster and finger a notorious Italian mobster for the crime. But the heist goes wildly, lethally wrong. Two bank customers are shot; the Russian, a former KGB “interrogator,” goes medieval; and the software engineers are forced into something not part of their skill set: improvisation. Zeltserman has used criminals as protagonists to fine effect in the past (Pariah, 2009), but this time his characters are honest guys who only begin to act like criminals after the crime.

Despite the fact that she and the doctor have never seen eye to eye, Christine agrees to help him search for Deirdre -- only to discover her brutally strangled body in the lake.Heartbroken, Leo tells Christine that his daughter was deaf and had recently given birth to a child she had deliberately ensured would be deaf. As a militant suporter of the Deaf Culture, Deirdre wanted a deaf child to make a political statement. Although some people supported her stand, many did not -- including Deirdre's own father. Christine must use her new kills as a forensic profiler to discover the killer.A light, but fun read.(Packet & Times)This is a well-written book, full of energy, excellent characterization and a great plot. Jennings' new series is on its way to success.(Ken Kilpatrick)Jennings unravels her narrative with deliberate precision, setting up a cavalcade of possible suspects and intriguing plot twists.(Sarah Weinman)I was utterly fascinated by Maureen Jennings' depiction of deaf culture in K Handshape ... Some really nice detective work on Christine's part, with her colleagues offering their forensic profiling skills at their regular meetings, makes this a super read.Talented author Maureen Jennings shows us a world we know little about and the difficulties in communicating with the deaf friends of the victim in the search for a motive and a killer. Recommended as a read for any mystery fan who likes to venture into different worlds and subcultures ... Enjoy. I did.(Anne K. Edwards)Maureen Jennings is a mystery writer of imaginative precision, andThe K Handshapeenhances this reputation. It is well plotted, with cleverly placed clues and dialogue that shape the characters and highlight the tension. Sub-plots enrich the multilayered story - - a hallmark of Jennings' consummate skill as a storyteller ... Jennings' writing merges solid procedural work with atmosphere and character interaction. She is a humane observer of the circus of life.The K Handshapeoffers a challenging conclusion and is a most satisfying read.(Don Graves)... a remarkably poignant story about the murder of a young deaf woman who was simply trying to break down discriminatory barriers for the hearing impaired ... Jennings is a master at drawing out  her characters, here introducing new ones along with some from the past whom she brought to life in Christine Morris's first case.(Mike Gillespie)Jennings' new series is on its way to success.Jennings is highlighting an aspect of modern police work that is understood by few.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Middle-aged, a widower-and battling an ominous pain in his testicles that nearly matches his libido in its intensity-Johnnie lifts weights to embody the \"Daddy\" persona he craves: an older man who's hot enough to attract a man half his age. But can he find true love with the youthful Joe Callahan, a former gay porn actor and callboy? Or will he find love where he least expects it? Between scenes of receiving bad news (his mother is diagnosed with a brain tumor) and comforting those he loves, Johnny drowns his grief in bouts of loveless and sometimes anonymous sex, which is graphically depicted in adolescent terms that too often render it-like the entire novel-more silly than erotic.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In no other volume with which I'm familiar is the issue of white antiracist accountability handled so directly, honestly, and from so many important angles and perspectives. This volume provides insight, inspiration and much needed instruction for those of us seeking to be stronger, more effective allies in the struggle for racial equity. --Tim Wise,antiracist white ally, author,White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son,andColorblind: The Rise of Post-Racial Politics and the Retreat from Racial EquityWhite people publicly standing up against racism AWESOME!!Accountability and White Anti-racist Organizinglights the path for White anti-racist activists to become effective in their work and build sustainability as a collective. Accountability is the key to building cross racial relationships in the movement to undo racism and create a more just society. This book offers guidance, shares the process and pitfalls of organizers across professional disciplines, and gives hope to anyone doing racial equity work who may feel isolated or lost. Despite the book s explicit address to White readers, there is much here that will benefit People of Color as well as organizations who wish to gain clarity about the role of accountability in addressing institutional racism. --Mary Pender Greene,LCSW-R, woman of color, psychotherapist, organizational consultant, activistBonnie Cushing and her fellow editors have put together a startling and edifying collection of articles that provide us with a deep insight into the minds of those who have been transformed by their work as whites engaged in anti-racist organizing. It's so easy for people engaged in social change work to get lost in our own self-righteousness and lose a perspective on the limitations of our own impact on those whom we imagine we have come to help. This book should be read by anyone who plans to do any form of organizing work. And organizer or not, if you care to defeat racism in American society, you need to grapple with some of the issues raised in the stories from the actual anti-racist work presented here. --Rabbi Michael Lerner,Jewish American, editor ofTikkun Magazine,chair of the Network of Spiritual Progressives, and author ofThe Left Hand of God", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Students will love references to giving a prissy sister a worm for her birthday, inviting Frankenstein to the party, and eating a whole cake the night before the big day. In addition to Lansky's works, eight other poets, including Dr. Seuss, are represented. Lindstrom's black-and-white drawings play up the slapstick humor: a cake is made with flour (a yellow rose), the icing with ice; candles are blown out with such enthusiasm that icing, drinks, and party hats are victims of the gale. The book is similar to the work of Shel Silverstein and Jack Prelutsky, and the topic is beloved by all children.

There is such an air of pertness about every one of the speakers, and the story is told almost entirely by means of conversations, that the reader gets the impression that all the characters are referring to jests known only to themselves, as if he were overhearing private conversations. As may be imagined, this scrappy way of writing soon becomes very tiresome from the difficulty the reader has in detecting the hidden meaning of these curt sentences. The book tells the love of Rollo for Wych Hazel, and indulges in gentle satire against parties, round dances, etc. The love-story is made obscure, Rollo's manners are called Spanish, and he is in many ways a peculiar young man.

She remembers her struggling as a single-mom, raising two lively sons, holding down a job, and trying to find time to write. Often late at night she would be found typing on her old portable typewriter, using any paper she could get her hands on. She still has some of her first manuscripts that were typed on the backs of her sons' school papers.  Then nearly 30 years ago she received a computer as a birthday gift and her life changed. In 1988 she sold her first article and short stories soon followed. Today she's been published in a variety of media, from newspaper and magazine articles, to short stories.  She also has six novels published and a collection of her shorter work.  She was at one time the Relationship's Editor at Bella Online, one of the leading women's web sites in the world. Rescued Hearts is the second novel in her “Everyday Hereos” series.  Three years ago Pam returned with her husband, Ken, to the Boyertown area and they live in the home built by her father when she was just 4 years old.  She has many fond memories of her days growing up in Boyertown and hopes to one day touch base with some of her friends from school.  She and Ken are actively involved with their church. In fact, much of what she writes is driven by her faith. Her testimony tells how as God changed her, her writing also changed. Her writing goal is to bring Him glory in the stories she tells. As much as she enjoys writing, she treasures her time away from her computer when she and Ken can be with their five children, their spouses and four grandchildren.", "related": ["B0057ZE7A2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Smooth, affluent\nand charming his attitude towards his \"roster\" girls, and his cynical\npick-up routine initially made me despise him; but his honesty and \"I am\n what I am\" philosophy was both engaging and endearing.   Bethany,\nAdam's love interest, is the voice of convention. She falls in\nlove with Adam and tries to persuade him to adopt a life of monogamy.\nBethany's main concern is that she not appear \"judgmental\". Adam tries\nto show her that being judgmental is a natural part of being human, but\nthis minor difference foreshadows much greater divisions to come. In the\n first half of the book Mike depicts Bethany as someone who is extremely\n beautiful and intelligent, a paragon of female beauty. In the second\nhalf he deconstructs that image, showing Bethany to be as flawed as many\n of the characters she tries-and fails- not to judge.All in all, a wonderful, funny, challenging exploration of the rules of romantic relationships.  I loved this book, 5/5", "related": ["B00GUN9RAU"], "rank": 28901, "title": "Secrets of the Elusive Lover - Book 1: The Personal Journal of a Playboy", "author": "Mike Wells", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 14, "rating_average": 3.6429, "rating_total": 51.0}

She explores the mystique that has grown up around Saturday night, the one night that allows significant variety and opportunity for socialization. Also examined is the seemingly random violence that occurs more often on Saturday night than at any other time. But whether discussing the social etymology of the phrase \"Saturday Night Special\" or the tribulations of arriving after 9 p.m. at the video store, which earlier \"would probably still have some color movies available,\" the book reveals much about ourselves.

First and forever foremost, Otto, and his wife of many years, parented five beautiful children. They currently have four grandchildren, each of whom is a uniquely wonderful light in life. Otto was High School Valedictorian, Magna Cum Laude graduate from Rockhurst Jesuit University, and has performed graduate work in Mathematics, Nuclear Physics, and Political Science. He has earned varsity letters in all sports. Otto is a veteran, a veritable war hero, as the \"gunning guard\" for the Brigade Bombardiers at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo, while the real war, the one in Vietnam, raged without him. But American flags still wave in the heartland, so heroic was his defense of it from Communism, while he was playing basketball. He has also taught Mathematics at Indiana University, has run for public office, taught \"public speaking\" at Hallmark Cards, toiled for years as a Techno-Dork, been a guest on talk shows, and has been published over 200 times in various venues. He remains non-controversial in his life, and throughout his public outbursts, by speaking primarily on topics about which he claims special expertise: politics, religion and sex. He was born and raised in Jefferson City Missouri, but has yet to grow up. Since his military service, his homes have been in Bloomington, In, Chicago, Il, and most recently for many decades in the Kansas City, Mo, area. The Rieke family has suffered cataclysmic tragedies in life, which have rocked hearts, minds, and spirits. But this book is not a cosmic pity party. It is fun, engaging, and if not thoroughly entertaining, he has failed. Many of his public rants are woven into the story, and should entertain, inform, and inspire the reader. Otto possesses a visionary perception about the cosmos that make his story telling riveting. His great vision notwithstanding", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For the uninitiated, it follows the stoic, hulking, and streetwise Jack Reacher, a former military policeman who's now a drifter with a vast capacity for protective and retributive violence. The short story \"Second Son\" is a snapshot of the life of Reacher and his family circa 1974, while they're stationed on a military base in Okinawa. Upon arriving they immediately get into deep trouble that's compounded by some bad news. For those new to Child's writing, the action is interspersed with contemplative moments, such as when Jack's grandfather, a prosthetic-limb maker in Paris, recounts that \"… a great war leaves a country with three armies: an army of cripples, an army of mourners, and an army of thieves.\" This tightly constructed story pulls readers right to the end and is sure to find new fans for the series. --Paul Diamond", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The boys flee, fearing the gun man will get them, too. The authorities eventually identify the dead man as an Italian gangster. Christie, who was looking forward to a holiday in Venice with his wife, instead stays home to investigate. That Christie takes advantage of his wife's absence to pursue an attractive female coroner may not endear him to some readers. Others may find the revelation of those behind the gangster's killing and their motive too over-the-top. (Feb.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

He is one of few USAF pilots ever photographed in the cockpit of a MiG-21. He writes fiction from memories of surviving a colorful past. Mitchell loves God passionately. You'll find his books devoid of explicit language, sex and gore, but they are all the more fine tuned for that. The reader definitely knows such action is happening, while the author averts his gaze and pen. Your imagination is more fertile than anyone could describe. In his novels, Mitchell is all but inventing an unusual, narrative style. Characters introduce themselves at the beginnings of chapters and tell the tale powerfully in first person, sometimes from conflicting viewpoints. His sister, Delle Jacobs probably sells more historical romance books than anyone. Carol, his beloved wife is a fine author, and all of his children write beautifully. It must be in the genes. The whole family reviews and edits each others' books, assisted by other professionals. The Mitchells' son-in-law and daughter have graciously allowed them to use their names as the main protagonists.  They are Robert and Christie Mach, and the Mach Books series is named for them. Mitchell has enjoyed often-simultaneous careers as a mechanic, pilot, professor, artist and sculptor, musician and composer, computer scientist, consultant, real estate investor, inventor, author and business leader. He holds two degrees in mathematics and an MBA (summa cum laude.) He has founded numerous successful businesses and has been on the boards of others. One, named Good Samaritans, saves people from foreclosure. His 2012 motto is, \"If you're not improving the world, then lets.\" The Mitchells and the Machs live and enjoy life in San Diego, California.", "related": [], "rank": 4608941, "title": "Flash Points (Dare Books)", "author": "Will David Mitchell", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Clearly, she forgot to take her medication before writing this author bio, but she does have splendid taste in music, the ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound and no idea why she's talking about herself in the third person.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In his fifth appearance (after Off Minor ), the divorced, cat-loving, jazz-addicted inspector Charlie Resnick continues to trudge through the cold streets of an England adrift in celluloid-induced violence and American-style fast food (bastardized as only the cuisine-cursed British are capable of). A series of violent armed robberies are being committed in Nottingham by two groups. One team is clever; their counterparts are clearly a couple of teenaged yobs--one terrified and the other memorably vicious--who are rapidly becoming both more professional and more deadly. All this coincides with the early parole of another criminal anxious to settle a score with his informant wife and the cop she slept with. For his part, Charlie drifts back through the years, recalling the events leading up to his own marriage and its gradual dissolution in an unspoken, uneventful mist. By now Harvey's economy of prose is a given, as is his ability to pull together the many composite parts--the interlocking crimes, the boozing, infidelity and Resnick's very human bunch of underlings--that make a Charlie Resnick mystery such satisfying reading. No wasted time here.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Kennedy administrations.\"— Kenton Clymer,H-Diplo Roundtable Reviews(29 April 2013)\"The Universe Unravelingis a wonderful, spellbinding account, one of those rare books that you really do not want to put down. Although the heart of Jacobs's book is about cultural attitudes, one real strength is that he integrates them into a fairly traditional diplomatic history narrative that explains cogently the intricacies of Lao politics and American policy.\"—Diplomatic History\"In his fascinating, lively, and well-researched study of the failures of U.S. policy in Laos Seth Jacobs accepts that decision makers in the Kennedy administration viewed Laos as a poor setting in which to mount a vigorous response to the communist menace due to its difficult terrain, overwhelming logistical challenges, and easy accessibility for North Vietnam and China. But going beyond this orthodoxy, Jacobs also makes a sustained case that cultural factors—in particular an ingrained American belief that the Lao people were feckless, indolent, disorganized, cowardly, and inherently pacific—played an even more important role than strategic considerations in convincing American policymakers that the more resilient Vietnamese (as they were viewed through an inverted cultural lens) would offer sturdier resistance to communist insurgency.\"—American Historical Review\"The history of that period has been the subject of numerous studies. Jacobs, however, wants to get behind the narrative of American actions in Laos: the misspent aid, the attempts to build a Lao military force, the waging of covert war by the Central Intelligence Agency, the subversion of elections, the internecine rivalry of US agencies, the provision of arms which led at one point to the absurdity of Lao military factions fighting each other, each with American weapons. Jacobs handles all of that deftly and links it skillfully to the labyrinthine shifts in Lao politics.\"—Paul Cheeseright,Asian Affairs(July 2013)\"It is impossible to understand U.S. intervention in Vietnam in the 1960s without understanding what happened in Laos between 1954 and 1962. Seth Jacobs's cultural approach to U.S.-Lao relations offers a very exciting way to analyze events in that tortured nation. Jacobs has discovered enormously suggestive evidence that the policies the United States pursued toward Laos were shaped by how U.S. policymakers thought of the Laotian people.\"—Andrew J. Rotter, Charles A. Dana Professor of History, Colgate University, author ofComrades at Odds: The United States and India, 1947–1964\"Jacobs's meticulously researched study takes Laos from the periphery to the center of Cold War analysis. In his back and forth chronological approach with thematic consistency prevailing, Jacobs elucidates how a variety of Cold War policy makers saw proxy warriors as supremely inferior. . . . In this insightful though troubling analysis, Jacobs challenges colleagues to continue the analysis of Kennedy's having 'no intention of scaling back Washington's commitment to defend as much territory as it could from red aggression.' . . . Highly recommended.\"—Choice(1 December 2012)\"The Universe Unravelingis a fine answer to the paucity of scholarship dealing with the countries surrounding Vietnam and their relationship with the United States that for many years shaped their options in the Cold War, their internal (in)stability, and their destinies. The thread that runs through the text is the tragic combination of American ignorance and arrogance that characterized so much of what is called nation building during the Cold War. This book informs our understanding of America's broader—and counterproductive—role in impeding the global forces of nationalism during the Cold War.\"—Journal of American History", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Carroll was the youngest of seven children and was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1970 where he was kept in a dresser drawer with the clean socks. Luckily, he wasn’t kept with the dirty socks or else he might have grown up to become slightly warped. As a child, John spent most of his time wandering through the Mojave Desert in an attempt to avoid people. He would stare at the sky, imagining what it would be like to explore different worlds. One of his favorite memories is watching his dad build the fuselage of Evel Kneivel’s skycycle in their garage. One of his least favorite moments was watching that skycycle fall into the Snake River. (Not his dad’s fault and he has documentation to prove it, so nyah) As a teenager, John spent most of his time driving wherever he could in an attempt to avoid people. He would stare at the road, imagining what it would be like to explore different worlds. He was the captain of the chess team, lettered in golf and band while in high school, and wasn’t beaten up anywhere near as much as one might imagine. As an adult, John spends most of his time staring at a computer screen in an attempt to avoid people. He stares at the monitor for hours, imagining what it would be like to explore different worlds. He has been married to his wonderful wife for fifteen years and they have three obnoxio . . . wonderful children who always behave . . . when they’re asleep. Emo bunny minions surround John at most times. He is their imaginary friend and they look to him for guidance. At one point, they took over the world. No one noticed because they left everything exactly as it was. They gave the world back after a week because it was depressing. The Willden Trilogy is his first endeavor into the field of writing. Other series and standalone works will be forthcoming. In addition, John has written a number of short stories he publishes for free because he likes you so much. (And it’s good marketing. Shh) He writes in the evenings and weekends whenever possible. Regrettably, the family mentioned in the previous paragraph desires food and shelter, requiring the author to possess a full time job until his writing makes him rich.", "related": ["B00LEVJ79Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Keane, one of Ireland's most prolific and respected literary figures, died on 30 May 2002 at the age of 73, after a long and difficult battle with cancer. John B. was born in 1928 in Listowel, County Kerry and it was here that he spent his literary career, running a pub which provided him with inspiration for his characters and ideas.His first play, Sive, was presented by the Listowel Drama Group and won the All-Ireland Drama Festival in 1959. It was followed by another success, Sharon's Grave, in 1960. The Field (1965) and Big Maggie (1969), are widely regarded as classics of the modern Irish stage and jewels in a crown which includes such popular hits as Many Young Men of Twenty, The Man from Clare, Moll, The Chastitute and The Year of the Hiker. His large canon of plays have been seen abroad in cities as far afield as Moscow and Los Angeles. Big Maggie ran on Broadway for over two months in 1982 and The Field was adapted into an Oscar-winning Hollywood film, starring Brenda Fricker and Richard Harris, in 1991.But it was not just in his plays that John B. Keane managed to portray all aspects of humanity with both wit and truth. He also wrote many fine novels, including The Contractors, A High Meadow and Durango. Durango was adapted for the big screen, starring Brenda Fricker and Patrick Bergin. A writer of essays, short stories and letters, his humorous words live on in Celebrated Letters of John B. Keane, More Celebrated Letters, The Best of John B. Keane and The Short Stories of John B. Keane. In 1987 John B. Keane received a special award for his enduring place in Irish life and letters from the Sunday Independent/Irish Life. In that year he also won a Sunday Tribune Arts Award and in 1988 he was chosen as the recipient of the Irish-American Fund Award for Literature. In 1999 he was presented with a Gradam medal, the Abbey Theatre's highest award. He was a member of Aosdana and the recipient of honorary doctorates from Trinity College, Dublin, Limerick University and Marymount College, New York.John B. Keane remains one of Mercier's best-loved and best-selling authors.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Jacobs' single work, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, published in 1861 under the pseudonym \"Linda Brent\", was one of the first autobiographical narratives about the struggle for freedom by female slaves and an account of the sexual harassment and abuse they endured. The narrative was designed to appeal to middle class white Christian women in the North, focusing on the impact of slavery on women's chastity and sexual virtues. Christian women could perceive how slavery was a temptation to masculine lusts and vice as well as to womanly virtues. Jacobs criticized the religion of the Southern United States as being un-Christian and as emphasizing the value of money (\"If I am going to hell, bury my money with me,\" says a particularly brutal and uneducated slaveholder). She described another slaveholder with, \"He boasted the name and standing of a Christian, though Satan never had a truer follower.\" Jacobs argued that these men were not exceptions to the general rule. Much of Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl was devoted to the Jacobs's struggle to free her two children after she escaped. Before that, Harriet spent seven years hiding in a tiny space built into her grandmother's barn to see and hear the voices of her children. Jacobs changed the names of all characters in the novel, including her own, to conceal their true identities. The villainous slave owner \"Dr. Flint\" was based on Jacobs's former master, Dr. James Norcom. Despite the publisher's documents of authenticity, some critics attacked the narrative as based on false accounts. There was a reaction against the more horrific details of slave narratives, and some readers believed they could not be true.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 112, "rating_average": 4.4107, "rating_total": 494.0}

Harriet Beecher Stowe was appalled by slavery, and she took one of the few options open to nineteenth century women who wanted to affect public opinion: she wrote a novel, a huge, enthralling narrative that claimed the heart, soul, and politics of pre-Civil War Americans. It is unabashed propaganda and overtly moralistic, an attempt to make whites - North and South - see slaves as mothers, fathers, and people with (Christian) souls. In a time when women might see the majority of their children die, Harriet Beecher Stowe portrays beautiful Eliza fleeing slavery to protect her son. In a time when many whites claimed slavery had \"good effects\" on blacks,Uncle Tom's Cabinpaints pictures of three plantations, each worse than the other, where even the best plantation leaves a slave at the mercy of fate or debt. By twentieth-century standards, her propaganda verges on melodrama, and it is clear that even while arguing for the abolition of slavery she did not rise above her own racism. Yet her questions remain penetrating even today: \"Is man ever a creature to be trusted with wholly irresponsible power? --review by Erica Bauermeister", "related": ["B00EN6LJ2U"], "rank": 1630, "title": "Uncle Tom's Cabin", "author": "Harriet Beecher Stowe", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 60, "rating_average": 4.45, "rating_total": 267.0}

Here local newspaper oddities, diaries, letters and accounts of unsolved mysteries from the historical records of Vermont precede many of the chapters, adding to the authenticity of the chills as a Vermont family struggles in the grip of powers it can barely admit exist.

Seeking comfort from the cousin to whom he was close in childhood, he finds refuge from his grief in their loving home. But soon after his arrival, strange events occur that seem to have their roots in an ancient evil. Detached in its characterization, this strong novel handles the Whitcome family dynamics with dexterity.

Durango’s implanted artificial intelligence remains a highlight, and her razor-sharp wit is conveyed in both natural language and computer code. Fellow mercenary and love interest Vienne returns for a side adventure with a Russian biker gang en route to rejoining Durango.

A small treasure, from the author of the wonderful romantic comedyAddition(2009).’Kirkus Reviews'Jordan renders this extended family's interwoven story in gorgeous layers of warmth, understanding and casual cruelties, interspersed throughout with good humor and perfectly rendered dialogue… In spare but rich prose, Jordan shows all the love, fear, tenderness, disappointment, joy and sadness any life could hold.'Shelf Awareness‘Jordan elegantly captures the hopes and despairs of three generations of a troubled family, offering a diverting read that will appeal to fans of sophisticated historical fiction and book club members.’Library Journal US‘Simply a joy to read.’Courier-Mail‘Toni Jordan has written a beautiful novel which captures the loves and fears of an ordinary Australian family through hard times and better times. It reminded me of Elizabeth Stead’s books.’Australian Bookseller & Publisher‘Jordan is clear that what binds us to one another and to a meaningful life is simply valuing the life you have been given and the family that is yours and yours alone. Reading Nine Days, you will laugh, even cry, but you will be in no doubt that Toni Jordan uses the modern novel to reflect those tensions that exist for many of us between duty and desire.’Australian Book Review‘A brilliant piece of writing…compelling, engaging and will bring tears to the eyes…’Sunday Star Times‘Toni Jordan’s characters beautifully frame a story of compassion, fun and poignancy.’Launceston Examiner‘Every now and then a book comes along that’s brilliantly conceived and tightly written, yet there’s nothing flashy about it. I think Australian writer Toni Jordan’s third novel, Nine Days, falls into the rare and wonderful category…Each of the nine voices is distinct and brimming with personality and by the finish every part of the jigsaw fits perfectly and you see the whole sweep of this romantic, thoughtful, heartbreaking story…Jordan’s previous novels, Addition and Fall Girl, were smart sassy and humorous. Nine Days has taken her to another level. More serious than her previous work but with the same astute observations, brightness and wit, its a sensitive and beautiful novel, a slice of Australia’s working-class history, that is a joy to read.’NZ Herald on Sunday‘This novel is a triumph. Another signal career in Australian fiction is well under way.’The Australian‘Jordan’s triumph is in the structure and scope of this novel set in working-class Richmond, starting and ending indeed in 1939 but spreading out an ensuing 70 years to solve a mystery and build a love story.’Adelaide Advertiser‘The suspense is frequently nail-biting, and there’s a strong undertow of unspecified doom, but the book is far from gloomy because Jordan has a fine line in wit too, not to mention the natural storyteller’s ability to keep us guessing about where it’s all going…beautifully constructed…’Daily Mail UK'Jordan is the master of keeping a lot of characters in play.'Book Riot'Told in nine different voices, this is an unforgettable story of love and family.'The Chuckanut Reader'Read and enjoy this novel not just for its perfect historical snapshots, but for its engaging tale of family and how love binds us all together.

Readers witness him navigating the changes that came through the loss of a loved one and a family member moving away. Creating a strong sense of place and time with evocative language, he immerses readers in the midst of a torrential thunderstorm. \"I could hear the thunder. Muffled, thuddy thunder. And I could hear my quickened heartbeat. This was not good at all, this basementless tornado-bait farmhouse.\" Jackson writes about each season, whether the family is harvesting and preserving produce or homebound due to a blizzard, with equal descriptiveness. Sadly, the environment is more engaging than the people. One feels detached while reading about Jeremy and his family coping with a terminal illness, and the inability to connect with anyone makes the book tedious at times. The child's nervousness when purchasing earrings for his crush and the subsequent trepidation about giving them to her are believable, just not captivating. Older teens are perhaps the intended audience, given the small font and the reflective nature of the narrative, yet the plodding events, lack of engagement, and Jeremy's age may dissuade them from staying with it.-Hilary Writt, Sullivan University, Lexington, KYα(c) Copyright 2011.

S. Air Force aircraft crew chief that wrote science fiction and fantasy stories as a hobby. He was born in Ohio and grew up in Florida in a career military household. After enlisting in the military he was sent to Southern California, where he still lives after his Honor Discharge. Grant worked as an aircraft mechanic at the then McDonald Douglas Aircraft company which is where he met Mary Alley, a fellow aircraft mechanic. Mary (Alley) Workman was born in Northern California, living in several states and a foreign country while also growing up in a career military household. After working as an Administrative Assistant in Colorado for several years, she moved to Southern California, became a mechanic, and eventually becoming an aircraft mechanic. Together they crafted machines that fly as well as stories that send the reader soaring. While working together at MDC, they began to collaborate on Grant's fiction stories. In 1993, they married and in 1996 self-published the DNA based vampire tale, The Guide, with AuthorHouse. Grant begins the writing process and originates the ideas which come from his love of science fiction and fantasy realms. Mary performs the first edits on the stories rough drafts, as well as being a storyline consultant. They have since created over a dozen completed stories of fiction: horror-vampire and werewolf tales; space travel adventures; alternate dimensions; time traveling sword fighters; futuristic off-world military; and murder mysteries. Their study of Sil Lum Kung Fu and other martial arts are used in the many action fight scenes of their storylines. There is always another story to tell, another character to create and one more person to inform about the truth that only women can be werewolves; care to know why, just ask them. Currently, they have novelized a fantastic screenplay by Neil Johnson, Descent into the Maelstrom, into a riveting book that is soon to be a major motion picture.", "related": ["B008UEHJ9I"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Siegel MD of UCLA: The mind is a process that regulates the flow of\nenergy and information. In this book, we first explore how information gathered by\nthe senses is processed by the mind. I explain the differences between the\nconscious and subconscious minds. This will help you understand why one single\nset of instructions can be understood differently by various people. Throughout\nthe book we focus on a client's emotional and psychological states. Your awareness of your thoughts and experiences is your\nconscious mind, also called the \"thinking mind.\" That just means you are\nattentive to what is going on in and around you. Although some of this activity\ninvolves you directly, some of it is just what you are observing in real time.\nIt also includes what you are remembering, imagining, and visualizing. You probably believe that as you see, hear, touch, smell,\nand taste something, you become aware of it immediately. In fact, that's not\nso. When your senses take in new information, it is analyzed and evaluated\nthrough an array of complex emotional, perceptual, prejudicial, and defensive\nfilters. Then, and only then, will some of that information become available to\nyour conscious awareness for deliberate processing. This happens in a split\nsecond, but it does happen. In the first chapter, I lay the foundation for\neverything that you'll learn in this book. Brian Walsh", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

InThe Travelers: Present in the Past, the first in a planned series of young adult novlels, Elaine Schmidt has done an excellent job of creating believable characters who travel to times and places that are both fascinating and historically accurate. When Nona McDonald accidentally touches an antique quilt at her grandmother's house, she is suddenly transported momentarily to another time and place. The incident means that her family must let her in on the family secret: They are all time travelers, rare individuals who are born with the ability to do so. Before Nona really has time to get over the shock and begin to learn the rules of time travel and how to control her travels, trouble strikes. Things are disappearing from the secret time travel society and it seems that Nona's family is being framed for the crimes. To keep her safe, they send her to stay with ancestors on a farm in 1898. There she meets the maker of the quilt, Winnie Longanecker, who is just Nona's age at that time. Nona is just beginning to adjust to life on the farm in this strange time period when another complication arises. A young boy, Henry Sanchez, literally drops into the barn, terrified and utterly unable to control his own time traveling. Unlike Nona, who has had at least minimal training, or Winnie, who has had no training but did know she was destined to be a Traveler, Henry had no forewarning and no idea of how to stop his fall through time or how to get back home. Nona and Winnie have just begun to help him learn some control when trouble comes from Nona's time and forces the children to learn some quick lessons about time travel, friendship, and team work as they attempt to protect Nona's and Winnie's families and get Henry back to his own time. The story is exciting, rich with historical detail, and the children act like real children. Young adults and adults alike will find the story engrossing.The Travelerswill leave readers anxious for the next installment inThe Travelers' adventures. This is an excellent, well-written addition to young adult time travel fiction. --B.C. blogcritics", "related": ["B0093BBJUW"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

What inspired you to start writing about natural methods of stress relief?Women everywhere are experiencing severe amounts of stress in all aspects of their lives, on the job and at home. I see it all around me every day, and I know from personal experience that coping with stress is a difficult prospect. Unfortunately many turn to \"solutions\" that often do little to improve things and may even make their situation worse--drinking too much, using narcotics, or giving in to fits of anger; these things only hurt you and those around you and rarely do anything to actually address the situation that is causing stress.I discovered from my own personal experience that there are many positive and beneficial things that can be done to address stressful situations naturally. First of all, facing the situation and doing what you can to change it is vitally important, even if it means making long-term plans, long-term goals, and long-term lifestyle changes. That's why I decided to write about natural methods of stress relief, identify and expose the core causes and detrimental effects of stress for women, and share the high-performance strategies and techniques that women can use immediately to improve their lives. Natural methods work to relieve stress effectively and naturally.2. What are your best sources for coming up with tips to share with your readers (your own experience, research, suggestions from other people...)?My best resource is by far my own personal experience, as well as the experiences of the many women whom I have worked with in my professional life during the last 20 years. Women coping with divorce, family conflict, parenting challenges, financial tragedy, job burn-out and frustration; women who are overwhelmed by the pressures and anxieties of modern-day living. Really, who isn't stressed these days?But in addition to my own experiences, I also do a lot of research and reading on healthy living and wellness, not only focusing on physical wellness, but also on emotional and spiritual wellness. For women, emotional and spiritual wellness is supremely important for inner-peace, joy, and happiness.But more than just reading about healthy living, emotional wellness, and spiritual wellness, I work hard to apply what I learn.I used to be a stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed woman, but I learned how to slow down, re-organize my focus and priorities, and bring balance into my life. I discovered that there is a lot I can do to manage my stress levels and keep them within acceptable standards. When I see how natural stress relief methods work in my life, such as gardening, walking, juicing, proper time management and money management, camping, nutrition, aromatherapy, etc, I write about it so that other women can learn to implement these natural stress relief methods too. They really do work!3. In addition to your books, articles, and stress management for women ezine, what services do you offer in terms of personal support?I offer one-on-one support via email. I always answer emails personally.Most of the time when we are stressed, having someone to talk to goes a long way in helping to soothe frazzled nerves or just to help regain perspective and direction. Some women may not always feel comfortable opening up to family members, and others may live far away and isolated from family and friends, like I was for many years. Yet, via cyberspace, with the click of a button, you can connect with someone in a meaningful way that brings some perspective and peace to your life.Developing a meaningful support network is by far the single most important natural stress management strategy for women. The support network does not have to be big and extensive. It can be as strong as one person you can confide in, one pair of shoulders to cry on, and one pair of trustworthy listening ears.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Each page leaves you wondering what extraordinary creature or behavior would appear next or how even those that seem the most ordinary have mysteries beyond our imagination. Beyond inspiring wonder, Prager tells why it all matters, from the tiniest to the largest creature, our health, our lives, the economy and our future are interconnected in astonishing ways.”--US Congressman Brian Baird, former chairman of the Energy and Environment subcommittee(US Congressman Brian Baird, chairman of the Energy and Environment subcommittee)“In my years of diving and reporting below the surface of the sea, Ellen Prager has been the most effective and humorous storyteller about life in the ocean. Here she brings us the strangely well-endowed conch, slime-touting hagfish, transgender parrotfish, and an abundance of slime and sex within the seas. By combining science with humor, she allows more people to learn about the ocean and understand that the lives of animals are not only crucial for our food and fun, but also for our economy and health. You really should read this book, which not only teaches us about the ocean, but also makes it entertaining and gives us ideas about how to save the sea and the wonderful life in it.\"--Bob Woodruff, ABC News correspondent(Bob Woodruff, ABC News correspondent)“Ellen Prager has produced a fascinating and delightful read about the amazing diversity of life under the sea. She describes a panoply of strange and wondrous creatures in an accessible and non-technical fashion that leaves you shaking your head in wonder. Prager’s book will make you want to head to the nearest shore and jump right in!”(Lisa Speer, Director of International Oceans Program, Natural Resources Defense)\"Packed with excellent conversation fodder for your next date, this book details the strange lives and mating rituals of sea creatures.

I wrote it as a novella the year after my first novel was released by Harlequin, in 1985.  I rewrote the story, originally more than 12,000 words long, in 1991, and again in 1993, shortening it to 6,500 words.In February 1994 it was published in a little-known romance anthology calledNaked Came the Ladies, whose cover featured a giant, handsome, shirtless hero being tethered to the ground by lots of tiny naked women.  Inspired by Jonathan Swift's Gulliver and the Liliputians, this was a perfect cover design because it suggested the ironic, tongue-in-cheek, and sometimes outright hilarious tones in the works.  My story, given a rather mundane new title, \"Why Don't People Make Love Anymore,\" appeared along with stories by friends Maralys Wills, Suzanne Forester, Chelley Kitzmiller, Lori Herter, Linda Prine, and others. The publication date was about a year after my fifth novel,Days of Fire, came on the market.I changed the central character's name based on advice from a critique group I lead on Monday nights.  I also expanded the love scene and made many small changes to improve the manuscript.  The suppression, individualism, and self-actualization themes in this tongue-in-cheek short story make it one of my favorite fictions.I would enjoy hearing whether you feel the piece interests and entertains you as much as it did me to edit and release it.

In his reflectively raw debut novel, he channels this haunting struggle of his own life into Orville James McFadden, a boy with a fantastical mind and a fear of the world. McDonald’s brilliant mix of plot driven narrative and dialogue are bound to make one reflect on their own struggles with fear, compelling one to turn the page, to find out what becomes of Orville James McFadden. McDonald writes witty dialogue and raw scenes that are meant to make one laugh-out-loud at one moment and cry out with wonderment at the next. He writes reflectively about the world, and his characters are gray with complex internal struggles. McDonald is one to explore the darker areas of life, and he writes terse prose mixed with larger philosophical trains of thought. In addition to fiction writing, Timothy McDonald teaches English as a second language, manages a wine bar, travels the world, and studies languages. Read about his own philosophical reflections, travels, and his up-and-coming second novel, God City, in his witty and hilariously creative blog, http://www.failuremcfadden.com.

Providing personal accounts of women who worked on highways, as war correspondents, and as entertainers and political activists, five chapters, illustrated with black-and-white photographs and reproductions, look at advances in each of these areas. Though the personal stories help, the text is dense and detailed. Thus, it is a bit dry, making it most useful for research or as a report resource. That aside, this is an excellent title for expanding students' view of the Civil Rights Movement, showing just how many people it took to achieve even the legislative ends realized under President Lyndon Johnson. Additionally, by focusing on women, it gives background on an aspect of the Women's Movement that is often overlooked and on the course of the broader Civil Rights Movement.-Ann Welton, Grant Elementary School, Tacoma, WAα(c) Copyright 2011.

She's eternally grateful to her older brother for providing so many opportunities to tell stories to their parents about her innocence. A love of reading was instilled early by her parents and when she ran out of reading material in her childhood home, she started writing her own stories. As an elementary school student, she even wrote a short story on the back of a tissue box while trapped in the car on a family road trip. She can’t remember the entire story, but it involved her pet frog, Garfunkel, who had escaped his tank, stealing a car to go for a drive because he was upset with his roommate, Garfield. She really should apologize to her high school English teachers. They’d give a serious writing assignment, like a childhood memory, and she’d use it as an opportunity to make up stories about her family. She was often referred to as creative by those teachers who didn’t want to come right out and call her a liar. But there were a few who were willing to bluntly call her a liar, as well. Lana writes from her home office, overlooking a lake in Northern Wisconsin, when she's not busy wrangling children, prying cats off the curtain rods, or playing the Revolving Door Game with her two large, slobbery dogs. (They think it’s a game, she thinks they’re trying to drive her insane.)", "related": ["B00ICZM94K"], "rank": 1536573, "title": "Faceoff of the Heart", "author": "Lana Voynich", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The book provides new answers to a number of difficult questions beginning with a discussion of why Canadian troops were sent to Hong Kong at the request of the British War Office. Were the British duplicitous in making this request? Was Canadian Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant-General Harry Crerar, guilty of putting his own interests above those of his men in telling the minister of National Defence that there was \"no military risk\" in sending the \"C\" Force?The book recounts the formation of the \"C\" Force and its departure to Hong Kong where it arrived just three weeks before the Japanese attack. It outlines the course of the battle from December 8, 1941, until the inevitable surrender of the garrison on Christmas Day. It places appropriate emphasis on the Canadian contribution, refuting 1947 allegations by the British General-Officer-Commanding - allegations which were only made public in 1993 - that the Canadians did not fight well. Greenhous attacks these charges with solid evidence from participants and eye-witnesses.Finally, the book tells the story of life and death in the prison camps of Hong Kong and Japan.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Re-launched in 2013, the redesigned Aperture updates its sixty-two-year-old mission as the world’s most vital photography magazine in print.Presenting fresh perspectives accessible to the photo practitioner and the culturally curious alike, each issue examines one theme at the heart of contemporary photography, explored in two distinct sections: “Words,” focused on ideas, interviews, and debate, and “Pictures,” offering an immersive photographic experience of artists’ projects and series. A host of new columns including Studio Visit, The Collectors, Dispatches, Object Lessons, and What Matters Now, sample other realms of photography, from collecting to books and from objects that shaped the medium’s history to thoughts on the latest technologies. Aperture will continue to publish the work of many iconic and emerging artists, from Diane Arbus, William Eggleston, Nan Goldin, and Jeff Wall to Michele Abeles, Walead Beshty, JH Engström, and Anouk Kruithof. The magazine has also showcased the thoughts of leading writers and curators in the field, including Vince Aletti, Geoffrey Batchen, Charlotte Cotton, David Levi Strauss, and Luc Sante, among many others.Aperture magazine is the flagship publication of the not-for-profit Aperture Foundation, which was founded in 1952 by the photographers Ansel Adams, Minor White, Barbara Morgan, and Dorothea Lange and the photography historians Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, among others. Aperture Foundation connects the photo community and its audiences with the most inspiring work, the sharpest ideas, and with each other—in print, in person, and online. From its base in New York, Aperture Foundation produces, publishes, and presents a program of photography projects and programs—locally, across the United States, and around the world.Aperture: Speaking the Language of PhotographyKindle Magazines are fully downloaded onto your Kindle so you can read them even when you're not wirelessly connected.", "related": ["B00KH9EN3Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Today's tour is\nespecially poignant because the owners of the manor have sold the place.\nGathering her last group around her, Laurel tells them about the many\nMastersons who have shared the bed: the medieval knight who returned home from\nthe Crusades to find that his wife by proxy was not at all happy to see him,\nthe Elizabethan mercenary who kidnapped the wrong woman only to realize he did\nnot want to give her up, and the Regency miss who chains her former lover to\nthe bed to keep her smuggler brother safe. Unbeknownst to Laurel, one more\nromance will be played out upon that famous bed--this one involving Laurel\nherself and annoyingly attractive handyman Ned Masterson. Dodd and Brockway's\ncreative collaboration yields four delightfully humorous and delectably sexy\nromances that exemplify their witty writing and talent for creating compelling\ncharacters. John Charles Copyright © American Library\nAssociation.

So I promptly signed up to become... an accountant. Then a radio and TV presenter, now a QVC shopping channel presenter. But at least I get to do a weekly blog - (12,000-17,000 views per week as at March 2013) - always longer than they should be, 'cos - of course - I'm supposed to be writing! 'Serial writing course attender', RNA New Writers' Scheme, and script-writer wannabe, I am loving having finally finished my first romantic novel ('Hawaiian Affair'). There's another book called 'Till the Fat Lady Slims' which pops up from time to time from second hand sellers - creating the soft copy and uploading it to Amazon is on the list! It's a self-help book based on 'freedom eating' - body-signals and freedom of choice. Plus there's a always my only paid commission (so far) - good old 'Clive the Camel' - a very short kids' story, broadcast by Buena Vista (Disney) 'Rise and Shine' breakfast show from the early 90's. Considering the file was written about eight computers ago, it's a tall order! My second novel will be based on 'how to find a husband' and it's going to be a script first - with a time-slip plot, partly current day, party 1930's. Valentine's Surprise, my first upload here, is based on an original short story written for QVC UK viewers and blog readers around Feb 14th 2010. Enjoy it! It's my little practise for when I get to upload the full-length novels!\" Follow Debbie on Twitter - @debbieflint and on facebook (debbieFlintQVC) Plus, sign up for regular newsletters via her own website, www.debbieflint.com. Here you will also find hints and tips about how to write your own self-published novels, and new novel recommendations on her page 'Read It, Write It, Sell It!'

As a child she missed the connections of other family members, longtime friends and the stability and history of being raised in the same community.  From childhood she learned to shed the old and embrace the new, but has spent the last several years building a community of family and friends.  The combination has created a woman who doesn’t know a stranger. She learned the voices and songs being transmitted to her sub-conscious were not fanciful imagination, but rather a higher connection, allowing her to share the love and wisdom which filled her body and spirit. Following the guidance of the angels, she sent letters to her friends. The network of followers grew in leaps and bounds leading to numerous speaking engagements where she shared ways others could hear the angels and their messages of love, joy and understanding. The word spread to nursing homes, hospitals, and churches, easing troubled souls of the transitions and fears associated with day to day living and learning. The following is the result of the journey to enlightenment. Kathryn lives in Texas, and spends her time with her daughters and the newest “angel baby”, her 2 year old granddaughter. She enjoys live music, outdoor festivals, and is an avid fan of the Dallas Mavericks.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story begins in the heat of the moment, not with Julie but with a woman who is beaten and with her son who witnesses the attack. Julie is called to the crime scene as head of the Victim's Advocate Department. She calms and supports victims of brutal domestic violence, traumatic car accidents, fiery devastation, and overwhelming natural disasters. But she is haunted by a shadow from her past. The shadow waits nearby, breaks into her home, and kills her beloved cat. The shadow also places a snake in her car, causing her to crash into a telephone pole. Eventually the shadow's identity is revealed. But for most of the story, the man in Julie's life is a flirty, well-muscled firefighter named Rusty. Julie and Rusty slowly form a psychological and romantic bond by their work and by their mutual attraction and need.The character of Julie is well-developed and complex as she begins to face her past. She confronts her fear and slowly learns to trust again for a hopeful future. The descriptions of emergencies and human behavior are realistic and thoughtful. Anxious moments of suspense and swift actions are balanced by tender and erotic moments. Cries In The Night by Kathy Clark shows a snowy, Christmastime in Denver with more than a few brave souls. Many of the cries in the night are heard by people who care.", "related": ["B00K0SC9QU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 18, "rating_average": 4.8333, "rating_total": 87.0}

And the characterizations are simply superb...Shaara has managed to capture the essence of war, the divided friendships, the madness, and the heroism of fratricidal conflict.”—Stephen B. Oates, author ofWith Malice Toward None“My favorite historical novel...a superb re-creation of the Battle of Gettysburg, but its real importance is its insight into what the war was about, and what it meant.”—James M. McPherson, author ofBattle Cry of Freedom“Remarkable, a book that changed my life...I had never visited Gettysburg, knew almost nothing about that battle before I read the book, but here it all came alive.”—Ken Burns, filmmaker,The Civil WarThe Broken Place“...Shaara’s impressive creative talent manifests itself inThe Broken Place, a novel that is at once tough and tender, that moves rapidly and still remains reflective, that is sexually realistic without being pornographic, that is funny in spots, yet serious about the human condition...Through all of this punishment McClain is searching for peace and belief in God. In taking him on this search, Shaara provides us with parallels with Hemingway, who furnishes the title for the novel in a passage fromA Farewell to Arms. There is the Hemingway world of violence...There’s the Hemingway concreteness and feeling for nature...And one drunken party has the wild frenzy of those inThe Sun Also Rises...Yet one feels more compassion for McClain than one feels for most of Hemingway’s heroes...in the best sense of the word, this is an intellectual novel, one that comments seriously upon man’s life: Shaara has a cure forThe Broken Places that mar man’s soul...I think Florida has a new novelist of great promise.”—Tampa Tribune, Florida Accent Magazine“The author spars like Hemingway through much of this first novel about a soldier-prizefighter who kills a man in the ring. It’s probably inevitable. Writers are mostly violent people who act gentle. When a writer is a gentle person who acts violent, as Michael Shaara seems to be, Hemingway is one of the few guides available... When Mr. Shaara writes at ringside he writes as well as anyone around... McClain’s is a rare sickness, and more rarely still does someone write it truly. Mr. Shaara generates fits of murderous rage at least as well as Hubert Selby Jr., and somewhat better than Truman Capote...The Broken Placedoesn’t pull its final punches. Michael Shaara, one novel in, comes on at least as a middleweight.”—Richard Rhodes,The New York Times Book Review“Author Shaara has the sensitivity to present the interior voyage of a man becoming. Often McClain’s world fractures, but at those moments beauty and freshness enter like sunlight. McClain, the reader feels, will make it around the bend. This is a novel at once soft and strong, tender and tough, like the journey of a man, in search of his soul.”—Miami HeraldThe Herald“...a frighteningly credible version of nuclear apocalypse. Shaara’s forte is the subtle buildup of tension, a series of apparently ordinary evens leading to an unknown but dreadful finale. He has an unerring eye for those fascinating details that flesh out a finely paced thriller.”—St. Louis Post-Dispatch“This is borderline fantasy, but Shaara (The Killer Angels) brings it to a poetic reality.”—Publisher’s Weekly“Michael Shaara has broken new ground with his latest novel...After finishingThe Heraldreaders will be glad that Shaara, who lives in Melbourne, continues to write what he wants. Considering the current popularity of doomsday tales, the publisher should also be satisfied...It’s a brilliant story told in a gripping style. Shaara uses short staccato sentences to show the urgency in the minds of people groping to deal with the power they are facing.”—Sentinel Star", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His only concern was to serve others no matter the personal sacrifice it meant. He did so for his Guru Shrii Shrii Anandamurtii, Founder of Ananda Marga. Dada spent many years as a missionary both in the Philippines and then in America. Once here, his heart began to open to serving others as a married householder. He saw the problems that America was having in coping with material life and attempting to find peace and joy while raising a family, earning a living and still seeking inner peace within. Dada felt he could best understand this challenge and show how a human being could accomplish living among the regular world, serve ones community, raise a family and still find balance within.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As an adult, I learned that the familiar stories, like those about Aladdin and Sindbad, represent a mere fraction of theArabian Nights Entertainments. Few translators have attempted to present the entire collection in English. Sir Richard Francis Burton was one of these, and his ten volumes comprise the best-known complete translation. Burton published his translation for private subscribers since he included the adult stories that other, and tamer, translations omitted. Many of the stories in this collection are based on theArabian Nights Entertainments. Its stories can be brief, consisting of a page or less. They can also be quite lengthy. I've tried to vary the length of my stories as well. I've also attempted to make them different from the originals, changing plots, character motivations, and other factors as needed. My goal was to retain the flavor of the original stories without emulating thirteenth century literary style and taste. I hope you enjoy them.", "related": ["B00K31USUS"], "rank": 2711854, "title": "1,001 Lightyears Entertainments eBook", "author": "David Loeff", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.0909, "rating_total": 45.0}

Most of the time, when you read, About The Author, you discover that said author has three dogs, two cats, a turtle named Harley, and enjoys hiking with her husband of five years, and generally, the piece is written in the third person. I have no quarrel with such an expose, it’s just not for me. If you are reading this assume you really do want to know About Me, and I want to give you that, from me, so here you go. I write about the Dominant/submissive dynamic, because I am a submissive, and having experienced the thrills and spills that D/s romance offers, I don’t just feel qualified to do so, but I am truly, deeply and wholly passionate about the lifestyle. Every second of every day it’s on my mind and in my heart, which, by the way, has been shattered into a thousand tiny pieces, and made shining and whole and filled with joy. Such are the highs and lows Dominance and submission can bring. Having tried and failed with vanilla relationships, during which I was constantly frustrated and unfulfilled, I came to an understanding and acceptance that vanilla simply doesn’t work for me. If you read my blog you can learn more about the addiction to this lifestyle, and while every interaction is unique, each share one truism. The submissive wants and needs the romantic domination of her man, and the Dominant wants and needs the gift of submission his girl offers.

It will suck you in as you go places with Kathryn into her past that is filled with a lot of intense moments. There are tons and tons of supernatural occurrences which really added to this story, leaving you feeling breathless at moments. There are some steamy parts with Kathryn and Jared that will make your jaw drop just a bit. I kept saying to my sister, \"Wow risky!\" But it is still a clean romance, which I'm thankful about! If you want a unique romance this is it! The dialogue in this book is really, really amazing. Some flat out hilarious parts that actually made me laugh right out loud. I love the banter between the two main characters. The author really does well to make you love her characters! I really think this new author will go far if she keeps up this type of work!
