Like buried treasure for cult movie enthusiasts, this memoir from British film producer Deeley is rich with the star-studded backstories and day-to-day drudge work of making major, if unconventional, Hollywood product. Frequently the glue that holds a project together, Deeley's job is, largely, to keep the peace among anxious investors, prima donna talent, and overworked, underpaid crews; in his own words, \"a producer doesn't really make films, he causes them to be made.\" Deeley's account of making 1969's The Italian Job (\"the ultimate cinematic indulgence for car junkies across the globe\") is as riveting and suspenseful as the film; with the enthusiastic approval of Turin, Italy's own Mafia, a traffic jam scene was filmed in the middle of the city using unwitting citizens, essentially held hostage by blocked-off highway exits. Deeley isn't shy about discussing big-name associates, including Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman and Harrison Ford as actors new to the game. Though this older, wiser Deeley puts his world in wry perspective (\"all of us who work on pictures expect the last month to be frantic\"), the grizzled movie vet also gives fanboys exactly the kinds of stories they're looking for: \"As Ridley Scott famously said, every movie is like going into battle. But Blade Runner was World War I and II combined.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The weekly was produced in a small frame building on 21st Street.The paper was then bought and sold a couple of times and was reborn in 1907 as the Daily Phoenix. It was published three times a week until 1909 when it became a daily and was renamed the Saskatoon Capital in 1910.In 1912 the paper was sold again to W. F. Herman and Talmage Lawson and its name was changed from the Capital to the Saskatoon Daily Star.During the 1920's a series of sales and purchases between newspaper owners in Saskatoon and Regina left Saskatoon with two daily papers, Saskatoon Daily Star and The Daily Phoenix. Then, on January 1st, 1928, the Sifton family, publishers of the Winnipeg Free Press bought and amalgamated the papers to form the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix.The Siftons owned the paper until it was purchased by Hollinger Newspapers in 1996. Hollinger was purchased by CanWest Global Communications Corp. in 2000.The Kindle Edition of The StarPhoenix contains articles found in the print edition, but will not include some images and tables.

Inspired contributions include Teresa Edgerton's \"Captured in Silver,\" a nice ghostly locked-room murder tale, and Lillian Stewart Carl's \"The Necromancer's Apprentice,\" which presents an interesting solution to the actual mystery surrounding the death of Amy Robsart, wife of Elizabeth I's favorite lord, balancing wizardry with astute deductions about the political motives of those who stood to benefit. The standout, James D. Macdonald's \"A Tremble in the Air,\" introduces a psychic detective, Orville Nesbit, who's clearly heir to the tradition of such sleuths as Algernon Blackwood's John Silence and who deserves to live on in further tales. Unfortunately, most of the other stories rely on catchy gimmicks (e.g., a husband-and-wife sorcerer team based on Nick and Nora Charles in Sharon Lee and Steve Miller's \"A Night at the Opera\") rather than well-crafted puzzles. The jacket art—showing a white-bearded wizard gazing at a body outline on the flagstones of a foggy, gas-lit street—amusingly evokes the fantasy-crime blend.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Chaoul's work on chöd from the Bön's perspective could not be more timely. His thorough analysis of this syncretic and fascinating religious practice and the use of the metaphor of cutting as a way to go beyond assumed boundaries provides a broader picture of chöd and sheds light on the interrelation of Buddhism and Bön.\"—Giacomella Orofino, Professor of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, University of Naples\"Chaoul's book offers a comprehensive intellectual understanding of chöd and its origins within both the Bön and Buddhist traditions, and as such will have great benefit for scholars as well as for those who wish to engage in chöd as a daily ritual or meditation practice. . . . Through this ancient and profound practice, anyone who is able to recognize their own fear—whether its source is external or internal—can face that fear, challenge it, and overcome it.

In April 1997 Reynolds Price received a letter from  Jim Fox, a young man who had recently withdrawn from medical school  due to colon and liver cancer. Fox had readA Whole  New Life, Price's book about his bout and with spinal cancer,  and was moved enough by their similar experiences to write. He was  also searching for reassurance, or wisdom, if not outright answers: \"I  want to believe in a God who cares ... because I may meet him sooner  than I had expected. I think I am at the point where I can accept the  existence of a God (otherwise I can't explain the origin of the  universe), but I can't yet believe he cares about us.\" The letter was  so heartfelt and full of \"un-self-pitying eloquence\" that Price had  \"no choice but to answer it.\" His first response was presented as a  lecture to the Auburn Theological Seminary in New York City. Soon  after he expanded it and released it asLetter to a Man in the  Fire.The questions implied in Fox's letter are simply paraphrased in the  book's subtitle: \"Does God Exist and Does He Care?\" Though Price  writes from the perspective of one who believes fully in the Christian  tenet of the Holy Trinity, his message and sincere examination of the  nature of faith make his words relevant to those of any  denomination. Price incorporates, among many other sources, Milton,  Dante, Dostoyevsky, Eliot, theBhagavad-Gita, and the Book of  Job into his own spiritual awakenings in contemplating God's  participation in the fate of humankind. He exposes biblical  inconsistencies and apparent indifference to suffering as well as  celebrating acts of healing and inspiring mystery.What began as a long letter written in reply to one person became a  book relevant to all. Unfortunately, Fox was never able to read either  work. After sporadic e-mail and letter correspondence, a few phone  conversations, and then several months without contact, Fox died in  February 1998 at the age of 35. Before Price knew of Fox's fate, he  continued working on his book \"in the hope that, failing to reach its  original aim, the text might find some use in the hands of others.\" To  this end,Letter to a Man in the Fireis an unqualified  success. Deep thoughts abound in these pages and his writing often  soars. Price beautifully appeals to both the emotional and  intellectual sides of faith. He is erudite, humble, and wise. He  ponders some age-old questions, though ultimately unanswerable, in a  moving and satisfying way.--Shawn Carkonen", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Times and a reporter for the New York Times, Goldberg's life was driven by career deadlines. Yet, like her friends Jones, a recently divorced writer, and Ferdinand, a single reporter for the Washington Post, Goldberg longed for a child. Having just ended a relationship, Goldberg decided to order eight vials of sperm from California Cryobank, a deceptively hopeful maneuver that pushed all three down the path toward motherhood. That they actually make it, and find long-term relationships along the way, makes for a happy journey, but the power of this three-pronged narrative is the trio's candor regarding the compromises and complications that arise in the process of becoming mothers. Ironically, the anonymous vials of sperm never fulfill their intended purpose, but instead become a symbol of empowerment, giving each woman the green light to let go of bad relationships, find fulfilling new connections, and determine their own destinies. This personal, carefully recounted tale will resonate with any career woman wondering if it's too late to have it all.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her younger sister remains in Finland with their father. As the eve of her 13th birthday approaches, Kerka has much to learn about her heritage. Human fairy godmothers live among the unknowing, protecting and providing hints of magic where needed, and the women in her family have always held that role. Now, Kerka finds herself embarking on a magical journey where her sister's future is at stake. This second book does an excellent job setting up the fairy world of Aventurine where Kerka meets the fairies, trolls, and other spirit creatures that lead her on her quest. The writing is refreshingly well done and weaves together the author's knowledge of art, folklore, and botany to paint a magical world where readers' senses are piqued by the likes of stone fairies, cave anemones, and a queen named Patchouli. Kerka's growing awareness of her family history and events that happened when her mother and aunt were teens helps her find strength as a young woman coming of age. She relies on her brain as well as her own mystical powers to maneuver through the fairy dream world while finding her true place in the real world that is her home.—Cheryl Ashton, Amherst Public Library, OHCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This opening effort begins with a geologic description of the formation of the continent as it separated from the supercontinent of Pangaea about 140 million years ago. It concludes with the Eureka miner rebellion, a critical episode in the development of Australian democracy. Keneally, a Booker Prize–winning novelist and nonfiction writer, utilizes some wonderful vignettes gleaned from primary sources to advance his narrative. Aborigines, transplanted convicts, settlers, soldiers, and miners all play their part. Keneally conveys the sense of wonder and confusion as Aborigines encounter their first European. Convicts describe the suffering aboard transport ships and the grind of carving out an existence in a new and harsh land. There are recurring themes: first, Keneally stresses the exotic quality of the land, produced by its geographic isolation. And, second, he traces the steady evolution from a hierarchical social structure to a more egalitarian, democratic civilization.

The detailed study of the phenomena of affection, forgetting, habitus and translation sets out a distinction between three meanings of passivity: receptivity, sedimentation or inactuality and alienation. Husserl’s texts are interpreted as defending the idea that cultural crises are not brought to a close by replacing passivity with activity but by having more of both.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Cook, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy, Beloit CollegeReviewed By Dominique SessonsOfficial Apex Reviews Rating: 5 StarsFor years, we have been led to believe that the universe traces its roots back to the Big Bang, a cataclysmic explosion of ethereal energy that resulted in the formation of the planets, stars, and everything in-between. Suppose, though, that the cosmos wasn’t, in fact, borne of a random eruption – but rather stems from the ever-evolving imagination of a multi-dimensional dreaming mind? Such a drastically different perspective would no doubt change the way we see not only ourselves, but also our place in the infinite realm of the universe.Such is the central premise of The Heaven At The End Of Science, the eye-opening new offering from author Philip Mereton. Probing, well written, and thoroughly researched, Mereton’s insightful volume serves as a treatise on the popular misconceptions that the world of science would lead us to believe about the origins – and subsequent development – of the universe. More than just the simple remnants of ancient star dust, Mereton paints the compelling picture of life as a purposeful, directed means to an end. Bolstered by a wide range of enlightening sources, including religion, eastern philosophy – and science itself – The Heaven At The End Of Science breaks important ground regarding the limited purview of life as we’ve come to know it, encouraging readers to explore the unfettered depths of a new vision of universal purpose. A highly recommended read.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Whereas Socialism emphasized collectivism relegating man to a mere cog in the wheel of the larger social order, Liberalism celebrated man's independence from arbitrary authority. In one society after another, men and women asserted their right to make the decisions which affected their lives free from the control and/or tutelage of powerful elites both in and out of government.In 1905 Persians took the stage and demanded liberal reforms on par with the West. Revolutionaries demanded and received Asia's first formal constitution and in-so-doing began a journey down a path that would take them from a backward relic of a once-powerful empire, to one of the most important nations of the East-West Conflict known as the Cold War.Over the course of 74 short but turbulent years great men would rise and fall and the hopes and dreams of millions of their countrymen along with them.This, is their story.

Fans will find Brontë's Jane Eyre intact and unchanged. Her new story begins the year after the fire.We see how trauma and Edward's loss of sight affects each of them in different ways, and how they psychologically deal with both being a newly married couple and his handicap. Jane wonders how to deal with his brooding nature and Edward ponders if his beloved can love a man with so many problems.This is also the story of how to rebuild a world after it has been destroyed. Ms. Bennett explores the many ways Jane and Mr. Rochester try to bury the past and create a new life, untainted by history. In the process they reclaim a daughter's love and help Jane's cousins find their ownromances, as they learn to live with one another, blending their unique characters into a new, stronger coupled personality.Purists will applaud the gentle manner in which Ms. Bennett captures the essence of the original novel and yet adds her own distinctive voice and thoughts to the new beginning made by Jane and Edward. She maintains just the right tenor in her lush prose and never destroys Ms. Brontë's vision.Reviewed By: Kathe RobinThis review refers to the trade paperback edition.--Romantic Times Magazine Review", "related": [], "rank": 1344254, "title": "Jane Rochester: A Novel Inspired", "author": "Kimberly A.

He served in the Royal Engineers (popularly known as 'sappers') from 1907-19, being awarded the Military Cross during World War 1.He started writing in France, adopting a pen name because serving officers were not allowed to write under their own names. When his first stories, about life in the trenches, were published in 1915, they were an enormous success. But it was his first thriller, Bulldog Drummond (1920) that launched him as one of the most popular novelists of his generation. It had several amazingly successful sequels, including The Black Gang, The Third Round and The Final Count. Another great success was Jim Maitland (1923), featuring a footloose English sahib in foreign lands.Sapper published nearly thirty books in total, and a vast public mourned his death when he died in 1937, at the early age of forty-eight. So popular was his 'Bulldog Drummond' series that his friend, the late Gerard Fairlie, wrote several Bulldog Drummond stories after his death under the same pen name, which had by then become synonymous with fast-paced, intelligent thrillers and complex, vibrant characters.", "related": ["B004ZEYX5U"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It does so with a simple story about all the things that ducks can do (\"Ducks slurp/Ducks burp\"). The spare text allows for little narration, but picture clues divulge that a duck family is off to visit a loving goose relative, and the day includes activities familiar to young children. The animals embrace, eat lunch, and spend a messy afternoon baking, followed by cleanup and a fond farewell. Concentrated colored backgrounds add to the visual appeal of the pages, which have either black or white text and bright cartoon illustrations. The fact that the ducks use a remote control to operate their TV and talk on a cell phone adds a contemporary touch to this otherwise timeless story.

I admit the early creative stories featured me riding the range with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans and saving the West. What a disappointment to learn that Roy was exclusively committed to Dale! Eventually, my best friend from across the street and I decided to become better detectives than Nancy Drew. We drove our parents and neighbors crazy sticking our pert little noses where they didn't belong. About that time I started writing down my adventures, but mostly I was a reader. Not until I read Nora Roberts' early novels did I decide to create my own romance manuscripts. My road to publishing was a lot slower than Nora's was. No surprise there! I still read Nora's books—as well as those of countless other authors—but now I write full time. Unless life interferes, that is.  My Hero and I live one a small acreage in the ranching and horse country of North Central Texas. Finally, my childhood dream has come true and I’m in the midst of cowboys. Our two daughters are grown and in their own homes not far away.  Living with Hero and me now are Webster, our sweet black Shih Tzu, and our two shorthaired cats: Sebastian, a large black and white tuxedo who thinks he's our watchcat; and Bailey Erin, a shy apricot tabby who mostly stays in my office. When I'm not writing, I love spending time with family, reading, traveling with Hero, browsing antique malls and estate sales, and digging into family history and genealogy. Writing about strong heroes and heroines who overcome amazing obstacles to forge a meaningful life together is my passion.  I love to hear from readers at caroline @ carolineclemmons (dot) com.

The narrator, a woman who keeps her convictions to herself and who's entirely comfortable with a desultory life absorbed in Native American mythologies and nature, is hitched to a man who is much the opposite: impulsive, driven, social, and cocky, yet paranoid. As the story of this unlikely cohabitation unfolds in Tucson and a small seaside Mexican town, we come to see that there are no accidents or happenstances in their lives. Whether making impetuous choices (shooting a gun to scare off a pack of wild dogs) or thoughtful ones (attempting to develop ocean-front property), these characters drive and steer their own disasters. Their joy, rage, drama, resentment, fear, and elation become the reader's guilty pleasure. Though much of this story is a rebuke of the major themes of American literature--the promise of the road, the American dream, expansion of the frontier, to name a few--there's no righteousness to be found in it. There are only deeply flawed, yet cogent and likable people whose honesty illuminates our own lives. --Paul Diamond", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This is especially true for short stories and inclusions in anthologies; I confess that I'm not a huge magazine reader so I would have completely missed out on all the stories included here if not for this collection. As the synopsis indicates, a variety of genres that fall under the wider \"science fiction\" umbrella are included here, so not every story is going to be for everybody, but that's okay! The best thing about anthologies is being able to discover something that may normally not fall into one's purview. It's good to try new things, you know? I'll say at the onset, my favorite story was Obamaphone, an alternate history gem that's short, sweet, biting, and hilarious all at the same time. Seriously, this is how I envision decisions being made. The dance between bloggers, traditional media, and the world around us certainly doesn't escape unscathed either. I giggled. I giggled a lot. The other stories represent a variety of other subgenres, as well, but Obamaphone was really the breakout of the bunch. There is something for everyone lurking in here, though, so don't be afraid to give other new genres a shot.\"Review by Emily of whatbookisthat.com book review blog", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Personal-injury lawyer Sally Wade hires Gold to sue her almost ex-husband, Neville McBride, for assault, offering her black eye and bruises as evidence. A week later, Wade is found dead in a pose identical to one in a pornographic photograph discovered in McBride's apartment; McBride's only alibi is a mystery lover who failed to show up that night. But Gold is persuaded by McBride's defense lawyer, Jonathan Wolf, despite his abrasive style, that the woman who hired her could have been an impostor. Digging through Wade's records, Gold finds a passport for brief trips to Hong Kong, a stash of bonds and stocks, a list of people and payments not on her client list and a receipt for some photographs. Inspired by her martial arts class, Gold confronts two of Wade's chasers, i.e., men and women who cruise the highway for victims who might be potential clients, survives two death threats and gets a chilling look at what goes on inside a modern slaughterhouse. With the assistance of her secretary, Jacki Brand, in the fifth month of turning his linebacker body into something feminine, and law professor Benny Goldberg, who thinks unrelenting verbal sexual assault is funny, Gold digs deep into the surprising market for animal byproducts in an intricate, suspenseful story. \nCopyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I've read \"The White Mountain Chronicles\" at least a 1/2 dozen times. You can't imagine how much I can relate to this work.I enjoy his writing style and the way he speaks of the White Mountains and the time he spent there. I share so many of his sentiments about the area, but one that stands out most to me is his thoughts on hiking alone, \"I'd rather hike alone than share the mountains with someone who does not appreciate them the way that I do\".I'm a bit embarrassed by it, but I often think how great it would be to have a hiking partner like him, someone who loves the whole mountain experience: the drive up as the weight of the world starts to leave your shoulders, the satisfaction of a long hard hike, the pleasure of a warm camp fire and cold beer afterwards, gazing at the stars from a tent in Dolly Copp, and all of the other great things that come with the mountain experience.I actually just stayed at Dolly Copp on Sunday night before hiking King Ravine on Monday and was thinking of this book. I'm curious what his favorite site was. I was putting up my tent in the rain, remembering the story 'May Camp', of arriving late in the evening at Dolly Copp, and getting his tarp set up in the rain. His writings are so vivid that it's impossible to be in the area and not recall a story or two of his about the area you're in.Laudizen King's writings mean a lot to me. I think you will enjoy them as well.

With no holds barred they examine the disparate emotions and self-justifications of slaveholders' ideas, including a true picture of the complex and even contradictory ideas of paternalism.  Their analysis deepens our understanding of the social relationships that shaped the history of the American South, relationships with vast implications even today.  Steeped in comprehensive research, Fatal Deception is cultural, social, legal, and philosophical history at its best--simply brilliant.\" -Orville Vernon Burton, Clemson University, author of Age of Lincoln and In My Father's House Are Many Mansions:  Family and Community in Edgefield County, South Carolina\"'One day they learned that they had been deceiving themselves and living intimately with people they did not know at all.' This Eugene D. Genovese wrote more than four decades ago. In Fatal Self-Deception, Genovese and the late Elizabeth Fox-Genovese demonstrate with unflinching clarity just how fatal this self-deception proved. This judicious assessment of the 'burning contradictions' that riddled slaveholder ideology traces the immensity of that deception in the face of the embarrassments that betrayed the poverty of its moral and intellectual foundation. All along the way, slaveholders scrubbed away evidence that they were not loved by the enslaved, that black people were not inherently inferior, preferred slavery to freedom, and would be wiped from the face of the earth by emancipation, denying in the process (and against opposing voices, South and North) slavery's 'unremitting despotism.' In the end, as the authors write, 'Slaveholders had trouble getting their story straight.' The conundrums-including the place of poor white people in a slaveholding society-were unanswerable. The measureable consequence was the destruction of slavery in the US. A work of prodigious research.\"   -Thavolia Glymph, Duke University\"An extraordinarily learned and persuasive exploration of the intellectual world of the southern slaveowners, Fatal Self-Deception delves with unprecedented depth into the slaveholding mind and helps us make sense of their understanding of paternalism and their always fraught defense of slavery. This is a masterful work of historical scholarship, wholly impressive in every respect.\" -Mark Smith, Carolina Distinguished Professor of History, University of South Carolina and author of How Race Is Made: Slavery, Segregation, and the Senses\"In remarkable ways, this brief, lapidary volume, the last in the Mind of the Master Class series, at once hones and culminates the argument, about planter hegemony's rise, funcitons, operations, fall, and consequences, that Eugene Genovese and the late Elizabeth Fox-Genovese developed over a half century. How, in the process of forming, living, and imposing their worldview, planters deceived themselves about their meaning to and relations with their bondpeople emerges powerfully. So does planters' very different-and, in many respects, more distant and classist-regard of their white servitors, even when dining together. That thirty percent of the book is given to endnotes is a crude measure of the daunting research that underlies the work's conclusions about the affective bonds and disconnects both in paternalist ideology and among the holders and those who resisted and bore the consequences of that hegemony's emotional claims and sway.\"    -David Moltke-Hansen, Director, Simms Initiatives, University of South Carolina\"This thoughtful treatise lets slaveowners speak for themselves, showing how they struggled to square paternalism with the need for profit.

The revelation was life-altering and resulted in his first book titled \"My Sister:  A Journey to Myself\" published in 2010. The experience inspired him to continue writing. His second book, \"The Mountain of Hope\" will be released shortly and he is at work on a third book, \"Indian Joe's Treasure.\" The themes of interest to Peter Breyer concern the ultimate goodness of man and the power of belief and redemption to make our lives more meaningful and rewarding.  Peter Breyer was born in New York City to immigrant parents who fled war torn Europe in 1941. He attended City College of New York and completed a 1965-1967 tour in the Peace Corps in the South of India. He received his Ph.D. in City and Regional Planning from Rutgers University and has worked as a strategic health planning consultant for the Urban Health Institute which he helped found in 1973. He is married for over 40 years to Mildred Harper, whom he met in the Peace Corps. Their son Darrell and daughter-in-law Senait live in New York City with their daughter Miah who was born in 2008. Peter Breyer divides his time between suburban Somerset New Jersey and the pastoral country setting of Hillsdale New York, where he indulges his passion for working his 60 acres of forested mountain lands.  It is those mountains and those Indian and immigrant farmers of the past who inhabited his two new books. He believes that the land has a story to tell and once told it reveals as much about our lives today as about those who lived in the past.", "related": ["B00FIOIJHO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tetel ( Tangled Dreams ) treats readers to an exotic paradise peopled by beautiful, friendly inhabitants with rich customs, but fails to dish up much action. Eve Marie and Adam adopt Arawak Indian language and mores, and propriety soon loses its value for this very proper, intelligent and independent Englishwoman. After much teasing and tussling, she and Adam give in to their desires, but a return to civilization brings unpleasant revelations about both her lover and, later, her father. The heroine's newfound wisdom effects the requisite happy ending, and if the author has come up with nothing new here, she's at least provided an appealingly spunky protagonist.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B005GEYTIY"], "rank": 1472640, "title": "Swept Away", "author": "Julie Tetel Andresen", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Having been stranded in Italy at the beginning of the war, Questa Adamson spent years narrowly evading the Fascists and enduring near-starvation and brutalization by German soldiers. At age 17 she returns to her native land and learns that she has inherited the nearly ruined Shropshire estate of Eagle Court. Her short-lived tranquility is disturbed by the arrival of her father's old friend, Grace Syrett, seeking refuge from London's housing shortage for herself and her young son, Dickie. While the women reach an uneasy truce, Questa falls into swoons in which she finds love with a mysterious neighbor, a young Roman named Marcus who lived in the area 20 centuries previously. She also befriends a modern neighbor, elderly, crippled Randolph Atherton, who teaches her how to farm her land. When disaster strikes, Questa manages to find the strength to surmount her troubles and embrace a new love who seems to be Marcus's legacy. Saxon paints a vivid picture of life in postwar England, its inhabitants bitterly struggling with shortages and other deprivations. Her attempt to integrate Questa's dreamworld of Roman Britain is never fully convincing, however.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00BKQ0PMQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's a waist-high stack of Alice Munro stories.\") YetShelf-Loveis not just an ode to Munro. It is also a tribute to anyone who has ever had a rapturous literary crush. At one point, Dolnick shares his favorite passages from Munro's fiction; it becomes clear that this isn't so much a love letter addressed to Munro, but a letter to all readers who have ever found themselves underlining or reading aloud sentences from their favorite authors.--Kevin Nguyen", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Joe husbands going off to war and the tearful good-byes. At night my mother would read stories to us before bed. Stories like: The Happy Hollisters, The Bobbsey Twins or Nancy Drew, and she would do different voices for the characters. My dad introduced me to the sci fi writings of Andre Norten, Issac Asimov and Piers Anthony. I think the first book he let me read was \"The Octagon House\" by Andre Norton and I was probably in first or second grade. I was a voracious reader! I composed my first story with my mom when my cat died and I asked if it went to heaven. I also told my brother an elaborate tale of how he came to live with us, and when he was 13 he said he was running away to find his real parents who lived in Oklahoma. I had some explaining to do over that one!I've spent some time writing on forum based role-playing sites online.

I began to write seriously in 1985, when I moved from England to Australia with my husband and two small children. Jacaranda Wiley published my first novel soon afterwards - Sit Beside the Gnomon, a time travel adventure for 9-10 year olds. My latest adult novel, Compline (2012), is published by Amazon.com Kindle Books.  Life has given me two unusual experiences. Firstly I grew up as a teenager in Liverpool when The Beatles were rising to fame. Then I left Beatlemania behind to become a nun in Ireland, France, Belgium and England. I combined these two experiences in Compline, a book about a nun and Beatle George Harrison. Over the years I have developed my writing skills both by attending courses and by continuously practising my craft. More recently I was awarded a degree from Southern Cross University where I undertook two majors in creative writing. This gave me new ways of thinking about writing and enormous confidence, for I had matched myself against other excellent writers. Furthermore my work had been critiqued, and when I received my degree I knew I could hold my own among my peers. I immediately set to work to write Compline, my magnum opus. Other children's novels I have written are: Frizzy's Rainbow Maggo Ribbo B Bopp Goes Bim Bam Boom I also like to write picture books, short stories for adults, visual poetry, free verse stories, articles for newsletters and magazines.", "related": [], "rank": 1268467, "title": "Compline. a nun. a Beatle. a life. eBook", "author": "Gladys Pagendam", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Beginning her career in 1967 when she's 19 years old, she interviews emerging talent like Jimi Hendrix, Mick Jagger, and Jim Morrison while fixating on being overweight and embarking on a barrage of diets. Lola feels ashamed of her excess pounds because parents Renia and Edek suffered from malnutrition in a German concentration camp during WWII. Although Lola's career is taking off, she feels like a disappointment to her family, having never graduated from high school; and despite Renia's intervention, Lola remains heavy. Her survivor's guilt increases as she grows older, leading to panic attacks when she's in her 30s. Lola peers into other people's lives as she hides behind her role as a writer, seeing how their habits and histories came together to make them who they were.  Brett creates a fascinating portrait of a woman searching for meaning and connections stolen from her family. Agent: Anne Edelstein, Anne Edelstein Literary Agency.

Dennis does a good job of interweaving--and at the same time, keeping separate--the two simultaneous stories that constitute the novel.

Originally a mathematician, Tessa began her working life as a computer programmer, then married an author who encouraged her to start writing. She wrote a series of unexpectedly popular books about her hobby of knitting, and patented two knitting aids: The Golden Gauge, a device for isolating long knitting pattern lines, and The Silver Gauge, used for substituting yarns with others of the same thickness. She is featured as one of a handful of knitters in Richard Rutt’s seminal A HISTORY OF HAND KNITTING. After her husband died of cancer Tessa wrote, at his request, her first non-knitting book, A VOICE AT TWILIGHT. This takes a look, not always solemn, at the experience of living – and dying – with the Big C. Tessa was awarded the Oddfellows Social Concern Award for this book, and the prize was presented at the House of Commons. As family members kept telling her how like her husband the book sounded she thought she might be able to use that skill to write fiction. Tessa has now published six suspense novels and a family saga – a trilogy – set in North Germany and based on her mother’s family.  And she’s busy writing more books, both fiction and non-fiction.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It takes up where both the first and second books left off - yeah, both of them. I like the time-walking, the mystical shadow warriors, and Lady Mist and sergeants rule the army! There's good comic relief with the comical snake Ith.  ··JD King***** The changing landscape of the story and of the desert, war, magic, and a touch of sensuality, I was all in.  ··W.R. Masters*****...What I mostenjoy about this story is the ability of the author to draw one\ninto the minds of his characters, even those who happen to be on the\n\"wrong\" side of the battle. Additionally, the banter is natural and\nentertaining, the characters are complex and dynamic, and the battles are epic\nand exciting. On that note, few authors are able to narrate a battle with such\nskill that they can keep me from skimming through them, but R.L. Kiser is one\nof them.··Patricia\nHamill on Goodreads**** R.L.\nKiser has created a really epic trilogy with the Tales of the Crystal series\nand I have loved each one more than the other. The Twelve Tablets is fast paced\nand it really forces your brain to try to keep up with all of the action, while\nat the same time keeping you engaged in the characters. For me, this book is\nvery character driven and I like that fact. Each character is well fleshed out\nand you can picture them in your mind and understand why they choose to do the\nactions they do. Lovers of fantasy are really going to enjoy this last\ninstallment of the series because it hits all the key points you like to see in\nwell written fantasy work. I am glad that I started reading this series and\nwould highly recommend it. ·· Kathryn Bennett for Readers'\nFavorite", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

An explanation of certain elements, that readers have commented on, either very positively or very negatively, looks certain to be helpful, and possibly of interest to potential readers. This story was written in a very different style to my usual style, at least, at that time; I've written another couple since that use similar themes. The key differences are: a cut down storyscape that is almost devoid of technology, or features only simple technology, for example, windmills and looms; a form of speech that suggests the era of the story is an old one, certainly pre-Industrial Revolution, but conversely, it might fit just as neatly with someone's idea of post-apocalyptic. Certain elements are anachronistic, for example, the 'pod car', suggests to some that this is futuristic; I don't quash that idea; I like the idea that it could be. I wanted the love story here to be uncomplicated; the issue that needs to be addressed is a simple one, as old as time itself; prejudice. The love between Troy and Dan and the issue that they have to overcome is far more important to me than whether this is historical romance, steam punk or retro futuristic; you can decide that.", "related": ["B00KFKXV10"], "rank": 4262101, "title": "The Mouse That Felled The Oak", "author": "Alp Mortal", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Even as a child he would hide away for long periods of time to read it and other books that helped him learn more about the real meaning of life and what our purpose is here on earth. Upon moving off to college, he drifted far away from his roots and began living a life much lower than what he had learned we were called to live. Thankfully, at the very end of his college career, he was approached by a couple students who gave him the gospel of Christ. This was a major turning point in his life. From that time, he determined to live for the glory of God and the benefit of others. Lawrence currently lives in Orlando, FL with his wife and two children. He enjoys spending quality time with his family and friends and is a lover of the beautiful outdoors. He writes short stories and novellas in the Inspirational and Christian Fiction genres with the intent of both entertaining and helping to transform the lives of his readers with the ultimate message of hope. Lawrence was a bit concerned about the lack of clarity in some Christian fiction books with regards to the ultimate message of Christ as Savior.

As with most of us, I never had enough time. When I retired from my engineering career, that excuse evaporated.2012 was the right time, and Tales From The Glades Of Ballymore became a reality as an eBook.Tales From The Glades Of Ballymore is a family-friendly book. Although the animals have many adventures, there is no violence. It is heart-warming and humorous. The beautiful illustrations by Karen Ohlinger help bring it to life. The underlying theme of the book is The 'Golden Rule'. There aren't many books like this one written today.I released my second book at the end of 2012. This one, Ballymore Adventures, Book 1, also features the animals of Ballymore. Although, it is a story-book written for younger children.I recently completed a fantasy short-story for adults, \"Tuatha De Danaan\". Set in Western Ireland in the late 1800s, it is a story of a fateful night of interaction between a villager and the Otherworld.I am now working on a followup to Tales From The Glades Of Ballymore from my home in the Netherlands.Cooking has also become a serious hobby of mine, and when I'm not writing, I can frequently be found in the kitchen.I appreciate your interest and hope you choose to read one of my books. I hope it brings some joy to your life and the lives of your loved ones.I can be contacted at: Ballymoretales (at) gmail (dot) comSincerely,Bob Brooks", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That word, more than any other, sums up the gospel of Jesus Christ. And preaching that victorious gospel to the world has been Kenneth Copeland's driving purpose for more than 30 years.  An ordained minister, author and internationally recognized preacher, Brother Copeland began his ministry in 1967. Since then, Kenneth Copeland Ministries has grown to include not only its headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, but offices in Canada, England, South Africa and Australia as well.  Best known for his exuberant proclamation that \"Jesus is Lord!\", Kenneth Copeland has introduced people the world over to the saving message of faith. However, the vision of KCM includes more than simply introducing people to Jesus Christ. Theirs is a vision of taking believers on to maturity in the principles of faith, love, healing, prosperity, redemption and righteousness.  Every day that vision becomes more of a reality through Kenneth Copeland Ministries daily and weekly television broadcasts, monthly magazine, books, teaching tapes, gospel music recordings, meetings and conventions. Through these KCM outreaches, every day thousands of believers from Jacksonville to Johannesburg are moving from defeat, self-doubt and discouragement - to a life of God-given victory.", "related": ["B00EUQTTLG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Born in Southern California, but raised on Massachusetts' South Shore, Brian has been writing since he was a small child, often testing the boundaries of his school assignments by writing fictitious stories in place of daunting reports.  He even invented an English poet his senior year of high-school in order to bypass the school's rule  of 'no self written yearbook quotes'.  Readers now know this poet as William Grave. Though never a big reader, as odd as that may sound, Brian did grow up a fan of Dean Koontz, so it's no surprise that his writing style mimics that of the renowned author, with multiple story lines cohesively coming together by story's end.  And with a knack for creating vivid characters with dynamic personalities, as a reader you'll find yourself rooting for, and sometimes against, the people who make up his imaginary world.  But don't get too attached, because standard rules don't always apply, and not everyone always makes it out alive.

Here are Gospel-minded pastors and scholars doing Gospel business from all the scriptures—this is a biblical and theological feast preparing God’s people to apply the entire Bible to all of life with heart and mind wholly committed to Christ’s priorities.”—Bryan Chapell,President Emeritus, Covenant Theological Seminary; Senior Pastor, Grace Presbyterian Church, Peoria, Illinois“Mark Twain may have smiled when he wrote to a friend, “I didn’t have time to write you a short letter, so I wrote you a long letter.” But the truth of Twain’s remark remains serious and universal, because well-reasoned, compact writing requires extra time and extra hard work. And this is what we have in the Crossway Bible study seriesKnowing the Bible—as the skilled authors and notable editors provide the contours of each book of the Bible as well as the grand theological themes that bind them together as one Book. Here, in a 12-week format, are carefully wrought studies that will ignite the mind and the heart.”—R. Kent Hughes,Senior Pastor Emeritus, College Church, Wheaton, Illinois“Knowing the Biblebrings together a gifted team of Bible teachers to produce a high quality series of study guides. The coordinated focus of these materials is unique: biblical content, provocative questions, systematic theology, practical application, and the gospel story of God’s grace presented all the way through Scripture.”—Philip Graham Ryken,President, Wheaton College“TheseKnowing the Biblevolumes introduce a significant and very welcome variation on the general run of inductive Bible studies. Such series often provide questions with little guidance, leaving students to their own devices. They thus tend to overlook the role of teaching in the church. By contrast, Knowing the Bible avoids the problem by providing substantial instruction with the questions. Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology. I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.”—Graeme Goldsworthy,Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College“What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers! The organization and structure of the Bible study format presented through theKnowing the Bibleseries is so well conceived. Students of the Word are led to understand the content of passages through perceptive, guided questions, and they are given rich insights and application all along the way in the brief but illuminating sections that conclude each study. What potential growth in depth and breadth of understanding these studies offer. One can only pray that vast numbers of believers will discover more of God and the beauty of his Word through these rich studies.”—Bruce A.

Unbeknownst to Laurel, one more\nromance will be played out upon that famous bed--this one involving Laurel\nherself and annoyingly attractive handyman Ned Masterson.

Osbey's poem is a brilliant exercise in cultural archaeology -- reminiscent of Robert Hayden's groundbreaking poem \"Middle Passage.\" No detail . . . is without significance. --William Boelhower, literary editor ofAtlantic Studiesand editor ofNew Orleans in the Atlantic World\"History is your own heartbeat.\" So wrote Michael Harper. Few poets have attended to America's beating, bleeding heart as closely and as tenderly as Brenda Marie Osbey. In these poems, as in her past work, she traces the mortal marks our past has left on our city streets, in the rhythms of our feet. If history has been a coffle, it is also our freedom train. --Aldon Nielsen, author,Black Chant: Languages of African American PostmodernismandMantic Semantic, Kelley Professor of American Literature, Pennsylvania State UniversityMemory, culture, and language are the compelling cornerstones ofHistory and Other Poems. In this magnificent evocative of the long ago past, Brenda Marie Osbey brings her amazingly accurate voice and probing vision to bear on an historical archive of the Americas from fifteenth through the nineteenth centuries and expresses her powerful twenty-first century reflections on the origins and imposition of the Atlantic slave trade. Exploits and exploitations mingle in the voyages of European explorers, merchants, and slavers and in the words of lost captives, dreamers, and workers in sugar, rice, indigo, or cotton. No pandering to stereotypes and no longing for idealizations here; Osbey reaches deep into her own brilliant imagination and into cultural memory to expose to new life a necessary but often buried history. --Thadious M.

In town centres across Canada, war memorials pay tribute to the fallen. Who were they? From what deep well sprang so much courage, resourcefulness and resilience? In the  much and filth of sodden battlegrounds, how did these farmers, fishermen and shopkeepers persevere and acquit themselves so splendidly against a superb foe?Mark Zuehlke, acclaimed author and military historian, tells the story of the average Canadian who volunteered for the Canadian Expeditionary Force through the lens of one battalion-the 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish) of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division. This Highland Regiment fought in the Ypres Salient and in the Somme, at Vimy and Amiens. It suffered the first gas attack; its ranks were decimated as it fought at virtually every major battle in  the European theatre.From the declaration of war to the cessation of hostilities, Zuehlke follows the battalion from marshalling and training in Canada, across the Atlantic to England, and then landing in Europe. In graphic detail he takes the reader into the trenches and onto the shell-pocked battlefields, through assaults on ridges and wooded valleys. One unshakeable, startling image is that of the piper piping troops into battle-exposed to enemy fire all the while.Brave Battalion is not a sweeping history of the conflict. It is rather the story of war on the ground as told though the accomplishments of a band of brothers-the Canadian Scottish-who came to represent the best of what Canada sent into battle.", "related": [], "rank": 590922, "title": "Brave Battalion", "author": "Mark Zuehlke", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After college, she travels to Spain, where she is confronted with a tragic event and finds that her ties to her home and family are stronger than she thought. Upon returning home, she marries, has four children, and later loses her beloved husband to a heart attack. In the aftermath of his death, Claudia's loneliness brings a sad reflection on her relationships with the rest of her family. Always close with her mother, Claudia decides to accompany her to her native Latvia—a country she was forced to flee as a teen as a result of Soviet occupation. While uncovering the secrets of her mother's past, they discover unknown family members and begin the journey of healing past wounds. The dry, subtle humor will challenge most teens, but the characters are well drawn and the plot is accessible as well as beautifully constructed. Readers will connect with young Claudia and recognize elements of their own families in the Hewitts. This is a subtle novel that details the strength, forgiveness, and power of family while examining the ties that bind people together.—Lynn Rashid, Marriots Ridge High School, Marriotsville, MDCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Kettle has a knack for creating a heart thumping \"Gotcha\" moment in his stories, which is a great thing to have in a horror story...His tales have all the requisite elements to make a story captivating and hard to put down prior to finishing them.

Since she loves several genres, you may find your heroes in a contemporary, historical, paranormal or sci-fi setting. One of her passions is bringing people's fantasies to life on the page, because life is too short for even one boring moment. Her stories are volcanic in heat, deep in emotion, and sprinkled with doses of humor. When not indulging in her passion for books, she loves the outdoors, film and music. The Pacific Northwest is the ideal spot to enjoy both hiking and beachcombing. Once upon a time she was the singer in an indie rock band that toured the West Coast and charted on U.S. college radio. She currently resides on the northern coast of Oregon, where the constant rain and fog remind her of visits to her family in England and Scotland when she was a child. She is currently working on a new historical MM series, as well as a steampunk horror and sci-fi ménage.", "related": ["B00JRGJL4Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My childhood was blessed with influences of several cultures. Later, I married a true Oklahoman and learned all about the Sooner Spirit. The Oklahoma Land Run of 1889 sounded like a great backdrop for a romantic adventure. Who would be a good heroine?My Gramma Rose came to mind.  As she tried to teach me to sew, knit, and cook, she shared stories of her childhood. They stayed with me longer than the lessons. She fondly remembered her early years in Mexico as the privileged daughter of a doctor. Those halcyon days ended abruptly to violence and death. As a teenager, she became an immigrant in the US, living with her brother in Colorado. Treated more as a servant, than a family member, she made choices to be liberated from a demeaning situation. Gramma Rose carried dignity around her like a cloak. Despite a lack of education, language barriers, and cultural bias, she moved forward and took risks for a better future. I once asked her how she had the courage to leave Colorado for the unknown in California. She shrugged and smiled, \"Loco.\"She wasn't loco. She was smart, clever, and courageous. Definitely heroine material. PROUD HEART is entirely fictional and set in a time period before my grandmother was born. But, the hearty souls who made a run into the Unassigned Lands might have included a strong-willed Latina very much like Rosa Dominguez, my proud-hearted grandmother.", "related": ["B00IKWGM8O"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Often things and people were not the way they first looked so she had to keep digging deeper. As I read, I was pulled into trying to solve the murder case with her.

The action was fast-paced and non- stop throughout the whole book. The characters were well- developed and realistic.
