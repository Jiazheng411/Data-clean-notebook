William Swift sat in a room on the third floor  of Ludlow House and gazed with determined hatred at his father, who peered  back at him with a demon’s eyes and a madman’s smile.Evening was still hours away, but in that chamber darkness had already  fallen. It was no ordinary darkness, no mundane arrival of night. It was a  living, churning shadow that had swallowed the room and blotted out every  bit of natural daylight, so that the   windows were black as pitch and a fog of darkness pulsed and breathed,  filling the space between the two living beings who sat facing each other  on hard wooden chairs.The only light came from thin white candles that had been placed every six  inches in a rough circle around the center of the room, a circle that  included both William and his father, Henry, within its boundaries. The  candles had been made by virgin hands and cooled in holy water, and an  unnatural blue tint engulfed each wick. The color was beautiful and  calming and strong. The shifting shadows that swirled about could not  touch that uncanny blue light.The room had once been a nursery. Both William and his younger sister,  Tamara, had slept here in their infancy. He was determined that once the  demon was gone, and his father was restored, no one would ever use the  nursery again. With his own hands he would board it up, nail it shut, and  remove the knob. They were, each member of the Swift family, forever  stained by their contact with the evil and the damned, and their home was  equally tainted.This infestation in particular, though, could not be allowed to remain. At  the same moment as he and Tamara had inherited the abilities and duties of  the Protectors of Albion—novices though they were in a perilous and  eternal war—their father had been possessed by this demon Oblis. As they  studied and practiced and honed their knowledge and their skills, each new  triumph convinced them that now they would have the fortitude needed to   exorcise the creature from Henry Swift.Yet each time they tried, they failed.William had been growing more and more restless. The knowledge that his  father was trapped within his own body, enslaved to the demon that was  housed therein, haunted the young man, awake and asleep. His work as  manager of the family bank, Swift’s of London, had suffered. Too often he  wandered around, little more than a ghost himself, dark circles under his  eyes. At times he nodded off, waking to find himself in the midst of a  conversation, or having walked into a room without remembering why he’d  gone there or what he’d been seeking.But now the moment had come. He would not rest until the demon had been  extracted from his father’s flesh.The creature sat across from him, grinning in the shadows that danced with  the blue light of those blessed candles. The eyes that opposed him were  not those of Henry Swift, but of Oblis. The demon often attempted to  manipulate the members of the household by speaking in Henry’s voice,  exhibiting the gentle kindness of a father. And from time to time, William  thought that perhaps   it really was his father, wrestling the demon down or slipping through  when Oblis was distracted.But he could never be sure, could never know if he spoke to the man or the  beast.All of that was going to end.The darkness was cold. A rime of ice frosted the windows and the floors,  the walls and the chairs. William and the demon stared at each other, both  breathing evenly. Oblis’s expression was strangely curious.In the center of the room, precisely midway between them, stood an  elegant, handmade perfume bottle swirled with pink and red and blue glass  and stoppered with a handmade glass butterfly.“Well, now, this is lovely, isn’t it?” the demon said in Henry’s voice.  “Just the two of us, and a pretty bauble.”William glared at him. “We’re not alone.”Oblis sat back in the chair, comfortable in spite of the chains that bound  him to it. They were, after all, only physical bonds to prevent him from  causing harm to Henry’s body, or attacking   anyone who entered the room. Once the chains themselves had held many  spells, binding magic. But he had managed to escape more than once, and  William and Tamara had become very, very careful. The numerous spells that  kept him prisoner were in the walls themselves; they would not allow him  to leave the room while his demonic essence was within the flesh of Henry  Swift. The young Protectors made no attempt to shackle his spirit  alone—they wanted the demon to depart their father’s flesh, more than  anything, and their spells would not prevent that—but Oblis was not quite  through tormenting them yet.“No, we’re not alone, are we?” the demon whispered, in his own voice now,  a kind of serpentine rasp that seemed spoken just beside William’s ear.  “Your father’s here with us, isn’t he? Though he’s a bit tongue-tied at  the moment.” He chuckled at his own wit.William remained impassive. He had learned not to rise to the demon’s bait.Another voice flowed from the darkness. “This is a bad idea,” it said. “I  wish to make certain that, later, you’ll remember that I warned you.”The demon arched an eyebrow.“When I said we weren’t alone,” William told him, “I wasn’t referring  merely to my father.”“Oh, I’m well aware of the presence of the ghost,” Oblis replied, not  bothering to glance into the shadows from which the voice had come. “I  simply take no notice. I don’t like to encourage this impression they  have, that they are of some consequence.”A low chiming sound filtered into the shadows of the room, and a figure  began to manifest in the corner, beside a blackened window. The specter  had one arm and was dressed in the garb of the Royal Navy, but the navy of  years past, not the present day. Lord Admiral Horatio Nelson was one of  many ghosts who functioned as allies for the Protectors of Albion,  attempting to aid them in defending the mystical soul of England against  sinister forces that would corrupt or destroy it.“I’m also not sure what you hoped to gain from the phantom’s  participation,” Oblis went on. “He cannot harm me. Not while I occupy the  form of your dear, dear father.”William opened his hands. “True enough. Oh, Horatio could hurt you a great  deal, but he wouldn’t, as long as you possess my father. But we’ll soon  have you out of there. And then you’ll find the fury of a ghost of far  greater consequence than you’ve ever imagined. We’ve each a reason to make  you suffer, but I suspect Bodicea’s vengeance upon you will last an  eternity.”The demon only scowled, but William saw a flicker of doubt in Oblis’s eyes  that pleased him. The ritual ought to work, but if it went poorly and  Oblis tried to escape, Horatio ought to be able to hold onto the vapor  demon long enough to imprison him. He might even be able to destroy the  demon once it had left its human host.One way or another, they would cage him. And if they could cage him, they  could destroy him.But the ghost of that brave, if slightly pompous and effete,   admiral had not been enlisted to take part in this ritual as a combatant.  William had simply wanted someone there to watch over him, to warn him if  he seemed to be falling under the demon’s influence, and to sound an alarm  if the worst happened.“William . . .” the ghost cautioned.“I’ll remember, Horatio,” the young man replied.“You don’t know if it will work.”William stared at his father, his gaze locked again upon the eyes of the  demon within. “No, I don’t. But I’ve run out of patience.”Oblis smirked with Henry’s lips. “This should be interesting, then.”Though there was a tremor in his heart, William kept his hands steady as  he raised them, revealing the straight razor clasped in his right hand. He  flicked it open with a flourish, the gleaming steel sliding out of the  ivory handle.Before he could begin to doubt, he drew the blade across his left wrist,  hissing through his teeth with the sting. A line of blood welled up  instantly and began to trickle across his palm. Several drops fell to the  floor.And then the blood began to pulse from the cut, the flow increasing.When he spoke, the words were in halting German, memorized from a  handwritten journal produced by a demonologist whose work William had  discovered in the course of his research.“With the blood of his blood, I summon you,” he said. “With the blood of  his blood, I draw you out.”Several drops that had begun to fall were abruptly arrested   in mid-air, quivering there a moment. Then they began to flow across the  room, sliding through the air slowly, like mercury rising. Before long,  the string of blood stretched toward the center of the room, until it  reached a point just above the perfume bottle—the receptacle—he had placed  there.For the first time, the demon looked concerned. Henry’s brow furrowed  deeply.“What do you think you’ve discovered, boy?”William ignored him, massaging his left arm, running his hand down from  the elbow to the wrist so that the blood flowed from the slit. More and  more ran out and into the air, and the stream of blood t...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The two of them walking down the street side by side drew every female eye for a half a mile.Heads turned. Slow, admiring smiles spread across faces of women young and old. A pretty, little curly-headed thing beamed at them from across the parking lot, and Romeo perked right up.\"Don't even think about it,\" Jax warned, giving a little tug on the line that held them together.More than one woman had commented that they resem-bled one another, although Jax just didn't see it.Oh, they both had hair that was a little longer and blonder than most. Jax's used to drag the top of his shoul-ders when it wasn't pulled back into a disreputable-look-ing ponytail that more than one woman had claimed made him look dangerous in a very interesting way. He now had what was, for him, a fairly short, neat trim, the ends barely brushing his collar in the back. Romeo, too, had gotten a trim, since spring was coming on strong already in north Georgia, even though it was only March. Both he and Romeo were full through the shoulders and lean in the hips, and Jax wouldn't deny that they both probably had a little swagger to their walk.But Jax wasn't nearly as conceited or as much of a flirt as Romeo, who was probably the most pathetic thing Jax had ever encountered. Jax chased criminals for a living. He'd seen \"pathetic\" before.Romeo was a police academy dropout and now, a kept man. Kept, unfortunately, by Jax's softhearted, dying mother, who was completely blind to every fault Romeo had.\"She probably left you every dime she's got,\" Jax com-plained, just imagining the way Romeo would strut then.For the moment, Romeo just kept on walking, oblivi-ous, as ever, to any insult Jax slung his way.The security guard at the hospital's employee entrance was an off-duty cop and a friend, who let them slip in the back way and up the stairs. Jax thanked the man and tried not to sound ungrateful for the patrol-man's offer of sympathy. He wasn't ungrateful, not really, just trying as hard as he could to deny what was kept wanting to talk about it.He knew they meant well, but it didn't help to know everyone else felt lousy about what was happening. He felt lousy, too. That bit about misery loving company just wasn't working for him. He thought he'd be better off if everyone in town would just let him wallow in his misery and pretended to be oblivious to the whole situation.But they all knew his mother, and they all loved her. Most of them either had known his father or had fathers who'd known his father, through the job. A good number of them had dated one or more of his sisters, and the rest—the females—had dated Jax himself.to help, but the hard truth was, his mother was dying.Nothing made that better, and he wasn't sure how much more he could stand, watching her suffer this way.They got to the third floor, and Jax held up a hand to signal Romeo to stop.\"Remember, be quiet,\" he warned as he eased open the door, which led directly onto the hospice ward. \"All right. Coast is clear.\"The three nurses at the nurses' station obligingly looked the other way, feigning a sudden and unfailing interest in a splotch of paint on the ceiling of the hall. They were sweethearts. All of them. Any other time, and he would have been as charming to them as humanly possible, giving them one of the legendary smiles for which the Cassidy men were known.He wasn't being conceited. His mother had told him all about the power of a Cassidy male's charm from the mo-ment of his birth and sworn he wouldn't be getting away with anything with her because of it. Supposedly he'd gur-gled and slobbered on her, waved his fists madly and smiled with every bit of the charm she feared a male child of Billy Cassidy's would have.As his grandma Cassidy had told the story, his mother had promptly started praying that God would send her nothing but female children from then on, and she'd gotten her wish. Three times. Then she'd proceeded to try as hard as she could to raise her only son to think the ability to charm women was something of a burden, dangerous, unpredictable and a completely unfair advantage to wage against the women of this world.It was the one thing she'd never convinced him of, de-spite the fact that they loved each other dearly.Jax slipped out the door and into the hall. Romeo perked up as he spotted the women at the desk.\"You say a word to them, and you'll sleep outside for a week,\" Jax threatened.He got nothing but a low growl in return.Romeo had never met a woman he didn't like. He saw a pretty one and everything else went straight out of his head.\"Just remember where we are, and that you're not sup-posed to be here,\" Jax reminded him.As hospitals went, this wasn't bad. It was in a nice, old, whitewashed stone building with a wide, elegant, wrap-around porch and tall, white columns, which used to be the main hospital seventy years ago. Now, the real hospital lay off to the right, attached to the hospice unit by a pretty atrium.They kept things quieter over here. It was dark and peaceful. The patients slept as long as they could in the morning and throughout the day, had as much medication as their systems could stand and as little pain as was humanly possible, although it was still too much.Jax hated the place.But his mother was in the room down the hall, and there was nothing on this earth that would keep him away from her now or at any other time in her life when she needed him.His three little sisters were all exhausted from the battle they'd fought to keep their mother at home, where she'd asked to stay until the end. But in the middle of the night, forty-eight hours ago, her breathing had gotten so labored and the pain so bad and his sisters had cried so many tears and hurt so badly themselves, that maybe he'd just gotten too scared to let it end like that. Because he'd called 911, and they'd carted his mother off here, where, with the kind of strength she'd always possessed and he'd never under-stood, she still clung stubbornly to life.She was one amazing woman. How could she do some-thing as ordinary as die?Pausing outside the door, he looked over to Romeo and shook his head in disgust. \"Don't jump on her or hang all over her. She hurts just about everywhere,\" Jax said, then thought of one more thing. \"And don't you dare cry.\"Jax pushed open the door. The room was dim. His pretty quilt stitched by his own grandma Jackson's hand, the woman whose family name he carried. William, for his Jackson, for his mother's family. William Jackson Cassidy.His mother had realized right away what a mouthful it was. She was the one who'd given him the nickname Jax when he was still tiny, when she'd been young and abso-lutely stunning, from the pictures he'd seen, and had what everyone must have thought was a long, happy life ahead of her. A husband she loved dearly, one who clearly adored her, a son who adored her just as much, and three beauti-ful daughters.\"Didn't quite work out that way, did it, Mom?\" he whispered.Her pretty, honey-colored hair was long gone, her eyes sunk down into her face, dark circles under them, no color at all in her cheeks. She turned her head ever so slowly to-ward him and managed a weak smile.Then she caught sight of Romeo and said, \"Oh, baby. You made it.\"Romeo stood there and grinned like a fool. His tail swished back and forth in a move that he seemed to think made women swoon. Of course, he thought everything he did made women swoon, and Jax couldn't deny it was pretty much true.The dog had a way with women.Especially Jax's mother. \"Come here, sweet thing,\" his mother said. \"I take it you mean the dog, and not me?\" Jax said, tak-ing the chair by her bedside and sitting down.\"You know I love you,\" she murmured weakly, turning her cheek for his kiss.He gave her one, trying to make it seem like any other greeting he'd given her over the years. Casual and easy, as if he had ages to say hello to her this way. As if this might not be the last time.How could that be?The last time?What were they going to do without her? \"You love the dog more than any of us,\" he said, because it was a familiar argument, and he couldn't stand to talk about her dying.\"You're just jealous, because he's prettier than you, women like him better,\" his mother said, actually managing to make him grin when he wouldn't have thought anything could. She was one of those who claimed he and the dog were way too much alike. Another subject he was happy to talk about, instead of what was going on here.Romeo whined and put his front paws up on the bed, then stuck his cold nose against his mother's cheek. She smiled and turned her face to him. \"Come here, baby.\"The dog leaped up onto the bed. \"Romeo, what did I just tell you?\" Jax reminded him. The dog gave him a look that he could swear said,She does love me more than you, and I am prettier than you. So there.\"It's all right,\" his mother said, the words coming slowly, her breathing labored. \", been at this for a long time. He knows, to be careful. Come right up here beside me, baby.\"Her fifty-five-pound baby crept up very slowly, feeling his way, until he was as close to her as he could get, pressed against her side, all stretched out on the bed, his head on her right arm, his nose against her cheek. He whimpered softly.\"Yes. That's my good boy.\" His mother leaned her head against the dog's and gave a contented sigh, then turned back to Jax. \"Thank you for bringing him.\"\"You know I'd do anything for you,\" he said and worried he might be the one to start to cry.\"Yes, I know.\"\"Sorry about bringing you here.\"\"It's fine, . Doesn't hurt much now. The medication is, They keep the really good stuff here. I needed it.\"\"If you want, we'll take you back home.\" And somehow they'd find the strength to s...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Not yet.Heidi bit her bottom lip, praying that this wasn't it. That Jesse wasn't finished.He collapsed against her.The moan turned into a groan.\"Mmm,\" he hummed, kissing her neck several times and then kissing her mouth. \"That was good. You were good.\"Apparently she was too good. He'd reached climax before she was even halfway up the ladder, leaving her hanging from the rungs with no hope of his helping her over. Because she knew that no matter what she said, what she did, he was done.And she wasn't even close.\"What?\" he said when she kissed him back with moderate enthusiasm. \"Oh, no. Did I do it again?\"Heidi took a deep breath, trying to unwind her coiled muscles. \"When I said 'quickie,' I didn't mean it in a literal sense. I meant 'no foreplay necessary.' But an orgasm would have been nice.\"He chuckled into her hair. \"I'm sorry, Heidi.\"She stretched her neck, figuring she could see to herself in the shower. After all, it was three o'clock on a busy Saturday afternoon in June and she certainly hadn't expected more. Had hoped for more, especially since they'd spoken several times lately about Jesse's habit of not waiting for her before diving over the orgasmic edge.Of course, all it usually took for Jesse was a gentle blow in his ear and a squeeze of her thighs and he was a goner.Therein lay the problem.\"It's the place, I think,\" he said, smoothing her hair back from her face. \"It's strange having sex in Professor Tanner's place.\"\"It's not his place, it's mine. At least for the summer while I'm renting it from him.\"Well, she was actually house-sitting, as well. Watering Tanner's plants, taking care of his garden, forwarding his mail to him while he was in Belgium for the next couple of months. A perfect set-up, really. She got the type of privacy with Jesse that she wanted and that they couldn't have at the apartment he shared with two friends, and all she had to do was take care of the house as if it were her own. Perfect.Only it wasn't working as well as she'd hoped.Jesse turned on his dazzling megawatt grin. \"Do you want to try again?\"Heidi quickly reached for another condom on the nightstand.A knock at the front door thwarted her intentions.Jesse kissed her. \"I'll make it up to you, Hi. I promise.\"She languidly snaked her arms around his neck and tunneled her fingers into his thick, dark hair. \"At this rate, you'll owe me well into the next century,\" she whispered.His chuckle made her smile. \"So be it.\" He kissed her deeply again before pushing off to jump into his jeans sans underwear. \"I can come up with worse debts.\"So could she.Heidi propped herself up on her elbows, watching Jesse Gilbred's fine male form as he got dressed. His tousled hair dipped low over his brow. His slender, whipcord-taut muscles moved and rippled with his actions. His green eyes twinkled at her mischievously.It was a sight of which she'd never tire. She'd met Jesse when they'd been little more than kids in high school and had remained smitten with him ever since. He'd been the captain of the football team, she'd been the quiet, studious girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Even when he'd left Fantasy, Michigan, to attend college in the east, they'd maintained a long-distance relationship, with Jesse returning at least one weekend a month to see her. It had been a long two years, but when he'd graduated and come home for good to work in a managerial capacity at his father's construction company, she'd been there for him, just as she had for the past eight years.He had been her first. And she intended that he be her last. He was the one she'd built all of her plans around. Well, all but the little detail they encountered every now and again, as they had just now. But they could definitely work on that.He left the room and Heidi pulled a pillow over her head and gave a muffled moan.\"Hey, how's it hanging, man?\" she heard Jesse's voice as he greeted their visitor.She shifted the pillow to peek at the bedroom door he'd left wide open.Jesse's best friend entered her line of vision, all blond hair and dark tan. He stared at her, apparently as startled as she was at being caught in this situation.\"Jesse!\" she called, yanking the sheet up to her chin and then catapulting off the bed so she could close the door.Heidi leaned against the wood for long moments, listening to Jesse's laugh and Kyle's awkward apologies.So much for seeing to her own needs. Whatever lingering desire she felt had been chased away by another man's scorching gaze.She made out Jesse's words through the wood, \"No need to apologize. If a guy can't trust his best friend, who can he trust?\"Heidi gave an eye roll and dropped the sheet, stepping over it on her way to the connecting bath.Naked as the day she was born.The ridiculous saying came to Kyle Trapper's mind as he raked his hand through his hair, staring at his friend as if he'd lost a baseball or two on the way to the game.Kyle had yet to move from where he stood in the middle of the small, well-appointed living room. His gaze wandered back toward the closed bedroom door of its own volition, as if hoping to catch another forbidden glimpse of Heidi's decadent white flesh. He didn't care which part. Whether it was her pert, rose-kissed breasts, her flat, toned stomach, or the trimmed triangle of hair that seemed to point toward the V of her thighs like an erotic arrow.His friend sat on an armchair pulling on socks and athletic shoes, oblivious to his thoughts. And it was a good thing. If their roles had been reversed, he'd have punched his friend.\"Hell, Jesse, do you let everyone see your girlfriend naked?\"Jesse got up and smacked him on the back. \"Only my closest friends.\"Kyle was not amused.\"What's your problem? You'd think you'd never seen a woman without her clothes on.\"\"Never that woman.\"Never Jesse's girl.Jesse grabbed a T-shirt that was hanging on the back of the chair. \"How'd you know I was here, anyway?\"Kyle hadn't known. In fact, he hadn't come here for his friend at all. He'd come to talk to Heidi.He cleared his throat. \"Where else would you be?\"His response must have come out gruffer than he'd intended because Jesse paused. \"Hey, you never have told me what your problem is with Heidi, but she's one of the most open women I've ever met.\" He shrugged as he pulled the shirt over his head. \"She won't care that you've seen her naked.\"\"Right. That's why she turned ten shades of red and slammed the door.\" Kyle rubbed the back of his neck. \"And why do you think I have a problem with her?\"Jesse pulled the T-shirt down, revealing the name of a local tavern. \"She thinks you don't like her.\"That surprised him. At the same time it was cause for relief. If either Jesse or Heidi had a clue about how he really felt… well, he didn't think he'd be standing in her rental house right now, about to leave with her boyfriend to play softball.In fact, he'd probably be run out of the small town on a rail, back to a life that had never held much for him by way of a future.If you had asked him seven years ago where he'd be now, he would never have guessed south-east Michigan, working as an architect. But that would have been before Jesse was assigned as his roommate at Boston University and his life had changed forever… for the better. So much so that he hadn't hesitated when his friend had invited him to come to Fantasy eight months ago and put his architectural talents to good use by working in cooperation with Gilbred Builders. So he'd shut the doors to his own start-up company in Boston and moved to the Midwest.He'd like to say it had been smooth sailing ever since. But he wasn't much into lying, particularly to himself. Until he'd moved to Fantasy, he'd only spoken to Heidi when she called and Jesse wasn't home—calls he'd enjoyed more than he should have. What he hadn't anticipated was that coming to Fantasy would amplify his lust for a woman he could never have.If he'd needed a reminder, he'd just gotten it by way of his uncomfortable physical reaction to a mere glimpse of her full-frontal nudity.And what of his strategy to combat his unwanted emotions by asking her to help him plan a surprise birthday party for Jesse? The idea being that the more time he forced himself to spend around her, the better he'd be able to battle against his attraction to her? Was he kidding himself by thinking that familiarity would erase whatever mysterious factors drew him to her?But after eight months of careful avoidance and awkward silences whenever their paths crossed, and nights filled with countless cold showers, Kyle knew he had to do something to defuse a situation that was only getting worse instead of better.\"Anyway, we all know you're gay,\" Jesse said, lightly hitting him in the arm.\"What?\"\"You heard me. I haven't seen you date a single woman since you've come to Fantasy. Back in Boston you were with a girl nearly every night of the week. I figured you'd switched sides and were batting lefty.\"Now that was a new one. But, hey, so long as it kept his best friend from learning the truth, let him think what he would.\"I'm joking, man.\"Kyle stared at him, realizing that Jesse had expected something else from him. A denial maybe. Or perhaps a mock physical assault.He made like he was going to slug him.Jesse laughed and good-naturedly dodged the hit as he grabbed his ball cap. \"Come on. We can get in some practice on the field before anyone else gets there.\"Jesse opened the front door and walked out. Kyle stood staring at the closed bedroom door for a long moment, feel...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is much more traditional in its vampire lore (having to invite a vampire into your house, no reflections, wooden steak through the heart, etc) than many of the current stories in this genre. As such, the vampires seem scarier and more dangerous than those humanized versions resulting in a suspenseful read...Another side effect of the more traditional vampire lore is that the story acutely focuses on the relationship between SFPD officer Brady and his dead lover, turned vampire, Cole. I found the relationship really interesting. It was realistic and very compelling. The sex was really hot, too!..Overall, this is a well-written paranormal romance.\"--Matthew, Rainbow Reviews\"5 NYMPHS!...GOLD BLUSH AWARD!...an amazing book. In fact, I pretty much read it in one sitting...it held a very strong plot and the sex simply flavored it. That's the kind of book I crave: one where I become so lost in the story itself, that when the characters come together (literally), it feels natural and not contrived...Personally, I hope and pray that maybe Ms. Dean will write a sequel, because there's so much left for Brady and Cole to rediscover about themselves and each other. That's why I give this book a Golden Blush Award.

Some fakes were so cleverly done that they have deceived even twentieth-century historians who have cited them as though they were authentic sources. Myra Glenn spent many years in assiduous archival search to discover the true narratives of real lives among these often-deceptive texts and has decoded the hidden messages about nineteenth-century masculinity and patriotism that the authentic autobiographies hold.

There are three big ideas in it. One is a novel argument for the conclusion that perceptual experiences have representational content. Siegel makes a persuasive case that this argument applies even to all but the most radical of those who take themselves to be opposed to representational views of perception. The second is a set of arguments that these contents of perception are 'rich' in that they go beyond color, shape, illumination, motion, and space. Perceptual experiences represent such properties as being a dog, being a pinetree and even being John Malkovich. The third big idea is a method for adjudicating the contents of perception, the method of phenomenal contrast. This method is of considerable value whether or not one accepts Siegel's conclusions. This book is illuminating, convincingand also wonderfully clear and fun to read.\"--Ned Block, New York University", "related": [], "rank": 1781956, "title": "The Contents of Visual Experience (Philosophy of Mind)", "author": "Susanna Siegel", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I refused, explaining rather pompously that I was actually a novelist. Well, I was sort of. I already had two novels in a drawer, where they remain to this day. Months went by, no one accepted anything I wrote. Finally I called the Lippincott lady and said I would do it. The advance was $1,000. I had a wife, two children and a day job, so I wrote it mostly at night. Sometimes the people upstairs pounded on the ceiling to make me stop.  The book came out, achieved both sales and notoriety, much of the latter focused on the \"Alligators in the Sewers\" chapter, and nine month later came the first royalty check, $1,700.

After receiving a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science and a Master of Fine Arts in Cinema from UCLA (1968, l969) he spent two years as a copywriter for a small Studio City, Calif. advertising and public relations firm. His writing career began when August Derleth bought a long Lovecraftian letter of Foster's in 1968 and much to Foster's surprise, published it as a short story in Derleth's bi-annual magazine The Arkham Collector. Sales of short fiction to other magazines followed. His first attempt at a novel, The Tar-Aiym Krang, was bought by Betty Ballantine and published by Ballantine Books in 1972. It incorporates a number of suggestions from famed SF editor John W. Campbell. Since then, Foster's sometimes humorous, occasionally poignant, but always entertaining short fiction has appeared in all the major SF magazines as well as in original anthologies and several \"Best of the Year\" compendiums. Six collections of his short form work have been published. Foster's work to date includes excursions into hard science-fiction, fantasy, horror, detective, western, historical, and contemporary fiction. He has also written numerous non-fiction articles on film, science, and scuba diving, as well as having produced the novel versions of many films, including such well-known productions as Star Wars, the first three Alien films, and Alien Nation. Other works include scripts for talking records, radio, computer games, and the story for the first Star Trek movie. In addition to publication in English, his work has appeared and won awards throughout the world. His novel Cyber Way won the Southwest Book Award for Fiction in 1990, the first work of science-fiction ever to do so. Though restricted (for now) to the exploration of one world, Foster's love of the far-away and exotic has led him to travel extensively. After graduating from college he lived for a summer with the family of a Tahitian policeman and camped out in French Polynesia. He and his wife JoAnn Oxley, of Moran, Texas, have traveled to Europe and throughout Asia and the Pacific in addition to exploring the back roads of Tanzania and Kenya. Foster has camped out in the \"Green Hell\" region of the Southeastern Peruvian jungle, photographing army ants and pan-frying piranha (lots of small bones; tastes a lot like trout); has ridden forty-foot whale sharks in the remote waters off Western Australia, and was one of three people on the first commercial air flight into Northern Australia's Bungle Bungle National Park. He has rappelled into New Mexico's fabled Lechugilla Cave, white-water rafted the length of the Zambezi's Batoka Gorge, driven solo the length and breadth of Namibia, crossed the Andes by car , sifted the sands of unexplored archeological sites in Peru, gone swimming with giant otters in Brazil, and surveyed remote Papua New Guinea and West Papua both above and below the water. His filmed footage of Great White Sharks feeding off South Australia has appeared on both American television and the BBC. Besides traveling he enjoys listening to both classical music and heavy metal. Other pastimes include basketball, hiking, body surfing, scuba diving, collecting animation on video, and weightlifting. He studied karate with Aaron and Chuck Norris before Norris decided to give up teaching for acting. He has taught screenwriting, literature, and film history at UCLA and Los Angeles City College as well as having lectured at universities and conferences around the country and in Europe. A member of the Science-Fiction Writers of America, the Author's Guild of America, and the Writer's Guild of America, west, he also spent two years serving on the Planning and Zoning Commission of his home town of Prescott, Arizona. Foster's correspondence and manuscripts are in the Special Collection of the Hayden Library of Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona. The Fosters reside in Prescott in a house bu", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This was the starting point for this story. Instead of a post-apocalyptic setting, I wanted to explore how someone would try to survive the most hostile situation imaginable and still maintain something of his moral compass.Mitch isn't a conventional action hero. He has a conscience and really doesn't want to cause anybody harm, even when they're trying to rip his throat out. He knows the people trying to kill him are sick and not acting out of their own free will.

No other textbook covers magnetic components of inductors and transformers for high-frequency applications in detail.This unique text examines design techniques of the major types of inductors and transformers used for a wide variety of high-frequency applications including switching-mode power supplies (SMPS) and resonant circuits. It describes skin effect and proximity effect in detail to provide you with a sound understanding of high-frequency phenomena. As well as this, you will discover thorough coverage on:integrated inductors and the self-capacitance of inductors and transformers, with expressions for self-capacitances in magnetic components;criteria for selecting the core material, as well as core shape and size, and an evaluation of soft ferromagnetic materials used for magnetic cores;winding resistance at high frequencies;expressions for winding and core power losses when non-sinusoidal inductor or transformer current waveforms contain harmonics.Case studies, practical design examples and procedures (using thearea product methodand thegeometry coefficient method)are expertly combined with concept-orientated explanations and student-friendly analysis. Supplied at the end of each chapter are summaries of the key concepts, review questions, and problems, the answers to which are available in a separate solutions manual.Such features make this a fantastic textbook for graduates, senior level undergraduates and professors in the area of power electronics in addition to electrical and computer engineering. This is also an inimitable reference guide for design engineers of power electronics circuits, high-frequency transformers and inductors in areas such as (SMPS) and RF power amplifiers and circuits.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

My mom told me the most difficult form of poetry to write is a sonnet. So I wrote one. The sonnet quickly became my outlet for all those adolescent emotions. My collection of sonnets now exceeds 160. What makes the sonnet so difficult is the iambic pentameter. (It's also not easy to keep a cohesive piece when rhyme is required.) The iambic pentameter became a strong focus for me, and by December of 2009, I didn't want my sonnets to be the only place for such a lovely meter. That's when I began writing Storytale. A novel with iambic pentameter woven throughout. I graduated college in the winter of 2008, so only three years removed from college, I work full time and take care of my family: wife and three boys.", "related": ["B00I344DMQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Most readers know me as the author of the \"Weddings by Bella\" series from Revell Publishing. Long before I penned that comedic series, I spent my days writing traditional inspirational romances like the one you will find in the Texas Weddings collection. These aren't as laugh-outloud funny as the Bella books, (and were never meant to be), but I truly believe the stories will inspire and uplift you! Why so many wedding-themed books, you ask? Well, if you've followed my publishing career for any length of time, you know that I'm the mother of four daughters. All four of them got married within four years of each other. Wowza! What blissful chaos! Many of our adventures became fodder for my wedding-themed books, which is why you see so many of them from me! Oh, and the whole \"Texas\" thing. . .well, that's a given! I'm a Texas girl through and through, y'all. I've lived in the Houston area most of my life.

Research has demonstrated that children who feel safe and cared for are predisposed to learning, and Patty O’Grady’s book provides readers with the tools to provide this care.” (Bev Dekker, The Society for Safe and Caring Schools & Communities)“There is a growing consensus in thoughtful schools about the advantages of incorporating ‘positive psychology’ into teaching and learning.  Now we have a guide to implementing this approach at the earliest stages. This book is a must-read for parents and teachers who seek guidance in finding a student's strengths rather than focusing on learning deficiencies.” (Patrick F. Bassett, President, National Association of Independent Schools)“Positive Psychology in the Elementary School Classroomprovides a thorough examination of neuroscience research, educational theory, and teaching strategies that can be combined to produce a school climate that helps children grow both cognitively and emotionally. In addition to explaining the science behind the connection between emotional and academic competence, this book also teaches the reader about specific classroom activities that will enable children to develop confidence and enjoy an ‘accomplished life.’” (Cheryl Scott Williams, Executive Director, Learning First Alliance)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Education & Teaching", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Increasingly we were living in a Post Christian culture.  It is a culture in which people used to go to church, used to believe the Bible and used to be Christian in their outlooks and understanding.  But that is no longer the case.  A new generation had grown up with a Darwinian worldview.  The more I laboured at sharing the gospel the more I realised that we spoke a different language and certainly viewed the workd in different ways.  The Chrsitian worldview can be defined in terms of a five fold platform:1.  Creation2.  Fall.3.  Redemption.4.  Sanctification.5.  Glorification.This defines who I am and my worldview.  I am created in the image of God... not some ingenious animal who has simply learned to communicate and walk on two legs... an accidental assemblage of molecules.  I live in a fallen world and have bought into the fall by making bad choices myself.  I am a fallen man living in a fallen world.  Hence I need locks on my door, pin numbers for my bank cards, and an alarm on my car.  I live in a world where people might at any time seek to deprive me of what I have and accumulate stuff for themselves.  This too is part of my identity.  But thanks be to God I have experienced the redemption which is to be found in Christ.  I could not appreciate the concept of redemption unless I understand thte concept of the fall.  Sin exists.  I am guilty.  Hence I need the redemption that only Christ can bring.  This too is an important ingredient of my identity.  I am created.  I am fallen.  I am redeemed.  My whole world is now expressed in terms of the process of becoming more like Jesus (sanctification) and going on to a heavenly home (glorification).  Hence my identity is summed up in these truths.Darwinian worldview is the antithesis of all of this.  I am not created in God's image, I am an improbable accident.  There is no meaning to my life.  There is no direction.  There is no purpose.  And one day I will dissassemble and be only a memory.How does the Christian communicate with those who are raised in the midst of indoctrination into the Darwinian model?  I wrestled with this before finally arriving at the series of chapters in the book which deal with introducing people to Christ in the Word.  Centering on the book of John we see Jesus in the seven signs recorded by the Apostle.The book ends with a series of chapters based on discussions I have had in Bible studies in the homes of seekers.  Each chapter has a the same form of title... I Believe Because....I hope and pray you will find this exremely helpful.  That was my purpose in writing.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

When Joshua's father dies in a suspicious plane crash in Mexico, the 13-year-old flies across the Atlantic to investigate. Explanatory passages mix neatly into the action, and readers put the pieces together along with Josh, who narrates in the present tense. Background information is clearly explained, and ancient Maya prophecies of world disaster in the year 2012 play a central role. Eventually Joshua discovers a secret society that has remained hidden for centuries. In an appealing twist, the members are not just keepers of ancient traditions they're high-tech geniuses with airplanes so cool they resemble UFOs. The story zips along as Josh survives high-speed chases by car, airplane, and boat along with various threats from spies, agents, witches, and crocodiles. With everything that's going on, there's not much room for character development. Joshua is engaging enough, but his relationships with the two friends who accompany him, the mother he leaves in England, and his newly discovered sister are not especially convincing. Occasional stiff dialogue and plot contrivances are barely noticeable because there are so many intriguing ideas and exciting scenes to keep the pages turning. Josh's quest for an ancient codex reaches a satisfying ending in this first book in the series, and at the same time builds anticipation for further revelations in sequels to come.Steven Engelfried, Wilsonville Public Library, ORCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We have all published in various ways - independently, with traditional publishers, or by combining both methods. No matter how published, we have two things in common - a love of writing and an independent spirit. We live in various parts of the world and come from a variety of backgrounds. Originally, we gathered together to create one anthology. The experience was so enjoyable that many of us decided to continue together to create more anthologies. We believe that together we can make a difference not only in each other's lives, but in the world. All proceeds from the various Indie Chicks Anthologies go to charitable organizations. We hope you will visit us at the Indie Chicks Cafe - our website where you will find not only all of our books, but where you can also find all of us hanging out and blogging about various topics close to our hearts. www.indiechickscafe.com", "related": ["B005NR6TFU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Though the novel is replete with the usual criminal atrocities, the most flagrant crime is committed by the authors themselves--against the English language. When Susi Haverford and her husband are gunned down at their wedding reception by members of the notorious DeSanto crime family, Miles Haverford, Susi's brother, determines to retaliate. He heads to Japan to find Nagoya, leader of the Yakuza, the only mobsters capable of destroying the DeSantos clan. Originally a spoiled, feckless WASP, Miles is transformed into a fierce warrior of the Yakuza, whose greatest challenge is to survive the pathological hatred of Sato, Nagoya's heir apparent. Sato is jealous of the American's influence with the other warriors, not to mention his fiancee, the porcelain-complexioned--what else?--Tomiko.This situation occasions the most bizarre episode in the novel--a brawl in a heap of manure. Afterward, Miles returns to New York to lead the Yakuza against the DeSanto mob and the fun begins: heads are decapitated, arrows fly, necks are snapped, knives with oriental tassels are thrown at the faces of unsuspecting mafiosi, hands chop spinal cords. The final shoot-out in Central Park is a muddled orgy of mindless bloodletting. The authors ( High Priest ) display a tenuous understanding of Japanese culture, and their stereotypical portrayal of Italian mobsters makes this novel a study in banality.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 27.0}

First, I spent many adventurous summers in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, Central America. We went horseback riding at my Grandfather’s farm; whitewater rafting and rock climbing in Nicaragua; we played with firecrackers purchased in local mercaditos; we ate fruit pops bought from a man in a straw cowboy hat, pushing an icebox on wheels with an old bell dangling from a string; I learned to dance meringue at a beach-side dance hall in Telamar; and explored a bat cave in the Mayan ruins. All of these events made an incredible impression on me.  Second, fate had it that I stumbled across a collection of youth fiction during my childhood (such as the Hardy Boys & Nancy Drew mysterys) which piqued my interest. Later on, over the years, I migrated to reading romance, thriller, and suspense novels. Then there are the other texts which were required reading in college, a list that included everything from the classics by Homer to the contemporary works of Philip Roth.  I knew I wanted to be a writer early on, but I wanted to first LIVE the experiences I would write about. Third, I inherited my mother’s sensitivity. She’s very emotional and very sentimental. I am just the same. I don’t even know another guy who could be touched by a good hallmark card the way that I get affected. I am an emotional person. Have you seen the movie The Holiday starring Jude Law? That’s me! I’m like that character, really!  I started writing poetry after high school, during my college days. But I was mainly interested in writing, producing music back then. I was also busy on the acting front. I did however publish my first poem in an anthology by the National Library of Poetry called After the Storm. The poem is called Above the Sea. Okay, so that’s my background and motivation for becoming a writer. There’s still my professional/business background. If you want to be a writer/entrepreneur, then you need literary and business skills, right? Profession As a certified English Teacher I had the ability to hone my craft, as well as the time to be creative. I also spent 10 years in the real estate industry, mainly working in Miami, which has given me a pipeline of material to tap into for future writings.  As an actor, I was fortunate to star in an indie film at the age of 21. The last television series I worked on was Burn Notice (as an extra).", "related": ["B00K6LW0RO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Joan Mauch does a splendid job\nof painting the picture of Ellie's life and just how disconnected she\nfeels towards her mother and sister.The way Joan Mauch illustrates the progression of Ellie's anger in the\naftermath of the shooting is brilliant. She highlights the changes to\ncome within Ellie as she imagines herself performing brutal acts of\nviolence on her mother, her sister, and her \"ill-behaved brats\" and even\n a general killing spree. Her thoughts darken the more she allows\nherself to put up with the abuse from those around her. She realizes the\n only way to avoid succumbing to these dark thoughts is to flee her\nhometown of Hummerly. After trotting around for a few days, Ellie makes\nher way to Halifax.

You can get around this by making the guy entertainingly cranky or eccentric or by giving him a fascinating nemesis. But Oliver simply presents a hard-luck case named Jack Starr and invites readers to slowly warm to him as a series of misfortunes bring new meaning to his life. It's a risky gambit, but it ultimately pays off in a low-key way. When Jack gets out of prison in 1972 after killing his critically ill wife, he finds himself 62 years old and without friends or family. His hometown, Spokane, Washington, is gearing up for the Expo '74 World's Fair, and there's little left of the old city he remembers. But when he finds a murder weapon while working as a security guard, Jack becomes both a prime suspect and the only man determined to crack the case. Demonstrating a firm grasp of Spokane history, Oliver turns the city into the book's most compelling character.Frank SennettCopyright © American Library Association.

If you can relate, you will be understand many of the situations I write about. If you can't relate, I'm very happy for you! At some point in your life either you or a family member will be touched by this awful disease; Sustain Me: Notes on Cancer may encourage you when that time comes. Above all, there is hope. There is ALWAYS hope. Physically there are good things being done within medicine,andwonderful results being seen through the proper use of nutrition. One of my personal hopes is that medicine and nutrition will become better friends so that patients like myself don't have to forge their own trail to blend the best and avoid the worst of both worlds. Trial and error is painful when it involves your body. It should not be up to patients to need to fight to get the medical community to acknowledge and embrace and interpret how nutrition can drastically alter the odds, even change the odds, for successful treatment and lasting good results (or even just a better quality of life lived with cancer) when it is properly applied.

Sophia wakes up in a cabin in the woods with a woman who is convinced that she is her dead daughter, Ruthie. The woman's three sons concur, especially the eldest, Gabriel. Soon, Sophia realizes that Gabriel intends to molest her the way he molested his real sister. Meanwhile, Cole's flashbacks to the accident lead him to believe that he was the victim of attempted murder, his family may still be alive, and it is up to him to save them. Dove delivers a well-paced, albeit overly complicated, thriller. Readers will shudder at Gabriel's sinister behavior and find themselves on the edge of their seats as Cole races against time. And while there are elements that will stretch reader patience, many will be willing to overlook them as they get caught up in the gripping story.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 16, "rating_average": 4.6875, "rating_total": 75.0}

In summary, this book is timely, useful, well thought out and well presented. It contains lots of useful knowledge.

What do we tell our children? What stories do we pass along so they know their history? These questions permeate Yale historian Holloway's riveting account of how we see, study, and learn about racial identity, and how we acquire the memories that shape that identity. Holloway (Confronting the Veil) surveys the social, political, and cultural milieu of race in the latter half of the 20th century, from a review of various sociologists' perspectives and the controversies surrounding them in light of the explosion of social science literature in the 1940s, to the role played by the Johnson family of magazines, the impact of 1960s documentaries, and the development of Black Studies programs in the 1970s. He visits American plantations, museums, and other important sites before taking his research to places such as Ghana and Liverpool. The book is noteworthy for the clarity with which Holloway treats historical events and persons buried in ephemera, and for its abundance of detail. Part jargon-free academic treatise and pertinent personal memoir, the result is an evocative bildungsroman in which we see the social scientist as a young man become the provocative historian. 18 illus.

Writing was set aside as she married and began a family.  It was because of family members who had to spend long hours in the hospital that Linda took up the pen.  Over the next 10 years she wrote short stories for children to entertain her own family as well as others who were hospitalized.  During this time she gave most of her stories away to parents, teachers and friends   She would write one night, read it the next day at the hospital, and give it away to someone who had been touched or wanted to share it with someone else.   Challenges of being a single mother, working and supporting family members fought for her time, but at the request of some acquaintances at work, Linda wrote down some thoughts about how she managed from day to day given the trials they saw her facing regularly.  Shortly before agreeing to take custody of three of her grandchildren, she wrote a short story with the hope of encouraging self-esteem in one of her granddaughters.  Since then Linda has completed twenty more stories about Princess Jelisa.    Linda currently lives in Salt Lake City with a daughter and granddaughter.  She is active in her church and community.  When she is not thinking about what she wishes she had the time to write about, she enjoys painting, playing the piano, singing and being with her grandchildren.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Larry Brill's anachronistic tale mixes Georgian-era ribaldry, contemporary references, comedy, and a double-crossing liasion with provocative secondary themes of literacy, celebrity, and the public's appetite for misfortune.On its surface, The Patterer is an entertaining roast of the televised news industry and itsmoral bankruptcy. More profoundly, the novel is an imaginative look at the power of continualforward movement. Leeds embodies the entrepreneurial spirit with memorable panache.--ForeWord Reviews MagazineAs I read this book I found myself laughing out loud on about every page. The story takes place in 1765 with our main character, Leeds Merriweather, working as a patterer for the London Tattler-Tribune. A patterer, at least in this case, is a writer and seller of papers, with the motto that good patterers \"...never, never let facts get in the way of a good story.\" Author, Larry Brill, shows his tongue-in-cheek sense of humor throughout the book.-- Portland Book ReviewsHoly Hilarity Batman! If you are looking for a rowdy romp around England, look no further than The Patterer by Larry Brill. From the very first page you are scandalized, embarrassed, laughing out loud, and (dare I say) intrigued.

It's not made up.What lies out there in the unseen world that is able to interact with our world. With our lives and not in pleasant ways. Able to manifest itself to us in a real physical manner as real as everything else and get into our heads in a hidden way that makes us question our very sanity.We pretend we didn't see the shadow move in the corner of our eye.

It seemed only fitting that the wonderful events she experienced and the places she visited on these journeys be recorded for history. Thus, her story telling skills began. Firstly, to Rupert Bear, her lifelong companion, and then to a host of imaginary friends and finally to her pet dog once the family finally set down roots in Australia.  Each book Susan creates encourages and promotes the wonderful art of story-telling with organic illustrations that reach to the very essence of the reader portraying similar character traits that their pets share. Susan lives with her family and her dogs, in particular, Rocky the Border collie and Stella, the blind dog.  She is a canine behaviorist and spends her time writing and illustrating; training and counselling dogs and being bossed around by the family cat, Speed Bump Charlie.", "related": [], "rank": 3895481, "title": "Speed Bump Charlie's ABC", "author": "Susan Day", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However I have made a decision to identify my name as such! Selig is not a name I hide behind, for it is simple an author name. My real identity is as irrelevant as I have turned out to be in some people’s lives.  Irrelevant until now; no longer will I remain in the shadows as if my life has no meaning or purpose. Finally there is a mighty purpose for my existence. My birth has been to tell the world there is a higher power so great; the 7 great wonders on this earth are of truly no comparison.  I witness to you a higher power that controls the wind, the seas, the sun and the moon. I witness a higher power that controls every word that is written in my testimony of Sin Committed by Simple Confusion, Catastrophic Collision, and Struggle. I witness Sin is real, committed by thought and action of myself and others.  Many years as a Son, Father and Husband, I didn’t understand the true power of deliverance, obedience and forgiveness. I lived as such a man. I embraced such people in my life. That of course is a distant memory in my life for the most part. There is obviously a small part of me left that is fighting for my salvation! The same part of me that remembers the lessons my father and mother imposed on me as a child and young adult. My parents implemented Values and Morals so deep within me, it blossomed just the season I needed it most. It blossomed just as Satan made a final attempt to destroy the little in me left of spiritual sanity.   Sin Committed by Simple Confusion, Catastrophic Collision, and Struggle is not written for the intent or purpose to make any public attacks on anyone. They are rather ironic situations I personally experienced in sin, and my plight to rectify the time I have remaining on this earth. I attempt to rectify my life by glorifying Gods word,  I once failed to understand as: Luke 6:26-28 tells us: 26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak good of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets. 27 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you. 28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.

I have provided career and business content to Fortune 500 companies, such as Citibank and Hearst, been published internationally by Cambridge University Press, by universities, military academies, medical and business societies, and financial organizations in Australia, India, and Saudi Arabia and translated into Mandarin Chinese, reaching a Chinese audience of more than two million. I also served as financial news editor for Hearst’s MoneyMinded.com/Woman.com. I am a past member of the Board of Directors of the National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO-San Antonio); am active with the White House project, whose mission is to encourage women’s participation in politics and to place women in the pipeline to reach the highest offices in the United States. I am active with Win With Women, National Democratic Institute, Washington, DC. to promote women in political leadership in 65 countries and various organizations supporting the increased use and funding of technology. I attended Wellesley College and graduated from Columbia University with a degree in writing. I come from a *very* entrepreneurial family and was, for many years, a serial entrepreneur myself, always looking for a new horizon to explore. The latest horizon has been the dawning of the Internet, which I migrated to and set up a tent, shortly after Netscape came out with the browser in 1994. (As those of you involved with the Internet know, in Net time, that is somewhat equivalent to when the dinosaurs were crawling out of the swamps. I have many interesting stories from those wild and woolly pioneer days.) For the past 18 years, I’ve been working on the Internet. I’m all about building community and making work faster and easier by using less money, more brain power, automation, and smart outsourcing. I hope this book will help you do the same.", "related": ["B00HI0L8YC"], "rank": 1787416, "title": "The 20 Percent Solution", "author": "Gretchen Glasscock", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Of course, there will be some newcomers to this\nspinning rock who were not yet born or were not yet old enough to hear about\nme. For them, hi! Your parents, or whoever it is you are close with, should be\nable to give you a brief background on me, so I need not go into it now.Surrounding this letter\nare the crucified corpses of ten women. I found them all last night, nailed\nthem all to their current homes, and then planted them all in New England soil.\nI had a busy night last night, and I'm tired now. Had I thought this thing out\na bit more, I would have written this letter first, but if you bear with me, I\nthink I may be able to make some progress in educating you all on my goals.\nThis letter would have received no real traction if it wasn't combined with a\ndramatic display, thus the poor women who will need to be identified by their\nparents at morgues over the next few days. Fear not, they suffered little and\nwere not sexually harmed. In reality, their fate is going to be much better\nthan the people still surviving, than those reading this letter--whether that be\non a newscast or the Internet, it makes no difference.The FBI knows what I'm\nup to, they simply haven't made you aware of it. I've contacted them. I've told\nthem that this would happen if they did not get my message out to you all. They\nrefused. So, I've taken it into my hands. In a way, it's better. Now they know\nI'm not playing, and hopefully, you, dear citizen, know this is not a game as\nwell. Four years ago, I killed a handful of people. Ten years before that, I killed\nthe same number. Last night, I killed ten, and for no other purposethan to\nget your attention.I trust I have it now.The plan, what the FBI\nis refusing to tell you, is that within a month or two, all of you will be\ndead. There are Aborigines living in Australia who won't get the chance to see\nthis letter, but they too will be dead. Everything living on this Earth, from\nthe tiniest bacteria, to the largest mammal, all of it will die. You've all\nheard of the atom bomb, doubtlessly remember the devastation it caused in Japan\nlast century. I've found a way to create about one hundred billion, trillion of\nthose--and that's on the conservative side, really. You see, each one of you,\neach human being on this Earth has countless atoms inside themselves. If we could\npart one human from the energy inside his or her atoms, we could power cities\nfor years and years. I know how to do it. I'm including, with this note, a copy\nof the formulas I derived to accomplish it, with a few key parts redacted. No\nneed to give the governments of this oppressive planet any more firepower, as\nI'm sure you agree. The point here is that I have the knowledge, as well as the\ncapability, to harvest energy from human beings.Why would I want to do\nthat? Am I planning on stopping climate change? Ridding the world of fossil\nfuels? Ah, but then remember the paragraph above where I said I would kill you\nall?I'm going to use the\nenergy I extract from fifty-five humans (to be honest, I picked that number\nbecause that's all I could fit on the contraption I built to hold all of this\nenergy) and fire it at our sun. That life giving orb that we take for granted\nevery single day, the thing that allows the flowers to bloom and your babies to\nthrive. So what happens when I hit it with one hundred trillion suns of my own?\nI have two theories, but I lean (and hope) to the second. The first is that all\nof that energy in one place, at one time, causes the sun to contract massively\nand in the shortest of time you can imagine, before bursting out in a supernova.\nThat would mean we all die by fire about seven minutes later. I hope that\ndoesn't happen. I really do. The second option, and what I think is most\nlikely--though these things are never definite in cosmology--is that the sun\nsimply dies. All of the gasses in the ball are burnt up within a day or so, and\nnothing is left but a hardened rock.Then comes the fun part.For the next month, you\nwait it out. You hope that scientists can somehow figure out a way to live\nwithout the sun, and believe me, they'll be working furiously. They won't\nsucceed, however. The atmosphere will hold in much of the heat that the Earth\ncurrently has, but everything else stops. Plants die in a few days. Animals are\nblinded and die from thirst or starvation. Disease breaks out en masse across\nhumanity as they now lack the vitamin D needed to fight off infection. Within a\nmonth, everyone's dead.That's what I'm bringing\nto all of you.The world didn't want me\nto have my son. They thought it terrible that I wanted the cops who shot him,\nwho filled his young body with bullets, to pay with their lives so that he\ncould have his again. I wasn't asking for a lot. Justice. Maybe for some of you\nto look the other way while a father went and dealt with the people who had\nharmed his family. Four years ago, Allison Moore (who is one of the first four\nin my Death to the Sun plans, followed by her daughter, and the literary giant\nJeffrey Dillan/his girlfriend) decided that maybe I shouldn't have my wife\neither. She decided that my wife might be a good idea to take from me, and so\nshe did, first mentally, and then physically. This world left me with nothing\nbut my mind. You celebrated my achievements when I was formulating genetic\ntheories that halted aging. You celebrated my accomplishment when I created the\nfirst viable treatment for cancer that didn't cause the destruction of healthy\ncells in the human body. When I gave to you, you celebrated, but when I asked\nfor you to give back to me, you refused. You took everything I had and left me\nwith nothing.So, world, this will be\nmy gift to you. I will take everything. I will take your sons, your daughters,\nyour family, your futures. All of it belongs to me now, and I'm going to cast\nit all into eternal darkness, where nothing will ever rise again.Cheers, friends. Matthew Brand, Ph.D.", "related": ["B00JQPGPAE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
