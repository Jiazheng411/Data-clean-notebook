Noah isn't eager to take on new clients, but he's moved by Peter Pluto's pleas to find younger brother Linc, a college student, whose apartment turns out to contain a stash of guns. The tension escalates when Linc's neighbor is shot after being questioned by Noah. Soon after, Noah's untimely arrival at Peter's ransacked house in a quiet cul-de-sac irritates a couple of vicious skinheads. Noah awakes in a ravine, left for dead, and a bit too cozy with Peter Pluto's corpse. Later, accompanied by his pal Carter, conveniently six-foot-nine, Noah boldly wades into plenty of life-and-limb\"threatening situations, including verboten gang territory and a secluded skinhead gathering.

But the answer is right before our eyes. Invent a new tomorrow and change the rules!\" Basing their advice on five overarching principles (create your own future, utilize your connections, help others learn, help others succeed, and take ownership of your company and your life), Belasco and Stead offer readers a way to use these strategies to revitalize themselves and their organizations.--Howard Rothman", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a member of Mountain Rescue-Aspen, an elite group of volunteers dedicated to helping those lost, injured, or worse in the rugged terrain surrounding one of America's favorite alpine playgrounds, he knows what it means to risk one's own life to save another.  He understands the excitement that lures people to the mountains and has witnessed the deadly consequences of ill-conceived, or just plain unlucky, outings.InThe Falling Season, Clifford opens a window on the cliquish world of the \"adrenaline junkies\" drawn to the dangerous and heroic work of mountain rescue and offers first-hand accounts of actual emergencies.  \"I keep climbing, up toward a pile of rocks that is the 12,430-foot summit.  I look up again and see a body, 50 yards ahead. It is lying head downhill, face turned up to the sky....\"  In crafting his story, Clifford reconstructs tension-filled events and mixes them with a chronicle of the team's long and colorful history. He focuses on the formerly unfettered group's ongoing struggle with the constraints of a litigious society, increased media exposure, and ballooning government bureaucracy.  He attempts journalistic impartiality, but his personal involvement and emotional attachment show through, giving the story a powerful sense of urgency. Clifford possesses the technical skills, conditioning, and experience it takes to belong in Mountain Rescue-Aspen; fortunately for the reader, he happens to be a compelling writer as well.--George Laney", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Igo explores how changes in commerce, governance, culture, and the social sciences have converged to induce Americans to answer survey questions on everything from sexual practices to voting patterns. Igo draws on researchers' private papers to reveal how the Gallup poll, the Kinsey reports, and other studies and surveys have been formulated; the kind of undisclosed assumptions behind the surveys; and how conclusions are drawn from the responses. She begins by exploring how the detailed survey of Muncie, Indiana, in the 1920s and its transformation to \"Middletown,\" a representation of American averageness, changed broader American society. Igo also explores how Americans allow their behavior to be judged and influenced by the results of surveys, measuring themselves against studies showing that half of all marriages end in divorce and that most Americans support the death penalty. Igo brings historical perspective and a critical eye to surveys and the creation of the notion of a mass public.Vanessa BushCopyright © American Library Association.

When banking tycoon/philanthropist/political aspirant Paddy Power dies on the eve of an economic conference he's called in Kerry, his doctor cries murder, and head of the Irish homicide squad middle-aged, first-time father McGarr is put in charge. Rumors of scandal are whipped up with the appearance of portions of Power's diary. A wealth of suspects includes Power's ex-partner at Eire Bank; his perfectionist assistant/ex-lover; his coarse, melodramatic physician; and his ex-wife, an Eire Bank shareholder. Plot twists abound--one turns on a mass political assassination. But the main joy is Gill's distinctive voice and viewpoints: \"What good is it being Irish . . . if you can't make fun of the little you allow yourself to know of the rest of the world.\" With some lovely set pieces--a rural funeral feast, for one--Gill gives us a sympathetic, warts-and-all glimpse of Ireland and lifts his latest above more commonplace novels in the genre.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Before he dies, Lord Kensu tells his son that his bodyguard will now be responsible for his upbringing. Jimmu spends the next seven years learning the art of the samurai at Nichiren's side, with the sole intention of avenging his father by killing Lord Ankan, the man Nichiren blames for betraying Lord Kensu and taking from Jimmu all that was rightfully his. Jimmu reports to Mitsukage Castle under the pretense of wanting to work for Lord Ankan, and, impressing the captain of the guard with his swordsmanship, is allowed to stay. But as Jimmu gets to know Lord Ankan, he finds him to be a principled and courageous leader rather than the monster that Nichiren described. Complicating matters further, Jimmu is drawn to Lord Ankan's impetuous daughter. The resulting story is an honest and engaging portrayal of a young man's struggle to do the right thing—even when it is not clear what that is. The cast of characters includes Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga, two renowned military leaders from the Sengoku period. The vivid depictions of a soldier's life in 16th-century Japan will captivate samurai enthusiasts, and the amount of action that Matthews packs into this relatively short novel will appeal to reluctant readers.—Kim Dare, Fairfax County Public Schools, VACopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The central relevance for Millbank of the Lubac's account of the history of the supernatural lies in its potential to address the crucial turning point in Radical Orthodoxy's account of intellectual history. (...) To those already persuaded, the case is strengthened by his careful narration of the differences and continuities between pre-modern, modern and postmodern theology, the clear implication of the impossibility of any simple retrieval of pre-modern forms of theological expression, and his commitment to the cultural embeddedness of Christianity.\" Russell Re Manning, TLS, September 1 2006.\"Millbank argues that de Lubac's position does not in fact 'undermine the foundations of Catholic doctrine', but is on the contrary more radically true to Aquinas and Thomist critics and others. For all the highly technical nature of Millbank's argument, at its heart is no matter of purely internal theological dispute. Millbank's claim is that the autonomy of 'pure nature', which de Lubac denies but which the bulk of modern and postmodern western thinking takes for granted, 'is likely to result in joyless disciplinary programs for the maximizing of corporeal efficiency, and in the long run in nihilistic cults of individual and collective power' (p.21), to which might be added that a theology of grace detached from created nature is likely for its part to result in one variety or another of religious authoritarianism, making the questions at issue here deeply important to both Church and world today.\" Michael Kitchener, St Boswells, Theology, Nov/Dec 2006.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Combining oral histories with political analysis, Stern (chair of the history department at the University of Wisconsin at Madison) commendably delves into the stories of Chileans who supported Pinochet as well as of the families of his government's victims. Arguing that memory plays a key role in struggles for political and cultural legitimacy, he studies how individual memories compete for a place in the formation of a deeply symbolic, collective memory. Memory, he contends, functions within multiple frameworks: salvation, rupture, persecution and awakening. Nonspecialists at times may be frustrated by Stern's cursory references to related academic studies, yet overall he makes a serviceable effort to write for a general audience. In light of the recent revelations of American human rights abuses of Iraqi prisoners, his insights into the legacies of torture and abuse in the Chilean prisons of the 1970s certainly have contemporary significance for any society that undergoes a national trauma.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Chaos-on-wheels and flat-broke filmmaker Mimi joins the crowd gathering on the street outside his brownstone, tiny video camera in hand. A stylish slasher film earned her some cachet, but she�s now desperate. Her dealer-lover has vanished, and she�s out of cocaine. Her intractable 14-year-old daughter has left her father to move in with Mimi and her dying dog, and Mimi�s alcoholic brother, Carmelo, is certain that their cousin Agnes, an illegal immigrant, has been murdered. Time to call on Mimi�s wealthy, gin-besotted cokehead neighbor across the hall. Eleanor, 80, is a reclusive cult writer infamous for her lesbian erotica. Mourning the death of her lover, Yvonne, a famous painter, she is surprised to be experiencing a modest revival. As angry, foulmouthed, and jittery Mimi runs amok and Eleanor confronts the obdurate facts of old age, Hagedorn flashes back to their traumatic pasts of ostracism and political violence. Out of jump cuts and close-ups, Hagedorn has composed a jazzy, stingingly smart tragicomedy of toxic substances, hate, and delusions; hustle and creativity; obsession and passion. --Donna Seaman", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This million-pound production, with some of Britain's finest actors was released at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991.His extensive esoteric works are said to be the largest collection in the produced by a living author. He has written over 100 books and his list of audio tapes extends to include 400 live lectures given around the world.His books are now being translated into the 7 European languages.Douglas Baker has led the field in esoteric astrology, producing with a team, his magnum opus, a Dictionary of Astrology for the 21st Century in three volumes. This is in addition to the already existing 11 volume set of text books on the same subject.His most recent production is a comprehensive video course on Esoteric Astrology which explores the impact of astrology on all aspects of life and consciousness in a new and unique fashion, full of relevance to the modern and future world.He is presently engaged in research work extending the discovereis in the field of Occult Chemistry, particularly dwelling on background radiation and special characteristics of the carbon atom and the role it plays in organic chemistry. He is also looking into the esoteric factors related to weightessness in space physiology.His previous research into the Akashic Records is well know and documented.

He is a graduate of Georgetown University. Kit’s interest in religious exploration started as a result of being a confirmed Episcopalian attending a Catholic University. 40 years ago non-Catholics had to take courses in comparative cultures replacing the non elective courses taught in Theology.  Georgetown University provides a fabulous backdrop for historical and geographical connections with the U.S. Government. In the Georgetown Cypher, Kit poses many questions about the relationship of the University to The U. S. Government and more serious ones about an alternate non religious message by Jesus and his followers. Kit has begun work on a series of Thrillers featuring Ian MacAlester and Father Xavier Cortez that explore the many aspects of guided meditation and the tremendous benefits that can be achieved by its practice.", "related": [], "rank": 1794624, "title": "The Georgetown Cypher (Book I)", "author": "Kit McKittrick", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In this Kindle Single, Gunn sheds light on a more personal side of his life, revisiting his childhood and recounting what it was like to grow up with an obsessive-compulsive father. Not wanting to follow in his father's footsteps (though he has his father to thank for his penchant for suits), Gunn struggled to overcome his own OCD tendencies and demons, including a failed suicide attempt. It becomes clear that his rise to the top was not an easy one, making the man he grew up to be even more impressive. --Shirley Hong", "related": ["B005Y27VLU"], "rank": 635989, "title": "Shaken, Not Stirred (Kindle Single)", "author": "Tim Gunn", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 60.0}

He was encouraged at an early age to write by his English teacher and went on to read English at Birmingham University. While an undergraduate, he started to develop the radio play format for which he first became known. At the age of twenty-one he sold a play to the BBC and continued to write following his graduation while working as a stockbroker’s clerk. In 1938, by this time writing full time, he created the character Paul Temple, a crime novelist and detective. With Steve Trent, a Fleet Street journalist and later his wife, Temple solved numerous crimes. Durbridge’s style was very much in the mode of the earlier Golden Age middle-class amateur detectives. The first book,Send for Paul Temple, was written along with John Thewes as the novelization of a radio serial. Many others followed and they were hugely successful until the last of the series was completed in 1968.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The range of inquiry is enormous. Burns, Schlozman and Verba delve not only into political activity but also into the processes in the family, in the workplace, in places of worship, and in voluntary associations that promote and inhibit political involvement. This book goes beyond the literature in connecting to an enormous range of scholarship in political science, economics, and sociology. This is a fine piece of work.--John Mark Hansen, University of ChicagoThe Private Roots of Public Actionis a very important book. It pushes research on gender and participation to a whole new level, and reshapes the agenda as far as our thinking and our research about the connections among family life, the workplace, institutions of civil society, and political and governmental institutions. The authors demonstrate the importance of understanding political participation within a larger context in a way that does justice to the complexity of people's lives.--Kristi Anderson, Syracuse UniversityThe Private Roots of Public Actionis an important contribution to the literature on both political participation and gender politics. Because of its database, its tie-in to the most current work on political participation, and its comprehension of important current questions about gender politics, this book provides a new benchmark for work in this field. In particular, the Civic Voluntarism model developed by Verba, Schlozman, and Brady, and the consideration of how gender difference and inequality might feed into that model, is a unique contribution. This accessible book will be welcomed by gender politics scholars and will have an impact on the field of political participation.--Virginia Sapiro, University of Wisconsin-MadisonThe Private Roots of Public Actionbegins with common explanations for the gender difference in participation, from domestic demands on women's time and psychic space through the effects of the patriarchal family, socioeconomic hierarchies, and political socialization...The results of [this] novel analysis are complex and interesting...The authors extend their model to examine the relationship between class, race or ethnicity, and political participation. This unique and accessible volume will be influential in the fields of political socialization and gender and politics. Strongly recommended.--B. E.

I was given an opportunity to write a review of it. So I got to read it. The pages and cover seemed unturned. Maybe I was the first to open this copy. For a book lover like me, a new book is as irresistible as catnip to a you-know-what.    Spirits of the Mighty Oaks, by Mary Jane Fitch Peltier, is a small book full of big surprises. Adorning the front cover is a dramatic photograph of a large live oak, inviting the reader to assume that this is going to be about oak trees, with some history of these magnificent icons of the South with personal anecdotes about living among them. I was the reader who assumed. And I was wrong. The is a series of character sketches about people who were either born and reared here in the Deep South where live oaks grow, or found themselves lured by the mystique of Cajun people, their culture, and the almost last-frontier feeling of Gulf Coast wetland. It doesn't hurt to mention the attraction of arguably the best food, the best music, and the best inborn hospitality in the world.   There is quite a variety. Both genders are represented, Cajuns and outsiders, rich and poor. While neither God nor Satan have speaking parts, the power and influence of both are manifest as influencing the characters and the plot. Cajun Al is the star. Peltier's book follows the long life of Cajun Al, until it turns into unforgettable memories.    First impressions: A personal quirk if mine is wanting to know why a book is written, and there are always several possibilities, often working together. Writing is often its own inspiration, almost a calling. Writers must express themselves, and if they are wise, choose something that moves them and is deemed important enough to need to share it with the world. At the very end, on pages 220 and 221 (you have to count them yourself; the pages aren't numbered), is a brief rationale written by Peltier herself. Living in Abbeville during her teenage years, she writes, she and her family visited friends in nearby Erath. There she met and got to know Mr. Alphe Peltier, whose sense of freedom, courage \"to tell it like it is\" blended with compassion and understanding.    Later, she married into the Peltier family, resulting in long association with the man she refers to as Cajun Al. Now in retirement (she was \" the first female patrolman of Erath\"), she reminisced about Cajun Al, and \"how it was a miracle that he survived everything life threw at him, \"with neither bitterness nor any grudge. Spirits of the Mighty Oaks is written about his life, augmented by an extraordinary cast of supporting characters, mostly real and some imagined. Here, the deceptively simple skills of storyteller are employed very effectively. If the author were a painter, she might be using bright colors, sharp contrasts, and Magic Markers. Any reader would recognize and appreciate a skill level of her caliber, however applied.    The book could only have been written by a native to Cajun Land. No one from outside could have added the many details of Cajun life, what it was like to scratch a living from an often hostile land, what Cajuns liked to do in their spare time, and how it was to cope with occasional banker, clergy, and politician whose motive and power-hungry drives made them on a par with the mosquitoes, alligators and cottonmouths.    There is little subtlety in the narration. There is never any doubt in the reader's mind what the people are like, what forces drive them, both the good and the not so good assembly of traits that make up the human personality. They are presented chronologically in the from of chapters, and then interact with each other, working out their individual destinies. Warts and all.   Take some of the stories from \"Les Miserables\" by Victor Hugo, add some of the heroic struggles of poor Odysseus struggling ten years to get back to home and family in Homer's \"Odyssey.\" Then blend in a healthy shot of Tobasco Sauce and stir gently.    There is sophisticated duality in comments scattered throughout the book. Her character Armade`ous was a smuggler with enemies, one of whom was also his friend Paul Ed. He was loyal to this \"friendly enemy\" while aware that Paul Ed stole from him, lied about him, and coveted his wife. Eventually Paul Ed poisoned him and stole his wife.    \"Each of us looks in a mirror every day, writes Peltier about human nature. \"If we were to place a divider between the left and right side of our faces we would notice a difference. One side has the look of a lighthearted, pleasant person and one side has the look of a heavy hearted angry person. This serves as a constant reminder that good and evil exist within each of us.\"   A storyteller's hyperbole emerges here and there, as with Asa Ifanee, the young man from Philadelphia who, from reading about Cajuns, became a \"Cajun-wanna-be\" and moved to Louisiana. He \"trained\" to be a barber by buying scissors and other equipment. No mirror, because he rightly thought that his first haircuts might be too bad to look at. His first customer was Cajun Al. The result looked like \"the mark of the beast.\" Cajun Al had to go hide in the swamps until his hair grew back. It was a tribute to Al's kindness that he continued to patronize the little barber until he improved. The book has rough edges, departures from standard English spelling, punctuation and grammar, which as a copy editor, I find distracting. Still, that technique could be intentional; after all, it worked for Mark Twain. It adds immediacy, and even urgency, to the narration.    Scattered throughout is first class art work which enhances the mood, especially with old, faded photos and shots of nature. The contents seem to reach out and tug at your arm, as is the Cajun way of maintaining you attention. And the format, that gives the book a feeling of a draft emerging from a carefully archived old shoe box of memories, clippings, and even a few souvenirs will, I hope, affect other readers the same way it affected me. At first the book was hard to get into. Later, it proved impossible to get out of without finishing. The author is a very good storyteller; I read several of the best parts more than once.\" --Abbeville Meridional (Duncan Boutwell copy editor)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Placing his hand on the small of her back, he urged her toward the staircase.Elizabeth looked up at him, her protest poised on the tip of her tongue when she saw the lust in his eyes. But that wasn't what gave her pause; it was the glimmer of satisfaction in making her wary and nervous.By God, heknewshe wasn't about to just let him have his way with her. Certainly not before they married. So what was his game?\"And is that where you hope to seduce me?\" Her parents would be appalled had they heard her. She was astonished anything in that vein was able to pass her lips.Lord Creswell didn't respond until they reached the first door on the third floor. No doubt a bed was on the other side of that door.He turned to her. \"If I may be frank, Miss Smith...Elizabeth.\" He spoke her name, soft and low, and somehow her name on his lips sounded more intimate than a kiss. \"I am a man who likes to leave nothing to chance. If I am to court and marry you in such unfashionable haste, I would like some assurance that you and I suit when it comes to the intimacies of the marriage bed.\"At his words, lust in its most pure form accosted her. Parts of her went soft while other parts became rigid, pinpoints of pleasure to come.No. No. No. There would be no pleasure of any sort. Not for her and definitely none for the viscount.\"So you would like us to have marital relations outside the sanctity of marriage?\" she asked in a voice she barely recognized. \"You've been so skittish of late. If I hadn't already kissed you, I think you didn't like to be touched. When I marry, it'll be for life and I have no desire to saddle myself with a wife who cannot perform satisfactory in that area.\" Lord Creswell turned, his back to her as he faced the chamber door. But on his face, she glimpsed the barest hint of smile.So that was how he thought to get around marrying her. He thought she'd cry off, refusing to enter his philistine game of sampling the goods.For several long seconds, Elizabeth said nothing, allowing him to believe she was grappling in indecision. His hand released its grasp on the handle of the door and he straightened as if ready to claim victory.\"Very well, if that's what it will take to ease your mind--ease both our minds--let us proceed. But I must have your assurance that once we've established that we suit, um, in that way, we will immediately announce our betrothal and set a wedding date.\"Elizabeth took great satisfaction in watching Lord Creswell's entire form stiffen and his hand still in mid-air. Slowly, he angled his head over his shoulder to regard her, incredulity flashing briefly in the  blue-green depths of his eyes. \"You are in agreement?\"Feigning the stalwartness of that of a virgin about to be sacrificed for the good of God and country, Elizabeth gave a tremulous but firm nod.\"And if we do not suit, what then?\"Did his voice sound a mite strained?\"I have a feeling we shall suit very well.\" She gave him a slow smile. \"Shall we proceed, my lord?\"", "related": ["B00APT8BDE"], "rank": 3578, "title": "All's Fair in Love & Seduction (The Elusive Lords, Book 2.5)", "author": "Beverley Kendall", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 156, "rating_average": 3.8974, "rating_total": 608.0}

After the First World War, however, he gave up legal work in favor of writing full time. He went on to complete some thirty books ranging from light-hearted farce to adventure thrillers. The Berry series established Yates’ reputation as a writer of witty, upper-crust romances, and he was also very successful with the thriller genre though the character Richard Chandos. As a consequence of his education and experience, Yates’ books encompass the genteel life—a nostalgic glimpse at Edwardian decadence and a number of swindling solicitors, and he regularly featured in bestseller lists and was greatly admired by both readers and fellow authors.", "related": [], "rank": 1847381, "title": "She Fell Among Thieves (Richard Chandos)", "author": "Dornford Yates", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She swallowed quickly and kept her mouth open, her tongue extended. His briny taste and soft sighs egged her on. She enjoyed the hungry look she knew she had inspired in him. He was missing her mouth, coming on her cheeks and on her forehead. In her hair, down the front of her dress and on her bare shoulders and chest. Finally Donnell's deep moans gave way to satisfied sighs, and he stopped stroking himself.In the next instant, Gloria found herself bathed in a bright, harsh light. She heard an authoritative voice shout: \"Carnal, Police!\"She cocked her head and squinted, holding her arm out and shielding her eyes with her hand.Donnell hiked his shorts to his waist, stuffed his cock into his pants, and broke into a run. Gloria sat up, quickly swinging her legs off the table and pushing her dress into her lap. She briefly considered following Donnell, but she wasn't sure which way he had gone. Wasn't sure where her flip flops or purse were. That bright light disoriented her.Instead of running, she squeezed her eyes shut, turned her head, and let out a low rolling whimper. She heard someone race past her, the slap of fast moving feet, the jangle of a utility belt filled with all manner of equipment.The light continued to shine in her face.She looked to see if she could spot Donnell or the person chasing after him, but the bright light had ruined her night vision and she saw only the inky blackness of night. Turning back to the light, she stood up. She did this as much to allow her dress to fall back over her hips and cover her bare bottom as to confront the person shining the light in her eyes.\"Don't move,\" she heard.Gloria stood still. Her blood thumped in her ears. She squinted, raised her arm, and tried to look past her hand to visualize the man holding the light on her. \"Who are you?\" she said. \"We weren't doing anything.\"\"Lower your hand,\" he said.Gloria lowered her hand. She licked her lips and tasted Donnell's salty cum. With a gasp, she realized her face and hair were still covered with his sticky cum. She raised her hand to wipe her face, to clean herself up.\"Lower your hand,\" he said. \"Lower your hand!\"His tone was demanding and urgent and Gloria froze. He instructed her to turn and put her hands behind her back. She sighed noisily and slumped her shoulders in the way that teenagers often do. He repeated the command in the same no-nonsense voice. Gloria turned and put her hands behind her, slowly shaking her head. \"Oh, come on,\" she said. \"This is so stupid.\"In a few quick steps, he was behind her, slipping her wrists into handcuffs. As she felt the cold metal on her skin, she wanted to cry.\"Sit,\" he said. He nodded to the picnic table bench.He shined the light back on her face and she winced as she sat. Gloria tried to duck her head, to hide the cum that was on her face and in her hair. But the officer took her chin in his hand and tilted her head up. Shining the light in her eyes, he tilted her face first to one side, and then the other.Gloria closed her eyes. She could feel her face heating up. Licking her dry lips, she tasted more of Donnell's cum.She thought she might really begin to sob, but then something happened, something snapped inside of her. She was tired of being pushed around. Pushed around by her parents. Pushed around by her high school counselors and teachers. Even by the pastor at her church. But mostly she was tired of being pushed around by her own needs. Everyone was trying to keep her from Donnell. Everyone thought they knew what she needed better than she. Everyone was judging her, finding her lacking.Gloria opened her eyes and smiled.She raised her chin from the officer's fingertips and shook the long dark hair from her face. If this cop wanted to see the cum Donnell had deposited all over her, she would show him. Squaring her shoulders, she pursed her lips and proudly presented her wet face. A cool breeze swept through the isolated picnic area, making her damp cheeks and chest tingle. She opened her mouth and touched the tip of her tongue to her upper lip. She turned her face first to the left, then to the right. She grinned and showed her teeth. Looking right back toward his face, she coyly tilted her head. If he hadn't been shining that light in her eyes, she would have met his gaze.The officer snorted. He wiped his hand on his pant leg and then shined the light on the table top where her panties lay in a bunch. He chuckled and then shut the light off.The crickets chipped and no one said anything for a short while.\"You're the Dean girl, right?\" he said. He wasn't really asking a question. \"I know your mom.\"", "related": ["B00HFXR68Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Thomas O'Hare served in Charlie Company 51st Inf 4th. Armour Grp. of\nthe United States Army in 1961 and at that time, was stationed in Mannheim Germany.\nThomas's father had died just before his enlistment and he'd lost his girlfriend\nto someone else' so that when an occasion came along for Thomas to spend\nmilitary leave in Ireland, he accepted with delight. He flew to Heathrow in\nEngland and on to Dublin, where he was transported to Galway on Ireland's west\ncoast. With joy, Thomas shares with the reader what it was like to dance, sing\nand have a genuinely good time in that city, Galway, where the term \"lynch him\",\noriginated with a Mayor Lynch of long ago Galway. Thomas meets Mary O'Grady at a\nlocal dance and their relationship is the basis for this memoir, \"Galway\nRomance\". Mary and Thomas dance together, shop together, go boating together and\nfall in love with each other. Do they marry or is this vacation romance to be\nThomas's special memory forever? \"Galway Romance\" is well-illustrated with color\nand black and white photographs that are not identified but are clearly of the\nauthor's trip to Ireland and especially to Galway and the people that he met\nthere. Most of the book's pages are filled with the account of author O'Hare's\nbrief romance with Mary O'Grady, but there are descriptive passages that tell of\nGalway's history. There are moments of humor as when the haystack where Thomas\nand Mary were making love was found to be filled with field mice. Some\npunctuation errors need correcting, but otherwise this is a delightful memoir\nthat all will enjoy reading.", "related": [], "rank": 3803624, "title": "Galway Romance", "author": "Thomas D.

That was not, however, his first encounter with those revolutionaries. In 1971, they seized Bizot and two Cambodian companions, eventually releasing him and killing his friends. This account of that ordeal hinges on Bizot’s later recognition that his interrogator subsequently became the commander of the Khmer Rouge regime’s main prison, a sinister, murderous place memorialized in Voices from S-21, by David Chandler (2000). Recalling the man, who was named Duch and was recently convicted of his crimes, Bizot ostensibly recoils from Duch’s barbarity, but his true purpose is plumbing Duch for signs of humanity and himself for signs of his personal inhumanity. For that, Bizot alludes to a cruelty he says he committed (killing a family dog), which introduces to the narrative a self-flagellating, if not misanthropic tone. Along with Bizot’s labyrinthine disquisition into Duch’s mentality, this memoir gives disturbing witness, including trial testimony, to a perpetrator of the Cambodian genocide. --Gilbert Taylor", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Whilst gifted  academically and musically, she was not encouraged to  further her  talents by attending university, and instead joined the  civil service  in Scotland as an assistant press officer. In 1946, she  married  Alastair Dunnett, who was at the time the chief press officer to  the  Secretary of State for Scotland. He went on to become editor of The   Scotsman newspaper, whilst she later worked on a statistics handbook   for the Board of Trade. After a brief spell in Glasgow, the couple   settled in Edinburgh where their home became a centre for hospitality   and entertaining, mostly in support of Scottish art and culture. Dunnett   had also taken evening classes at the Edinburgh College of Art and the   Glasgow School of Art, and from 1950 onwards she established a  prominent  career as a portrait painter, being exhibited at both the  Royal  Scottish Academy and the Royal Academy. She was also an  accomplished  sculptress. Her interest in writing developed during the  1950's. Her own  tastes took her to historical novels and it was her  husband who  eventually suggested she write one of her own, after she  had complained  of running out of reading material. The result was The  Game of Kings, an  account of political and military turmoil in  sixteenth-century  Scotland. Whilst turned down for publication in the  UK, it was  eventually published in the USA where it became an instant  best seller.  Other titles, such as the Lymond Chronicles and House of  Niccolo series  followed and which established her international  reputation. She also  successfully turned her hand to crime, with the  Johnson Johnson series.  He is an eccentric artist, famous for bifocals,  and of course amateur  detective. All of the titles in the series  somehow also feature the  yacht 'Dolly', despite ranging widely in  location from Scotland, to  Ibiza, Rome, Marrakesh, Canada, Yugoslavia,  Madeira and The Bahamas.  There is plenty of sailing lore for the  enthusiast, but not so much it  detracts from the stories genre; crime.  Each of them is told by a woman  whose profession explains her role in  the mystery and we learn very  little about Johnson himself, save for  the fact he is somewhat  dishevelled in appearance.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They are stories of men and women sometimes willfully unaware of the darker undercurrents of domestic life until a moment arrives that changes, or threatens to change, everything. An unintended pregnancy, or an intended one with complications. A kid, facing a bully who is also his best friend. A college professor fearing a tenure decision at his school and in his marriage.   In \"Tell Me Where You Are,\" Charlie Peterson has rats eating through his house even as his marriage is unraveling. \"He parked in front of the Presbyterian Church on First Street. He left Rachel sleeping in the locked van and stepped into the downtown city streets, damp with a light drizzle.\" His daughter is safe but where is his wife?  The stories seem to grow darker, more complicated, with deep sexual currents, as the book progresses, concluding with \"Criminals,\" which won the 2009 Camber Press Fiction award. Gerald Prescott Carter is an American living on the island of Carriacou, drinking heavily and working on a book about seashells, collecting rainwater in cisterns and terribly annoyed when a local boy, \"Soup,\" attempts to steal some of the water. Carter is a deliciously unreliable narrator, concerned with his own sad dignity while life and death play out before him. Clarity? Here, not so much. --Dan Barnett in Biblio File, Chico Enterprise Record", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After all, his father and his relatives are hunters, and they hold an annual pheasant hunt, so it seems an apt choice. The author, a journalist by trade, seems to have approached it like a writing project, beginning with preliminary research (determining what his prey will be, attending an NRA convention to get the right cultural background) and moving on to practical concerns (obtaining a hunting license, learning to shoot, and, of course, actually hunting something). Lighthearted but with a serious message—it’s never too late to reconnect with your family—the book isn’t about hunting so much as it is about a man’s fumbling attempts to redesign himself according to his mind’s image of what sort of man he should be. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Marcus Carter and hispartner, Angela Darden, are investigating a series of disturbing homicides when the killer’s pattern suddenly changes.Instead of targeting only female prostitutes, whose faces he removes post-mortem with a knife, the murderer startsvictimizing people close to Marcus: his grandfather, who recently passed away, and even Angela’s own family. Inbetween the action, Stephens keeps readers engaged with glimpses into the journal entries of a madman whose killing spree in the 1940s matches some of the details in the present-day murders. Each time readers step inside his head, they learn a little more about the psychology behind the crimes. To the killer, who receives his instructions from a demon, the only way to speak to God is to work with the devil. As the case unravels, Stephens uses supernatural influences in place of scientific explanations, and only at the end does he offer a less fantastical theory. Still, the lack of a traditional smoking gun makes for an unsettling read, even if it does lay out a premise that’s been explored before, most notably in Hollywood. This version reads like a series of plot points; characterizations aren’t much deeper than what’s necessary to drive events forward and maintain suspense. For many readers, though, this murderous tale will be a page-turner, an easily digestible thriller with a few effective images—creepy mannequins that appear seemingly from nowhere; the sagging, peeled faces of the dead; and disembodied voices that speak of unstoppable evil.Not particularly original but sure to unnerve.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her mother Azima (the charmer) taught her about ancient sciences, technology, that there is an answer for everything and everyone deserves to live freely according to culture. Her fascination developed her talents and skills along two paths: She graduated with honors from Harris Stowe State University with a B.S. in Accounting and over a twenty year span, Milele studied ancient Kemetic sciences including astrology, numerology, herbalism, crystal healing, aromatherapy, alchemy, divination and mysticism. “I am an activist, educator, business woman, writer, healer, teacher, liberator, wife and a mother of two Afrikan warriors. I began this journey to free minds and to challenge commonly accepted stereotypes.” Her experience growing up & working at Progressive (a prominent Afrikan bookstore/ cultural center) helped to shape her into the woman & artist she is.  Her encounters exposed her to a myriad of artists & teachers who educated her in many schools of thought. From meeting Muhammad Ali to studying under Nana CK Gano, Paramount Chief of the Ewe of Ghana, she was given a rich knowledge of the power and influence that “art” has.

Bureaucrat cum sleuth, Landon (from Men of Subtle Craft ) has received veiled threats from members of the devil-worshiping sect and learns that the group has a penchant for blood sacrifice. When he shares his suspicions with the police, however, they label him deranged. When a second, equally grisly murder implicates a noncult suspect, the authorities ascribe the homicides to a heated territorial dispute. After Landon falls prey to a vicious attack by an unknown assailant, he realizes that the killings may be the product of a deranged mind. And he soon discovers that many people in this small academic community are willing to sacrifice anything for the sake of their careers. Beginning slowly with lengthy background material on medieval religious cults and with detailed characterizations, this intelligent, nicely textured mystery gathers speed and races to a thrilling conclusion.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00EXRFLBO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

All books are standalone books and can be read in any order, with the exception of the two Davenport books, since Safewords: Davenport and Chiffon is a sequel to Safeword: Davenport.

It's strange--they don't look like my keys. It's been almost five\nmonths, but I can't get used to this new \"home.\" Not when you're my home. I\nlook at the keys and I expect to see my old ones. The ones that opened our\nfront door, before you changed the locks.Tears burn in my eyes. I take a deep\nbreath and will them back. I amnotdoing this tonight, and I tell\nmyself that, over and over. Like maybe I'll believe me, but it never works.Halfway down the hall, I glance up at\nlast.You're there.I freeze. Blink. Nearly drop the\nkeys.You're just...there. Standing at the\napartment door.Waiting for me.My heart clenches and I tremble,\nnearly dropping the keys. Maybe I've gone mad. Maybe I've lost my fucking mind\ncompletely and Jess is going to find me later, sobbing in the corner and\nbabbling before calling the nuthouse.You.There.That's not something you would do--not\never. We spent years together, and it was always me who made the first move. I\nkissed you first. I touched you first. I wanted to make love first. I wanted to\nlive together. You'd never pursue me--never risk yourself. That isn't your way--you\nwait for things to come to you. And that's why we drifted, why I shut down, why\nI never knew how to tell you I wanted the opposite.I wanted you in control. I wanted you\ntake, to push, to dominate.And here you are. At the apartment\ndoor. Your eyes lock with mine. So intense. So blue. God, I've missed just\nlooking at you.I don't know who let you in the\nsecurity door. I don't know how long you've been there. I don't know why you\nshowed up and I'm scared of what this will turn into. A shouting match? Me\ncrying again and you storming off? Did you think I followed you to the club the\nother night--is this where you tell me not to stalk you, accuse me of harassing\nyou?I can't read anything in your gaze,\ndespite how I try. The house key is clutched so tightly in my hand that the\nmetal digs into my flesh. It almost feels as though I'm bleeding physically now\ntoo.At last I force my steps forward again,\nstill shaking, sucking in deep breaths as I near you. \"Why are you--\"You reach for me. That alone is\nunexpected--in the final weeks before I moved out, just after our break-up, I\nhad to beg you to touch me. But now your fingers slide around the back of my\nhead, you draw me forward, and kiss me. And this isn't a typical kiss from you.\nYour lips push mine open, your tongue is in my mouth in moments. It's ravenous.\nIt's rough. Your five o'clock shadow is chaffing my chin, and it occurs to me\nhow much I missed that feeling.My back hits the door and it rattles\nbeneath me. You're crushing me and I love it. I breathe in deeply; you smell\nlike...you. That mix of soap and men's deodorant. Your hand catches a fistful\nof my hair and it tugs on my scalp. I love that too and I think my panties are\nalready soaked.I don't say anything as I break away.\nYou don't say anything more either, you just wait while I unlock the door, and\nthen follow me inside.The door slams shut. Your mouth is on\nmine in seconds. The keys hit the floor along with my purse and I don't give\nthem another thought. I wrap my arms around your neck and clasp your t-shirt,\ndigging my nails into the cloth.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The society even created some outlines, but for one reason or another, the book was never written.That is until the society put Sciacqua on the job in 2006. Sciacqua really got down and started working on the book in early 2007, going through old book outlines, photos and files that belong to the historical society.Working with publisher Arcadia, Sciacqua put together an outline for the book and tapped three of the historical society members — Ann Hagen, Dick Caster and Diana Noble-Gulliford — to write the book.The society used information compiled by some earlier members of the group, includingShirley Charnell, Maire Reed and Ilene Marckx.“Without their efforts, we wouldn’t have this information,” Sciacqua said.The book includes a history of Federal Way and some background on nearby areas that aren’t technically part of Federal Way, including the history of Redondo.There are hundreds of photos throughout the book, dating back to the turn of the century right up to the Federal Way Farmers Market, which opened in 2004. The book follows the history of the city through its incorporation in 1989. Before that point, the area was part of unincorporated King County.“We’re still just a young city,” Sciacqua said. “We’ve come a long way. People don’t realize how young we are. (Under King County) we didn’t have control of our destiny.”The society will celebrate the book’s launch from 1 to 4 p.m. Nov. 22 at the Federal Way Community Center Senior Lounge, 876 S. 333rd St.On hand will be Federal Way mayors, both past and present, as well as refreshments and music. Books will be available for purchase for $23 each.Contact Kyra Low: klow@fedwaymirror.com or (253) 925-5565.Check it outFor more infomation on the book, call (253) 945-7842. The Historical Society of Federal Way is open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday.<br /><br />Title: Federal Way’s logging roots among nuggets of bookPublication: The Tribune NewsAuthor: STEVE MAYNARDDate: 11/21/2008Federal Way began forming in the late 1860s around the logging industry, was home to an Indian boarding school and later had one of the area’s first shopping centers.Those and other historic features of what is now the state’s eighth-largest city have been overshadowed by growth and development in recent decades.But the Historical Society of Federal Way hopes the roots of the area will become better known with this week’s release of the first history book about Federal Way.Marie Sciacqua didn’t know where to learn about Federal Way after she moved to the area in 1976. Now, she said, “people will be able to read about it.”Sciacqua, the group’s vice president, coordinated the book after scouring historical society materials for six months. She hopes the book, “Federal Way,” will increase community pride by “knowing where we came from.”The 127-page book will be unveiled Saturday as part o --Historical Society of Federal Way", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Personally acquainted with the joys and dangers of ministry, their practical insights will lead seminarians, pastors, and congregations to discover themselves and each other anew as the called people of God.''--Jaco J. Hamman, Western Theological Seminary''This book masterfully unveils to congregants the joy and challenges for pastors as they work within the church as the body of Christ. If congregants enact even a few of the book's practical suggestions to support their pastor and church, everyone will be healthier and stronger for it.''--Rae Jean Proeschold-Bell, Duke Clergy Health Initiative and Duke Global Health Institute''The work of a pastor is both a joy and a burden, a calling and plain hard work. No one understands this better than the authors of That Their Work Will Be a Joy. They have taught and encouraged many pastors who have succumbed to burnout or stress, and also guided many through the maze of challenges that face all people-healers . . . I strongly recommend it as a must-read for all seminary students as well.''--Archibald D. Hart, Fuller Theological Seminary''A practical guide for living an authentic life in the ministry. Lee and Fredrickson generously share from their own experiences and introduce the major areas of life in ordained ministry. That Their Work Will Be a Joy is a wise companion for ministers and the congregations who love them.''--Jeanie M. Thorndike, Presbytery of Los Ranchos''Anyone who has served as a pastor knows there is joy in serving the Lord in the local church. The authors underscore the joys, but also paint a realistic picture of the challenges: relational demands, conflict, expectations, overwork, burnout, and other critical issues . . . Not only is the book realistic; it is also practical. It provides insights and sound advice about how pastors can exercise self-care, and how congregations can effectively undergird their pastors.''--Reggie Thomas, Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary''Out of the tension between the ideal and the actual, the authors have forged five principle-based habits or patterns that, if shared by pastors and their congregations, would create new life and effectiveness in any church. Each chapter's postscripts--written for pastors, congregants, and seminarians--are alone worth the cost of the book.''--Michael B. Ross, The Pastors Institute''Written in accessible language for congregational leaders, pastors, and seminarians alike, this book is full of tangible content, concepts, and insights that will spark the kind of deeper understanding needed for effective partnership. Of value to the individual, I particularly recommend its use for group study, bringing together clergy and lay leaders.''--Gary Walter, The Evangelical Covenant Church''Though pastoral ministry is one of the most fulfilling calls a Christian can have, it is inherently challenging and stressful. I know of many colleagues who have left the church or wanted to leave, but felt trapped and unsupported. That Their Work Will Be a Joy is written for both clergy and laity to understand the pressures pastors face, and the proactive steps that can be taken to develop and maintain healthy lives and congregations.''--Wayne Walters, Fuller Theological Seminary --Wipf and Stock Publishers", "related": [], "rank": 609683, "title": "That Their Work Will Be a Joy: Understanding and Coping with the Challenges of Pastoral Ministry", "author": "Cameron Lee", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This book, I am sure, will stand out from among the hundreds of books in this genre because of the sheer power and efficacy of her arguments and the brilliant examples she has taken care to provide. The illustrations have been given at the most apt positions and in so smooth a fashion that they do not stand out as digressions as it often happens in so many books of this sort. Another advantage with the author is that quite a few examples are from her own life, which makes it more credible and appropriate.Awakening the Champion: How to Think, Speak, and Live Like a Conqueror is really a champion book from a true champion, encouraging and challenging us all the way. I was impressed by the neat way in which she writes her ideas. Everything has been rendered in a logical and cohesive manner to make it very reader-friendly. Hearty congratulations to her!

Along the way, he relates the experiences of past adventurers including Bruce Chatwin, James Cook, Charles Darwin, Ferdinand Magellan, Allen Gardiner, and Joshua Slocum.\" Reference and Research Book News“For anyone considering venturing to this part of the world, or simply those that love armchair adventuring, this is a ‘must-read.’ Not only does Nick Coghlan paint a vivid picture of the tenacity and slight insanity required to attempt winter cruising in this part of the world, he also delves into the rich maritime history that the likes of Chatwin, Cook, Darwin and Magellan left behind. Nick and his wife Jenny, experienced cruisers with a circumnavigation under their belts some 20 years previously, sail from Cape Town to the Beagle Channel and the Strait of Magellan, skirting Tierra del Fuego (Fireland). Progress is slow in their 27 foot sailboat, and their days are dictated by constant weather concerns, tricky navigation and the harsh yet beautiful terrain surrounding them. Both enjoy exploring and hiking ashore, giving the reader a full picture of just what it’s really like to adventure in Patagonia.” Sue, www.noonsite.com\"[Nick Coghlan] combined the two qualities that make “Winter in Fireland” a gripping read – an irrepressible spirit of adventure which took him into the most daunting situations, and an ability to describe his experiences in lucid prose. This book, following on his previous publications about Colombia and Sudan, places him solidly in the company of the best travel writers - those hardy souls who have explored the world’s nether regions and lived to tell the tale.\" Paul Durand, Just Ottawa. [Full review @ http://www.justottawa.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=241&Itemid;=40]\"This rugged region at South America’s southern tip has lured hardy adventurers and sailors for centuries. Don’t miss reading this tale of one couple’s voyage in Bosun Bird, their Vancouver 27. Packed with carefully documented history and as much about adventures by land as by sea, it’s a volume you’ll want to keep permanently on your bookshelf.\" Lynda Morris Childress, Cruising World\"Coghlan will describe the day's sail, mentioning the landmarks, telling what happened to previous explorers, then talk about the interesting people who make their living on these forbidding waters at the bottom of the world.\" Chas. Hague, Good Old Boat Magazine.\"This book, following on his previous publications about Colombia and Sudan, places him solidly in the company of the best travel writers -- those hardy souls who have explored the world’s nether regions and lived to tell the tale. [In Capetown, South Africa, Nick and his wife Jenny] conceived of the ultimate sailing adventure; around the tip of South America, through the Beagle Channel and the Strait of Magellan, then into the Pacific. This region, the ‘Roaring Forties’, is beset by ferocious storms, numbing cold and unpredictable currents: the most difficult sailing area in the world. .... He talks of 8-metre waves and 50-knot winds, sudden squalls and always the freezing, wet cold. This is not hospitable territory.... On March 1, after re-supplying and re-fitting, they depart Puerto Montt and the Chilean mainland, heading out into the Pacific.... A perfect ending to a gripping adventure, written by a colleague who has mastered both sail and pen.” Paul Durand, former Canadian Ambassador to Chile (and to Costa Rica and the Organisation of American States) and former Director General for Latin America at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Ottawa, bout de papier, January 2012\"Leaving in 2005, they crossed the South Atlantic via Namibia and lonely St Helena, making a spectacular landfall at Rio de Janeiro. In ever heavier weather they then battled south down the coast of Patagonia through the Roaring Forties, to Latitude 55 South. They wintered over at tiny Puerto Williams, Chile: the southernmost permanent settlement in the world, on the shores of the glacier-lined Beagle Channel and only a few miles from Cape Horn. Setting off north again through the lonely Chilean Channels towards warmer climes, with sea-ice still choking many bays, they sat out winds of up to 90 knots and saw scarcely a soul in four months.\" Sail-World.com, January 21, 2012\"Winter in Fireland: A Patagonian Sailing Adventure recounts the sailing journey of author Nicholas Coghlan and his wife Jenny aboard their 27-foot sailboat, Bosun Bird, from Cape Town through the winter waters of the Beagle Channel and the Strait of Magellan, dancing along edges of Tierra del Fuego (Fireland). Their adventure involved braving stormy waters, navigating channels and inlets, and encountering the whims and wonders of other cultures. Reflections on a lifelong love of sailing and incredible nautical adventures past and present fill this treasury for armchair travelers and sailing enthusiasts alike.\" Midwest Book Review, The Nautical Shelf, January 2012“In this adventure our captain takes his boat, and then his reader, from acquisition through renaming and refitting to the completion of a dream... In addition to relating stories about many of the people met along the way, the author includes or references considerable material explaining reasons for most of the names and places also encountered…. I definitely finished this book with the understanding that cruising is considerably more of a tension filled adrenaline sport than common usage of the term would otherwise suggest. And that’s surprising as everything untoward which happens in this journey is quite ably handled by the author and his wife. I’ve read this book cover to cover, including the appetizing selected bibliography and some of the quite serviceable index. I’d read it again, and I’d urge you to read it too.” Garth Miles, Currents Magazine, March 2012\"Winter in Fireland chronicles Nicholas and Jenny Coghlan’s journey from Cape Town, South Africa, to Tierra del Fuego or 'Fireland.' The Coghlans first traveled to Patagonia in 1978 while teaching in Buenos Aires. From 1985 to 1989 they circumnavigated on their boat, Tarka the Otter, after which Nicholas joined the Canadian Foreign Service, and served at various postings around the world. In Winter in Fireland Nicholas and Jenny revisit Patagonia, this time aboard their cutter-rigged Vancouver 27, Bosun Bird. Coghlan weaves their personal journey with the history of the region. A talented writer, Coghlan’s book follows in the wake of Bruce Chatwin, James Cook, Charles Darwin, Joshua Slocum and others who were captivated by Fireland’s allure and primal beauty.\" Ocean Navigator, May-June 2012\"Looking for a good cruising adventure to read during the winter months? Try Nicholas Coghlan’s Winter In Fireland on for size. Nicholas & his wife Jenny revisit Chile & Patagonia aboard Bosun Bird, their 27 foot yacht. Their adventure takes us through their purchase & fit out in Cape Town, the coast of Argentina through the stormy waters of Tierra del Fuego & up the coast of Chile. It is a tale of their journey, filled with trials & tribulations, as well as reflections on the journeys of past explorers & adventures, told with humour & insight. Interspersed with photos this book is perfect for the armchair sailor and would be explorers.\" Cruise News, May 2012\"[Winter in Fireland] is a story by adventurers for adventurers. For someone planning their own trip south, this book would be useful as both a beginning resource and for its annotated bibliography that lists several books of sailing around South America. For others it will be an escape into worldly travel urges likely to inspire fantasies of visiting Patagonia for ourselves.

I now live in North Carolina with my beloved wife and pets. I first became interested in the subject of penis enlargement after seeing the classic smiling bob commercials. After experimenting with various penis enlargement pills, and natural herbal remedies with mixed results I decided there had to be more I could do. One night I happened upon an article about penis extenders being medically proven to increase penis length. I promptly started searching for as much information about extenders as possible. The result was not only learning a good deal about how and why such devices work but also learning of other methods of penis enlargement. I decided that night to give extenders a try. I ordered a low cost extender from Amazon and waited patiently for it to arrive. A week later my new extender arrived with little information on how to properly use it. I spent painstaking weeks gathering all the information I could on not only properly using my extender, but also other forms of PE. After some time of extender use with little to show for it, I realized that I had been overworking myself by jumping so quickly into extending. I needed to get my penis properly conditioned first. I threw my extender into the trash and started doing a purely manual PE routine. After much trial and error I begin to see the results I had expected when I first bought the penis extender. Realizing that other men could benefit from my initial failure and eventual success with PE, I decided to write a book designed to introduce newcomers to some of the basic ideas, principles and routines behind PE. I want others who are following the same path I was to have easily accessible guidelines for successfully implementing PE into their lives. Hopefully through reading my book, others will avoid the pitfalls of over training that I first experienced, save themselves weeks of research and avoid buying costly devices that are better used after you have already established a solid manual PE regimen. My gains at the time of writing \"Are You Big Enough?\"? I can proudly say I've gained 1 inch in flaccid length, 3/4 inch in erect length, and 1/4 inch girth.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He grew up in the city of Wellington, renown for its high winds and the almost magical ability of rain and sleet to be lifted off the street and blasted into one's face. After eighteen years of suffering the cold and wet, he was finally blown away in a particularly bad storm to settle far away as a student, for more years then most would ever admit to. Then finally when the universities pronounced him done he became an overqualified and underpaid worker in the health sector, (aren't we all). He has lived in the city of Rotorua, one of the very few places in the world where people have actually chosen to reside beside active geysers and breath air that reeks of sulphur, for the past fifteen years. He works by day for his daily bread by speaking to people about their various diarrhoeal illnesses. While at night he toils away on his books. When not engaged in his great passions of reading and writing science fiction and fantasy, drinking strong black coffee (some call it tar), and consuming copious amounts of chocolate (dark naturally), he lives a quiet life of contemplation as the high priest to his two cats. His duties include worshipping them with regular gifts of food, the occasional grooming and providing them with a warm dry place to sleep. They in turn look down upon him with typical feline disdain, but occasionally deign to bring him gifts of headless vermin, - as a warning. In a desperate bid to understand the meaning of his life, he has recently started studying philosophy, particularly metaphysics, and come to a startling conclusion. God is a cat!

Her most recent novel,Theena's Landing, takes her readers into the lush landscape of South Florida, the land of exotic birds, fragrant blossoms, and bright skies. In that narrow strip of land between the Atlantic and the Everglades, Gretchen grew roses in the sandy soil and orange trees in dark loam reclaimed from the swamp. InTheena's Landing, the early settlers living among the scarlet ibis and wild orchids tamed the wilderness to make way for the storied city of Miami.She has also been recognized for her ante-bellum historicals, set in Louisiana among the Creoles, Cajuns, and African slaves. Always and Forever, from Kensington Zebra, won the Colorado Romance Writers Award of Excellence for Mainstream with Romantic Elements and was chosen as an Editor's Pick in the Historical Novel Society reviews. Continuing the saga of the same extended families,Ever My Lovewon the Booksellers Best Award from the GDRWA. The last book of the trilogy,Evermore, carries the families into the early days of the Civil War.Gretchen was born in the Florida Panhandle and grew up in St. Petersburg on the Gulf Coast. She and her husband have lived in South Florida, Germany, and Maine, and are now in Texas among the mesquite and sunflowers. Maybe because she's lived in such diverse climates and terrains, Gretchen's novels are notable for their strong sense of place. Readers swear they can smell the bayous of Louisiana and taste the gumbos of New Orleans. Crimson Sky, a Kindle Novel inspired by the pueblos, mountains, and deserts of northern New Mexico, evoke the lives of people living under a searing sun among the stark beauty of mesas and canyons.

Dilloway has been a writer for most of his life. He completed his first story in third grade and received an ‘A’ for the assignment. Around that time, he was also placed in a local writing contest for a television station, receiving an action figure in lieu of a trophy, thus securing his love with the written word. Since then, he’s continued to spend most of his free time writing and editing. In the last twenty years, he’s completed nearly forty novels of various genres. In 2012, Solistice Publishing published P.T.’s superhero novel A Hero’s Journey, Tales of the Scarlet Knight #1. That same year, December House Publishing included P.T.’s flash fiction stories as part of the collection We Are Now. Also in 2012, P.T. created the imprint Planet 99 Publishing to publish the remainder of the Tales of the Scarlet Knight series as well as a variety of other novels, all of which can be found at http://www.planet99publishing.com. When not writing, P.T. enjoys reading and photographing Michigan’s many lighthouses.

Barton is the author of several fast-paced mystery and thriller series, featuring lively characters and lots of action. \"Miz Scarlet\" (Scarlet Wilson Mystery series) is a teacher-turned-innkeeper, who throws herself into danger with a feisty determination to make things right, relying on cohorts like \"Captain Peacock\" and \"Colonel Grey Poupon\" to help her solve the clues. Deputy Gabby Grimm (Gabby Grimm Fairy Tale Mystery series) protects the citizens of Latimer Falls, where there are more cows, goats, and chickens than people, and she has her hands full when terrorists, organized criminals, and other bad guys wreak havoc with the peaceful village of Latimer Falls, Vermont. Sydney Stansfield (Off-the-Books Mystery series), an artist and interior decorator, is the sidekick of FBI Special Agent Henry Hartman, and she is often dragged into crises that result from his investigations. Bea Jones, a former bookstore manager, is the beleaguered wife of Benedick, a CIA officer forced into early retirement, and they bicker their way through a myriad of intelligence situations of Shakespearean proportions, even as they run their Vermont bed and breakfast, hosting a variety of spies, operatives, and even a couple of war refugees.The author's passion for writing fiction comes through each tale. \"There is nothing sweeter than sticking characters in the hot seat and making them find their way out of the darkness. I'm fascinated by human behavior and I love to see characters grow as they go through tough times. Life is never fair, but I believe in heroes, those people who don't take no for an answer, who put the greater good ahead of 'me, me, me'. But most of all, I enjoy a good story, seasoned with action, memorable characters, unpredictable behavior, and a monkey wrench big enough to jam up the best laid plans.

She even designed her own cover, and after nabbing an A+ on the story in school, her love for writing was born. She enjoyed creative writing and drama throughout high school. She continued to write, but mostly covered sports stories in high school, including a weekly column called Behind the Bench, featuring stories and anecdotes from her time as boys and girls basketball manager. Following college graduation, she knew she wanted a career in writing, but that insurmountable task of writing the Great American Novel seemed too high of a hill to climb.

Throw in a little adventure (he has traveled to more than 60 countries, many of which do not appear in your typical tourist brochure - think Sudan, Ethiopia, Mongolia, Mauritania, and Colombia to name but a few) and a dash of family turmoil and it’s no surprise that Weary Heart is an emotional roller-coaster of a journey.  Born in the UK, Roderick Phillips moved to America in 1992.  He now lives in San Francisco with his wife, young son, and two incorrigible orange tabby cats.  He is currently writing the sequel to Weary Heart, which is entitled Savage Heart.

Hobby quickly turned into passion, and when she discovered the world of romance as a teen, poems and short stories gave way to full length novels with sexy heroes and heroines waiting to be swept off their feet. She wrote her first romance novel at seventeen.  While that manuscript gathered dust-bunnies beneath the bed, she went on to establish herself as a contemporary, historical, and paranormal author under the pen name, Claire Ashgrove. Her writing, however, skirted a fine line between hot and steamy, and motivated by authors she admired, she pushed her boundaries and made the leap into erotica, using the darker side of human nature and on-the-edge suspense to drive grittier, sexier, stories.  Her erotic romantic suspense novels are searingly sensual experiences that unite passion with true emotion, and the all-consuming tie that binds—love.", "related": ["B00CGFJ0LM"], "rank": 1847095, "title": "Explosive (The Black Opals)", "author": "Tori St. Claire", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Nearly five centuries have passed since their arrival, and the Riviera Maya continues to shine as one of the most beautiful destinations in the Americas. Stunning landscapes, friendly locals, and a laid back culture create a unique fun-loving atmosphere that's perfect for couples, honeymooners, and families. Nature-lovers can take full advantage of the area's rich flora and fauna. Snorkeling with sea turtles, diving with whale sharks, or tubing down a lazy river are just a few options. Of course, there is also plenty to satisfy history buffs - the Riviera Maya is home to some of the world's most fascinating Mayan ruins. Visitors can check out the ancient cities of Tulum, Cobá, and Muyil, all of which are open year-round and offer a remarkable glimpse into Mayan culture. But if you really just want to sit back and relax, the Riviera Maya is the ideal place to catch up on some R&R.; All-inclusive resorts, luxury boutique hotels, and romantic bungalows line the white sand coast. Sit back and enjoy the view with a cold margarita or book a decadent spa treatment to pamper yourself. Travelers with kids have plenty of options too, as many attractions are designed with families in mind. Eco parks like Xel-Há, Xcaret, Río Secreto, and Sian Ka'an hold hours of fun for people of all ages and interests. I visited the Riviera Maya in January 2013. Its stunning coastline and friendly people makes in the quintessential Caribbean paradise, except it offers so much more than sand and sea. Mayan cities, underground rivers, world-class gastronomy, and the world's second longest coral reef provide a host of new experiences for all travelers alike.

Though it seems like a terrible beginning, small William lived through it and gained great life experience. The will of providence brought him to work as a servant in the house of the great master, Sifu Qian Bo-Wan. His Kung Fu school became his home and shelter. At the age of 8, boys passion for martial arts was recognized and he began learning personally from the great master Bo-Wan. He was trained in various methods: Wing Chun, Shao Lin Guan, Tai Chi Guan, Xing Xi Guam. He studied Chi Kung with my master and Buddhist monks. Just before his Sifu left this world, he told to 14 year old boy: \"Xi (his name for author), you have to go and spread this knowledge. You can do much more then I ever could, you will see.\" Author felt humbled and obligated to carry out his wishes and he did so. After finishing his studies of traditional Chinese medicine with Dr. Le Cai, author moved to the Western world. He often stated that he never understood what his Sifu meant by saying 'you can do much more'. He did not say 'better', but 'more'. He explained that despite spending more then 30 years in teaching martial arts, Chi Kung, and related disciplines just recently he was able to understand why he used the term 'much more'. It was not because of anything in me. It is because of the Internet and modern technology that I really am able to fully fulfill his instructions. I am more than grateful to all my students and readers who help me, and continue reading and using my books.

Her previous ‘indie’ project is the Penelope Pembroke Cozy Mystery Series.  It is available as single copies and as a 6-book boxed set. She writes real-life stories in a clean way and likes to say there’s not a blush in a book. She finds story ideas in travel experiences, genealogical research, newspaper articles, and sometimes just through a chance conversation or people-watching, one of her favorite things to do in airports, restaurants, and other places in which she happens to find herself. She enjoys her empty nest and is having her adolescent rebellion 50 years late—an example of which is taking a ride in a WW II B-24 bomber built the same year she was born!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
