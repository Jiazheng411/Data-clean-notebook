This impressive work contributes vitally to breaking down the distinction between literacy and orality which has often clouded discussions of cultural and administrative institutions in the ancient world, and reaches significant conclusions that will have an impact far beyond its core area of Biblical Studies.\"--John Baines, Professor of Egyptology, University of Oxford\"Carr spans the ancient Near East with enviable ease, bringing together scholars and debates from diverse disciplines.

Carr adroitly employs an impressively broad range of comparative and theoretical perspectives to argue for the centrality of an oral-written textual practice in the educational process of cultural formation and socialization in elite Israelite circles.  While this book is must reading for students and scholars of the Hebrew Bible, both in its literary formation and social reception, Carr's reach extends to other cultural fields in which orality and textuality are performatively bound.\"--Steven D.

Between the menage relationship, BDSM elements, tension from outside forces, the mixture of personalities, needs, and wants, the authors manage to deliver a well-written, cohesive and beautiful story. Although this is a romance, the characters have an intensity and edge that never mistake this for an easy relationship. \nThe interesting and incredibly hot men drew me into the story very quickly, leaving me rapt at Ethan's earnest missteps and honest emotions. The point of view changes are skillful and seamless, allowing the intensity to subtly and gradually increase. My sole caveat aside, which I didn-t find to take away from the story too much, I was kept guessing as to what would happen in each moment. As the path of your life can change in an instant, the fascinating turns that follow the lives of these three men will keep you glued to their story. -Kassa, Rainbow Reviews 4.5/5\nI read Soft Focus on a very long plane flight. That was a mistake. The story was so hot that I didn't need my blanket, and I didn't want to stop reading for dinner. It's that good. The only reason not to read this book is if you violently dislike BDSM. Otherwise, pick this one up NOW. It's scorchingly hot, well-written, and describes a loving dom-sub relationship better than anything I've ever read. You'll be drawn into David and Kiyoshi's world just as surely as Ethan is. Kiyoshi, in particular, is a lovely character whose submissive nature hides a core of pure steel. -Ivy, Manic Readers Reviews 5/5\n\"The combination of the three men is a perfect balance of edgy, sweet, sassy, and power that makes their mutual attraction understandable.

He did more than any other man in modern times to establish the faith of the people in the validity of the Holy Scriptures.His weekly sermons were published by a newspaper syndicate composing some 2000 newspapers with a combined circulation of fifteen million readers. \"His writings are said to have greater newspaper circulation every week than those of any living man....\" (Editor of the \"Continent\")In addition, his missionary tour of Russia, where he delivered lectures to thousands of Orthodox Jews on \"the regathering of the Jewish people to Palestine,\" plus his travels to Japan, China, Korea and India to preach the Good News were widely known. On his return to America he was given a standing ovation at the New York City Hippodrome by thousands of Jews, his discourse on \"The Returning Favor to Israel\" being published by Hebrew newspapers, both in America and Europe.Convinced of the harmony of the Bible, Pastor Russell devoted his life to the cause to which he gave his life ... the teaching of the Holy Scriptures.

A close disciple of Lama Thubten Yeshe for more than three decades, Lama Zopa has taught by word and example the importance and power of properly following a guru. The book is based on several decades of dharma talks organized by editor Ailsa Cameron into twenty-four chapters, beginning with the question of why one needs a teacher to progress along the path. The remaining chapters discuss in considerable detail how to cultivate and practice devotion, and generate the view of one s own teacher as the Buddha. It concludes with several short guru yoga visualization practices. Throughout the book Lama Zopa offers personal reflections and stories to illustrate his message that guru yoga truly is the heart of the path to liberation. --BuddhaDharma magazineFor those interested in stepping beyond the realm of ideas into the world of practice, the latest book from Tibetan master Lama Zopa Rinpoche is a helpful guide to one important aspect of the spiritual path. The Heart of the Path explains the importance of guru devotion and Zopa's view of the proper way to develop a student-teacher bond. Lama Zopa has had many teachers, but his unwavering devotion to Lama Thubten Yeshe shines through on every page. Drawing on this experience and the Buddha's teachings, Zopa effectively conveys the value of relationships based on Buddhist ideals. --Tricycle magazineAlthough guru devotion is a foundational concept within Tibetan Buddhist thought, for many it remains a bewildering and impenetrable topic. Fortunately for contemporary practitioners, Lama Zopa Rinpoche has spoken extensively on guru devotion, giving teachings and advice about what it really means to have devotion to one s spiritual friend. Drawing from nearly fifty teachings, this treasure is the result of seven years of painstaking editing by Ven. Ailsa Cameron. Not only does it include teachings on the traditional sub-topics that fall under guru devotion found in Tsongkhapa s lam-rim, but also a useful outline to guide your reading, several supplementary prayers and teachings from other renowned Tibetan masters, and inspiring images of Lama Zopa, Lama Yeshe and other amazing teachers peppered throughout. A perusal of this masterful work by Lama Zopa Rinpoche will assuage any doubts about the utility or possibility of seeing the guru as Buddha . --Mandala magazine", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And often it’s in places organizations least expect. That’s good news – with a little creativity, research and focus on making things easier and better for the customer, any organization can create a superior customer experience. As Lynn illustrates in this easy-to-read and implement framework, a focus on customer needs and customer-generated metrics leads to superior financial metrics.     As a marketing strategist with expertise in using fun to drive creativity, I know first-hand that creativity drives innovation because it challenges the fundamental and sometimes incorrect assumptions organizations make about customer value. I also appreciate Lynn’s inclusion of critical, but often undervalued creativity tools such as parody, humor and improvisation; I know they allow organizations to see things differently – to see possibilities for improving the customer experience that were previously buried. That’s where the opportunity for value innovation lies and that is the focus of Lynn’s clear and actionable ebook, Innovating Superior Customer Experience.

I did not get enough of her. She is a no nonsense woman who has surrounded herself with an interesting crew and brooks no arguments from them...I would be interested to see some of the other characters in the story, like Will and Hal, have their own stories.

During the course of that year, six women, one man, and one child were murdered in their sleep by a silent, axe-wielding killer. Many more were attacked and the police were seemingly powerless to stop the crimes. Pinkerton detectives were brought in but they too failed to solve the mystery. After the shocking murders of two women on Christmas Eve the city was on the verge of chaos  awaiting the next outrage, but there were no further crimes. The murders ended as mysteriously as they began.Who was responsible for the murders? How were they able to escape detection and capture? And  why did they suddenly stop?

Weaver to Clarence and Virginia Weaver in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1957, I graduated from Withrow High and entered the military in 1958. While there, I studied the entire New Testament and became a devout Christian (with no plans to blow people to kingdom come). For Christians, \"devout \" has a peaceful meaning. In 1960, I converted to the Catholic faith, and later, took logic and other subjects and made the dean's list at Xavier University. I attended the Jesuit Seminary at Milford Novitiate from 1962-63. I wrote unpublished works, \"Computational Number Logic\" and \"Synthetic Photosynthesis\"around 1975. I then attended a number of colleges in the Dallas, Texas metroplex; these were SMU, UTA, UD and Bishop College. I graduated in 1972 with a major in philosophy and a minor in English. And in my leisure, I read the Bible and the Suma Theologica. Then, the impossible happened. Around 3:30 am on 9-3-93 in the sky far above, a snow white cloud covered the moon of love. A black night cross cut through that cloud; revealing the moon in intersection bowed.. Leaving me awed and before God cowed. This vision of the Cloud Moon Cross remained for over ten minutes while I looked at and felt the building to see if it could be a dream, which it was not. A few years ago, I even took an official polygraph to validate my experience. The computer enhanced polygraph showed no deception on my part as I affirmed every detail of the vision. The impossible had indeed happened, and I got to see it. I even offer the atheists a way to disprove my claims, but no one has accepted my POLYGRAPH CHALLENGE : I'll gladly retake the exam if they will pay for it and donate a million dollars to my charity. In fact, they can test me for drugs and monitor all my food for days before the event, if they wish. Back to the mundane, I created ageoftheology.com in 2006, wrote \"God Lives\" in 2008, and \"God (is not) = Zero\" in 2009. And now I bless you all in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.", "related": [], "rank": 2952841, "title": "God Is Not Equal to Zero", "author": "Jerry P.T.

What were your first impressions of the country and its people?Anna Badkhen:Actually, in 2001 I did not step off a plane: Because at the time the \n\nUnited States was conducting its war mostly from the air, very few civilian planes and helicopters \n\nwere allowed into Afghanistan. Besides, Taliban government controlled most of the country, and the \n\nsliver of Northern Afghanistan that was in the hands of U.S.-backed rebels had only one, barely \n\nfunctioning, airport. To get into Afghanistan I had to fly to Tajikistan, drive to that country’s \n\nsouthern frontier, and there, very late at night, take a rusty, diesel-powered ferry across the \n\nPyandzh River--the Oxus of antiquity.The Pyandzh was the border between the two countries, between war and peace. It was also a \n\nborder between eras. Suddenly I was surrounded by people who eked out a living the way they had for \n\nmillennia: without electricity or running water, tilling fields with primitive wooden tools, baking \n\ndelicious flatbread in tandoor ovens, taking flocks of sheep to the jade hills at sunup. I fell in \n\nlove with the tenaciousness and grace of these people, and with the generosity with which they \n\nshared everything: their shelter, their food, and their grief.Question:You wrote that upon your return in 2010 you found \"that the people who in 2001 \n\nhad embraced the U.S.-led war are now wondering whether the Taliban’s puritanical and cruel \n\ngovernance may be a better option than the anarchy, corruption, and abandonment that followed the \n\nmilitia’s ouster.\" In summary, what went wrong in Northern Afghanistan over those nine years that \n\nyou were away?Anna Badkhen:After the invasion, the north--where ethnic Pashtuns, who form the core of \n\nthe Taliban, are a small minority--was universally considered to be virtually Taliban-proof. NATO \n\nforces and most international donors focused their attention on southern Afghanistan, where the \n\nTaliban had retained a stronghold. The notion that the Taliban posed no threat in Northern \n\nAfghanistan spelled the region’s undoing: While the world was distracted, the Taliban quietly \n\nreturned to the north, capitalizing on the disillusionment of the local population both with the \n\nUN-backed kleptocracy that governs in Kabul, and with the West, which, in their eyes, had broken \n\nits promise to improve the way people live in the region.Question:From your sense of the people of Afghanistan, what do you think they want from \n\nthe United States?Anna Badkhen:Ninety percent of Afghans live in villages: kind, generous, religious people who live with their hands, who love their children, who want to kick back after a day of grueling manual labor, eat dinner, fly kites. They want what most people want everywhere in the world: Peace. Stability. Electricity, clean water, access to health care. They want to have enough food to feed their families. They want roads, and they want to be able to drive on those roads—whether to take their crops to market, or to visit relatives in a distant village—without being blown up by a roadside bomb, and without having to pay a bribe at every police checkpoint. They want to know that no misguided air raid will destroy their farmhouse while they sleep. It seems to me that at this point they don’t care whether all of this comes from the United States, or from some relief agency, or from the Taliban. Afghans have weathered thousands of years of invasions, fratricidal conflicts, political persecution. They are an astoundingly enduring nation. But they want a break.Question:What’s a day in the life of an average Afghan citizen like? How can and why \n\nshould an average American try to relate?Anna Badkhen:You have done this many times: On a day off, you pack some sandwiches, \n\nwater, and fruit, lock up the house, drive out of the city, and go for a hike with your \n\nfriends.One spring day, my Afghan friends took me hiking. Up a road strewn with chert, past some cotton \n\nfields drowned in stagnant water--to soak the hard soil--up a goat path that bisects a hill into a \n\nsloping wheat field and an almost vertical lea of cerulean wildflowers. Wars have swept over these \n\nhills like the smooth waves of wind that rolled the wheat ears, and many of the fields were \n\nprobably ticking with landmines. But wars cannot kill our basic human need for normalcy, our \n\nappreciation of natural beauty. At the top of one hill--turtles peered out from their nest beneath \n\nwildflower stalks; an ant dragged a husk of last year’s grain to a crevice between lumps of the dry \n\nclay soil; a one-humped she-camel grazed on chamomile flowers--we sat and drank water and mango \n\njuice we had brought, snapping pictures and laughing. A little boy--my friend’s nephew--put a rose \n\nin my hair, and held my hand all the way back to the car.Why should we relate? Because we are all human, because we share a planet, and because our \n\nworld, in an era of globalized trade, the Internet, and the 24-hour news cycle, is rapidly \n\nshrinking. What separates us are a language, a set of customs, geography. These are superficial \n\nboundaries. We want the same things: friends to go hiking with, beauty to clap our eyes on, and \n\nsomeone’s hand to hold.Question:In your opinion, what are the three most important things that Americans should \n\nknow about the current situation in Afghanistan?Anna Badkhen:One thing to keep in mind is that even those Afghans who initially \n\nsupported the war against the Taliban no longer see it a war of emancipation, and NATO troops as \n\nliberators. They see it as another war that threatens their lives and the lives of their kin. They \n\nare not interested in Western-style democracy; their lifestyle is traditionally feudal and \n\nland-based. They rarely travel far beyond their tribal areas and the nearest market town. They want \n\nto live comfortably, they want their children to stop dying of such preventable diseases as \n\ndysentery or common cold each year.Secondly: It is a common misconception that while the Taliban are a hardline, ultra-religious \n\nmilitia, their opposition--which makes up the current government--is not. Most Afghan leaders come \n\nfrom the ranks of mujahedeen, or holy warriors: a hardline, often ultra-religious militia \n\nformed--with the assistance of both the CIA and Osama bin Laden--to fight against the Soviets \n\nthirty years ago. Many have been accused of sanctioning mass murder, ethnic cleansing, and gang \n\nrape. The longer they remain in power, the longer their government will have no legitimacy in the \n\neyes of many ordinary Afghans.Finally: Nine years after the war began, life for most Afghans has not improved. Child mortality \n\nremains as high as it was in 2001: three out of four children die before they turn five. Most \n\nvillages still have no electricity, no paved roads, no access to clean water. When people in the \n\nWest wonder why Afghans do not appear grateful for the U.S.-led effort to rid their country of the \n\nTaliban, the question I have is: given these statistics, why should they?Question:On a less serious note, what’s the best treat you tried while there? What did \n\nit look and taste like?Anna Badkhen:Afghan food is a delight. During the spring 2010 trip that yielded Waiting \n\nfor the Taliban, I stayed in a private house of a huge, tight-knit family. My room was next to the \n\nkitchen, and there was always something sublime cooking on the propane stove there, and \n\nmouthwatering aroma would seep into my room through the door crack. One day--it was a Friday, a day \n\noff--my hosts were having some guests over, and I helped out in the kitchen. We were making--in \n\naddition to rice pilau, meatballs, stewed lamb, salad, creamed spinach, and spiced rice \n\npudding--mantwo, large Afghan dumplings with ground meat and onions (there is a recipe for \n\nmantwo and some other wonderful Afghan food in my bookPeace \n\nMeals, which comes out in October). Four women at the counter, preparing lunch for 40. At \n\nfirst, the other women watched me very suspiciously: were my untrained fingers a match for the \n\nfiligreed, stuffed beauties they were making? After the secondmantwo, they said: “Good, you \n\ncan do this,” and stopped watching. I felt as though I had been accepted into a tribe.And themantwowere delicious.More from Anna BadkhenWomen weave a carpet in Oqa, an ethnic Turkomen village in Northern AfghanistanWhite doves at the Blue Mosque, a shrine at the heart of Mazar-e-SharifA woman at the Mazar-e-Sharif house where the author stayed in the spring of 2010 carries a tray with freshly baked Afghan bread, naan.Hiking in Sholgara on a day offMahbuhbullah and Nargiz, author's friends in Dasht-e-Qaleh, serve lunch at their house.A man in Camp Shahraqi Mawjirin stands next to the grave of his child, who died of complications from a common cold.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Heinz is fully aware of the materiality of Christmas that leaves way open to commoditization; he invites critical reflection on the tension between capitalist commoditization and gospel materialism. The book offers a rich annotated bibliography. In all, the book is a winsome, fair-minded resource for reconsideration of our core evangelical pageant amid multiple temptations and distortions.\" --Walter Brueggemann, Columbia Theological Seminary\"Heinz has blended theology, sociology, history, and keen insight in examining the deepest meanings of Christmas. This is an intelligent and provocative work, full of humane passion for our favorite season.\" --Gerry Bowler, Professor of History, University of Manitoba\"Another book about Christmas? Yes, but this is the one we really need. Heinz tells us the deep story of Christmas all the way back, including its central meaning in understanding the Incarnation. But he also helps us understand why it has become perhaps the most central festival of family life in the year for Christians and non-Christians alike. Heinz is more concerned with helping us understand the joy in elaborations that seem far from the original meaning than he is with chiding the innovators. So this is a book that simultaneously deepens our theology while widening our sympathy.\" --Robert N. Bellah, Professor of Sociology Emeritus, University of California, Berkeley\"Heinz leaves the reader well informed about the rich tapestry of Christmas traditions and very aware that the Christmas celebration dominated by the prevailing winds of capitalism \"focuses on all the materials that claim to be good instead of on the Good that claims to be material.\" In short, we lose sight of Incarnate Jesus, the center of the celebration.\" --Urban C. von Wahlde, Biblical Archaelolgical Review\"Do readers need another book about Christmas? Heinz (California State Univ., Chico) believes so, and has written an interesting, informative book about the historical development of this Christmas festival and its larger cultural impact on Western society. Though the framework of this book is essentially historical, Heinz also employs insights from theology, art, music, and cultural criticism to examine his subject from a multidisciplinary standpoint. One major interpretive key for the author is the idea of Christmas as a \"theater of incarnation\" (theological language for the idea of God taking on human form), and how the festival itself becomes a series of theatrical metaphors for this concept. Christmas is, in this sense, a staged reenactment of the original event, and takes on sacramental overtones in the world of Christian piety. As Christmas moved out into the now more secularized Western world, it lost many of its previous associations, but developed further cultural significances of its own. Ultimately, Heinz suggests that \"Christmas becomes the uneasy record of how God and religion and humans are faring in the modern world.\" Summing Up: Recommended.

McDowell was born in Waco, Texas. At the age of two, his family relocated to El Paso, Texas, which allowed him the privilege of not only learning two languages but also understanding two cultures. For the most part, he led a normal life. Through the years, however, things changed . . . and not always for the best. \"I woke up one day and realized that my life was completely out of control. I went from the school's best-dressed runner-up and most likely to succeed, to having an addiction for fast money, cocaine, and alcohol.\" It would be years before Johnny would humble himself and ask God to deliver him from the bondage brought on by his error. \"I often tell people to be very careful about what they ask God for, and always be prepared to receive it. I received a prison sentence that lasted eleven years, eight months, twenty-eight days, twelve hours, and forty-seven minutes.\" It was during his time of incarceration that Johnny began to discover his talents. He spent most of his free time designing layouts for a clothing line and used his remaining free time being an avid reader. In a week's time, he would read up to three and sometimes four books.  Reading opened up a whole new world for him, and in May of 2007, he picked up a pen and pad to write his first story. Within two months, Johnny had written two books and, by then, realized that God had replaced the clothing ideas with a creative writing ability. Although he has written six books, Raising Hope for Darius is his first published work. Friends and family tell him that he is a success story by all rights because of his ability, but Johnny believes differently. \"Any success that I experience today or in the future lies only in the fact that God gave me my life back!\" Johnny resides in the Dallas area but says Waco will always be his home.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Modern critics continue to debate the significance of Eureka and some doubt its seriousness, in part because of Poe's many incorrect assumptions and his comedic descriptions of well-known historical minds. Presented as a poem, many compare it with his fiction work, especially science fiction stories such as \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar.\" His attempts at discovering the truth also follow his own tradition of \"ratiocination,\" a term used in his detective fiction tales. Poe's suggestion that the soul continues to thrive even after death also parallels with works in which characters reappear from beyond the grave such as \"Ligeia.\" The essay is oddly Transcendental, considering Poe's disdain for the movement. He considered it his greatest work and claimed it was more important than the discovery of gravity.Eurekaseems to continue the science fiction traditions he used in works like \"MS. Found in a Bottle\" and \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar.\" He further emphasizes the connection between his theory and fiction by saying that the universe itself is a written work: \"The Universe is a plot of God,\" Poe says, and \"the plots of God are perfect.\" Even so, Poe admits the difficulty in explaining these theories comes in part from the limitations of language, often apologizing for or explaining his use of \"common\" or \"vulgar\" terms.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Now\na young soldier injured in the Korean War, Larry Harris is AWOL, armed, and\nangry, and he seeks to destroy both Cliff and Angelina, whose friendship would\ngrow into love and, later, marriage.Fenter\nis a gifted storyteller with an engaging writing style and a seemingly natural\nsense for effective plot and pacing. Blessed with a good eye for detail, he is\nable to impart a sense of place and landscape without overwhelming the reader\nwith elaborate descriptions.The\nBee Treeaddresses topics as\nwide-ranging and timely as racial and cultural relations, religious\nintolerance, the horrors of war, bullying, mental illness, and illiteracy. Its\nprotagonists thrive and prevail because of their strength and resilience, clear\nthinking, willingness to take risks, and respect for the human and natural\nworlds. A hint of magic helps, too. Fenter beautifully describes both the\nblossoming of teen love based on honor and respect and the love between family\nmembers that enables them to surmount their differences.Fenter's\nability to create a real page-turner that will be enjoyed by young adult and\nmature readers alike.Kristine\nMorris", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At the age eleven I transferred to St. Joseph's House for Homeless and Industrious Boys, in Philadelphia. I ran away at the age of fourteen from the sexual abuse by a Catholic layman there and learned how to survive on streets of Philadelphia. At the age of sixteen, my employer at Gimble's Department store informed me I was a \"Dime a Dozen\". I stole $25,000 worth of tires to prove I was not. A four year stint in the USAF introduced me to Republican politics where I met the John Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch, and Ronald Reagan before he became California's governor. I quit the job I had for four years as a salesman for the California Fruit Exchange because I did not get a promotion I thought I deserved and embarked on a career with the Southern Pacific Railroad while pursuing a formal education in both journalism and the law. I moved from Sacramento to Pollock Pines California and took with me Judith Nelson, whose mother thought I was much too old for her. Judy and I founded and published the town newspaper for two years. My relationships continued to implode and I found myself committing a horrendous crime for which I was sentence to Folsom State Prison in California for twenty years. I was released early because the Board of Prison terms deemed my sentence to be disparate. I started a career as a public servant with the State of California as a secretary and retired in 2004 as an Information Systems Analyst. Having the burden of being a registered sex offender, I decided to write my autobiography because it would be one way I could pay for my grave sin and help to prevent the victimization of children. In 1998, I found a family of Russian immigrants -  The Klimovs - who informally adopted me and showed me the way to eternal salvation. In 2004 I retired from the state and moved to Christmas Valley, Oregon where I currently reside. I returned to grace and was baptized in 2009 at Grace Family Church in Carmichael, California. I consider this part of my life to be priceless. Although I started my life orphaned from a dysfunctional family, I believe it is God's plan that I became a part of both the Klimov family and the family of brothers and sisters I have in the Baptist church. In retirement I travel, making large, panoramic prints of nature on canvas. I market them at vistagraphs.net.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

O'Flaherty was the son of Maidhc O Flaithearta and Maggie Ganley of Gort na gCapall. In 1908, at the age of twelve, he went to Rockwell College. This was followed by enrollments at Holy Cross and University College, Dublin. He did not attend the first two schools for long. He had intended joining the priesthood, but in 1917 he left school and joined the Irish Guards under the name 'Bill Ganly'. He served on the Western Front, where he was injured, and it is possible that the shell shock he suffered may have been responsible for the mental illness which became apparent in 1933. After the war O'Flaherty left Ireland and moved to the United States, where he lived in Hollywood for a short time. The well-known director John Ford, a cousin, later turned O Flaithearta's novel, The Informer, into a film. Many of his works have the common theme of nature and Ireland. He was a distinguished short story writer, and some his best work in that genre was in Irish.  In 1923, O'Flaherty published his first novel, Thy Neighbour's Wife, thought to be one of his best. In 1935, his novel The Informer (for which he had been awarded the 1925 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction) was made into a film by John Ford. Over the next couple of years he published other novels and short stories. In 1933 he suffered from the first of two mental breakdowns. He travelled in the United States and Europe, and the letters he wrote while travelling have now been published. He had a love of French and Russian culture, and this may have been part of the attraction he felt towards communism. Before his death, however, he left the Communist Party and returned to the Roman Catholic faith.", "related": ["B0062N37VI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This is a moving story of one woman's journey to find where she belongs after her life is turned upside down. Lynn Hubbard's attention to historical detail is outstanding. This short story also includes historical photos and maps. Where I felt A Christmas Crossing fell a bit short is in grammar and typographical errors. Verb tenses would change in the middle of a chapter. Words were misspelled. I found that aspect distracting. A good editor would easily have caught these errors, making this a stronger story. Overall, I'm glad I read it and I would consider another of Hubbard's stories in the future. ~Cheryl Malandrinos", "related": ["B00G1RR2HK"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 3.375, "rating_total": 27.0}

Still, my family insists that that statue was smiling before my eight-year-old self started taking lessons. Concert pianist Jonathan Biss has felt this kind of rebuke, or at least the \"specter\" of it, as he has gone about the process of recording all 32 of Beethoven's sonatas--a mammoth, nine-year undertaking he describes inBeethoven's Shadow--and one he admits \"unmoors him completely.\" So why do it, especially when the level of commitment this requires makes mistresses of other composers that enrich Biss's life, but whose music he is now forced to set aside in the service of his goal? And why, with so many expectations placed upon these beloved pieces, make an unchanging record of them when it's impossible to achieve the \"ultimate\" performance? The reasons Biss provides would turn Beethoven's frown upside down: there is virtue in reaching for the unreachable and seeking the beauty and the consolation that art mysteriously, yet undeniably, provides. --Erin Kodicek", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 485681, "title": "Beethoven's Shadow (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Jonathan Biss", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 10, "rating_average": 3.9, "rating_total": 39.0}

I grew up in the shadow of the village’s ancient castle where we fished, walked, stole apples, smoked cheap cigarettes and lived a life of great freedom ranging around countryside where motor cars were still sufficiently rare for us to collect their numbers. A practical and headstrong teenager, I left school at the age of 16 years to begin an apprenticeship as a telephone engineer: despite the well-meaning advice of my father and his offer of one pound per week in pocket money, I opted for five pounds a week and a ‘man’s’ life. I enjoyed being an apprentice but it was not stretching – perhaps I should have taken pop’s pound. I took day release in order to study and also studied at night. I read voraciously – mostly science fiction – and wrote occasionally.  By the age of 20 I was married with a child and in the next year arrived at the University of Essex to take a master’s degree in telecommunications. A big change and an introduction to a wider world of thought, a world that I had missed out on by not becoming an undergraduate. On the fun side (also a little bit serious) I realised at this time how bad beer was becoming. I attended the first meeting of CAMRA with a dear old friend, Mike Bennett and together we started the Suffolk branch of the Campaign for Real Ale back in 1974. I became an Essex man, then a Suffolk gentleman (sic), a father of four, the owner of a five acre smallholding and ultimately a high-level manager in British Telecom and a keeper of goats. Around about 1990 BT and I parted company – I started to work for myself. I formed a company and became an author, consultant and educator in some obscure but lucrative areas of telecoms . Telecoms imploded at almost the exact same time that I became disenchanted with it. I had already moved to the beautiful city of Oxford and began to satsify two ambitions: to become an author of non-technical books and an Oxford tour guide. And that’s what I now am.  My main base is still Oxford, but I also live in Stow-on-the-Wold (my wife’s birthplace) and in La Fresneda, Spain which holds many memories of my eldest daughter – now dead. I also travel in a way that I never could when I had a ‘proper job’. In those days I saw the world mostly through the windows of aeroplanes, hotels and offices. Now I venture into that world, travelling slow and staying long.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

But it also challenges by questioning the foundations of those beliefs—especially the assumption that the geopolitical justifications, domestic benefits, and 'national interests' associated with the United States are uncontroversial and clear. . . . Hamilton-Hart’s argument goes beyond familiar arguments about the utilitarian relationship between domestic regime interests and foreign policy alignments . . . she has given students, scholars, and practitioners of Southeast Asian comparative political economy, foreign policy, and international relations much food for thought.\"—Alice Ba,Political Science Quarterly(Summer 2013)\"In this important and well-written study of Southeast Asian attitudes to American power since the end of World War II, Natasha Hamilton-Hart examines 'foreign policy beliefs' in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam. . . . Although she writes in part for a specialist audience of foreign policy and political science scholars . . . the book will be of general interest to historians of Southeast Asia and useful in teaching at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.\"—Tony Day,Pacific Affairs (Dec 2013)\"This fascinating book addresses important questions and offers thought-provoking answers that challenge current directions of debate on the foundations of American primacy, the origins of alignment, and the making of soft power. . . . Hard Interests, Soft Illusions presents a stimulating and important contribution not only to the study of Southeast Asia's international relations and the foundations of American primacy but also to the debate over the origins of alignment and the workings of soft power.\"—Alexander L. Vuving,Asian Politics and Policy(April 2014)\"A major strength ofHard Interests, Soft Illusionsis its perceptive point of departure. Natasha Hamilton-Hart describes the U.S. position in East Asia as hegemonic, despite official discourses in the region portraying the United States as an offshore 'balancer.' Hamilton-Hart suggests that If anybody needs to be ‘balanced’ against (in pure power terms), it is the United States. The book invites us to make a distinction between the political, administrative, and economic elites who, according to her, gain disproportionately from the U.S. role in the region and the general populations of the region, who gain little. Whether or not one agrees with Hamilton-Hart’s thesis, it is a book well worth reading.\"—Yuen Foong Khong, University of Oxford\"Natasha Hamilton-Hart provides a well-researched and trenchant analysis of the reasons for key Southeast Asian states' alignment with the United States. Her findings point to some serious challenges for Washington and its regional security partners in maintaining these relationships in the rapidly changing contemporary strategic context. This book is important reading for scholars of Asia-Pacific international relations as well as U.S. strategy more broadly.\"—Evelyn Goh, University of London", "related": [], "rank": 3327452, "title": "Hard Interests, Soft Illusions: Southeast Asia and American Power", "author": "Natasha Hamilton-Hart", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I spent most of my childhood in a seaside resort town on the south coast of my native England. Eastbourne was a wonderful place to grow up, but sheltered just enough to make me want to go out and spread my wings and see what the rest of the world had to offer! That adventure started after I married a wonderful, young serviceman. After settling into life in the forces, we moved to Germany where we lived for a couple of years. On returning to England and civilian life, we settled in the north where I found work in the more heavily industrialized world of Yorkshire. Very different from the life I had known in a seaside resort! I loved living in and learning about the lifestyles in different parts of England, but my education really expanded when we moved half the world away to Saudi Arabia. The contrast between the coastal mountain areas and the inland, desert cities along with the rich culture and traditions going back literally thousands of years, is something which has affected my life and my writing ever since. Eventually we bid ‘Adieu’ to those exotic, arid lands and returned to the UK. Back home again, I started my own business—a secretarial agency which provided companies with the then-fledgling service of a virtual assistant. We’ve now moved again and this time to Wales, where I’ve settled into my writing career, and very happily draw on my many experiences both at home and abroad. Because those experiences have been so diverse, my books tend to be very different from each other and stand on their own- in plot, characters, culture and background.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.7143, "rating_total": 33.0}

I also grew up with Mercedes cars in my family and an uncle of mine, who had a small collection of pre-war cars, introduced me at the end of the 1960s to vintage cars. That virus never left me again, so from the mid 1970s I started collecting vintage cars myself. Naturally my first such car was a Mercedes, a rather neglected prewar 170V Cabriolet B. Later additions were from a 200D fintail, 250SE, 350SL, 300d Adenauer and a 280SE 3.5 Coupe. Mercedes cars became a passion I have kept and further developed throughout the years.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Abandoned by his wife, he sure could use the money since he is barely making ends meet and is responsible for his two teenage stepchildren and an autistic younger daughter. Whitney is entranced by Gabe's children and the beautiful horses, and she realizes that although Gabe is not the type of man she was looking for, he may turn out to be the man she needs.

The author did a wonderful job making you feel all the pain they endured.The story takes us to the present time where Van and Saldivar meet Indea and Simone. The girls have come to Paris to visit Indea's family and are looking for the company of a Frenchman. What they find is way more than they expected. Unknown to them is that Van and Saldivar were expecting them. How could they know the girls were coming? Are they their life-mates?Although this is a story full of love it is also filled with revenge and hatred. We meet Saldivar's maker, a vampire determined to see that Saldivar is destroyed. Zane not only wants Sadivar destroyed, but all those he loves, Indea, Simone and Van. Does Zane win? Is he strong enough to destroy them all? What did Saldivar do that make Zane hate him so?

After giving security advice to participants in an archeological dig, Jurnet with his love Miriam stops for a picnic on a Norfolk beach. There they discover the mummified corpse of Annie Chance, a single mother who had recently disappeared from a nearby village, having deserted her nearly grown retarded son Timmy. As Jurnet seeks a murderer among those who loved and lusted after Annie, Timmy and his protector, recently widowed Hannah Milburn, provide insights into village life and mores, particularly when it is revealed that Timmy had been involved with two goat farmers who are afflicted with AIDS. As Jurnet hunts for the man Annie might have decamped with, he comes to admire the aristocratic Hannah. A tragedy of misplaced maternal love intermingles with Jurnet's revitalized romance before the story comes full circle.

With Prohibition winding down and the potential for even more money to be made in the liquor business, America's top mobsters agreed to this unprecedented summit and alleged \"peace treaty,\" turning Atlantic City into a \"Camelot of corruption.\" At the core of Tonelli's story, however, is an insistent aversion to myth. By acknowledging the questionable accuracy of \"gangster literature\"--and even getting famous writers to admit that much of the written history of the mob is bullshit--Tonelli debunks the commonly accepted versions of the '29 summit, and crafts a funny, obsessively reported hybrid of a story, part wise guy romp, part investigative mini-masterpiece, and part treatise on fact vs. fancy in the world of Prohibition-era mobsters.

It has become her tradition to celebrate the season of giving with an original short story for her loved ones. Each one is an allegory that represents a concept she has learned or problem she has struggled with during the year. The catalyst came when Audrey began telling oral stories. Soon, she realized that storytelling was a big part of her past with bedtime stories of Dumbo told by Uncle Doc and Grandpap stories told by Dad. As a parent, she told improvised stories to her boys with their teddy bears, not even remembering that her Uncle used to do for her as well. Oddly enough, it was this new found passion of storytelling “finding her” that encouraged her to actually begin publishing the stories that she had written over the years. “Once Upon a Storytime at Christmas” is the compilation of Christmas stories that she traditionally writes each year during the Holidays, so look for more stories to come. The books, video and audio recordings of these stories are available on her website and Amazon.com. Events with these stories and more can be scheduled by contacting Audrey at: www.profundities.net www.onceuponastorytime.net www.facebook.com/audreyleestoryteller", "related": [], "rank": 4835778, "title": "Once Upon a Storytime at Christmas - Christmas Craving eBook", "author": "Audrey Lee", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 9, "rating_average": 4.7778, "rating_total": 43.0}

Forty years later, Susan is still carving new paths and walking on freshly paved roads, only this time the roads lead to her custom home on a hilltop in North Scottsdale, Arizona.  Ms. Fisher was at the forefront of a movement that has become more than a trend.  The movement is one that seeks a balance between a healthy lifestyle and a solid income; it is the direction that many boomers will choose and many generation Xers will insist upon.  The path to this zen balance is telecommuting. Susan has been a telecommuter for 20 years, refining systems and definitions that did not exist back in the early nineties.   She still values living life on her own terms and working to her own rhythm, only now the rhythm includes the role of Business Development,  directing projects with decision makers in corporate America.   Today Ms. Fisher holds a key position in her field.   Her client list has included Dr Pepper, Nike, Rollerblade, Johnson Controls,  the Arizona Diamondbacks, and the J. Paul Getty Museum. Originally from Chicago, IL, Susan has lived on both coasts and in the Midwest.  She has a Master’s Degree in Business Communication from the University of St. Thomas, MN and a Bachelor of Arts Degree, Speech, Communications and Theatre, from Temple University, PA.  She’s had a career in the exhibition and marketing industries for the past twenty five years.  Prior to those career moves, she was a college instructor in Speech/Theatre and a drama coach for primary and secondary schools in the Midwest.  Susan also spent time as a fabric artist and clothing designer.  Ms. Fisher presently bases her operations from a spacious home in the Troon area of North Scottsdale, Arizona.

Sansom' Bookbag 'Clements' thrilling murder mysteries are a real cut above ... steeped in authentic 16th-century politics, the plots are complex and clever, and the characters believable and engrossing. But his greatest gift is the ability to bring to life the squalor, intrigue and perils of Tudor London and amidst it all create a superbly tense and entertaining mystery. Roll on Mr Shakespeare's Act IV' Lancashire Evening Post 'Blending fact with fiction Clements tells a rip-roaring yarn with vigour and energy and a huge enthusiasm for the period ... a novel lacking neither action nor spice. An undeniably enjoyable and lively plot that gathers pace and excitement throughout. A devilishly good read' Crime Time 'There is a veritable cornucopia of elements to praise here ... John Shakespeare is one of the great historical sleuths' Barry Forshaw 'This very well-plotted, erudite, historical mystery has many twists and turns which make for a very vivid story line. A very absorbing read with a real quality, similar in style but perhaps faster moving, than books by James Forrester or C.J. Sansom. I consider it one of the best books I've read this year. I will certainly look out for more stories by this very talented writer' Eurocrime 'What most impressed me was Clements' ability to set a fast-paced crime thriller in the London of 1593 and to make it entirely convincing. Clements gives life to this world, not just through years of painstaking research into all things Elizabethan - from cuisine to clothing, politics to borstals, autopsies to witchcraft - but through his use of real figures from history and the manipulation of actual events. What we end up with is a scenario that is believable, and perhaps this is what makes it such an enjoyable read. Whether intentionally or no, many of the topics dealt with in this book also still resonate today and it gives acts of terrorism, for example, a longer historical context' Edinburgh Book Review 'A cracking plot full of twists right up to the last minute. I look forward to the next' Sunday Express 'Beautifully done ... alive and tremendously engrossing' Daily Telegraph 'A colourful history lesson ... exciting narrative twists' Sunday Telegraph 'Enjoyable, bloody and brutish' Guardian 'An engrossing thriller' Washington Post 'An excellent debut' Publishers Weekly This is a historical thriller to send a shiver down your spine ... atmospheric - the evocation of the filth and debauchery of London is quite exceptional - it demonstrates the compelling eye for detail and character that Bernard Cornwall so memorably brought to Rifleman Sharpe. I could not tear myself away, it is that good Daily Mail Compellingly readable ... easily the equal of its predecessors Good Book Guide", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Professor Walford has enabled us to perceive in the visible world the spiritual meanings inherent within works of art. This collection of essays displays the fruit of his labors through the work of scholars who have received his artistic insights and share his passion for close readings of visual imagery, clear expressions of doctrinal truth, and joyful experiences of aesthetic delight.”—Philip Graham Ryken, President, Wheaton College“Art as Spiritual Perceptionis a rich kaleidoscope of art historical essays all centered around one common theme of increasing importance today—the way in which artists’ views of the world, not least their religious beliefs, shape artistic perception and meaning. I cannot think of a more fitting tribute to the impressive work and legacy of John Walford.”—Adrienne Dengerink Chaplin,coauthor,Art and Soul: Signposts for Christians in the Arts; former senior member in philosophical aesthetics, the Institute for Christian Studies\"It is with great delight that I herald the arrival of Art as Spiritual Perception in honor of Dr. Walford. James Romaine and his fellow scholars have created a fitting work in tribute to Walford and—perhaps more importantly—have added a significant new volume to the select canon of books on art and faith. This is a fantastic book. The chapter on van gogh alone is worth the price of admission.”—Ned Bustard,editor,It Was Good: Making Art to the Glory of God; illustrator,The Church History ABCs“This wide-ranging collection of essays by current colleagues and former students will be an encouragement and inspiration to all who love art and love God.

The story begins 10 years after the inexplicable, violent death of Keith Duncan, drummer for Blue Heron, a popular rock group. The group disbanded shortly after the tragedy, and now, despite ominous phone calls warning its former leader, Jordan Treveryan, against reuniting the band, Jordan brings the group together for a one-night charity gig. Among the Blue Heron alums is his ex-wife, Kathryn. Although reluctant to return to the estate she and Jordan once called home, she bows to pressure from her daughters and a desire to see the old gang again. The mystery surrounding Keith's death intensifies, and Kathy and Jordan come to terms with the past while reflecting on Keith and the changes in all of their lives. Kathy says, \"The Hippies of years gone by become the yuppies of today...Keith got lost in the transition.\" This finely crafted, extremely credible love story is for those who survived the '60s and for anyone else who wants to understand them.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In the full light, this second knight looked even more frightening and dangerous than his companion. Every step he took seemed deliberate and commanding, as if he was a lion surveying his domain. The air surrounding him crackled and even from this distance, Estella could sense the power that emanated from him.Like his friend, he wore a thick woolen cloak that accentuated his warrior's physique. The material stretched across his broad shoulders and draped over his massive chest.He glanced her way as if he was aware of her intense perusal of him. His unwavering gaze made Estella flush.He searched her face, his eyes lingering on her countenance for what felt like an eternity. It was as if he could see through to the center of her being, could hear her thoughts. But how could that be? She had never met this man in her life. And as far as she knew, no one could read minds, could they? Her fingers dug into the trestle table, needing somehow to feel something solid, something to steady her trembling limbs.His eyes scanned over the rest of her body, his gaze settling on her breasts and then her hips. Estella felt an inexplicable urge to cover herself as a wave of heat coursed through her body. He raised his eyes to hers and time stood still.When he broke away from the electrifying contact, Estella felt the warmth being withdrawn as if a servant had opened the shutters, and let the cold air inside. Estella let out her breath in a rush, suddenly aware that she had been holding it.This man was dangerous. That much she could tell, and she suppressed an urge to shudder.--Other books by the author:First Kisses - A Medieval Romance Edition (FREE) The Knights of Honor Trilogy:One True Knight - Book 1A Knight's Duty - Book 2Fallen Knight - Book 3  -Available now! Heart of a Knight", "related": ["B00KY0YURU"], "rank": 650499, "title": "The Promise (A Medieval Novella)", "author": "Dana D'Angelo", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Reaction to this series has been very satisfying to me. Some feedback I've received on Goodreads and Amazon: \"I\n literally consumed those three books when I read them! I sat and read\nthe books in two days, and even when I wasn't reading them I was\nthinking about them. Though from memory I distinctly remember The Mummy\nMonster Game being my favourite, it's safe to say when I read them this\ntime, the last in the series, The Mummy Rescue Mission was my favourite -\n I could literally feel the desperation Harry, Amy and Harry felt in\ntrying to save Aunt Jillian. I had to keep reading at such a fast pace\nas though I had to keep up! I like the idea of mixing video games with\nEgyptology, being that both those things interest me. I'm glad I finally\n got my hands on these books.... now I can read them as often as I\nlike.\"Carli. 5 stars Totally spooky\"This book is great!\n This book had me spooked until the very end. I advise against reading\nit at night unless you're practically fearless.It makes you want to read\n until the very last word. I don't scare easily, but this book managed\nto scare me pretty bad. Plus, it's one of those books that you can read\nand re-read again and again. It's a great, scary book, that pulls you\nright into the action and doesn't let you out until you finish it. I\nrecommend it to anyone that likes to be scared.\"Amazon customer  4 out of 5 stars", "related": [], "rank": 3910619, "title": "The Mummy's Revenge. 1st in The Mummy Monster Game Set", "author": "Roy Pond", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is difficult to imagine a better way to acquire a working knowledge of what the Constitution means, in some of the most important areas. Fallon brings to his subject the sensibilities of a first-class law professor, combined with a sympathetic understanding of what political science can add. I highly recommend it.\" - Barry Friedman, New York University Law School\"Richard H. Fallon has distilled the often unruly and always complex cases into a clear, concise, and beautifully written book. Fallon simplifies without oversimplifying, distills without dumbing down, and writes for a general audience without sacrificing the insights that made his name as an academic. He is one of the most sure-footed and balanced analysts in the legal academy. If you are seeking a smart, accessible, and utterly trustworthy guide to constitutional law, look no farther.\" - Heather Gerken, Yale Law School\"If you read just one book on the U.S. Constitution and Supreme Court, Fallon's Dynamic Constitution is it. And if you read everything on the subject, this up-dated edition should be required reading - you will gain fresh and important insights. Why? In two words: breadth and judgment. Across the full range of current Supreme Court decisions Fallon elucidates doctrine, assesses competing strands of constitutional interpretation, provides historical context enlivened by memorable historical anecdotes, brings into play the background and styles of individual justices, acknowledges the force of practicability in decision making, incorporates recent political science research, and offers a sophisticated judgment of the part politics (only rarely partisan politics) plays in judicial decisions - tracing the Court's interactions with Congress, public opinion, and social movements and the 'political construction' of its authority. Fallon does it all with clarity and verve, and with deep respect for the 'dynamic' constitutional enterprise. We are in the hands of a true master of constitutional law.\" - Nancy L. Rosenblum, Senator Joseph Clark Professor of Ethics in Politics and Government, Department of Government, Harvard University\"Fallon's book is not only a wonderfully sophisticated survey of American constitutional doctrine as developed by the Supreme Court, but it is also, and even more importantly, a powerful argument for why that doctrine matters to lawyers, to judges, to public officials, to the public at large, and to the country as a whole.\" - Frederick Schauer, University of Virginia\"This is a wonderful introduction to American constitutional law. It is clear, lively, and easily accessible to non-lawyers. It is filled with common sense and good judgment. At the same time, though, it is sophisticated in its approach both to the law and to the political setting in which, inevitably, the law develops. Anyone who is interested in the Supreme Court and the Constitution will learn a lot from this book.\" - David A.

Ernst vom Rath, Grynszpan's Prussian diplomat paramour, is bound by tradition and seduced by Nazism's promise of order, discipline, and masculinity, but he cannot resist the younger, moodier Jewish boy he meets in France; thoughts of their trysts haunt him even in the heat of India. Their passion cannot, of course, deny the deportation orders for long, and the boy's suicidal last stand is snapped up by the propaganda ministry's machinations. The rest is, as they say, history. Driven by Greene's fascination with the \"puzzling, annoying, contradictory, adolescent, and tragic\" Grynszpan, the story line oscillates between provocative historical speculation and provocative homosexual erotica. An ambitious fusion for a sensitive moment in Holocaust history, and a significant departure from Greene's South Carolina-based earlier work.Brendan DriscollCopyright © American Library Association.

It is just in his later years that he has decided to bring his work to the public eye. All his works are a product of his life experiences.  “Zivo” his first book is an autobiographical depiction of his travels when he ran away from home at the age of fourteen. Some of the names and places have been changed due to failing memory. Chronologically the events occurred as depicted in the story.   While stationed on Guam after the Second World War he amassed the material for his novel “Marines and renegades.”  “My Corps” His short stories have been praised by his comrades in arms, their coments provided the incentive for him to put them into book form. In his files he has a many completed short stories and a number of novels that if time allows will be set down for our pleasure.

In the late 1980’s computer aided design (CAD) was the thing. At the time there wasn’t a standard system being used; each company had their own program which made it impossible for a consultant to get work because of the learning curve. Computers put him out of work! Then it happened! Glenn was introduced to a new product that blew him away with its simplicity and effectiveness. He started a new business known as Streak-Free.net without a clue how to market it. Computers put him out of business and it was time for them to get Glenn back in business, so he bought a computer. Now the fun begins. Glenn had to decide to pay for “Advertising or invest in himself to learn “Marketing”. He invested and has been a student and implementer of Internet Marketing ever since. StreakFreePro.com had been #1 on Google for 8 years running. We got bumped a little from the last algorithm change, “Hummingbird”, competing against 70 to 80 million websites for that top spot!", "related": [], "rank": 1151785, "title": "Glenn J Fournier's Marketing Secrets For Architects eBook", "author": "Glenn Fournier", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After creating a series of short fantasy pieces for a class assignment that were received with praise, he was hooked on writing fiction for the entertainment of others. Now Brandon writes supernatural horror as well as fantasy, science fiction, and other genres. His short fiction is available online in various formats. Brandon still lives on the family farm in northwestern North Carolina with his wife and family. Taking inspiration from his homeland, he brings southern sensibilities and a modern flair to these classic genre themes.

Bonnie moved to Baja in 2000 for a fresh start and more time to write. She enjoys writing mysteries and thrillers but wanted to do something that would help make a positive difference in people's lives. After years of insomnia and wrestling with depression, she knew she was on to something when she came up with the idea of bedtime stories for adults. It was actually a break in at her house that spawned the idea. Unable to sleep and fighting nightmares when she did, something had to give. There is nothing more rewarding than helping other people overcome a problem, she said. She is very excited about doing more volumes of Peaceful Tales.

He started computer programming in 1969, and went to work for IBM when he was 20. Over the years he also worked for the likes of ITT, Wang and BBN, and was, for two decades, a leading authority on IBM networking. Writing, however, has been a consuming pastime since the early 1980s. His first book was published in 1984. Four further books on technology as well as over 350 technical publications followed. Around 2006, with IBM networking an oxymoron, he turned his attention to papal history, art and astronomy. He is the sole-author of twenty books.

Carlisle, a self-described liberal who practices in La Luz, Calif., gets pulled into a family drama when an unscrupulous freelance writer tries to blackmail her wealthy kin. All the Carlisles have deep, dark secrets—K.C. herself, her mother, two brothers, and two cousins, not to mention her late, sainted father, a judge. The premise strains credulity, as does the blackmailer being stupid enough to invite the victims to come one at a time to her apartment. Still, K.C. does a decent job investigating the case and putting the pieces together. When a potential love interest says to her, You've slept around some, and she shrugs, the reader is likely to laugh out loud. Hard-boiled? Not so much.

The book largely focuses on domestic cats, although three chapters are devoted to a general discussion of a wide selection of wild species. In the context of this work, welfare primarily refers to general care of domesticated cats in the home setting—including some basic information on health care—as it pertains to an animal's overall well-being. Readers should appreciate that this is not a book about the ethics of animal rights. General audiences will easily understand most of the text, although the writing tends to be rather verbose and needlessly repetitious. The author does a good job of putting details of feline behavior into perspective to the overall mental and physical health of the domesticated cat; however, the brief discussion of anatomy and physiology is of more limited value, especially for laypersons, and is not well tied into its underlying role in driving behavior. A selection of 90 black-and-white photographs varies widely in quality.

Au départ, j’étais surtout passionné par la lecture, puis, un jour j’ai eu envie d’écrire à mon tour des histoires. Assez vite, j’y ai trouvé beaucoup de plaisir et j’ai laissé venir les récits au gré de mon inspiration. Les thèmes se développaient naturellement, ce qui m’a entraîné sur des chemins assez divers : -Le polar avec une héroïne sexy, une rousse flamboyante, Victoria Salinger (Requiem en OGM mineur, Sea, secte & sun) qui m’a été inspiré, en partie, par le style déjanté de Frédéric Dard avec son personnage, le commissaire San-Antonio. -D’autres polars ou romans psychologiques, d’une écriture plus classique, sont issus à la fois de mon expérience personnelle et professionnelle (La dormeuse d’Abou Simbel ; La partition oubliée ). -Le roman érotique avec « Delirium Eroticum ». J’ai participé également à des concours de scénarios. En février 2003, j’ai obtenu le prix du scénario du mois décerné par la société WriteMovies.com (Los Angeles) pour « Le jour où le Grand Esprit se mit à chanter » et en mars 2009, le même prix pour « Un amour de bonobo ». Bio : Psychologue clinicien formé à la psychanalyse et à l’hypnose. Publie en 2004, Stars War Academy. En 2010 « Requiem en OGM mineur » aux éditions Nuits Blanches, roman qui figure parmi les romans sélectionnés dans les  « coups de cœur » de la bibliothèque des Chiroux à Liège en 2011. Le livre fera partie des lectures demandées aux élèves de terminale d’un collège de Liège pour le cours de français.

Dark tale is rather vague and it's not in the form of a nursery rhyme. This story is hard to classify. The tale's short, direct narrative and cautionary aspects are reminiscent of fairy tales, but unlike fairy tales, the story has no magical elements. As for horror, an horrific event takes place and Fawkes flirts with seeing a ghost, but the story is not intended to evoke chills. So what is it? It's a fractured nursery rhyme in the tradition of fractured fairy tales.

That movie captured my imagination as a small boy and never let go. Over the years, I have read hundreds of sci-fi novels, and have watched more sci-fi movies and TV shows than I would care to admit. So, I approached the writing of my novels as the next logical (thanks Spock) step in my sci-fi journey. I have always loved sci-fi and will continue to love it for all of the fun and creativity it provides to my life. I hope you enjoy my books, and I hope they spark something in your imagination.I would also take this opportunity to mention that while my books are not written for young adults, they are family friendly. You will not find any vulgarity or explicit scenes in my writings. That's just not my style.Thanks again for stopping by,Ron", "related": ["B00LDCER4E"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 25, "rating_average": 3.48, "rating_total": 87.0}

We visit Dead Cities like the skyscrapered, yet bizarrely empty, attempts by China and North Korea to proclaim ideological success. Unused spaces enclosed by highways fall within No Man’s Lands. Lost Spaces range from tiny islands that come and go, with shifting conditions, to Leningrad, Russia, which was renamed St. Petersburg. International airspace, a peninsula-consuming Greek monastery, and a Somalian pirate feral city fall under Spaces of Exception. A section on breakaway nations includes a chunk of India within an Indian enclave in Bangladesh. Floating Islands come made of pumice, trash, ice, and modern building materials. The strongest places concern human adaptation. These Ephemeral Places contain a parking lot where work-desperate airport employees, including many pilots, lay over in RVs. The erudite Bonnett explores the roots of place all the way to childhood hideaways, yet the book doesn’t build. The many locations remain detached. --Dane Carr", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That ending evolved into a novella, which evolved into a book, which evolved into a series about something completely different than what it started out to be. The characters of the story got a grip on her soul and thus the Star-Born series came into being. Erin lives in an apartment with her husband of nine years, Rodney, and her three cats and overgrown furball of a husky. She leads a quiet life, and can usually be found either on the computer writing at all hours of the day or night, or discussing God with her husband. She is a hopeless romantic and loves all the sweet, sappy movies that her husband detests. Erin plays piano and sings in her spare time, and all the artwork in the series is of her creation. The rest of her time she spends writing about the quirky mix of characters that have so captured her heart.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has to be tough, as an officer in\n the violent crimes unit, but that doesn't mean her potency is\nimpenetrable. As she searches for the killer, the ghost who comes and\nkills women seemingly at random, only to vanish without a trace, Angela\nhas to face her own demons in order to solve the case.\nThe author has a background in criminal\nlaw enforcement, and it is clear from the way the scenes depicting the\ncase are described so intensely rooted in reality. Nevertheless, the\njourney to find the killer, although it goes cold for more than a year,\nis always hot on the pages of this novel, causing the reader to try to\nfigure out who is the culprit before Angela herself even has the chance\nto. The suspense builds from chapter to chapter, culminating in an\nunexpected reveal at the end of the narrative that will shock the reader\n through and through. Worley clearly has a knack for developing a\nconcise and chilling crime drama, and with his latest book, 'Ghost,'\nthis sentiment remains true.   ---  Red City Review, Pittsburgh, PA", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However, I wanted to create a world where individuals are generally accepted regardless of appearance or belief. Each individual has different strengths and weaknesses, but each can contribute to the resolution of conflicts or issues. Instead, I like the idea of playing with persecution based on age. It's certainly not dissimilar to persecution based on race or religion; yet, I think it's interesting to contemplate. While not immediately obvious in book one, readers will find a loose (and I emphasize loose) correlation to WWII as the series continues.In addition to exploring persecution, I also wanted the story to be fun to read. Most of my characters are different species, but you'll find their day-to-day issues are consistent with those we face here on Earth. You can easily find yourself lost in the journey and the various trials the marked ones face. You can laugh at their antics and cringe when the bad guys are close. Of course, all with a focus on solving the key question presented: Who is the next Miyran Heir?", "related": ["B00HK1HDZC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

You would have a hard time finding anyone who would tell you any different.  Like most serious survivalists, he lacks finesse in human interactions (to put it lightly).

Obsessive-compulsive by nature, he has meticulously crafted every detail of Calizona into a living, breathing world based on real-world science.        \"Who the hell says the end of the world can't be fun?\" Says Ralph.  \"When I created Calizona I wanted a different type of EOW story.  Instead of heroes who are thrown into the abyss unprepared, I wanted a story about what would happen if people had their shit together going into an event.  I was sooo tired of seeing how idiots and amateurs would do it.  We have seen that story over and over again.  I wanted to see how professionals would do it.  Could they avoid the usual pitfalls?  The answer is that they simply move to a new level of problems to contend with.

It is not as if i am innocent. On the contrary, my twenties were spent in a zone of perpetual partying.But the celibacy had diminished my sexual confidence, so when i was close to the object of my unexpected desire, i felt like a silly school girl - like a veteran/virgin or something. Stumbling over my words, never really being able to say what i wanted to say...at the age of 52, this was a humbling experience.So i decided to write something \"witty\" to send as a birthday gift, with the hope of stealing his heart. And this erotic fantacy unfolded. The creative process was a pure joy. And then i actually had the guts to send it.It was not received with the same enthusiasm. Never mind the beautiful bedroom that Jade and the Zen master never got to, i never even got to kiss him, although i had given him 4 reflexology/massage therapies...hmmm truly an exquisite body... Unforgetable but i am back on the straight and narrow again. Free, independent and a little heart broken. (Also a little relieved)The Riverstone is such a delightful fantasy, i decided to offer it to the world...a sweet and short gift for all of those who love falling in love.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It’s a fault that lands her in more danger than she bargains for while camping in the back-country of the Rocky Mountain National Park.Ranger Joel Morgan is used to having the upper hand in all his cases—until he runs into the headstrong blond while investigating disturbing incidents of poaching in the park. Brittany’s imprudent lie of omission awakens ghosts in his past, making the sizzling attraction between them unwelcome.As he searches for evidence he can trust her, the monster mutilating wildlife turns his sights on Brittany, and Joel discovers he’ll do whatever it takes to protect her—even give his own life.EXCERPT:“Find anything interesting up there?” Randy Gifford asked.“Just a camper in a restricted area.”“You think it could be the guy you’re looking for?”“It’s a woman. Camping where she shouldn’t be. I’m going to make sure she leaves in the morning, then return to my original route.”“You may want to reconsider. That storm front I mentioned earlier is moving a lot faster than expected. It’s over the Never Summer Mountain Range and will reach your area tonight. Temperature’s dropping, too, so be prepared.”Joel surveyed the heavy, gray clouds he’d noticed earlier. “What are they forecasting?”“If it keeps moving, a couple inches. If it stalls, up to a foot.”He muttered a curse. That would be a problem. “If that happens, we could be up here for a few days, so yeah, scrap the original route. The closest trailhead is Longs Peak, can you get someone to drop off my truck and trailer over there in the morning?”“Will do.”Five minutes later, he rode back into Brittany Lucas’s camp as she threw a couple pieces of wood on the campfire that’d been nothing but banked coals when he left. She brushed off her hands before bracing them on her hips.“Now what?”He dismounted to unpack his gear. “I’ll be camping here with you tonight.”“Ranger Morgan, let me assure you, I have every intention of leaving in the morning.”“And until then, I’ll make sure you stay safe.”“I don’t need you to babysit me,” she insisted, irritation flooding her voice as she sat by the fire.Ignoring the fact she’d heard him earlier, he met her stare over the top of Nobel’s saddle. “You got a gun?”Her gaze faltered. “No.”“Well, the poacher does, so I’m staying.” That shut her up, until he tossed his sleeping bag inside her tent.COLORADO TRUST SERIESEvidence of Trust, Book 1Trust by Design, Book 2, coming May 2014Trust in the Lawe, Book 3, coming May 2014Shattered Trust, Book 4, coming May 2014Dare to Trust, Book 5, coming May 2014", "related": ["B005GFBQWU"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 15, "rating_average": 4.8, "rating_total": 72.0}

Messenger starts a trilogy withGuardian...Within this everyday world is a great cast of\ncharacters who bring life to the story -- a feat that couldn't be done\nwithout Messenger's distinctive literary style and voice. From the\nordinary comes the extraordinary, where one's character and motives are\ntested. Where what one wants and what one needs may not co-exist; where\nduty and love are in conflict. Messenger writes an emotional, tender\nlove story about possibilities.\"-Happy Ever AfterSpecial for USA TODAY5-Star Review:\"The sign of a good YA/NA novel is when those of us who are somewhat more than YA/NA can also appreciate the story. AJ Messenger captures all the slang/angst...that is\nbeing a teenager - without talking down to her primary audience or\nassuming they can't handle well written, thoughtful prose. At times funny, dark, terrifying...we are taken on a startling and romantic romp with heroine Declan...and hero Alexander, to discover a world she could never have imagined, and a love he could never have envisioned.
