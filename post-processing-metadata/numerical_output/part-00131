A maturing portrait emerges, from bumptious young State Department code clerk during WWI to the man behind Walter Mitty, and the milieu of the old New Yorker comes similarly to life. The early letters to his Ohio State fraternity pal and college sweetheart are both sophomoric and romantic. After being posted to Paris and returning to the U.S. at the height of the Roaring 20s, Thurber's stylistic craftsmanship has begun to catch up with his sophisticated wit, which comes to fruition when he joins Harold Ross's New Yorker to edit, write, and rewrite \"Talk of the Town\" and draw dog cartoons. Thurber employs comedy adeptly and variously to woo several objects of affection and infatuation, to spar with the editorially prickly Ross and to construct droll personae to deal with life's predicaments and to amuse his recipients. The letters hit their peak of hilarity and exuberance in the late 1920s, just before he achieves unexpected fame as a bestselling author, with E.B. White, of Is Sex Necessary?. The chief pleasures here are the free and uncensored jokes (and drawings) and the occasional glimpses, behind Thurber's authorial mask, of a disappointed lover, discontented spirit, Civil War buff and Henry James devotee. For all the padding with prosaic entries, this carnival of correspondence, edited by Thurber's daughter and his biographer, fulfills its promise of wit and wisdom. 16 pages of b&w photos, 15 line drawings.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His pulse beat in his ears, making him feel like he was being tossed around in one of the dryers.From the first time Liam had seen her, over a year ago, when he'd initially moved into the neighborhood, his fantasy machine had been set to play reel after reel of Jenny 24/7—during the night, during the day… Nope, he never failed to fall asleep picturing how her short, smartly styled blond hair curled to a nape he'd love to nuzzle. How her blue eyes sparkled with the wit and dry humor that attracted so many friends…and probably admirers. How her plump red lips shaped into something sweet and cherrylike, as if ready to be tasted. How her pale skin covered a figure blessed with ample womanly curves.Normally those curves were decorated with chic clothing when Jenny appeared in the Club. In fact, she liked to dress as fashionably as a 1950s movie goddess who lounged in a swank living room while she posed for photos in a feature article about domestic bliss.But today, there was a difference in Jenny.In his corner, Liam leaned his chair back against a dryer on the wall, quietly assessing her.As she made her way to the seats in front of the television, her expression seemed dazed. Her arms were folded on her chest, and her usually perfect hair was pulled back into a tiny ponytail, as if she hadn't taken any care with it. She also wasn't wearing makeup—she didn't really need it, Liam thought—and the lack of her usual pizzazz made her seem… softer.Sadder?But most noticeably of all, she wore a drab, oversized, long-sleeved shirt over baggy khaki pants with sneakers.Definitely not like Jenny at all.Something was clearly up with her, but…Well, Liam wasn't sure why he should involve himself by asking about her mood, since he seemed to be the bane of her existence. So he went back to typing in HTML codes for a Web site he was designing for a nearby jewelry boutique. Today, Web sites. Tomorrow, full-on small-business consulting. That was Liam's plan.But Jenny kept drawing his attention, and maybe that made sense, since he'd often teased her about teaming up with him to start a consulting firm. After all, Jenny Hunter had a reputation as a crackerjack businesswoman, and she would be a great asset. She always brushed off his jokes, however, even if he wasn't entirely kidding.She hadn't taken a seat yet. In fact, she seemed to be shying away from all the other Sudsers. A few ladies discreetly traded questioning glances when she wasn't looking, and this told Liam that they also suspected something was happening with the usually confident businesswoman.Come to think of it, Liam reflected, Jenny had been getting quieter and more pensive lately, hadn't she?The final minutes of a game show that precededFlamingo Beach—the main reason everyone gathered in the Suds Club at this hour—played out on the TV. One of the women, an Eastern Indian named Evina, tried to draw Jenny into conversation. Yet the object of Liam's attention merely held up a finger, told Evina she would be right back, and headed straight for the drinks machine, as if retreating.Her path would lead her past him, and his belly tightened.He righted his plastic seat, the movement sending a twinge to his right leg, where underneath his worn jeans, scars covered an ache that was throbbing more than usual today.Maybe the reminder of his injury—and the habit of covering it with a smart-ass personality—urged him to stop Jenny as she passed. Or maybe it was because her sorrowful gaze somehow didn't sit right with him. Whatever it was, Liam closed the lid of his laptop, offering her a grin while folding his hands behind his head. \"Halloween come a few weeks early this year?\"She slowed down, just now seeming to notice that he was in his usual corner. Then, as she came to a full stop, her eyes lost their haziness and seemed to focus.In their blue depths, Liam detected the color of anxiety… maybe even fear. He'd seen the same hue in the mirror years ago, after his accident.Should he ask her what was wrong?\"Your clothes,\" he continued, nodding toward her blasé garb. \"It's… just a different look for a fashionista like you.\"Okay, that was close to inquiring about her personal life. For him, anyway.She frowned, glancing down at her outfit, then almost absently pulled her shirt away from her chest, as if trying to make her clothing even baggier. She was obviously not comfortable in them. Was not comfortable even being here today.Liam knitted his brow, but he didn't venture another comment.Could her attitude have something to do with how she'd missed her usual Wednesday-work-from-home lunch hour this week? She never failed to show up at the appointed time, but she'd been conspicuously absent yesterday.He'd been all too cognizant of that.\"You had a lot of work going on yesterday?\" he asked. Translation:What's with your change in schedule and appearance?Jenny swallowed, hesitated. Then a change seemed to take her over, as if she were forcing herself to put on some act. She even tilted her chin a little higher, taking the argumentative stance she always assumed around him.But there was something missing—heart. Spirit.\"Yeah,\" she said. \"I was really swamped with a project, and I needed every hour available to me. Today's better.\"\"Must've been some project.\"\"It was.\" Her eyes got that faraway look again. \"Huge.\"Liam motioned to his corner of the Laundromat. \"Just set up your office in here. There's plenty of room, and you'll never missFlamingo Beachat the Suds Club again.\"He'd hoped to see a sign of the old Jenny: maybe she'd plant her hands on her hips, as she often did while bantering with him.McCree,she would say,squatting in a Laundromat instead of renting real office space might be the gypsy thing to do, but I need more organization. More room. More professionalism.But now she only ran a glance over him, as if she were seeing him for the first time: a guy in a corner, with a slight goatee, shaggy brown hair, comfortable clothes and that gypsy attitude.His temperature rose and she looked away, catching herself.Hell, Liam almost thought she was interested.Doubtful.\"Things going okay at work?\" he asked.She was a hot dog at the Kendrick Corporation in San Francisco proper, where she dreamed up marketing plans for big accounts.\"McCree,\" she said, \"if you're going to tease me about working for your hardly existent business today…\"\"It'll exist.\"\"Oh, I don't doubt it.\" She gripped the hem of her shirt. \"Just not with me.\"\"Hey.\" He leaned forward. The change in position sent a thread of discomfort through his leg, but he ignored it. \"Anytime you want to get away from all the corporate red tape at Kendrick, you just let me know.\"The offer was genuine, and she seemed to realize that for the first time. Her hands dropped to her sides as she turned her face away; then she nodded, biting her bottom lip.Her innocent gesture blasted him. He'd imagined the feel of those swollen lips so many times, wished to experience the cherry taste of them. A million shivers danced over his skin as he told himself it would never happen, not with a woman who had always seemed to think he was more of an irritant than a true possibility.Besides, Liam doubted he had it in him to make any woman happy in the long run, after she saw beneath all his coverings and witnessed the injuries, the damage.But when Jenny's gaze met his, a jolt of electricity seemed to zap between them.Then she looked away again.A few heartbeats thudded by, marking the seconds, the burning aftermath.Had she felt it, too?He shifted in his seat again, and his leg screamed— a sharp reminder of his imperfections.Of reality.Meanwhile, Jenny's hands still hung at her sides, and her eyes had gone back to that empty look that blocked any sparks he'd seen during these past few seconds.Strangely moved by the change, Liam found himself overstepping his bounds. \"Jenny, is everything really okay with you?\"As her eyes widened—what, did she think she could hide it from him?—she twisted the hem of her shirt and pulled it away from her body, camouflaging every natural, beautiful curve.\"I'm fine,\" she said, her voice sounding choked.Before he could follow up, she rushed toward the soda machine, digging into her pants pockets for money.It felt as if the oxygen had been shoved out of his lungs. He was used to Jenny's shrugging him off and then eventually wandering past him again to continue whatever argument they'd been having before. But this time? He doubted she'd be back. Not when they both knew she was lying about being okay.While Jenny kept her back to Liam, one of the Suds Club's regulars turned up the TV.Flamingo Beachwas on, and everyone in the Laundromat had deserted their washers, their folding, and gravitated toward the seats in front of the screen. Earlier, they'd been guessing what might happen at Trina and Dash's wedding, but now there was respectful silence as the bride got ready to walk down the aisle.Liam flipped up the top of his computer and reim-mersed himself in his work.By the time the bell on the Laundromat's door dinged, signaling the arrival of Mei Webb, Liam was already well into pretending to have no interest in the soap opera—or the people in the Suds Club—whatsoever.Even though he was much too aware of Jenny, still standing with her back to him at the soda machine.Jenny stared at the buttons on the vending machine.Water. Orange soda. Apple juice.As she tried to concentrate on each offering, she rubbed her arms, hoping to calm the tremor that was running over her skin.It was cold—that was all. The air outside was getting autumny, the leaves were tu...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

You might call these periodic tables of the planetary energies, or three octaves of three notes apiece.The planets in the first row are personal. This is a little more physically graphic with the planets than with the signs. Just as the heart chakra is the center of a person's being and life force, so the Sun is the center of the solar system. The Sun is a person's core identity, his or her ego in the sense of a centripetal force that keeps him or her directed and connected. Astrology works not through rays that extend from the Sun, Moon, and planets, but through the mirroring of the solar system within people: microcosm mirroring macrocosm. The mirror of the Sun in people is the central, harmonizing heart chakra in a static, akashic sense and the central flow of his or her life's path in a dynamic, pranic sense. If a person says \"I\" and points to himself, he is pointing to his heart chakra. When someone asks \"How's your life been?\" they are asking about this central current of the Sun.The planets nearest the Sun are close to the creative outpouring from one's central being, just as physically they are nearest the radiance of the Sun. Also, the closer a planet is to the Sun the shorter is its year, and the faster it moves. This means that the inner planets have a high-pitched, personal vibration. They are intimately connected with personal expression and changes in life-direction. They are like filters for the radiance of the Sun, and they bubble along the surface of the life flow.The outer planets, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, are more attuned to the infinity of space. Their vibrations correspond to the deep, low-pitched bass notes of an organ that permeate and form a foundation for a musical composition. They are closer to the no-thing of mysticism than to the day-to-day life of the inner planets. They spend hundreds of years in one circle of the Sun; they rule broad social change and broad social ego. However, as with the signs, the state of consciousness of one of these transcendental outer planets does not a spiritual state make, although these planets are sometimes closer to spiritual states than are the inner planets. The outer planets are attuned to the universal akasha of outer space, while the inner planets are more attuned to the pranic energy pouring from the Sun.The intermediate planets in the middle rows act in a way similar to that of the signs of the zodiac's middle sector. These planets are involved with material manifestation and interaction between people and entities. Their vibrational pitch is halfway between the high-pitched piccolo of the inner planets and the deep bass of the outer. Their periods of revolution are also intermediate. Where the inner planets have periods of revolution on the order of months, the middle planets take two to twenty-nine years to complete a cycle. Within each row the planets are divided into three columns that also reflect a trinity. This trinity has been labeled Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, but this is only a rough approximation. One may think of the planetary rulers as a trinity of trinities.A trinity that is useful for understanding the rows and columns is that of coming from a central core to the surface, spreading along the surface, then being withdrawn from the surface back to the central core. This trinity happens within our bodies through the arteries, capillaries, and veins which handles our bloodstream. The arteries split the bloodstream into finer and finer paths on the way to the surface, the capillaries exchange energy at the surface, and the veins integrate the bloodstream into larger and larger vessels on the way back to the heart. Seen in spiritual terms, this is spirit coming up to the surface of life (manifestation) and becoming individualized (Brahma), operating on the surface of life as individuals (Vishnu), then withdrawing back to unity within (Shiva). This same trinity happens in the sectors of the signs.Each column is identified with one of the three qualities, Cardinal, Fixed, and Mutable. However, the columns are different for the two different currents.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Arts & Photography", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

B. Story is a writer living in the southwestern United States. While that territory can cover anywhere from New Mexico to Hawaii he declines to be more specific at this time. His use of the time-honored artifice of writing under a pseudonym comes from the necessity to still maintain a day job and the habit of employers to Google new applicants to discover what stupid things said applicant is willing to foolishly do, and then doubly foolishly post for the world to see afterwards. Such invasions of one's personal life become an unnecessary distraction. D. B. Story has long had interests in both Science Fiction (since first discovering his mother's secret cache of Ace Doublebooks stashed under her bed) and writing. In fact, anything he has enjoyed participating in he eventually has a desire to create as well. He seriously began writing (although not selling) stories ten years ago due to a dissatisfaction with what he was reading at the time and the belief that he could do it better. He started out with the interaction between humans and the sexy robots they would inevitably create and later branched out to other erotic Fantasy and SF genres. During that time he has written everything from flash fiction to a 402,000 word novel and a screenplay based on his other writings, as yet unsold. Whether his writing is actually \"better\" he admits he must leave to his readers to decide, but he likes his stuff a lot. He has often said that, \"Writing time is always good time.\" He also says that with the advent of cheap computers, word processors, eBooks, and the Internet that times have never been better for a diversity of writers to be heard.", "related": ["B003B66HVQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Snow was born in Leicester, on 15 October 1905. He was educated from age 11 at Alderman Newton's School for boys where he excelled in most subjects, enjoying a reputation for an astounding memory. In 1923, he gained an external scholarship in science at London University, whilst working as a laboratory assistant at Newton's to gain the necessary practical experience, because Leicester University, as it was to become, had no chemistry or physics departments at that time. Having achieved a first class degree, followed by a Master of Science he won a studentship in 1928 which he used to research at the famous Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. Snow went on to become a Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1930 where he also served as a tutor, but his position became increasingly titular as he branched into other areas of activity.  In 1934, he began to publish scientific articles in 'Nature', and then 'The Spectator' before becoming editor of the journal 'Discovery' in 1937.  He was also writing fiction during this period and in 1940 'Strangers and Brothers' was published. This was the first of eleven novels in the series and was later renamed 'George Passant' when 'Strangers and Brothers' was used to denote the series itself. 'Discovery' became a casualty of the war, closing in 1940. However, by this time Snow was already involved with the Royal Society, who had organised a group to specifically use British scientific talent operating under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour. He served as the Ministry's technical director from 1940 to 1944.  After the war, he became a civil service commissioner responsible for recruiting scientists to work for the government and also returned to writing, continuing the 'Strangers and Brothers' novels.  'The Light and the Dark' was published in 1947, followed by 'Time of Hope' in 1949, and perhaps the most famous and popular of them all, 'The Masters', in 1951. He planned to finish the cycle within five years, but the final novel 'Last Things' wasn't published until 1970. C.P. Snow married the novelist Pamela Hansford Johnson in 1950 and they had one son, Philip, in 1952.  He was knighted in 1957 and became a life peer in 1964, taking the title Baron Snow of the City Leicester.  He also joined Harold Wilson's first government as Parliamentary Secretary to the new Minister of Technology. When the department ceased to exist in 1966 he became a vociferous back-bencher in the House of Lords. After finishing the 'Strangers and Brothers' series, Snow continued writing both fiction and non-fiction. His last work of fiction was 'A Coat of Vanish', published in 1978. His non-fiction included a short life of Trollope published in 1974 and another, published posthumously in 1981, 'The Physicists: a Generation that Changed the World'. He was also inundated with lecturing requests and offers of honorary doctorates. In 1961, he became Rector of St. Andrews University and for ten years also wrote influential weekly reviews for the 'Financial Times'.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I found myself liking Jane, angry at Fanny, and frustrated with Bobby. I really enjoyed the neighbors and their friends also. The love scenes are vivid and searing. The reader finds herself rooting for Jane and Bobby, and hoping that Fanny will find her comeuppance. The twists and turns in the story really keep the reader involved.Jane's personality develops from an insecure, reclusive, one-dimensional person, to a well-rounded woman with friends and a life outside of her laptop. Fanny's downward spiral is fascinating. This is a wonderful novel that I read in one sitting. 4 1/2 Hearts,Maura Frankman, The Romance StudioNot your typical romance, this tale is as much about Fanny and her problems as it is about Jane finding herself and true love. While Fanny's exploits are self-centered and destructive, readers will root for Jane and Bobby. 4 Stars--Karen Sweeny-Justice, Romantic Times Book Club", "related": ["B00HQM8X68"], "rank": 4214481, "title": "Plain Jane's Tight End", "author": "Liz Hunter", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was an early champion of democracy and religious freedom, notable for his good relations and successful treaties with the Lenape Indians. Under his direction, the city of Philadelphia was planned and developed. In 1681, King Charles II handed over a large piece of his American land holdings to William Penn to satisfy a debt the king owed to Penn's father. This land included present-day Pennsylvania and Delaware. Penn immediately sailed to America and his first step on American soil took place in New Castle in 1682. On this occasion, the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new Proprietor, and the first general assembly was held in the colony. Afterwards, Penn journeyed up river and founded Philadelphia. However, Penn's Quaker government was not viewed favorably by the Dutch, Swedish, and English settlers in what is now Delaware. They had no \"historical\" allegiance to Pennsylvania, so they almost immediately began petitioning for their own Assembly. In 1704 they achieved their goal when the three southernmost counties of Pennsylvania were permitted to split off and become the new semi-autonomous colony of Lower Delaware. As the most prominent, prosperous and influential \"city\" in the new colony, New Castle became the capital. As one of the earlier supporters of colonial unification, Penn wrote and urged for a Union of all the English colonies in what was to become the United States of America. The democratic principles that he set forth in the Pennsylvania Frame of Government served as an inspiration for the United States Constitution. As a pacifist Quaker, Penn considered the problems of war and peace deeply, and included a plan for a United States of Europe (\"European Dyet, Parliament or Estates\") in his voluminous writings.", "related": [], "rank": 34359, "title": "A Brief Account of the Rise and Progress of the People Called Quakers", "author": "William Penn", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He published his first essentially autobiographical novel The Man from the North in 1898.

The Stalker was based upon the true life event of a nearly fatal missed diagnosis, and the subsequent struggle by Ms. Goldstein's daughter to survive with an incurable, although manageable, disease. Pracilla is currently working on a prequel to The Stalker. Ms. Goldstein was born and raised in the Texas Panhandle located within the infamous tornado alley. As a child, Pracilla and her family scurried underground on numerous occasions to seek shelter from the indiscriminate brutality of Mother Nature's ire. The Panhandle also known for its leg-stinging dirt devils, tumbling tumbleweeds and blowing horizontal snowstorms has weather to suit residents with a flavor for all seasons. One day stands out in particular in Pracilla's mind as a teen. She arose in the morning to a blue sky and bright, warm sunshine. Giant plumes of fluffy benign clouds billowed across the sky, but were soon surreptitiously supplanted with rumbling thunderheads. The black clouds soon gave way to a frog-drowning gully washer. That afternoon, a blue-norther blew in and turned the liquid precipitation into small pellets of ice and snow. Then, just as quickly as the storm blew in, it blew out, and the snow melted as the sun, again, emerged from it's heavenly hiding place. There is a saying amongst the locals of the Texas Panhandle, \"If you don't like the weather, just stick around awhile.\" Ms. Goldstein retired in 2003 after a twenty year career in the legal profession. She presently resides in central Texas with her three adult children and their spouses. Pracilla has been blessed with five wonderful grandchildren.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

(I love that about you!) I invited fans to create a character who would have a speaking role in a future Fool's Gold book. I honestly thought that I would give the character only a walk-on part, but the character they created - Cameron McKenzie, the new Fool's Gold veterinarian - turned out to be so intriguing that I had to write a book for him.We started with nothing. Fans voted on the character's gender, age, occupation, back story, name... and they even gave Cameron an adorable daughter named Kaitlyn and a dog named Noah. Noah is a girl, by the way - yep, my fans came up with that, too!", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 37, "rating_average": 3.8649, "rating_total": 143.0}

She strives to Live out her Purpose, which she deems the Creator has given her. A servant of YHWH and believer in CHRIST, Sistah Kenya is also an Author, Poet, Educator, Mentor and Mother. Sistah Kenya is also the First Lady of Spiritual Minded Magazine and Radio. She and AJ Rok have collaborated to bring a sanctified swagga to the world wide radio industry.      Sistah Kenya aspires to become a well renown author, not only so her voice will be heard, but with hopes that souls will be saved and lives changed. The inspiration for her latest series, Soul Savers, is to reach out to the lost in a way that will be receptive. Bridging the gap between what some might call secular and sacred.  Although her novels are created with this thought in mind, she hopes many will enjoy these uplifting, spiritual, erotica tales.  Over the past year her focus has been to encourage other self-published authors, as well as up & coming authors like herself. She teamed up with The Green Room Actors Lounge in Atlanta, owned and operated by Terri J. Vaughn, to achieve this goal.

Bridget, the main character,\nquickly discovers who she really is and what she's up against in the Fae World.\nShe's becomes acquainted with Irish relatives, learns she is a land owner, and\nwhen events go awry, Bridget becomes quite the sleuth with the help of a\ntalking dog who in actuality, is an entity from the Fae World.Meanwhile, Mary, her bestfriend and travel companion to the Emerald Isle,\ndiscovers life can be enjoyable and not dictated by a 9 to 5 job. She finds\nmeeting an intriguing, intelligent, hunk might just be her match and what she's\nbeen missing in her life.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was pure entertainment, an easy read and I\nthink Mrs. Crepeau put a wee bit of herself into Bridget.

I'm a native of the earth. Tom (my husband) and I have had the pleasure of visiting many countries. Of all the countries I've been to, India is my favorite. Camel carts, and tea vendors on the street are some of my favorite sights. Europe, in all its splendor, is beautiful and fascinating. I loved the majestic mountains of Northern Italy, and the rustic hominess of the French countryside. Now, though, I spend my time in a more mundane fashion at home. We live on a little ranchette outside Tucson, Arizona, and just between us...I love it. We sell eggs at the local farmer's market, grow a healthy and beautiful garden, and keep a range of livestock.  There's Jack, the retired prima donna show horse, and his herd of goats. Then I have two lovely Jersey milk cows and their heifer friend Feliz, a Dexter. The pig palace houses four porkers, Maybelle, Lulu, Princess and the love of their life...Sampson. The freezers are full, and we eat fresh eggs, produce from the garden, and drink fresh milk daily. Sound familiar? It's the self-sufficient lifestyle of the survivalist. The more you produce, the less you need to depend on the outside world to be functional. So first came the self-sufficiency phase, then the survivalist mentality. I began reading survivalist fiction and found there was precious little of it to be had. So when I discovered how easy Amazon makes it to publish my own stories, I got to work.  And here we are, you and me. Read...enjoy...then engage. I'm right here, waiting to hear from you. Tell me what you love, what you hate, and what I should work on next.

At Wesley College, an English-speaking boarding school, Simon, the teenage son of an English magistrate father and an Afrikaner mother, keeps quiet about his mixed ethnicity, but is forced to confront his past when a group of Afrikaner students from a nearby technical school arrive at Wesley for a tennis match and Simon recognizes Fanie van den Bergh, a primary school classmate. The book then alternates between the fated day of the tennis match and memories from Simon's childhood. All of these recollections chronicle Simon's attempt to establish his own sense of morality in the face of the racist conservatism of the adult world, but while the book successfully unveils the moral hypocrisy of the era, Simon's recollections lack the coherence needed to transform the mundane adolescent experience—sexual discoveries, troublesome friends, forging an identity—into a compelling story.(Aug.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Since the first books I published, the\nplot for this one had lingered in the dark recesses of my mind. There were a\ncouple of reasons that I wouldn't allow it to become a reality.First, in order to write the book, I would need to write it\nfrom the POV of a woman--something a lot of men won't try, and a lot of\npublishers won't look at.Then one day everything changed with me. I walked into my\ndoctor's office and he told me I had an elevated PSA. I asked him what could\ncause it, and he told me either an enlarged prostate or prostate cancer. Then I\nasked him what he thought it was and he told me I was too young to have an\nenlarged prostate. Well, I thought I was too young to have cancer too, but as\nit turned out, he was right and I was wrong.The knowledge that I had cancer and was probably going to\ndie gave me the incentive to write the book I wanted to.However, I also had another problem. The woman eyes I' had to write the book through was a criminal defense attorney and I knew nothing about\ncriminal defense or attorneys.As a cop and a homicide detective, I had spent hundreds of\nhours in the courtroom testifying, but except for what happened in the court\nwhile I was testifying, I had no knowledge of courtroom procedures or anything\nexcept that I had seen on TV, and I sure didn't trust that.I began my research by talking to attorneys--prosecutors as\nwell as defense attorneys. I even sat through a cold case murder trial just to\nlearn courtroom procedures. As luck would have it, one of the attorneys\ninvolved in the case was a woman. This allowed me to pick up on female\nmannerisms and things like that as the trial went on, but more than that, the\nactual procedures that happened in a trial.As it turned out, this research forTattered Justice, the trial, but more than that, the contacts I\nmade in the Angelina County Courthouse, would prove invaluable a couple of\nyears later when the trial of Kimberly Clark Saenz, the subject of my true\ncrime,Killer Nurse, began.Then after I publishedTattered\nJustice, I found out that I had actually beaten the cancer and wasn't going\nto die. It left me with a really good book, research for another, yes another\nfemale criminal defense attorney that I also published, and the contacts at the\ncourthouse for my true crime.Although the paperback version is out of print, people can\nstill get copies from me through my web site or through Amazon.com.Hope you enjoyTattered Justiceas much as I enjoyed writing it.", "related": ["B008J2S5CQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I heartily recommend this wise and winsome set of comments on a biblical book beloved by many Christians through the ages but sorely neglected in the present. May God use this commentary to renew the courage of pastors in preaching the Song of Solomon once again.”—Douglas A. Sweeney,Professor of Church History and the History of Christian Thought, Director of the Jonathan Edwards Center, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School“The wisest man this side of the incarnate Christ, inspired by the Holy Spirit, on a topic that always grabs attention, in poetry, in the Bible—could it get any better than the Song of Songs? You won't want to miss Doug O’Donnell’s exposition of the most sublime song.”—James M. Hamilton Jr., Associate Professor of Biblical Theology, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary; author,God’s Glory in Salvation through Judgment“Song of Solomon is a delicate portion of Scripture, and Christians in our sex-crazed culture desperately need a biblical perspective on love and intimacy. Doug O’Donnell is a thoughtful, knowledgeable, reliable guide to this seldom-preached book. O’Donnell is himself a poet and scholar, sensitive to both the art and academic rigors of Solomon’s Song. He hits the mark of being exegetically accurate, thoroughly canonical, and boldly Christological.”—James A. Johnston,Senior Pastor, Tulsa Bible Church, Tulsa, Oklahoma“These days the Song of Solomon is often treated on the one hand as merely a manual of practical teaching about sex and relationships that says nothing about Christ or, on the other hand, as a picture of the relationship between Christ and the church that says nothing to the marriages of ordinary men and women. Doug O’Donnell has given us a masterful exposition that unfolds the book’s very real wisdom for human relationships in a way that constantly and without allegory points us to the gospel. Highly recommended!”—Iain M. Duguid,Professor of Old Testament, Grove City College; author,Numbers(Preaching the Word)“It is a rare commentary that stirs the emotions. But then it makes sense that a commentary that ably presents the Song of Solomon would lead the reader not only to think deeply, but also to feel deeply and to worship whole-heartedly. O’Donnell’s insights are fresh, clear, and personal, equipping readers to communicate the love of Christ for his bride from this ancient book in a compelling way.”—Nancy Guthrie,Bible Teacher; author, Seeing Jesus in the Old Testament Bible study series“Our culture treats sex as an idol and the church often treats it as a taboo, rarely talking about it. This situation is a formula for disaster. We need more preaching and teaching in our churches, and the Song of Songs is an essential biblical resource that God has given us to lead us toward a godly theology and holy practice of sexuality. Doug O’Donnell has given us a profound, rich, and witty reflection on the Song that will encourage depth of understanding and motivation for right thinking and behavior. I recommend this book enthusiastically for everyone, but particularly on those who preach and teach the book in a church context.”—Tremper Longman III,Robert H. Gundry Professor of Biblical Studies, Westmont College“Doug O’Donnell unfolds the Song of Solomon with personal and pastoral delight—and with attention to the poetic text and the biblical context. Into his exposition are woven warm-hearted exhortations, rich literary allusions, and a great deal of wit. This volume helps us celebrate the Bible’s celebration of married love.”—Kathleen B. Nielson,Director of Women’s Initiatives, The Gospel Coalition“Simply brilliant! This is the book on the Song of Solomon I’ve been waiting for—funny, moving, powerful, provocative, rigorously faithful to the text, and utterly Christ-centered. Doug O’Donnell explains and applies this trickiest of books in a way which is always fresh, responsible, and captivating. As you read, you will be delighted and deeply challenged, and you will gasp at the incredible intimacy which God gives to his people, both in marriage and in knowing him forever. I know of no more helpful work on the Song of Solomon.”—J. Gary Millar,Principal, Queensland Theological College; author,Now Choose Life“How absolutely refreshing, challenging, and affirming is Pastor O’Donnell’s in-depth study of this love song—this Middle Eastern, centuries-old, wedding song celebrating the truly free love between a man and a woman in marriage. It is God’s provision to sustain loving marriages and renew loveless ones. This Song was written to give wisdom to the unmarried to wait and to give the married the wisdom to warm up to each other again and again. Pastor O’Donnell lays down his own soul and writes in places, not only expositorily but also experientially, and the reader gasps. Here is a man who is as tender and as bold as the author of the Song of Songs. So with testimony and Biblical insight we are wonderfully led to the gospel, to God-breathed love that changes everything.”—Wendell Hawley,Pastoremeritus, College Church, Wheaton, Illinois; author,A Pastor Prays for His People“Douglas O’Donnell has a special gift in integrating careful exegesis, poetic sensitivity, theological reflection, and relevant application, all seasoned with vivid language and winsome humor. His commentary on the Song of Solomon opens up the richness of this delightful book, which unfortunately is too little preached and too little understood today.”—Daniel J.

Poorly managed conflict creates enormous costs in the form of wasted management time, high turnover, and lawsuits, not to mention the failure to leverage the naturally occurring differences that can drive creativity, innovation, and invention. How can leaders develop the skills to get the best out of conflict?The second edition ofBecoming a Conflict Competent Leadershows leaders how to implement constructive approaches to conflict while avoiding strategies that lead to destructive outcomes. The book combines research, conceptual models, practitioner experience, and stories that highlight the core conflict competencies. Authors Tim Flanagan and Craig Runde describe constructive behaviors and proven approaches that leaders can employ, tactics and reactions to avoid, and insights for ensuring that organizational structures support positive approaches to conflict management and resolution.The revised edition of this classic resource features two completely new chapters: one that addresses the Cool Down, Slow Down and Reflect, and Engage Constructively model and one that offers guidance for conflict in teams. The authors have updated examples throughout the book, added references to recent research, and included a new constructive behavior, Listening for Understanding, along with many new suggestions for \"staying in the zone.\" Other enhancements, such as tips and exercises at the end of each chapter, make this edition user friendly as a personal resource or a text for teaching others.Keep up with new developments in conflict competent leadership at the authors' Web site: www.conflictcompetent.com.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I highly recommend it to athletes and coaches.\"- Joe Friel, Head Coach, Training Bible Coaching, and co-author, Paleo Diet for Athletes\"Many endurance athletes perform strength-training that causes harm to their bodies, impairing their overall goals of better performance. This notably includes the full spectrum of bone loss leading to common injuries.The Endurance Paradoxwill help you positively address this common problem. Authors Thomas J. Whipple and Robert B. Eckhardt clear up many misconceptions about bone and muscle health and fitness, and in an easy-to-apply, holistic way, discussing simple, short, and effective workout plans you can perform at home. Just as important, they discuss how diet, nutrition, hormone balance, and other lifestyle factors influence bone health.The Endurance Paradoxis also a must for all coaches and healthcare professionals who work with endurance athletes.This is truly an intelligent approach to a subject all endurance athletes should read. The notion of weight lifting to improve bone strength without inducing muscle fatigue and stress is natural, safe, and complimentary. And, it fits well into an overall endurance program.\"—Dr. Philip Maffetone, author,The Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing\"As an orthopaedic surgeon and sports medicine specialist who provides care for all levels of athletes who challenge their limits by participating in endurance sports, I have come to understand that many of these athletes underestimate the cumulative forces absorbed by their skeleton on a daily basis. Even fewer athletes know how to train, eat and recover in a way that may lessen their chances of an overuse/overload injury such as a stress fracture. Stress related bone injury need not be an expected outcome in the endurance athlete, and neither does the long-term, under appreciated complication, osteoporosis.The Endurance Paradoxis a valuable guide for clinicians, coaches and athletes who strive not only to maximize sports performance but also strive to maximize long term bone health and long term wellness. Thomas Whipple and Robert Eckhardt have teamed up to provide us all with a concise yet complete review of current scientific knowledge as it applies to the bone health, nutrition, training and the rehabilitation of all those who are involved in endurance sports. The authors very effectively bring the laboratory science to life by illustrating the practical application of evidence based strategies used by some of the most accomplished and successful endurance athletes and coaches in the world.\"-John R. Deitch, MD, Director of Sports Medicine, Wellspan Health (York, PA)\"The importance of this book appears through the authors’ reference to  the words of Dr. George Sheehan who wrote that 'each of us is an  experiment of one.' Unfortunately, in the case of bone health the long  term consequences of our choices in diet and exercise may be neither  desirable nor reversible. Whipple and Eckhardt provide practical advice  for athletes and the sports medicine professionals who care so that one  outcome of the endurance athlete’s experiments in search of success is  optimal bone health. The book is extensively referenced and covers the  key issues related to diet, exercise and bone health. The reader learns  where the evidence for change lies as well as areas of continuing  uncertainty and gains invaluable insight into the Endurance Paradox.\"- Craig Denegar PhD, PT, ATC\"I am very surprised and impressed by this book because the authors have  seen through the fog of the plethora of research in this field and have  made sensible, logical and clear recommendations. The book is well  researched and offers excellent practical advice.\"- Dr. Graham Fletcher, PhD, Sport Scientist, The Univeristy of Fraser Valley, Former British Triathlon National Team Coach“This book is a must read for athletes of all sports, ages and abilities, although targeted specifically for endurance athletes, it is also a must read for coaches, trainers, sports doctors, physical therapists and in fact anyone wishing to maintain or manage bone health.

I started writing seriously in 2009, steampunk novel called Steam Queen which was published in 2010. Around the same time I wrote a children's fantasy novel called On Angels Wings which I also had published. Both books have received great reviews and Steam Queen was www.sfbook.com's book of the month for January 2011.    I have always been a fan of superheroes. The comic books, superhero novels, superhero movies and superhero video games; I love them all so it was no surprise really when I decided to try and write a superhero novel too! The end result was True Hero? A novel which World Castle Publishing have agreed to publish.    Writing True Hero? Was partially inspired by my love of internet forum based RPG websites. With them you sort of pick  a character from whatever the site is based on and role-play as them. Many of the sites which I joined were X-Men/Marvel comics based which I think was pretty useful in developing my skills at writing the superhero genre.     At the moment I am currently in full time education studying Zoo Biology at Nottingham Trent University. I write in my spare time and would love to continue writing well past my education and when I enter the good old working world.    Most of my writing is fantasy based but I have wrote one or two horror short stories, one of which has been selected to appear in an upcoming anthology so maybe in the future I might write a full length horror novel too ;)    Visit my website at http://www.jackhessey.com/", "related": ["B00KXM8IP4"], "rank": 2771311, "title": "Fire and Fury", "author": "Jack Hessey", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Susie loved all kinds of sex, and one of her\nfavorite things to do was to suck a big hard cock, like the one she was\nstarting to take in and out of her mouth. It was big, but not so big that she\nwouldn't be able to move it around and fully revel in giving head. Her new\nneighbor's cock was nice and hard, as hard an erection as only a young man can\nhave. While she slowly lowered her face to engulf it, the thickness spread her\nmouth open just right, not far enough to be painful for her jaw and not so\nlittle as to be not noticeable. Allen was sitting quietly too, and letting her\ndo what she wanted, which was something else she always appreciated.When\nshe felt the tip brush against the back of her mouth, Susie stopped and let it\nremain where it was, while her tongue laved the entire length, loving the\nsmooth skin stretched so tightly over the hard roundness. Still moving slowly,\nshe drew her face back until just the head was nestled between her lips while\nher tongue stroked the head again, paying special attention to the slit. After\na couple of seconds, she took the cock out of her mouth and held it gently in\nher fingertips while she smiled around it at the man sitting on her bed. \"Do\nyou like that, Allen?\" she asked him. \"Yes,\nvery much. You're really good.\" \"I'm\nglad you like it, because I do too. Very much.\" That\nwas all the talking she would do for a while, because Susie had better things\nto do with her mouth that idle chitchat. This was the best cock she had sucked\nin a long time, and she wanted to enjoy every second of it. With the first few\nstrokes, she took the head only to the back of her mouth but, after that, she\nbegan giving deep throat, opening up to take the entire length into her warm,\nwet cavern of pleasure. With every stroke she made, her lips and nose were\npressed against Allen's pubic hair, and she relished the rather acrid smell and\nthe way they tickled her. Allen\ncould still hardly believe his luck. He was getting a great blow job from a\nsexy older woman, and almost everything about it was perfect, from the way her\nwarm brown eyes gazed at him to her soft murmurs of delight as her face moved\nup and down. Best of all, of course, was what her tongue and lips were doing to\nhis cock. As he writhed in pleasure on the side of the bed, the only thing less\nthan perfect was the fact he was so horny he was going to climax sooner than he\nwanted to, and have less fun than he would have preferred. Susie\nknew he was close to coming too, and was not surprised. She felt his cock\nthrobbing inside her mouth and shortened the strokes with her lips. No more\ndeep throat this time, because she wanted to be sure he didn't come and squirt\nhis semen down her throat before she had a chance to fully relish the flavor\nand texture. She also sucked faster, because she knew his climax was imminent. \"Ahhhhh,\noh god, I'm coming,\" he moaned, seconds before squirting a big wad of semen\ninto the mouth that had brought about that happy event.", "related": ["B00DG4PX0E"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I have two grown-up daughters and three grandchildren. I like all types of music, writing, reading, photography, gardening, yoga, and dog walking.  My passion for adventure books began when I was just five years old, but I didn't begin writing my own childrens' books until I purchased my first laptop in 2009.   I admire greatly the works of Hans Christian Andersen, Charles Dickens and The Brothers Grimm. I worked as an audio-secretary in offices around the Bristol City Centre for many years. The idea for my books came to me during a holiday in Torbay walking our cocker spaniels. A cheeky herring gull with spiky hair glared at me as I walked past. I knew in an instant that a quirky seagull would be my main character in my books.   I began writing The Adventures of Eric Seagull that afternoon. My character is named after a flamboyant Professor of Physics who worked with my dearest dad during the 1970s. His messy yellow tufts, bushy grey eyebrows, colourful waistcoat and bow tie matched my seagull's description perfectly. (He asked me to dance once, but I turned him down!)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

After working as a captive agent and regional manager for an insurance carrier, Postema realized that he could offer his clients more options, better products, and retirement, estate and insurance plans unhindered by the restrictions of a single insurer if he went independent—so he did. Now, Postema works with over 90 insurance carriers to ensure that his clients benefit from the most highly rated, competitive insurers with the newest products in this ever-changing market. His agency, Postema Insurance & Investments, LLC, has six locations and employs over 30 agents highly trained to assist consumers in fully protecting their assets with insurance and their retirement income with annuities. Dennis and all of his advisors concentrate on helping clients rather than selling products.  In 2011 Dennis and his agency were the cover feature for Agents Sales Journal (Senior Market Edition) a national magazine in the financial industry.  Not content to focus exclusively on his agency, Postema began Postema Marketing Group, LLC, in 2009 so that agents around the country could benefit from his experience and his drive to satisfy customers.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I continue to read voraciously and write about subjects that interest me. My goal is not only to share my findings with others, but hopefully to inform and help others with their own personal explorations.Even though I am in my senior years, I still enjoy a healthy physical body and a mind that still seems to work on a very high level.

Later she was transferred to a second orphanage in Preston in England, which was less harsh, and where, due to one special nun, she became acquainted with the magic of storytelling.  In her teenage years she moved to London to study Drama, working as a telephonist at night to pay her rent and attending Drama school in the day: after which she spent some years working full time in theatre and occasionally in television.  Her first attempts at professional writing began after her two children were born, and she became a full-time mother, writing at night when the world and her children were asleep. She began with two short stories, both of which won prizes. She then began her first novel, Tread Softly On My Dreams, based on the true story of the young Irish hero, Robert Emmet. Published by Headline and critically acclaimed by the Press, Tread Softly On My Dreams was acquired by the University of Notre Dame in the US, and The Princess Grace Irish Library in the Palace of Monaco. This was followed by her second Irish novel, Fire On The Hill and later followed by her first contemporary novel, Ghosts In Sunlight. Gretta’s writing career was interrupted in full flow when her son broke his back in an accident and needed her care for some years. Now fully recovered, her son is a successful young actor and Gretta has returned to her passion for writing. She is now an internationally published author with three of her books being published in all countries in Scandinavia, as well as Germany, Portugal, Holland and Japan. Her third stand-alone novel JARVISFIELD which is also the third book in The Macquarie Series has just been published (August 2013) to be followed by the publication of the fourth and concluding book in the series, THE WAYWARD SON in September 2013. Gretta is married to a lawyer and lives in London.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her father is a Spanish film director and her mother a Swedish author and interpreter (with a past life as an actress). She first came to the US to improve her English for a couple summers, and then as an exchange student, graduating from West Side High, in Omaha, NE. After a short stint at the Escuela Universitaria de Ingenieria Tecnica Aeronautica, en la Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Elin decided to pursue her childhood dream of becoming an airline pilot. She went back to the US and spent two and half years in Daytona Beach, FL, at the Phoenix East Aviation school, where she became a flight instructor with over 600 hours of total flight time. When her less-than-perfect eyesight impeded the full medical certificate needed to fly large passenger aircrafts, she switched gears again and went back to Spain to study Law. Missing the United States, she relocated to Seattle, where she graduated Magna Cum Laude in Philosophy at the University of Washington.  Here she also received the Mary Gates Research Endowment for a year-long research project to investigate persuasive effects of testimony. After a short stint working for a criminal appeals lawyer, Elin returned to Spain to obtain a Masters in International Commerce from the Universidad de Alicante. With the broad set of skills she developed over the years, Elin returned to the US and for the last decade she’s worked in technology for some of the most well-known companies in the US, including AT&T;, T-Mobile, Google, Microsoft, Tivo, and Samsung. Elin attended her first International Thriller Writers conference in 2009, and has not missed the annual event since.  Combining her passions for law, technology, and thrillers, Elin was inspired to pen her first novel, a thriller set in Silicon Valley, where innovation is always brewing.", "related": [], "rank": 377838, "title": "Justification for Murder (The Darcy Lynch Series Book 1)", "author": "Elin Barnes", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 38, "rating_average": 4.2895, "rating_total": 163.0}

His studies of American hieroglyphics, of Poe, and of Faulkner, and above all his definitive book on the greatest modern American poet, Hart Crane, are now joined by another luminous commentary.(Harold Bloom)The capstone book of his long and distinguished career.(David Wyatt, University of Maryland)John Irwin’s personal identification with the life and writing of F. Scott Fitzgerald and his many years of reading, teaching, and studying Fitzgerald’s fiction are fully apparent throughout this extremely readable and insightful study. The breadth of Irwin’s book is evident in his confident command not only of iconic works likeThe Great GatsbyandTender Is the Nightbut also in his frequent and pertinent use of less familiar stories and essays; its depth is equally apparent in his reliance on extensive quotations from Fitzgerald’s texts and in his abundant fresh and original analyses. This is a major contribution to Fitzgerald studies from a critic whose knowledge of and affection for his subject is evident on every page.(Jackson R. Bryer, editor,The F. Scott Fitzgerald Review)It was another time, another place, another world—and John Irwin has caught with perfect pitch all the lost glitter and dubious glamour of Scott Fitzgerald’s Jazz Age and its sequel. Irwin pursues a powerful line of critical inquiry, the insight that Fitzgerald was theatrical to the core, always projecting the belief that life is a scene, or it is nothing. Discovering endless details of this theatrical persuasion, Irwin’s reader will learn the difference between observing and being observed—the staging contrast that shapes many short stories, as well asThe Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night,and the unfinished Hollywood novel,The Last Tycoon.The age was a delusional period when Americans were drunk on diamonds, but Fitzgerald was also literally drunk, hence his fragmentary memoir,The Crackup.The difference shown here, however, is the degree to which Fitzgerald was intensely dedicated to the art of intelligent fiction, in which he melded story and style, Maupassant and Keats, one might say. Irwin digs deep into the early and later family biography; he avoids sensational accounts of the novelist’s marriage to Zelda, and he finally provides us with the first truly dynamic, detailed, and always elegant account of a writer whose poetic gifts were nothing short of miraculous.(Angus Fletcher)This is the best book on Fitzgerald's fiction. Irwin understands Fitzgerald and his work better and more interestingly than anyone else ever has. The single most important accomplishment ofF. Scott Fitzgerald's Fictionis its revelation of the ways that social and professional theatricality shape and inform his writing, and particularly the two great novels,The Great GatsbyandTender Is the Night. F. Scott Fitzgerald's Fictionis essential for an understanding of the writer and his work.(Scott Donaldson)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was removed from class for drawing a clown face in crayon over the entire surface of his desk in grade two. He wrote a serial story called “The Gang” for his grade four classmates. He built and painted a tipi for a grade seven history project. He helped orchestrate the erection of a picnic table pyramid in Stewart Park, Perth. When his jeans developed holes, he patched them, and then patched the patches. He wrote a Christmas play for his high school drama class called “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer Rejected” and despite the vagrants and prostitutes included in the script got to see it performed in the cafeteria. He wrote over a hundred songs and toured across Canada as a solo musician for three years. He acted professionally in six different provinces. He published two poems. He painted his rooms with psychedelic murals. These days, Johnny's producing an album for his band, The Chanteclers, in which he sings and shares duties on guitar and bass. He's shaving his facial hair in ridiculous ways. And — oh yeah — he's writing novels and really hopes you like the first one. Johnny tends to live wherever whimsy takes him, preferably with a cat, or a similarly awesome and independent animal. \"Summons\" is Johnny's first book.", "related": ["B0055I14BG"], "rank": 3963195, "title": "Summons (The Panachrest Book 1)", "author": "Johnny Eaton", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I spent most of my childhood in a seaside resort town on the south coast of my native England. Eastbourne was a wonderful place to grow up, but sheltered just enough to make me want to go out and spread my wings and see what the rest of the world had to offer! That adventure started after I married a wonderful, young serviceman. After settling into life in the forces, we moved to Germany where we lived for a couple of years. On returning to England and civilian life, we settled in the north where I found work in the more heavily industrialized world of Yorkshire. Very different from the life I had known in a seaside resort! I loved living in and learning about the lifestyles in different parts of England, but my education really expanded when we moved half the world away to Saudi Arabia. The contrast between the coastal mountain areas and the inland, desert cities along with the rich culture and traditions going back literally thousands of years, is something which has affected my life and my writing ever since. Eventually we bid ‘Adieu’ to those exotic, arid lands and returned to the UK. Back home again, I started my own business—a secretarial agency which provided companies with the then-fledgling service of a virtual assistant. We’ve now moved again and this time to Wales, where I’ve settled into my writing career, and very happily draw on my many experiences both at home and abroad. Because those experiences have been so diverse, my books tend to be very different from each other and stand on their own- in plot, characters, culture and background.", "related": [], "rank": 4967695, "title": "After Evergreen (Evergreen Series Book 3) eBook", "author": "Sybil Powell", "category": "Parenting & Relationships", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In addition to working full time, he is also a husband, father of two, and graduate from Full Sail University, where he ironically received his  Bachelor of Science degree in the Music Production program.  Tyrone was born into a military family in Bessemer, AL and has three older siblings. He spent his first few years in Alabama before moving to the west coast for a few years, before returning back to the south. Majority of his life was spent in Florida, which is where he graduated high school in Pensacola and where he enlisted into the military.   During the last few years, Tyrone has explored different ideas in which he could write about, many of which derived from his time out to sea while stationed in North Carolina. Not fully committed to writing what was on his mind, he put these thoughts behind him until the time was right. When that time came, even when it was during his last year of college, he fully committed and completed the initial rough draft within a few months.  The Great Keepers derived from a dream that he had three nights in a row at the beginning of 2013. The book is pretty accurate based on what he remembers about his dream, even down to the names of the initial four main characters. After finishing the editing process, the sequel to The Great Keepers was immediately penned and will pick up where the first book left off. He also has plans on writing books of different genres as well, but will make sure to leave his readers fully satisfied before exploring those options.", "related": [], "rank": 2480416, "title": "The Great Keepers eBook", "author": "Tyrone Minnifield", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He had always been interested in studying the human mind and the society. Ian holds a BA degree in Sociology and apart from writing and investigation he works as a HR consultant for many European companies from various sectors.  In his free time he really enjoys travelling and getting to know different cultures. His favorite way of travelling is a spontaneous, adventurous \"backpacking\" on a very little budget- something he has been doing since he was a teenager and became a part of his lifestyle. Hitchhiking, as well as using services like ''couch surfing\" are his preferred modes of immersing himself into new cultures and staying out of his comfort zone. He just loves the thrill of unpredictable travelling! Another passion of Ian's is music. He plays the guitar and composes music. He is also an electronic music producer- something he does as a hobby.  As a child and a teenager, Ian suffered from shyness and low self-esteem. Looking for solutions he would find consolation in doing lots of reading and writing songs. It wasn't until he began to confront his fears and do exactly the opposite that his brain was telling him. He likes putting his experiences on paper, who knows maybe they can inspire you in a way?", "related": ["B00HI0L8YC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Self-Help", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.9091, "rating_total": 54.0}

Dave Bilbrough, songwriter and worship leader For over-busy Christians and leaders, this book is a must. It is about much more than pace in the race. It is about going deeper with Jesus. The Right Revd Ken Clarke, Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh, Church of Ireland I commend this book to all who desire to be drawn closer to God because he is pleased with who we are more than what we do. Paul Tan, Overseas Missionary Fellowship, Singapore I greatly enjoyed reading Rhythms of Grace. Tony Horsfall's message to those of us who are so busy that we hardly ever have time to sit still and simply be is a timely one. It also helps us to realise just how precious we are to God, and that though we may feel we don't measure up as Christians, God accepts and loves us as we are, and longs to deepen our relationship with him. From Susan Hibbins, Editor of the UK edition of The Upper Room From The Good Bookstall - 14 April 2012 Horsfall's message here is a prophetic and timely one. Experiencing intimacy with God in a busy life is a perennial if not cosmic wrestle. The world, the flesh and the devil all collaborate with our busyness and vulnerabilities, to minimise the truthfulness that comes from silence and solitude with our Saviour. Rhythms of Grace has a pulsing beat emanating from a personal exploration of contemplative spirituality. Evangelical and charismatic pathways fuse meaningfully in an experiential pursuit of God. This is full of insights, wisdom, reflection and signposts toward action and transformation. Dense, definitive and delightful for the soul! This is a great title deserving of more than just shelf collection. Read and then re-read this gem of a book! This is a well-crafted and compelling invitation to walk in intimate grace with the risen Jesus Christ. This book in God's goodness could birth healing for many. Reviewed by Johnny Douglas From The Church Times - 18 May 2012 I confess that I approached Tony Horsfall's book with a cautious heart, but came away from it with a glad one. The writer comes from an Evangelical background, which is not my own, and my prejudices got in the way. His aim is to widen the spirituality of the 'usual' Evangelical (if there is such a person), and introduce him or her to a kind of spirituality which for many good Christians would be entirely new. He does this with great sensitivity - and possibly a little deliberate cunning. The first chapters describe issues that will be quite familiar to most Evangelical Christians, and probably form part of their daily devotions. But, slowly and gently, he leads his reader into what is probably, for most British Christians, new ground. He plays no tricks, but opens up radically different ways of prayer and listening to God. None of these is new to Christianity - indeed, many have ancient roots - but most have only relatively recently found their way into the daily devotions of today's Anglican (and probably Free Church) Christian lives. With Horsfall, prayer becomes listening and waiting rather than speaking and asking - as (he tells us) he has himself discovered.

He fills his pulpit each Sunday with solid biblical sermons on\nfire with the Holy Spirit.This book is about an important topic: what happens after\nthis life is over.
