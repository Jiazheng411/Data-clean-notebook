Packed with vintage Robbins boudoir scenes, it follows a street-smart youth clawing and copulating his way to wealth and power. Born Howard Hughes Jr., the bastard son of the famous multimillionaire recluse, Zack Riordan comes to Vegas in 1966 at age 12, and 12 years later has become the youngest casino security chief on the Strip. The narrative follows Zack's career as he gets involved in a vicious rivalry with the wastrel son and snooty Vassar-educated daughter of his mentor, Con Halliday, the aging owner of the casino Zack has helped save from ruin. When Zack is unceremoniously fired, he crosses continents to cut deals with Chinese criminal elements in Hong Kong and to parlay his quick wits and daring into enough money to finance his own casino, unwinding from hard days of sordid financial exploits by bedding one beautiful woman after another. Returning home, Zack discovers that he has a son by his former mentor's daughter, and finds himself wondering if he has paid too high a price for wealth and power. Those Robbins fans who haven't already fallen by the wayside will be rewarded for their devotion with this unexpectedly lively offering.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

People walked briskly along the sidewalks, their coat collars turned up and their heads leaning into the wind as they hurried from store to store. Shops and restaurants were crowded. A good sign for retailers, since the Christmas shopping season hadn't begun in earnest.Alicia Harris sat at a table in Espresso Heaven, a coffee shop on Main Street, waiting anxiously for someone who looked like Joe Palermo—thirty-six years old, six foot two, black hair, brown eyes—to walk through the door. It wasn't much of a description, but it was all he'd given her. It didn't matter. She was certain she would recognize him, even after all these years.No, it wasn't the description—or lack thereof—that made her anxious. It was wondering whether or not he would agree to her outlandish suggestion. If he didn't…\"Care for some coffee while you wait?\" the waitress asked, drawing Alicia's gaze from the street scene.\"No, thanks. But I would like some herbal tea, if you have any.\"\"Sure thing. Whole selection. Be right back.\"Alicia laid a hand on her extended abdomen. \"Maybe thisisa crazy idea, Humphrey.\" Humphrey was her pet name for her unborn child. \"Hecouldbe an ax murderer.\"Joe had suggested that possibility last night when they'd spoken by phone. He'd called from the motel near the airport shortly after checking in.\"You're taking quite a risk, Alicia,\" he'd said. \"You don't know much about me really. Just old memories and some instant messaging. I could be criminally insane. I could be an ax murderer.\"She didn't believe he was dangerous. She'd known the entire Palermo family when she was a girl, had made mud pies in the backyard with Joe's younger sister, Belinda. In fact, she'd had a major crush on \"Joey\" when she was ten and he was seventeen. But the Palermos had moved to California before she could grow up and make him notice her.No, Joe was no ax murderer. There were plenty of things she didn't know about him, nineteen years later, but she was certain the boy who used to fix her bicycle chains and search for her missing cat was no monster.A blast of cold air signaled the opening of the coffee shop's door. Alicia glanced up… and stopped breathing.She was over seven months pregnant and already as big as a barn. She hadn't had a good hair day in at least fifteen weeks. Before leaving the house, she'd hidden the mess under a black and redCat-in-the-Hat-typeknitted cap. It probably didn't look much better than her hair. To top it all off, three pimples had appeared on her forehead this morning and now glowed as bright and red as Rudolph's nose.And then there was Joe Palermo.How did an Adonis at seventeen become even more handsome nearly two decades later? Shouldn't he have wrinkles or a receding hairline or a middle-age paunch or something?He found her with his eyes, and he smiled.Good grief! They could light the Capitol Christmas tree with that smile.She swallowed hard, then smiled in return, watching as he made his way toward her.Get a grip, Alicia. It's only Joe, and he's just here to consider doing you a favor. He's off-limits.He stopped on the opposite side of the table. \"You must be Alicia.\" His gaze dropped to her abdomen. \"Although you look a little different from the last time I saw you.\" He glanced up. \"You're taller, right?\"\"Right.\" She chuckled nervously.\"It's good to see you again, Alicia.\"\"You, too, Joe.\"He pulled out the chair and slid onto the seat. The waitress appeared before he had time to remove his coat.\"Can I get you something?\" she asked, sounding breathless.\"Large coffee. Black. Thanks.\"\"No frills,\" Alicia said as the waitress hurried away.He smiled again. \"No frills.\"Now she could see she'd been wrong. Hedidhave a few wrinkles. Tiny smile lines around his eyes and the corners of his mouth. And mighty attractive they were, too.Oh, her wacky pregnancy hormones were doing a major number on her. She hadn't given a man the time of day since Grant walked out three weeks after their wedding. She wasn't going to start now. Playing the fool once per decade was her limit.\"Popular place,\" Joe said, intruding on her thoughts.\"Yes. I usually come about nine in the morning, before I open my store. It's a little more quiet in here then. The eight-to-fivers have come and gone, and I can sit in the corner and sip my tea while reading the paper.\"The waitress arrived with Joe's coffee.\"Thanks.\" He flashed the young woman one of his million-watt smiles. Then he looked at Alicia, giving the waitress no excuse to linger. \"Okay, let's talk about why I'm here.\"\"No-nonsense. Is that the attorney in you?\"\"I guess so.\"She sat a little straighter, drew a deep breath and let it out. \"Joe, I know this is a huge favor to ask of anyone. Especially since you haven't seen me in years. If there was someone else I could ask…\" She sighed. \"But there isn't.\"\"Are you sure this is the best way? I remember your grandfather as the sort of man who would forgive your faults and lend a helping hand when needed. I think he could handle the truth, whatever it is.\"\"If you'd seen him in the hospital, you'd understand. We came so close to losing him. If he knew I was about to become a single mom, he would worry about me. Worry is the last thing he needs right now.\"A frown drew Joe's black eyebrows together. \"Proverbs says that truth stands the test of time and lies are soon exposed. I'm thinking that's good advice.\"\"Is it so terrible to want to protect someone you love?\"\"No,\" he answered softly. \"It isn't terrible. Misguided, maybe, but not terrible.\"Alicia looked out the window at the scurrying Saturday shoppers. \"I never meant for things to get out of hand. I never meant to tell even the first lie. It just sort of…happened.It's a long, stupid story.\"Joe had come to the café to tell Alicia he couldn't agree to this charade, not even for an old childhood friend. He wasn't a great actor in the best of circumstances. He feared that pretending to be someone's husband—considering his low opinion of wedded bliss—would be beyond his meager capabilities. Besides, he had this troublesome feeling that God would prefer honesty.But when he opened his mouth to tell her he couldn't do it, out came different words. \"Tell me a little more—\" he motioned toward her stomach \"—about what happened. You haven't gone into detail when we've had our chat sessions.\"Still staring toward the window, she released a deep sigh. \"It's bad enough my friends and employees know.\"\"I'myour friend, Alicia. You can tell me.\"That drew her gaze back to him.\"Hormones,\" she whispered with a pitiful wave of her hand toward her tear-filled eyes. Then she grabbed her purse, opened it and withdrew a packet of tissues. \"Sorry.\"\"No problem.\" He sipped his coffee.After a lengthy silence, she began speaking in a low voice, so low Joe had to lean forward in order to hear her.\"I met Grant Reeves last March at a party. He was an acquaintance of one of my employees and was in town for a few weeks. He was from Reno where he worked as a carpenter. Grant was charming and charismatic. He had a way about him that made all the women take notice. But it was me he paid special attention to that night. And every night after that, too. He wined and dined me, showered me with flowers and gifts. It was all new to me, and I fell hard. He asked me to marry him two weeks later. He wanted to get married right away.\"Joe whistled softly, which drew a wry look and a nod from Alicia.\"I called Grandpa Roger. He's the only family I have left since my parents died. I wanted him to be happy for me.\" As she spoke, she lowered her gaze to the napkin in her hand and began shredding its edges. \"But he wasn't. In fact, it brought out the pastor in him.\" A brief smile curved her mouth, then vanished. \"He reminded me that marriage is a holy estate and not to be entered into lightly. He asked questions about Grant's character and wanted to know if he was a Christian. Questions I couldn't answer because I didn't know. Because I hadn't asked them myself.\"Joe saw the glitter of tears in her eyes and felt a tug in his heart.\"I got angry and said some very unkind things to Grandpa. And I didn't listen to his words of caution, either. Grant and I were married four days later.\"Marry in haste and repent at leisure. Whoever said that knew what he was talking about. But Joe would have shortened it to: Marry and repent. Period.\"I knew it was a mistake almost from the first day,\" she continued, \"but I wouldn't admit it. My pride was involved. I told myself things would improve. We just had to get used to living together, to each other's idiosyncrasies. I tried not to complain that he spent too much money and that he came home late so often.\"Alicia fell silent. Her unshed tears swam before her blue-green eyes. She looked fragile and vulnerable.All of Joe's protective instincts flared to life. But those instincts weren't good ones, he reminded himself. Better to ignore them.He took a sip of his lukewarm coffee.\"I found Grant with another woman three weeks after we were married. He seemed surprised I was upset by it. Apparently we had very different ideas of what marriage meant.\"\"Apparently.\"She took a quick breath and let it out. \"We got a divorce in Nevada. It only took a few weeks, since Grant was still a resident. It was all relatively painless and civilized. I was relieved I hadn't told Grandpa I'd gotten married.\" She sighed again.Joe wondered if she realized how often she did that. The deep breath and audible sigh. The rise and fall of her shoulders. The worrying of her lower lip between her teeth.\"And then I discovered I was pregnant.\"\"Did you tell Grant?\"\"Yes. He said I'd have to prove it was his and accused me of marrying him for child support.\" She released a self-deprecating laugh.\"Thisafter he nearly cleaned out my savings account in three weeks' time.\"If Grant Reeves ha...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

That her younger sister, thirty-two, happily married for six years, was carrying a longed-for child should have been great news. As it was, Leah absently poured orange juice, intended for four-year-old Mary Grace's cup, into her bowl of muesli.\"Mom!\"\"Oh, sh— Sorry. I'll eat it. Maybe I can pour it… Darling, just a minute.\"The life inside Leah's abdomen gave a kick, as if the baby could sense the turmoil Ellen's words caused.\"So we'll be pregnant together,\" Ellen continued, \"and we'll have new babies at about the same time. Mine's due December first. I think. Anyhow, our kids will be cousins and really close in age….\"I never planned on keeping this baby. This was your baby, Ellen.\"Ellen, hang on. I need to deal with cereal.\" She put down the phone. Ellen was pregnant. How was Ellen pregnant? And what was supposed to happen to the baby—Ellen's baby, for crying out loud—that Leah was carrying? Of course, Ellen had made her wishes clear—Leah would keep the baby.She picked up the phone and said, \"Mary Grace, I'm going in the other room for a minute.\"Her daughter, who had Sam's hay-colored hair and Leah's dark eyes, nodded without looking up from her bowl. She ate with deliberation, as she did everything.Leah stared out the window. The two acres of peach orchards on which the small historic farmhouse sat had been Sam's promised land. Leah loved the little three-bedroom house, loved to gaze out over the fertile valley at the snow-draped mountains.Stifling a sigh, she put the phone to her ear.First things first. Though she wasn't sure what should come first.She spoke to her sister. \"You're thinking…I'll just keep this baby.\"\"Well, it's up to you,\" Ellen said. \"But I thought you'd want to.\"Leah walked back over to the windows that fronted the tiny living room. Gazing out at mountains far to the north, she asked, \"How did you come to be pregnant?\"Ellen's husband, River, was a Desert Storm veteran. After leaving the military, he'd changed his name and taken up organic farming. Then, he'd met Ellen, and ever since they'd been trying for a pregnancy. After more than three years and no baby, they'd figured that they were, as a couple, infertile, and, unwilling to go to a fertility clinic, they'd asked Leah to have a child for them, the sperm to be provided by River's half brother, Mark.Leah had drawn the line at conceiving a baby the natural way with Mark Logan!River and Ellen, talked through every step of the process and reassured that no fertility drugs, for instance, would be used, had finally agreed that artificial insemination could take place in the office of a nearby Delta midwife, Kassandra Warner.\"You're pregnant,\" Leah repeated. \"With River's child.\"\"Yes. Of course.\" Ellen paused. \"Youwillbe our midwife, won't you?\"\"Yes,\" said Leah. She was ready to put down the phone and be alone and think—or maybe just scream. Granted, Ellen hadn'tplannedthis. Ellen and River had believed that they couldn't conceive a child together. Nonetheless, the situation seemed sotypical.Ellen was flighty and unreliable, and Leah had allowed herself to be persuaded to conceive and carry a child to give to her sister and River, and now this.She had to get off the phone. But there was still one question to ask, because the child she carried… Well, the baby had another biological parent. \"Does Mark know?\"A pause. \"I hadn't thought to let him know. I guess I should, because River and I won't be the parents of your baby. You will be. I'll call him. Right now. Go back to Mary Grace.\"Click.Leah sank onto an antique love seat by the window. Once again her gaze was drawn to the distant mountains. Mark Logan.She'd known him for years, though just as an acquaintance. Women throughout the San Juan Mountains and north along Colorado's western slope swore he was like a brother to them, that he was the best guy there was. Men respected him. And everyone agreed that he was the most capable mountaineer and back-country guide in the area.Leah found him abrasive. For whatever reason, she'd never felt comfortable in his presence. In any case, he'd never tried to secure her good opinion. He had been Ellen's choice as a father for the child Leah now carried. Ellen's and River's. Leah definitely would have picked someone else. But she'd gone along with the baby project because Ellen and River had been desperate, and Leah had wanted to give this gift to her sister.Well, it could be worse. Mark could come to Paonia and fight her over this child. Luckily for her, that wasn't going to happen. After having donated sperm to this project, he'd returned to his mountain home and hadn't looked back. He would leave the hard decisions to her.Now, she must make them.\"Leah?\" She'd already seen by the caller ID that the call was coming from Mark Logan's cell phone. So the deep, slightly gravelly voice should have been no surprise.\"Yes.\" She couldn't work up any friendliness, hadn't yet recovered from Ellen's announcement. Obviously, Ellen had wasted no time getting hold of him.\"You and I need to talk. I'll be down there by five-thirty. I'll take you to dinner. Can you get a sitter?\"Thiswas what she so disliked about the man. He hadn't asked if she was free. He hadn't asked if she had money for a sitter. He'd just tried to take charge. Well, he could be as dictatorial as he liked, but it wasn't going to work with her. \"No. I can't get a sitter. You can have dinner and come to the house after Mary Grace is asleep. Eight-thirty will be fine.\"Silence. Then, \"Okay. Can I pick anything up for you on the way?\"\"No, thank you.\"\"I'll see you then.\"Click.Businesslike.\"Baby,\" Leah said as she studied herself in the mirror, \"it's you and me.\"She smoothed a hand over her belly, admiring her maternity clothes. They'd been made by a Paonia designer, actually sewn in Paonia as well, and her red flared pants and matching tunic at once slimmed and emphasized the beauty of pregnancy.She considered whether to wear her hair up or down and finally settled on a single braid down her back.Mary Grace came into the room, carrying one of her stuffed animals, a unicorn named Secret. Unlike several of Mary Grace's other animals, Secret did not talk. He could keep a secret.\"You look pretty, Mommy.\"\"You are always pretty,\" she told her daughter.Now is the time, she thought. She'd had hours to come to terms with the idea of the baby being her child instead of Ellen's. Now she had to break the news to Mary Grace.\"Ellen doesn't want our baby?\" Mary Grace asked, after Leah had tried to explain what was happening.\"It's not that she doesn't want our baby. But she's having one of her own. So I'm going to have this baby, and you will have a brother or sister.\"Mary Grace frowned thoughtfully. \"This way is better,\" she said. \"It makes more sense.\"Having a mother who was a midwife, sometimes being taken to births in the middle of the night, Mary Grace had a strange maturity. She gave off a sense of knowing and wisdom. Leah found her daughter to be wholly remarkable and hoped the baby she was carrying would be as easy as Mary Grace had always been.This is crazy. I did not plan to have a baby myself.She said, \"What story tonight?\"Leah heard his vehicle pull up on the dirt drive. She opened the front door and watched him come up the walk, his blond hair a bright spot under the stars.Mark's blue eyes took in her appearance in one sweeping glance—then he seemed to dismiss her.She stepped back, holding the door open, and he came in, giving the foyer with its old-fashioned wainscoting the same sort of look he'd given her. She shut the door and led him into the living room. Her furniture was lodgepole pine, most of it crafted by Sam. Sam had been able to do so many things, and Leah had loved him. But his sudden death hadn't caused unending grief so much as a sense of being overwhelmed, of needing to swim, swim, swim to keep her head above water.The weighted windows were shaded now by blinds designed for energy efficiency, and they were keeping the house warm against the chill March night. Summer would be here soon, summer which meant more work in the garden and longer days with Mary Grace by her side and trips to the river and the swimming pond.How am I going to earn enough to support two children?She gestured Mark toward the couch. \"Can I get you anything? Water? Tea?\" She had beer in the fridge—primarily for River when he and Ellen came over—but felt disinclined to offer it. This was simple nastiness on her part. It wasn't his fault that Ellen and River had so unexpectedly conceived a child. \"Beer?\" she finally said, relenting.\"Water would be great. Thank you.\"She went to the kitchen and poured one for him and one for herself. Stalling for time, she took half a lemon from the refrigerator and garnished each glass with a slice. Added ice. She returned to the living room, handed Mark one of the glasses and sat down in the rocking chair at one end of the couch.He drove straight to the matter at hand. \"We need to decide what to do. You live here. My work is in the San Juans.\" He was a backcountry tour guide who operated a chain of huts through the mountains. \"There will be a lot of traveling back and forth in order for us to share custody, but obviously that's what needs to happen.\"Leah was momentarily dumbstruck. Then, she gave a brief, raw laugh.\"Obviously?\"\"You and I have conceived a child,\" he said in that same matter-of-fact, knows-what-is-best-for-everyone way. \"I don't expect you to raise our child on your own.\"\"I could put the child up for adoption.\" Leah could not bring herself to say \"our\" and thought it wrong to say \"my.\" In any case, she had no intention of putting the baby up for adoption, but she wanted to hear his reaction to the possibility.\"I wouldn't go along with that,\" he said.\"...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Brady's book is essential reading for scholars and policy makers interested in poverty in the United States and other affluent democracies.\"--John D. Stephens, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill\"David Brady has written a masterful book on understanding how such a wide variation in poverty can exist in rich, democratic societies.  This is indeed an abundant resource for understanding and explaining the institutions and politics that perpetually affect differing levels of poverty and inequality across multiple welfare states.  It will stand as the definitive explanation of institutional variation in poverty for political economists and sociologists for a long time to come.\"--Timothy Smeeding, University of Wisconsin-Madison\"Rich Democracies, Poor Peopleuses a comprehensive framework to explain variations in poverty across developed societies. It makes an important contribution toward understanding the linkage between welfare state politics and poverty.\"--International Journal of Social Welfare\"Brady's book sits squarely in the mainstream of current poverty research and is the most incisive, most informative, and most comprehensive treatment of that research published to date. This book belongs in every academic library and in as many classrooms as possible.\"--International Journal of Comparative Sociology\"Rich Democracies, Poor Peopleis a carefully-conceived adroitly-executed, and emintely-accessible piece of scholarship that will shape the fields of poverty studies and political sociology for years to come.\" --Contemporary Sociology", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At one level, the contributors' reading of the biblical text is simply more accurate than traditional interpretations that simply ignore race in favor of a simplistic presumption of euro-western supremacy. Yet at a more important level, this text represents a perspective that is theologically and socially much healthier for both communities of color and for white Christians. --Dr. Tink Tinker (wazhazhe, Osage Nation), Clifford Baldridge Professor of American Indian Cultures and Religious Traditions, Iliff School of Theology, Denver, COCurtiss DeYoung bears the marks of a modern day prophet. He has worked tirelessly to bring the issue of racial reconciliation and racial justice to the attention of the Christian community. In this new edition of Coming Together, DeYoung reminds us that the journey towards a Biblically-based diversity is a difficult one, but one worth traveling. He has pulled together his personal reflections as well as additional essential voices in this dialogue to provide a thoughtful, Biblical, and needed challenge for the church. --Soong-Chan Rah, author of The Next Evangelicalism and Milton B. Engebretson Associate Professor of Church Growth and Evangelism, North Park Theological SeminaryCurtiss DeYoung is smart. And he's gentle. That's what makes him dangerous. I would call him a prophet, but wouldn't want us to dismiss him that easily. Curtiss DeYoung is an unsung hero of reconciliation, an apologist for liberation, an academic revolutionary, and a pilgrim on the narrow, rugged road that leads to freedom. Read this book... and let it mess with you. And let it move us all a little closer to God and to one another. --Shane Claiborne, author, activist, recovering sinner", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tom's mission in life is to help as many people as he can re-establish their professional and personal lives.  Through his own experience of being suddenly out-of-work and through interviews with thousands of unemployed people, Tom has a unique understanding of the emotional issues of unemployment, and of the strategies required to create a healthy outlook and a more efficient job search.  Tom explains: \"In 18 years, I spoke one-on-one with thousands of unemployed people. In most cases, we met for an eligibility interview where I verified their claims and made sure they were doing everything necessary to remain eligible for their benefits. Like most rookies, I followed the procedure to the letter. I had my interview form and simply went down the list looking for job prospects, phone calls, contacts made, and other customary procedures.  \"As time passed, I discovered I had a lot in common with the 'first timers.' I had owned my own business for more than 20 years. When it closed, I was devastated - and I had no idea how to get through each day, much less find a job. With no energy or self esteem, I felt unwanted and scared. How ironic it was to land a job through networking with friends in which I spent each day hearing the same pain I'd felt myself only months before. \"As I grew more comfortable as an interviewer, I'd ask, 'How are you feeling?' or 'How do you spend your time?' Candidates who sensed that I was genuinely interested in them often broke down and cried. They were hurting and disoriented. They were somewhere they'd never been before, yet they were expected to fall into place and accept their plight.  \"Because I truly cared, I developed a program called Transition Layoff Counseling, and I would suggest that certain candidates attend my weekly seminars. Each week, I spent 90 minutes providing feedback and instructions based on the one-on-one interviews. Afterward, I tracked their progress. To my amazement, 92% were back to work in 5 months. \"I went on to become the manager of the local office over the next 15 years, but I never forgot the gut-wrenching feeling of becoming unemployed. I've helped thousands of people by implementing the principles in Little Victories, and I hope that this book will help you establish your own string of victories, a new job and a happier life.\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The rules of golf appear simple--there are only 34 of them--but, in fact, they conceal a minefield of possible interpretations. Displaying an engaging, anecdotal style, Palmer takes the reader through all the rules, discussing possible trouble spots and supplying examples from golf history. We learn, for example, that Ian Woosnam, in the 2001 British Open, was hardly the first pro to be penalized for having too many clubs in his bag. Johnny Miller met the same fate when it was discovered that he was carrying his son's toy driver along with his own clubs. Similar stories illustrate each rule as Palmer works his way from the differences between match and medal play through to what it means (and doesn't mean) to play the ball as it lies. A potentially boring topic (even for golfers) made fascinating by one of the game's legends.Bill OttCopyright © American Library Association.

In researching the market for the book, I discovered that I was not the only girl in the world to be born without a vagina. I realized that many people struggle with gender dysfunction, teenage alcoholism, anorexia, date rape, bullying and more. As I opened my heart to others and started sharing my secrets, they started sharing their stories and that gave me the impetus to continue. This memoir is raw, rude and real.  My hope is that it challenges people to think.  So far, everyone who has read it says it is a real tear-jerker. I am currently working on a musical CD to complement the book.  If I make you cry, I am sorry, but I have finally gotten to the point where feeling something is better than feeling nothing.Thank you for your continued support,Kay", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Earning her living as a journalist, she was an unmarried mother who stood apart by blending radical politics with Christian teachings and spiritual piety. She identified with early feminists and socialists, but unlike Emma Goldman or Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, she could not reconcile viewpoints that rejected religion. An internal struggle ended when she converted to Catholicism and committed herself to the faith that dominated her life's work. The Catholic Workers Movement, founded by Day during the Depression, continues to support community houses in urban slum areas. Written in a simple, spare style that draws from the subject's writings, this account affirms a life of service to the destitute and underprivileged. Black-and-white photographs appear in a 16-page center section. The text compares favorably to Jim O'Grady's Dorothy Day (Ward Hill, 1993), but neither volume measures up to adult biographies in emphasizing her influence on the American Catholic Church.

While South Carolina had its charms, every man has his limits, and Dr. Brooks reached his.Most people get into the healing profession because they enjoy being a help to others, and Brooks is no exception. He tell many stories of all different kinds of animals and their owners. Even though this book is an autobiography, the author is careful to show the good as well as the bad. He also applies this concept equally to critters of the two-legged kind.How does one counteract the daily stress of the life of a veterinarian? It helps if one has a family. At the end of the day, Brooks will be home with the ones who perhaps care about his well-being the most.Each chapter ofTending Crittersgives a glimpse of a man who dedicates his life to animals. No matter how big or how small, the word pictures are so vivid that the characters will leap off the page and into readers' hearts. I had fun reading this book, and finished in about an hour.It's perfect for those times when you only have a spare minute or two to read. \"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Humor & Entertainment", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Two members of the Godslove clan have been killed, and a third survived an attempt on her life.

Hired to break into a local judge's house and extract money and papers from a wall safe, Lefty Wright, a small-time thief, stumbles over the judge's corpse and is immediately surrounded by policemen. Wright later calls Diamond from prison, where he awaits trial for murder, and convinces the PI of his innocence. As Diamond proceeds with his investigation, the police, the governor and especially prosecuting attorney and DA candidate Lowell Ryder all make it very clear that they don't want him involved. When Wright is killed \"trying to escape\" en route to court, things get really interesting. Scrambling to make a case, Diamond trails crooked cops and even resurrects his dormant acting career to appear in a bit part in a movie to get close to a key suspect. Throughout the book, Diamond is reading Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo, which parallels his current case.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sadly not yet, but if we sent representatives like Hillary Rambunctious Cocker to The White House the world could be a better place. Karla Zemler has done a masterful job defining the world of \"pawlitics\" through the soulful eyes of a Cocker Spaniel. This book is a whimsical romp through the world of politics but instead of using today's jaded comments about the evils of government, the readers are reminded that a great society is built upon good governance, and that good governance is based upon the old fashioned notion that we treat others the way we would like to be treated ourselves. --Cheryl Ammeter-Series writer for Radio Disney and Barney & Friends Author of Ivey and the AirshipHillary goes to The White House, by Dallas based, Karla Zemler, is a delightful read through the eyes of the faithful Hillary, the Rambunctious Cocker as she heads to Washington. Special points, thoughts for the reader, are delivered in contrasting red print. A Special Plan lays out wise words to live and strive for complete with asides in doggie references. Photographer, Debra Gloria, gives the reader a visual treat with her photos of Hillary throughout the book. The final thoughts sum up Hillary's guidance, \"Do what your heart of hearts tells you, and you will find your purpose and be one happy puppy, like me.\" --Rachel Baker Ford BM, MA, Editor & Photographer Garland Area Democratic Voice", "related": [], "rank": 5091511, "title": "Hillary Goes to the White House", "author": "Karla Lee Zemler", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I would have to say that the revised edition is far superior and much cheaper because of the wonderful e-book revolution.I am sometimes asked how I come up with such amazing story lines, I can honestly say that I don't really know. Certain things have a relevance to my life, but most of it just comes faster than I can type with two fingers. Something I try to do is to avoid excessive padding as children tell me it is boring and slows down the story.  My books of short stories are unusual, quirky and thought provoking. Several will be uploaded in the near future, as will parts 2&3 of the Toby Smith series.Best wishes, Jeff", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Feisty, aggressive Noreen was wielding a potted plant when she cornered her ex-lover Helen Ananias at a party the previous night. After defusing this situation, Robin learned something more was afoot: Noreen hired her to conduct an investigation--cash up front, details to follow. The next morning, when Noreen is found lying on the kitchen floor, blood pooled at the back of her head, Robin can't forget a comment she heard Helen make to Emanuela \"Manny\" Diaz, Noreen's latest and highly distraught lover, at the party: \"It's time someone gave Noreen a little bit of her own poison.\" Neither the local police chief--with his sneering disdain for gays and lesbians--nor the local coroner/undertaker sees the death as anything more than \"simple cardiac arrest,\" but Robin decides to delve into Noreen's past--and realizes someone has been there investigating before her. Although Robin's sleuthing is as sharp as always, Maiman's ( Crazy for Loving ) lengthy romantic scenes between Robin and chef K. T. Bellflower slow the pace and Robin's musings over tragedy in her own childhood are contrived and unconvincing.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His writings reflect an eclectic interest in the impact new technologies impose on individuals and social groups. His latest research into programming the genome has led to the COHORT novels. Deadly Awakenings is today's Science Fiction, but soon will be science fact. Longtime friends seek to save a colleague who disappeared after discovering the secret to re-programming the human genome. When her private plane crashes returning from a conference her body is never recovered, raising hope that she is still alive. Determined to locate and rescue her, Elizabeth Stosak, founder of modern epigenetics, and her cohort of friends launch an international rescue operation. Corporate spies, assassins, and a secret society of ancient people threaten their success. They discover they have powerful mental abilities that foreshadow the emergence of a new human species. Onset is a story about Shannon O'Quinn and James Russo's niece, Chloe Russo. She must fight dark forces that want her emerging mental powers for potential weaponry. She must sort out truth from fiction while dealing with her own fear of onset schizophrenia and the trials of a life that have suddenly confined her to a wheelchair. A summer internship at a metropolitan hospital finds her responsible for the safety of a patient her own age that is fighting her own mental demons. Her work in is compounded by the dubious attentions of an all-too-charming psychiatrist.  Onset takes place in the year between Deadly Awakenings and the second Cohorts novel. In Evolutis Rising, scientists have realized they have become the next human species. The newly named species, Homo Evolutis, can self-evolve by reprogramming its genome. The struggle for power expands, bringing the cohorts in conflict with government, corporations, and an ancient people called The Followers.  Darkwood, a paramilitary corporation, seeking to control the World, exacerbates their initial conflict with the Followers. Both forces point out the need for the Cohort to prepare their government to accept and plan for a species that can live forever, while defending population against these sinister forces wish to over-take the world.  A third novel, Genecaust continues the Cohort struggle as their enemies make a final, nefarious, insane effort for domination.

One theme that rings true in the book and in my observations is that dating violence can affect anyone, and young women are especially vulnerable. I would highly recommend the book to anyone who was interested in understanding the dynamics of initmate partner violence.

In 1994 she left her beloved hometown along with her son to follow her then husband throughout his career in the U.S. Coast Guard. During the ensuing 18 years, besides raising her son, Amy volunteered for 12 years with the Coast Guard as a Command Family Liason, did freelance work in floral design, confectionery art and catering and was the quintessential wedding and funeral singer. You might say she is well-rounded in the fine arts but never settled on just one or two areas through which she could earn a living. Probably as much, if not more than anything, Amy enjoys her passion and love affair for cooking and hospitality along with all that those finer endeavors entail. After leaving behind her life as a military wife, Amy has set about reinventing herself in an “everything old is new again” fashion. Her first step in that direction is the creation of this cookbook; finishing a project that was begun and set aside many years ago. Her goal has been simply this: to finish something important, reflective of herself and her heritage. Social media has played an instrumental role in bringing the concept of this book to fruition. Wishing to participate with other friends on Facebook, yet not wanting to succumb to the mundane, Amy began to post regularly about things she had baked or meals she had prepared at home on Wildey Rd., sometimes including photographs. In a short time she developed the persona of The Chef…at Wildey Inn. Her friends seemed positively responsive to her posts and one might say they were “hungry” for them. It was not long before Amy was approached in public by someone who wanted directions to and reservations for The Wildey Inn…and they were very serious about that. Being in the company of J.T. at the time, who knew nothing of her Wildey Inn posts on Facebook, Amy was in the position of having to explain and was very unsure what the outcome would be. J.T. seemed completely charmed by the whole idea and the mysterious “Wildey Inn” was born.The Chef at Wildey Inn busily prepares food for her one and only guest and has been taming beastly appetites since 2009. Ms. Brennan resides in York County, Virginia and is Director of Music for Olde Yorke Chapel at US Coast GuardTraining Center Yorktown, Virginia. She has one son, James and his wife Hannah, nearby and Tucker, a Bluetick Spaniel born behind the woodpile...at Wildey Inn.", "related": ["B009B0R076"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

For the last three years, whenever an entertainment celebrity died, I knew that they will be escorted to me within a week. Some of them came back for another visit. They all still had the persona and appearance of their most recent physical life but the ego was gone and they became nice normal people. It was a real pleasure to converse with all of them and I conducted the interviews as if I was face to face with them in physical body. I could see and converse with each one as if they were in my room with me. Most of the time we talked about their life and how they made the choices that they did. We learn how culture affected them and what it was like to live their lives. We hear their inner most thoughts about who they were and what they would like us to know about them.This project was created for two main reasons. Many people today are totally fascinated by any news about the celebrity population. These people make the headlines every week in the tabloids and when one of them dies, it is a big deal. Usually, death means the end of the celebrity stories. But death is not the end of the being that was the celebrity.As everyone else does, they live on in spirit and continue to grow and learn about many things. By \"channeling\" the celebrity after they experience their transition from physical to spirit, we can continue the story and at the same time we can teach people about the afterlife. These are two subjects that many people are interested in and they will want to read about the celebrities in afterlife.These stories will reach an audience that might not normally read about spiritual concepts and ideas. Hopefully it will open some minds and get people asking some questions.The other reason this project was important was that it allowed each celebrity soul to look at their most recent life and understand how events and circumstances affected them. They can see if they made proper choices and also understand what they would have done differently. It is a life review of sorts. It gives each one the opportunity to tell us words of wisdom that they might have discovered now that they are back in spirit.It is a winning situation all around and I am sure you will enjoy how all these different personalities interpret the transition from physical to spirit. There is much to learn from their experiences that they have come here so graciously to share with us.  Dianna Gutoski     7/918/12", "related": [], "rank": 3382414, "title": "Conversations with Music Legends: Heaven's Hall of Fame", "author": "Dianna Gutoski", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Loving Lucius is another tale in the extraordinary Werescape series. The now familiar changes in personal points of view of the central characters, expose the reader to the insecurities of living in a world AEI (After Extraterrestrial Invasion) as well as to the dreams of connecting with someone that will stand alongside through every difficulty. Elise has a secret. Lucius/man doesn't like secrets. Lucius/Wolf doesn't care about secrets, he just wants to protect, to claim. And while the people/wolves in the story work through their fears and hopes, further details about alien schemes of genetic manipulation are exposed. Sure, Loving Lucius is romantic, erotic, adventurous and fantastic with a touch of alien creepiness. But I have to step back a bit and take in the whole picture. With each successive book I read in the Werescape series, I appreciate Skhye Moncrief's ability to shape a story more than ever. Book 4, Loving Lucius pulled me into life AEI a little more the number 3, Beauty and the Brute, just as book 3 drew me in more than the first two books in the series, Cougar and Resurrecting the Beast. All together, the books tell an epic, post-apocalyptic story of world redefining itself after aliens have decimated earth and the human way of life. Individually, each novel beautifully depicts characters that struggle to understand exactly what has happened to them while they try to prepare for what will happen in the future. The aliens are still out there.\" Reader review at B&N posted under LOVING LUCIUS", "related": ["B00K97O622"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

An English teacher or writer, trying to pick up a few extra dollars, would usually run these classes in their homes on a weekday night for six weeks. One teacher, six to twelve students. Each week we would submit a short story. The teacher would read two or three parts of submitted stories, then the floor would open for comments, moving around the circle in a clockwise pattern for approximately five minutes each, to praise or criticize their work. If you did not have thick skin, this was no place for you. Many quit after their short story was read and commented on. I am guessing that they where never to attend another.   The teacher was the last to comment. The instructor also policed the group so that one person could not rattle on about nothing. I found the classes a good way to understand that I could be making the same mistake as the other writers.  It really helped me to write with a much more coherent and comprehensive style. Some criticism I received I took and others I discarded.  I always stayed to the end of the six weeks as I learned as much as i could from others errors and successes, as well as my own. Classes that started out with twelve participants, would usually end up with around five at the end.      Most of the students were women. Being a single man at that time, I found this not to be a class that I dreaded. One of these nights, I handed in a rather a intense short story that could of offended some of the students. When it was time for the leader of the group to read my paper, he totally distorted what I had written. Perhaps the subject matter was too intense for him, or he thought it too intense for his students. I took objection to this. I said nothing and in discussing my situation with one of my friends, he suggested I turned in a short story about a student taking revenge on a teacher who butcher his short story. At first I laughed, and thought what a great idea. After giving it some thought I imagined; what if something happening to that teacher and me with a written confession in his possession. I was the one, who could of found himself in some non-fiction real trouble.", "related": [], "rank": 1716459, "title": "Murder Thy Neighbor", "author": "William Rutherford", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Even my own status meetings and reports sometimes failed to capture the project's status. I found this was occuring because I was missing the critical steps outlined in this book. Prior to writting this book, I created my own checklist to be used when setting up the status reporting processes on my project. Upon sharing with other project managers, I realized that while it isn't revolutionary, it wasn't something all project managers were doing. So that check list was expanded into The Lost Art of Project Status Reporting.", "related": [], "rank": 856934, "title": "The Lost Art of Project Status Reporting eBook", "author": "Thomas Ghantt", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Well, that's just one more question among the others I have posed, that you will have to find the answers to yourself, by getting Ken's book. You will not be disappointed! ---Best selling author Jim Lowrance", "related": ["B0097HAPDY"], "rank": 953066, "title": "Cruise Killer: Eleven Deadly Days in the Caribbean: Marsha & Danny Jones Thriller", "author": "Ken Rossignol", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Miller has been interested in stories from a very young age, and as a child she frequented the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), where paintings that told stories held her interest. At the University of Pennsylvania Yael majored in English with a Medieval/Renaissance concentration and minored in Classical Studies.  She likes to say that she spent four years studying story.  In her senior year Yael won the 2004-2005 Penn Playwriting Fellowship, which earned a stipend and a week-long workshopping of her short play JULIET’S NURSE (an Ovidian retelling of Shakespeare’s ROMEO AND JULIET). In the spring of 2007 Yael became interested in New Orleans and the effect Hurricane Katrina had on it.  She began to write a half-hour tv pilot about a 12-year-old boy who moves with his father to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.    In October 2007, two years after Hurricane Katrina, Yael visited New Orleans for the first time – discovering the places where her characters roam. Somewhere along the way she changed the story from a tv pilot to a Middle Grade novel, and in the spring of 2013 Yael self-published JACK STROM AND NEW ORLEANS HOODOO. Yael works in web development.

Although they follow a definite pattern (as is the case with episode's)\neach episode is written as a stand-alone story in its own right - so don't be\nafraid to 'jump in' anywhere along the line.Aviemore, the small town at the centre of\nthe story, is very much a real place and certainly worth a visit if you are\never in Scotland. Indeed, most of the places mentioned in the stories are in\nfact real places, though the names may have been altered for privacy's sake.\nThe green lochan for instance is a fantastic place for a picnic - and it is\nactually an opaque green colour. Do fairies really wash their clothes there?Although these episodes are categorised as\ncontemporary romance, I have to admit that there is as much action and\nadventure included, especially in the later stories. Contemporary romance it\nseems, is a little more 'gritty' these days than Sally and Robert would be\nhappy with - the Highland idea of morals a little more adverse to 'getting you're\nkit out' perhaps! Subsequently 'adult' content is only included where it actually\nplays a part in the overall story - if you're looking for gratuitous hot and\nsteamy sex scenes - these stories are perhaps not for you!I have visited and stayed in Aviemore many\ntimes, and continue to do so whenever I get the chance. It is a quiet peaceful\ntown, surrounded by spectacular mountains and beautiful highland scenery. - Ideal\nfor long walks and planning the next Sally book! This Highland town is popular\nboth in summer and winter for the many outdoor pursuits available; with Skiing\nin the Cairngorm Mountains, being the\nmajor draw over the winter period.Through these stories, I invite you to share\nand experience (albeit vicariously) the life of Sally and Robert, along with\ntheir growing family; as they settle into life in the highlands of Scotland.

Grade 4–9—Readers enter the creative, sensitive mind of Pablo Neruda, the Nobel Prize-winning poet, in this beautifully written fictional biography. Ryan artfully meshes factual details with an absorbing story of a shy Chilean boy whose spirit develops and thrives despite his father's relentless negativity. Neruda, who was born Neftali Reyes, sees, hears, and feels poetry all around him from an early age. Luckily he finds understanding and encouragement from his stepmother and his uncle, whose humanitarian and liberal attitudes toward nature and the rights of the indigenous Mapuche people greatly influence his developing opinions. In early adulthood, Reyes starts using the pseudonym by which he becomes known, taking his last name from that of a famous Czechoslovakian poet. Ryan suggests that this was how he hid his activities from his father. Her poetic prose style totally dovetails with the subject. Interspersed with the text are poems that mimic Neruda's style and push readers to think imaginatively and visually. Sís's whimsical pen-and-ink pointillist illustrations enliven the presentation. Each chapter is preceded by three small drawings that hint at something to come. The perfect marriage of text and art offers an excellent introduction to one of the world's most famous poets. An appended author's note gives further insight into Neruda's beliefs and accomplishments. In addition there are excerpts from several of his poems and odes.

But she soon learns that he can both travel through time and send others on similar journeys. When he strands Abbie on an island off the coast of California in the year 1704, she also learns that she is the key to his plans to change the history of Spanish colonization in the New World. Unable to return to the present by herself, Abbie faces survival in a hostile world. In this debut novel, Abbie's adjustments to strange, unfriendly cultures are interesting, but they sometimes seem too easy. The ending, in which Abbie loses all memory of her ordeals, seems rather strange, because the rest of the story has been told in the first person. If one can ignore these inconsistencies, however, it is easy to be caught up in an entertaining historical adventure story. For popular fiction collections.?Barbara E.

Everything you’d never expect! Ramblin’ Gamblin’ Willie’s got the ramblin’ blues. His bloodhound, his long-time boon companion Naso, has just died, and Willie’s gone to Las Vegas to regain his footing. What does he see in his wanderings? You’ll have to read his new book of stories, Losing Slowly, to see everything he turned up, but here are some highlights: * How can a guy go from being a busted gambler to a broke cab-driver to the headliner in a comedy club? * Does Jay Sarno’s ghost do a nightly patrol of The Strip like a mysterious Batman-on-the-come? * How does anybody have the stones to dedicate a book to a billionaire – and then make the dedication pay off? Losing Slowly is not what you’re expecting, a promise Brother Willie always delivers on: ”Upstairs in the Shoppes, every damn jewelry store is vastly empty, just like everywhere else, but unlike the other miles-of-malls at casino-hotel-resorts, the less-tony retailers were doing real business. “I put my money where my mouth is, too: I actually left cash behind in a casino, something I make a stout effort never to do. “I bought my wife a gift, that’s what happened. Huge, momentous story, right? This is the Willie world: I don’t go to your church. If you want twelve dead bodies a page, with the bad guys flossing their teeth with their victims’ veins, you bought the wrong book. I’m interested in real people and the things they really do. Real people shop. Me, too – and no one is more astounded by that fact than I am.” In twelve stories, plus a bonus chapter for studious readers, Uncle Willie gives you Vegas as anyone can see it – but no one ever does.", "related": ["B00DTBDI7Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Contemporary readers who saw Burgess’ 1962 dystopian novel as a celebration of youth violence were as far off base as the teens since then who have thrilled to the transgressive violence it—or, at least, Stanley Kubrick’s film adaptation—depicts. But paradox is at the heart of this book, as this newly restored, fiftieth-anniversary edition makes more clear than ever. Narrated by Alex, a teenage dandy who revels in language (he speaks a slang called Nadsat), music (especially Bach and Beethoven), and violence, especially violence. When imprisoned for murder, he is offered a chance at reform and leaps at it—but the reform turns out to be brainwashing, an aversion therapy that, alas, leaves him able to enjoy neither beatings nor Beethoven. Upon his release he becomes first a victim of his victims, then a cause célèbre of antigovernment activists before . . . well, publishers offered different endings to British and American audiences, as readers will discover here. What makes A Clockwork Orange so challenging, besides the language (“He looked a malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four of us”), is Burgess’ willingness to use an unsympathetic protagonist to make his point, which is essentially that it may be better to choose evil than to be forced to be good. (For, as it is put by two different characters: “When a man cannot choose he ceases to be a man.”) Readers can revisit or discover a classic that, while drawing from Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World and Graham Greene’s Brighton Rock, has in turn influenced authors from Irvine Welsh to Suzanne Collins. Extras include a thoughtful introduction by editor Andrew Biswell, reproductions of manuscript pages annotated by Burgess, and a previously unpublished chapter of a book that was to have been called The Clockwork Condition, in which Burgess intended to set the record straight about his intentions now that Kubrick’s film adaptation had made him famous. Readers will learn much, including the meaning behind the book’s title. All in all, a fitting publication of a book that remains just as shocking and thought provoking as ever. --Keir Graff", "related": ["B002JA023E"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The story that eventually becameSleepwalkerswas one of my earliest fantasies about the subject. I came up with it when I was maybe 11. There was nothing erotic about that first version; I was too young to know much about sex, and I had no clue what a fetish was - much less that I already had one. The story was just a couple of scenes and a vague idea of where I hoped to go from there.I alwaysdidwant to go on from there; I wanted to write a whole novel. But it took until 2012 to figure out how to make it work. That was when I realized the story lay with Paul rather than Shara (She'd been my original lead character). When I started novelizing, I ditched the opening scene of the old fantasy, heavily reworked the second scene, and changed the point of view from Shara to Paul. In the process, Shara became a completely different character from the one I first envisioned, but I think she's more interesting now. As for Wizard, she wasn't even a twinkle in my eye untilafterI wrote the first draft of the novel; but now she's my favorite character of the trio. A lot of my early readers seem to feel the same.Just as I've always dreamed of turning my fantasy into a novel, I've always dreamed ofpublishingthat novel. I can't believe it's finally happened. Sleepwalkers is a story that took more than 30 years to come to fruition.", "related": ["B00FVO0E2Y"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Her brain buzzed with an explosion of light tinged by jagged pain. Biting and then she realized it was the skin on her bottom that stung. Red-hot and he did it again. To the other side.    \"Please,\" she hissed. Eyes closed. \"That hurts.\"    \"Tell me to stop.\" He caressed her bottom, his large palm flat against her skin as she squirmed on top of his lap. Dressed only in jeans, Brett's warm torso came into contact with her naked bottom as he pressed her down onto his muscular thighs.    She wouldn't tell him to stop. Not after he'd withstood a beat down.  \"Go ahead.\"    He smacked her bottom ten more times alternating sides and making her count, and then instructed her to thank him. Can you imagine!    \"Thank you,\" she blubbered, her eyes stinging from salty tears. She blinked them away by the time he hauled her upright to sit on his lap. She was very naked, and the feel of his jeans under her bottom was decadent.    He laid her down on the mattress and dropped his pants revealing his rock solid cock hugging his abs. \"There isn't anything nice about using someone. I'd never do that to you.\" He went to the bathroom and returned with a bottle of lotion.    Turning her over, he hoisted her hips into the air. He rubbed her ass cheeks with the lotion that immediately cooled the burn. His breath caressed her skin. \"Beautiful. Pink, and so damn perfect. I'd love to do more than run my hands over this part of your body. But not tonight.

All she wants to do is to get home to her dying mother and one thing after another seems to get in the way, starting with the fact that she is in prison. Stealing a country music star's tour bus leads to some unique coincidences and allows for plenty of time to learn a few lessons about life along the way. In Loreen on the Lam: A Tennessee Mystery by Marielena Zuniga, several different mysteries come together and the more Loreen tries to remain isolated, the more she becomes entangled. Ironically, while she is running from the law, she ends up preventing one crime and solving another 25-year-old mystery. Through the intervention of what she comes to think must really be divine guidance, she manages to get back to her home town. The question is, exactly what is waiting for her?With a touch of humor and a good dose of common sense, Loreen on the Lam tells a story of a life gone wrong that may be on the way to getting back on the right track. Loreen is forced to do a lot of thinking and as she discovers some truths about herself, some basic insights into personal choices, forgiveness, and redemption shine through to provide a brighter outlook on life. Loreen's experiences teach a subtle lesson about never giving up in spite of personal trouble, heartache, and loss. This is a terrific story told with a hint of the South that begs for the pages to keep on turning.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.6, "rating_total": 23.0}

Bugni's crisp prose, clever plotting, and believable dialogue all add up to a fascinating read.  I appreciate the perfect length of each chapter and brisk pacing of the story.  Overall, Consumed is an excellent crime-thriller with substantial suspense from start to finish.- Lit Amri of Reader's FavoriteFive Stars.I haven't read a thriller this good in a long time.  The first chapter hooked me into the tangled web and by the end I wished it wasn't over.

Plus, it's super duperhot!H.O.T. Hot. It was nice to take off the blinders, stop worrying about what people would think, and just write whatever came into my head for these two. It's been an amazing experience both creatively and mentally. I'm so glad I wrote this as a serial...otherwise I don't think I would have been able to finish it. I wouldn't have had the heart. Thank you to everyone who has read and cheered and asked for more. You are what got me through the story.There is an Adam and Elizabeth because of you!Teaseis more than just steamy bedroom scenes. There is a complicated love story that develops underneath Elizabeth's rules. There is a connection between these two characters that neither saw coming, but both needed desperately.
