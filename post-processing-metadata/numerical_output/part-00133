Eddy, a 16-year-old Japanese American, tells how he and his buddies, Chik and Cobra, become part of Company B of the 100th Infantry Battalion following the attack on Pearl Harbor. Without discounting the community's old loyalties to Japan, the story makes clear the transition caused by the declaration of war, and by the desire to be part of the great fight to protect America. These young men are patriotic, but the powers that be have a hard time trusting their dedication. The novel is based on historical fact, and Salisbury brings events vividly to life as he recounts one humiliation after another foisted on the troops, from the top down to their immediate commanders. In one scene, these soldiers are heading to training camps on trains that pass internment camps for other Japanese Americans. As the actual assignment unfolds–they are to act as bait in the training of attack dogs–the pernicious racism and absurd beliefs are further revealed. The immediacy of the writing allows readers to imagine themselves as one of the boys. A story with huge implications for observers of current events.–Carol A.

Oh, it was once the Coot Capitol of the World, but now it's 1953, and that distinction is long past. Still, 10-year-old Franny Hansen and her raucous best friend, Sandy, manage to have fun, mostly involving harrassing prissy Nancy, the richest girl in town. There is one thing that Franny is serious about, and that's her piano playing. True, her teacher mostly sleeps through lessons (a cigarette dangling from her lips), but when Franny outplays Nancy in a school assembly, she knows her talent is something to be nutured. Then despair sets in. How can she progress when there's no one good enough to give her lessons? Enter Olga Malenkov. The locals buzz that a \"commie\" has come to town, but Franny is thrilled when she hears Olga play and realizes she would make a perfect teacher. Too bad, Olga wants nothing to do with Franny. Blume offers a story that is as rich as it is delicious. Using a narrative style that's slighty over the top, she sets Franny, by turn hopeful and hopeless, and her passion for the piano against the larger issues of the Red Scare that were so emblematic of the time. The characters, especially those in supporting roles, are as nuanced as they are humorous. Sandy is in equal parts proud of Franny's talent and threatened by it, and Mr. Hansen, who gave up his own musical dreams, shrugs off his ineffectuality to support his daughter. Read this one aloud and then talk about it.

Jason Starr's bettor loses the score of a lifetime when a fake security guard mugs him on the way to his car. There is more to horse racing than hard-luck lowlifes, however, as demonstrated by Laura Hillenbrand in her history of the Kentucky Derby and Steven Crist in his analysis of the overwhelming popularity of Smarty Jones. Best of all is William Nack's reminiscence of the summer of 1959, when he was a lowly groom in a powerhouse stable and was torn between the track and college. He chose college and the life of a writer, but he was always drawn back to the track, as were most of the authors in this irresistible collection. It is easy to see why.Dennis DodgeCopyright © American Library Association.

Volponi (1924-1994), who garnered international acclaim for his 1949 novel My Troubles Began, was one of Italy's literary luminaries, a two-time recipient of the Premio Strega book award. This is the first English translation of a 1975 work in which the author's hometown serves as the setting for national events. The characters are caricatures: The tyrannical remnant of local Renaissance royalty, Count Oddo Oddi-Semproni, and his sweet-natured whore, Dirce, are countered by the bandy-legged anarchist Professor Gaspare Subissoni and \"his woman,\" Vives, a tragically stoic Spanish revolutionary and the book's most resonant soul. All are set in motion by the television?a dour main character?when it broadcasts news of terrorist bombings in Milan. It's a Calvino-esque picture of modernity enthralled by technology, one that argues for decentralized government and personal freedom with an impressive eye for detail. Whether the pervasively obtuse syntax and strange language (a passage on Oddo's beard reads, \"The young man's down sparkled with satisfaction, dense like the subject of a Bronzino portrait\") are the faults of the translation or the original, there is something at odds between Volponi's powerfully incisive sensibility and the simple, at times silly, drama.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 4336598, "title": "Last Act in Urbino", "author": "Paolo Volponi", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Auntie, who came to England from India to look after the girls after their mother's death, is marrying Mr. Arora, the head of their school. Amber narrates from the center of the action as the family dodges the wild wedding-planning fancies of Mr. Arora's own strong-minded auntie. She is also drooling over a new boy at school who thinks he can rap, and her uncle-to-be uses his status to persuade her to befriend Kiran, a bullying new girl at school. Amid the squeals, giggles, and hijinks of Auntie's wedding, Amber learns some lessons about not judging others so quickly. The light banter and romantic theme make for a quick, appealing read.

The stories take place at various times between 1948, the year that marks the beginning of apartheid, through 2000. The main characters, who come from different ethnic and economic groups, are all children, and Naidoo's reliance on a child's perspective ensures that the material remains emotionally manageable. The author's touch is deft and sure, as she captures the ordinary details of life, along with the racism displayed in the speech and attitudes of white South Africans. In one of the most wrenching stories, \"The Noose,\" a boy of mixed race relates how on his birthday his father was reclassified \"African,\" thus imperiling not only his job, but even his ability to live with his family. Other stories tell of the white daughter of politically progressive parents who is trying to negotiate the racist world of her friend's parents, and a black African girl whose grandmother is drawn into helping her activist granddaughter during the Soweto uprising of 1976. The final story, about a middle-class boy of Indian descent who comes to feel a connection to a child living in a neighboring squatter settlement, leaves readers with the hope that human kindness will eventually triumph over the divisions among people. A time line of apartheid laws linked to the stories helps to establish the social and political context. As well as enriching any study of Southern Africa or human rights, Out of Bounds will be embraced by children seeking to expand their understanding of the world and other people.Sue Giffard, Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York CityCopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Dowling can't believe that Barrett fathered Madeline Murphy's child, but he knows that even an unfounded accusation could destroy his friend. Into the mix add Ned Bunting, an irksome aspiring author who hopes to get famous by writing a book about clerical sexual scandals. When Bunting's body washes ashore on Lake Michigan, no one mourns. But who killed him? Was it Barrett, or some other priest, trying to squelch Bunting's exposé? The book, though timely, is so heavy on dialogue that it reads almost like a screenplay. Too little attention to scene-setting and two-dimensional characters won't win the series new fans.(Aug.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Confederate Captain John J. Dickison commanded Company H, 2nd Florida Cavalry, which operated mostly in the interior of the state. Other companies were added to his force from time to time. Most historians credit him and his men for making it too hazardous for the Union troops to gain a foothold in the area west of the St. Johns River and east of Cedar Key. In fact, after the Battle of Olustee, nearly every time they tried to invade, the Union troops were soundly defeated.The Union forces did organize two regiments of cavalry from Florida men who had their reasons for wanting to fight against the Confederacy. Most of those recruited were from the west coast. The recruitment efforts were not as successful on the east coast. I suspect, as have other historians, that the Union Army's heavy-handed tactics in this area alienated many folks. On the west coast, the Union blockade squadron achieved more success, as they protected the Florida Unionists, armed them, and traded with them. Records show that in early 1864 a few Union recruits were signed up in St. Augustine, but as to whether someone like Dan Farrell experienced further success is not clear.I tried to replicate the engagements depicted as faithfully as possible. It may seem curious that the Confederates won all of the significant fights, but that is what the record states.The Union suffered a huge setback at Olustee, which also torpedoed hopes for readmission of the state until after the surrender.The Maple Leaf, which Confederate mines sunk off Mandarin Point just south of Jacksonville, has provided intrepid divers with wonderfully preserved artifacts that were saved from deterioration by the same mud that hid the wreck.Confederate scouts captured Colonel Noble and his companions soon after the colonel boasted he could travel between Jacksonvnille and St. Augustine in perfect safety. That Christmas Eve, he discovered he could not.The capture of the dance party acutally occurred in much the manner protrayed. Although the young soldier who infiltrated behind the lines to gather intelligence from his father is not identified in Dickison's writings, I assert it is very likely he was my uncle Charles Colee, who brought out his father, George, to talk with his commander.Dickison and his men achieved two amazing exploits that almost defy belief. The capture of the gunboat \"Columbine,\" achieved with a few artillery pieces and a dozen sharpshooters, was a unique feat. Cavalry is not supposed to be able to take on a heavily fortified gunship and win! But it happened just south of Palatka.The inconclusive first Battle of Gainesville did not involve Dickison's troop, though the Union reports made those claims. The second Battle of Gainesville was so one-sided that I spent a lot of time scratching my head and analyzing how it was possible. The opposing forces were about equal in strength, and in fact, some of Dickison's men were untrained recruits. The Union troops had just taken the town and should have been in position to resist the attack. Instead, the Confederates crushed them with very few casualties. Of the 300 Union troops involved, only about 40 made it out with the main column, though a number of others managed to straggle to safety. Dickison admitted to only six casualties, two dead and four wounded. This compares to an inconclusive but much larger number of Union dead, many wounded, and over a hundred prisoners. The only explanation I found was that the Union troops were busy looting, were caught off guard, and suffered the consequences.Since the publications of \"Exiles on the St. Johns,\" I have found two more Confederate ancestors previously unknown to me. John J. Irwin, the father-in-law of my great, great grandfather James L. Colee, served as a lieutenant in the same company, Baya's Artillery, 8th Florida. Alexander J. Wells served in Company D, 54th Georga regiment. He was the father-in-law of John Hardy Bolton, my great, great grandfather. I turned up a single, lonely Union soldier in my background, William Boor, who served in an Ohio regiment.I hope I fhave illustrated northeast Florida's much-overlooked role in the War Between the States in an informative and entertaining manner. It is my belief that accurate historical fiction is the most interesting way to learn about those sad but fascinating times.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The action shifts to two 13-year-old boys, Andy and Stig, which is appropriate enough, since the text reads much as though written by a 13-year-old boy for other 13-year-old boys. The plot germ revolves around a white (i.e., good) witch, who's absorbed others' nightmares for pay and been bricked alive into a crypt for some 300 years. With the crypt's opening, those nightmares are unleashed on the community with gory destructiveness. The author makes no attempt to explain why these nightmares are now so tangible when they merely originated from bad dreams. Sexual, scatological and pop cultural asides abound. Eventually, our Andy learns he's descended from the witch and, with a little help from some other 13-year-olds, comes to the rescue of the village and the troubled soul of his ancestor. All this is supposed to be scary, stirring and sweet, but many will find it merely disgusting, boring and tedious. At one point, a character thinks something \"was straight out of a trashy horror movie.\" She could just as well be alluding to this book-which means, of course, that pre-adolescent boys and their like-minded older kin will love it.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He's stranded in the mountains, a winter storm is about to freeze him solid, and there's a man aiming a rifle at him who's about the size of a bear.But Horace Grady's not a threat to Walker's life; just his virtue.Cabin Fever takes us back to the nineteenth century where the winter could leave people trapped inside their cabins for months until the snow melted and spring returned. At times like that, you get to know someone really well and that's what happens here as the young man Horace rescues comes to find out a lot more about himself and Horace than he expected.The love that grows over the course of the winter and the loneliness of both men is well captured and the sex scenes are scorchingly hot and inventive.Full of this author's trademark hot and deliciously kinky take on love, this is story that proves that times might change, but people don't -- and love and need are unchanging.As the spring comes, you'll be wishing, like Horace, that it could stay winter forever.", "related": ["B00IZR0FI2"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With keen analysis Erik German lays bare Amway's formula for recruiting and motivating sales people. Despite his experience, Roger German still thinks highly of Amway, such is the remarkable balance of ironies and contradictions captured in this piece, which straddles the lines of investigative journalism, memoir, and personal essay. --Paul Diamond", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 480688, "title": "My Father's Dream (Kindle Single) eBook", "author": "Erik German", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.25, "rating_total": 34.0}

In 1896, he began working for the London publisher, Redway, and also T. Fisher Unwin as a reader where he remained until 1902. During this time he undertook his first freelance journalistic assignments writing art and literary reviews. He also contributed regular columns to two newspapers: the Speaker (along with his friend Hilaire Belloc) and the Daily News. Throughout his life he contibuted further articles to journals, particularly The Bookman and The Illustrated London News. His first two books were published; two poetry collections, in 1900. These were followed by collections of essays and in 1903 by his most substantial work to that point; a study of Robert Browning. Chesterton's first novel, 'The Napoleon of Notting Hill' was published in 1904. In this book he developed his political attitudes in which he attacked socialism, big business and technology and showed how they become the enemies of freedom and justice. These were themes which were to run throughout his other works. 'The Man who was Thursday' was published in 1908 and is perhaps the novel most difficult to understand, although it is also his most popular. 'The Ball and the Cross' followed in 1910 and 'Manalive' in 1912. Chesterton's best-known fictional character appears in the Father Brown stories, the first of the collection, 'The Innocence of Father Brown', being published in 1911. Brown is a modest Catholic priest who uses careful psychology to put himself in the place of the criminal in order to solve the crime. His output was prolific, with a great variety of books from brilliant studies of Dickens, Shaw, and RL Stevenson to literary criticism. He also produced more poetry and many volumes of political, social and religious essays. Tremendous zest and energy, with a mastery of paradox, puns, a robust humour and forthright devotion along with great intelligence characterise his entire output. In the years prior to 1914 his fame was at its height, being something of a celebrity and seen as a latter day Dr Johnson as he frequented the pubs and offices of Fleet Street. His huge figure was encased in a cloak and wide brimmed hat, with pockets full of papers and proofs. Chesterton came from a nominlly Anglican family and had been baptized into the Church of England. However, he had no particular Christian belief and was in fact agnostic for a time.

W. (Ernest William) Hornung (7 June 1866 - 22 March 1921), known as Willie, was an English author, most famous for writing the Raffles series of novels about a gentleman thief in late Victorian London. Hornung was born in Middlesbrough, England, the third son and youngest of eight children of John Peter Hornung, who was born in Hungary. Ernest Hornung was educated at Uppingham School during some of the later years of its great headmaster, Edward Thring. Hornung spent most of his life in England and France, but in December 1883 left for Australia, arrived in 1884 and stayed for two years where he worked as a tutor at Mossgiel station in the Riverina. Although his Australian experience was brief, it coloured most of his literary work from A Bride from the Bush published in 1899, to Old Offenders and a few Old Scores, which appeared after his death. Nearly two-thirds of his 30 published novels make reference to Australian incidents and experiences. Hornung returned to England in February 1886, and married Constance (\"Connie\") Aimée Monica Doyle (1868-1924), the sister of his friend Sir Arthur Conan Doyle on 27 September 1893. Hornung worked as a journalist and also published the poems Bond and Free and Wooden Crosses in The Times. The character of A. J. Raffles, a \"gentleman thief\", first appeared in Cassell's Magazine in 1898 and the stories were later collected as The Amateur Cracksman (1899). Other titles in the series include The Black Mask (1901), A Thief in the Night (1905), and the full-length novel Mr. Justice Raffles (1909). He also co-wrote the play Raffles, The Amateur Cracksman with Eugene Presbrey in 1903. After Hornung spent time in the trenches with the troops in France, he published Notes of a Camp-Follower on the Western Front in 1919, a detailed account of his time there. Hornung's only child, a son, was killed at Ypres on 6 July 1915; Hornung then took up work with the YMCA in France. Hornung died in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, in the south of France on 22 March 1921, survived by his wife. In addition to his novels and short stories Hornung wrote some war verse, and a play based on the Raffles stories was produced successfully. Hornung was much interested in cricket, and was \"a man of large and generous nature, a delightful companion and conversationalist\". The model for Raffles was George Ives, a Cambridge-educated criminologist and talented cricketer according to Lycett .", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The question is: will you utilize the strategic gems contained in this book intentionally, or will you discover in retrospect that you have used them because they are an elegant path to enduring change?””Nardone offers the reader something precious and rare in the field of psychotherapy and personal change: explicit therapeutic goals that are carefully tailored to the dynamics of specific kinds of problems, and operationally-defined ways to reach those goals by reorienting the client's attention.”", "related": [], "rank": 1761184, "title": "The Strategic Dialogue: Rendering the Diagnostic Interview a Real Therapeutic Intervention", "author": "Giorgio Nardone", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I began to visualize situations in which a Safeguard would be requested. (I get an idea, toy with it, and then - sometimes - characters suggest themselves. A beleaguered farmer...

The narrator, an unnamed Argentinean writer, wanders a city in the south of Brazil. He is a great enthusiast of walking, going so far as to claim that it saved him, although from what he's uncertain: \"maybe from the danger of not being myself... because to walk is to enact the illusion of autonomy and above all the myth of authenticity.\" Recently, however, the act has become less meaningful--or perhaps less mysterious--to him. He seeks out a park \"too large not to have the air of abandonment which so appeals\" to him. He is self-conscious, worried about being ignored, and sure he's being judged; that the judgment of others remains opaque bothers him. Of ultimate concern, finally, is that walking has stopped giving him real insights. The book he's brought with him doesn't interest him nearly as much as boats shaped like swans, the meaning of time, or any number of other observations rendered in fascinating detail. Carson's magnificent translation of Chejfec's latest work should be treated as a significant event.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He lived in and out of orphanages until age sixteen – when he ran away to join the United States Merchant Marine. In eleven years of seamanship, he claimed he read a book a day and learned to write by typing out the complete text of War and Peace and editing out the errors – he subsequently threw the edited work in the ocean.  Jessup was married to Vera in 1944 and had a daughter named Marina. He left the Merchant Marine in 1948 to become a fulltime author. He was at the typewriter ten hours a day. Jessup’s obituary claims he wrote over sixty novels (only confirmed a bibliography of thirty-four). His first novel, The Cunning and the Haunted, was published in 1954 and filmed as The Young Don’t Cry in 1957. Three other novels were also adapted to film – The Deadly Duo, Chuka, and The Cincinnati Kid. He sold the movie rights to the 1971 novel Foxway but it was never filmed. Jessup published eleven novels – primarily westerns and spy thrillers – as Richard Telfair. His last novel, Threat, was published in 1981.

It reveals how we, as individuals and as a race, are killing the planet - and provides keys to change that hold the potential to affect our world and our relationship to it. And it uses observations of these healing methods and teachings as a foundation for describing events in such a fashion that readers are invited into an intuitive and nonlinear experience simply by reading about the experiences.MYSTIC WITNESS is an outstanding account of spiritual transformation and its links to global change. That's not to say that world change stems from individual transformation: more to say that healing trauma and developing sacred awareness in daily life is one of the keys to changing not just our world, but the world as a whole. Only by evolving to a more advanced spiritual state can an individual become an agent of the Divine, with the wider possibility of affecting the world. Any New Age reader will find this a compelling journey charting such a path.Diane Donovan, eBook Reviewer, Midwest Book Review", "related": [], "rank": 2923506, "title": "Mystic Witness", "author": "Larry Alboher D.C.", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Mulroy is  a professor of classics (Univ. of Wisconsin, Milwaukee), and  Carson (classics, McGill Univ.; The Beauty of the Husband) and  the late William Matthews (After All: Last Poems) are  well-regarded poets. Following Pound's dictum to \"make it new,\"  Mulroy and Matthews translate Catullus and Horace into modern  American idiom, striving where possible to find cultural  equivalents rather than literal translations. At the same time,  they try to be true to the shifting tones and rhythms of their  originals. The results are fluent, giving some sense of the  contemporaneousness that Catullus and Horace would have evoked  in their audiences. Carson's translation follows Sappho's  diction and form much more closely and includes the Greek  original on the facing page. Much of what survives of Sappho are  fragments, often just a stray word, phrase, or even a few  letters. Like many modern poets, Carson deploys these on the  blank page, letting their suggestiveness fill the gaps and  create whole lyrics in the imagination of the readers. All three  translators aim for a general audience, though Mulroy and Carson  also include notes and introductions of value to the more  scholarly reader. All three books are recommended for both  public and academic libraries. T.L.

Douglass drew on his experiences as a slave to articulate a version of liberalism that contained the basic Lockean, liberal elements but also promoted an ethic of mutual responsibility. That ethic was the basis for Douglass’s devotion to community, democracy, and state intervention to create a suitable moral ecology for liberal citizens. It was also a platform for expressing his distrust for gross inequalities issuing from the marketplace.The Political Thought of Frederick Douglass provides insights not only into Douglass’s nineteenth-century theory; it serves as a roadmap for navigating ongoing tensions that persist in twenty-first-century liberalism.”-Mark E. Kann,author ofPunishment, Prisons, and Patriarchy\"Looking broadly and deeply into Douglass's reflections on the requisites and moral purposes of liberal democracy, Buccola amplifies our understanding of Douglass's normative political imagination and skillfully demonstrates that Douglass also appreciated how a free society is nurtured and sustained by a moral ecology of personal courage, moral responsibility, and civic virtue.”-Thomas A. Spragens, Jr.,author ofCivic Liberalism: Reflections on Our Democratic Ideals“Nicholas Buccola's well-conceived, well-researched, and well-argued new study stands out in an increasingly crowded field of work on Frederick Douglass. Displaying a thorough familiarity with Douglass's published and unpublished works and an impressive erudition in his command of pertinent scholarship, Buccola makes a balanced, judicious, innovative case for Douglass's enduring vitality, in particular as a guide for both liberals and communitarians in their ongoing debates about individual rights and civic obligations.”-Peter C. Myers,author ofFrederick Douglass: Race and the Rebirth of American Liberalism\"Buccola offers a nuanced portrait that illuminates both Douglass and his place in American intellectual history.\"-Damon W. Root,Reason Magazine\"Douglass seems to have been a much more thoughtful, nuanced political thinker and \"agitator,\" as he sometimes called himself, than we are used to today. He offered vibrant political and moral arguments, not sound bites.

Before pursuing his doctorate in English at the University of Delaware (English, 1980), he spent two years away from formal study to fish in the Brandywine River of southeastern Pennsylvania and to plunder the local public and university libraries for books on a wide variety of subjects. From 1980 until 2007, he taught English at Georgia College & State University. He is presently Dean of the School of Arts and Humanities at Reinhardt University.

Alison's wish comes true when she meets Mrs. Considine, a rich and sophisticated older woman who is eager to be her friend. Soon Alison is spending every weekend at Mrs. Considine's luxurious home. There Alison sails, rides and wears clothes that belonged to Mrs. Considine's dead daughter Camilla. Because she looks just like Camilla it is easy for Alison to imagine that she really is Mrs. Considine's daughter, a game that Mrs. Considine also plays. So enchanted is Alison with her new life that she is more than willing to allow Mrs. Considine to obliterate her old self and mold her into the \"real\" Camilla. At first, Alison and Mrs. Considine seem irritatingly one-dimensional; but as the story progresses, readers will realize that more fully fleshed-out characters would be out of place in this starkly surreal world. The strange story of Alison's transformation will linger long in the reader's mind.

It was a full moon that night as we sat outside, and my thoughts went naturally to wolves...but quickly, the story got to be too complicated for me to keep track of (I’m a writer, not a talker), and I had to write it down for her. I wrote each book except the last at the same age that she was when I wrote it (the last one I’m writing about six months late—the story doesn’t take a break, but I needed one).

He is married and the proud father of two children.By many world criteria, Serge had a very successful life. He had received a privileged education, worked for some of the world's most admired companies, and before the age of 37 had realized a life-long ambition: to become CEO of a publicly-quoted company. In this capacity, he had the opportunity to join the world elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in 2001. He was married to the woman of his dreams, and had two beautiful children. He had \"everything\" to be happy, right? However, this was not the case. In his heart, he didn't have peace since he always felt pressured to perform and to prove himself to the world; he was restless, unhappy and found no meaning in life.Until one day, and through one of life's surprises, Serge got to know the living God! Not the god he had heard from as a child: a god who wants people to be poor and suffering; a god who is defined by a bunch of rules, a list of dont'ts , a straight jacket for life. No. He got to know a God of love and a God of life; a God who wants us to live in complete freedom, to be full of expectancy, to pursue amazing dreams, and to enjoy so much abundance that it overflows!Following his encounter with Jesus, Serge spent seven years he what he calls \"God's detoxification clinic\" before starting with his family SRL Ministries (www.SRLministries.org), which aims to help both unbelievers and Christians open new taps of abundance in their lives in such key areas such as health, marriage, parenthood, financial matters, etc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The opening focus is on homeless and pregnant teenager Lucy Walton, who is picked up by the police and taken to St. Ursula's Women's Shelter. From there, Father Donnelly takes her to a clinic for wealthy expectant mothers, where she sullenly agrees to do light housework for room and board. Interspersed are chapters following the criminal antics of hooligans Darren and Skeeter as well as the ethnic unrest that leaves Morrissey's young son, Mike, seriously injured. Dogged police work on both the rape case and the murder of the young woman, as well as the suspicious death of Father Donnelly, leads Morrissey and his crew toward a solution but also endangers Lucy's life. Despite the engrossing finale, this is a disappointing tale, its parts never quite coalescing into a convincing whole.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00H0DBQQC"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Fr. Michael Engle, a pragmatic Catholic priest, and Jude, who has a considerably more uncertain relationship with God, are unlikely friends, but when a blood-covered Jude runs into Mike's church asking for help, Mike listens to him, believes him, and joins him on a quest to find the Holy Grail, which Jude hopes will help him destroy a legendary and dangerous family heirloom. Along the way they encounter Cain, the Norse gods (drinking and watching Bridge over the River Kwai), and a Valkyrie with the requisite 'chainmail-covered pillowy breasts.' When Mephistopheles shows up, Jude manages to label him an Arch-Fiend of Hell without irony and without irritating the reader. Stone's depiction of magic is realistic and intelligent and his treatment of Catholicism refreshingly informed and three-dimensional. Even the obligatory near-apocalyptic ending is coherent, surprising, and exciting.\"--Publishers Weekly\"A fast-paced book which does not lack for history or adventure. The inclusion of death and destruction are a given and it is good that there is a lot of humour instilled throughout. I would say that if you're a fan of Jim Butcher'sDresden Files, you will enjoy Mark Everett Stone's work. Recommended.\"--Michelle Herbert, Fantasy Book Review\"Evil does not die so easily.The Judas Lineis a novel following Jude Oliver and the long family line that lies behind him, specializing in assassination, using the artifact known as the silver. Jude Oliver must find the origins and stories of his family to be able to end the Silver's legacy for good, with only a single Catholic priest by his side. Blending paranormal and biblical ideas,The Judas Lineis a riveting thriller that should prove hard to put down.\"--Midwest Book Review\"I have come to expect a lot from this remarkably talented writer, but Mark manages to please yet again by bringing new elements to his latest work.The Judas Lineis, as anticipated, a lightning-paced thriller that is equal parts non-stop action and intelligent musing. This is, in fact, a surprisingly introspective book that delves into many interesting questions about the nature of good, evil, and faith. It's an enthralling read certain to delight and entertain, a well-crafted gem worthy of a place on any bookshelf.\"--Michelle Izmaylov, author ofThe Galacteran Legacy: Galaxy Watch(5 Stars) \"I found myself chuckling at some of the insane twists and turns of the plot and other times I was worried by the sudden turn of events .... A fast-paced read, with nail-biting moments and some humor thrown in. The characters were compelling, I often find myself picturing them in my head .... I can't recommend this book enough.\"--Lisa McCourt Hollar, Jezri's Nightmares\"Once in a great while, a book comes along that challenges you to think outside the box.The Judas Lineis one of those books. I was absolutely amazed at the way Mark Everett Stone has taken religious stories and beliefs and intertwined his own tale of power, evil, friendship, sacrifice and redemption. The action is nonstop and the characters will stay with you long after you finish the last page.\"--M.E. Franco, authorWhere Will You Run?\"The pacing is flawless in every respect .... Never before have I found a work of fiction to be so captivating. It picks you up, sits you down, and it does not let you even think about getting back up. A word of warning: Hide your pocketbooks, because once you read this, you will spend your next paycheck on every Mark Everett Stone book available. And clear your schedule once you start, because, all of a sudden, that doctor's appointment doesn't seem so important.\"--Grace Knight, author ofSun And Moon(2013)\"InThe Judas Line, Mark Everett Stone takes the classic good versus evil plot line and puts his own unique spin on it. He effortlessly merges bible canon with the world and people he's created, adding off-the-wall humor to help break the tension. This book makes you laugh while making you think about the nature of evil and the power of faith.\"--Jamie White, Author ofThe Life and Times of No One in Particular", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.0, "rating_total": 20.0}

These two saddle bums wander into the town of Atascocita where they immediately get into trouble with local gunsels over a poker game. Saved from tar and feathers by the sheriff and an old couple who run a wagon freight outfit, Josh and Tiny find themselves in the middle of a range war with murderous tycoon Cullen Leach. On a freight hauling job, Josh and Tiny befriend a pretty young woman, Marylee Gaston, heir to a large ranch and guardian of two younger brothers after her older brothers are murdered by Leach's men. Rumors of hidden gold on the Gaston Ranch has every owlhoot in the territory sniffing around, willing to kill for it. As Josh and Tiny try to protect the old couple and the Gaston Ranch, ambushes and gun battles whittle down both sides, with well-ventilated corpses sprawled all over the prairie. When the last fusillade of bullets finally slams home only one cowboy is left standing (barely) with the girl and the gold. This is a smart, meaty story with likeable characters, funny gags and some nifty surprises.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At thirty now, a prolific reader and a freelance writer, she's since then expanded her preferences from just romance to romance with a dash of now trending sub-genres--paranormal , fantasy, sci-fi even, and erotica. She loves challenging herself and would write on a dare. On a normal day, she would be found in her herb garden collecting spices for her kitchen or ingredients for her potions; in her huge eclectic Provencal kitchen with the big modern oven cooking pots and pans of food for her family of one husband and three kids (an ardent daughter and two boisterous sons) that'll probably last for weeks; in her library with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and an e-reader in her hands as she reads the latest short story erotic hit; or scribbling pages upon pages of different erotic lifestyles, searching for the one that feels like it was inspired by just the right mix of passion, storyline, and sex. She loves going crazy on weekend nights with the hubby.

In 1764, nine-year-old Kaya lives in the traditional homeland of the Nez Perce tribe (present-day Idaho, Washington, and Oregon) with her parents, siblings, and Speaking Rain, a blind girl. InMeet Kaya, she neglects her duties and, when the other children find out, she wonders if she will ever live it down. InKaya's Escape, Kaya and Speaking Rain are captured and taken to an enemy's camp. Determined to escape, Kaya struggles to make it home through the bitter winter weather without supplies. Nez Perce words are used throughout both stories, and a glossary is appended. A closing section in both titles provides cultural and historical information as well as pictures of the Nimiipuu, known today as the Nez Perce. The editorial staff of Pleasant Company worked with the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Council to create an advisory board that supervised all aspects of the project, including the decision to set the story before contact with white explorers and settlers. Both historically accurate and culturally sensitive, Kaya's stories are welcome additions to this publisher's output and a noteworthy result of a unique collaboration.Karen HuttCopyright © American Library Association.

She earned her BA in education from East Texas Baptist College and her MEd in language arts from the University of Alaska Anchorage. Her teaching specialties are English, history, and music. She has taught on public and private elementary, secondary, and university campuses in Texas, Alaska, Colorado, and Arkansas. She has also earned two diplomas from the Institute of Children’s Literature in Connecticut. After more than 25 years as a writing teacher, she published her first novel in 2007. She writes specifically for middle reader boys and girls (ages 8-12) who are considered reluctant readers. Having been a reluctant reader herself, she has a passion for helping them build their reading skills to enjoy the written word. Her unique storytelling has successfully reached those in her target audience as well as avid young readers and adults alike. Her fans span a wide range of ages from all around the world.Brenda’s Arkansas Oil Days Collection is a series of stand-alone novels loosely based on her family’s history with the oil boom in South Arkansas during the 1920s. The backdrop for the setting is the Smackover oil fields and the communities in the surrounding areas. As she initially develops her plots, she starts with a story her grandmother told her when she was growing up. Then she creates an exciting tale of mystery and suspense with unpredictable twists and turns. Her novels are preserving a history few know about, a sense of community that has all but disappeared from our culture, and a family dynamic that is sorely lacking in our present-day society. Her fans enjoy being able to put themselves into her stories as if they were in the middle of the action and part of the family of characters.", "related": [], "rank": 3842322, "title": "Kidnapped Justice", "author": "Brenda Hutcheson Fickey", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Since that time he has dedicated himself to writing full time. He currently has two film projects in development.

In the past 8 years I have also been umpiring fast-pitch softball at local schools and recreational sports centers (a true test of my patience and management skills!). I was born and raised in Savannah, Georgia, and graduated from Windsor Forest High School, class of ’83, where I played noseguard and defensive tackle on the football team. I am a husky, graduate of University of Connecticut, located in Storrs CT. I joined the Navy in January 1984 and retired in January 2004. While on active duty, I was stationed in Japan and in various U.S. states, including Washington, Connecticut, Florida, South Carolina and Virginia. I visited more than 20 countries on naval vessels as a Chief Quartermaster / Navigation Electronic Technician. Now back in civilian life, I’m employed in a related field as an Instructional Systems Specialist in the Northern Virginia area, developing training material.

Logic applies to everything I write. I hate logic breaks, don’t you? As an example, people sailing in a spaceship does not easily lend itself well to the next paragraph having them riding a camel. There must be a way to lead you to it. So, I got something out of engineering, even if my personality was alien to it.      I was eleven years a California Highway Patrol Officer, learning about cops and courtrooms, cars and car chases, how to shoot straight, and how to be a cop. And yes, work with many of the good and honest cops from detectives to leaders, traffic to crime scene investigators. That, too, could not hold my interest. Once mastered, it had no challenge. I was more interested in the human mind, how it worked, and how to help people understand one another.      During and after the pursuit of my masters in psychology, and, yes, a serious logic break from electrical engineering, I was three years a motivational speaker and seminar leader for Positive Living Seminars. This was Zig Ziglar and Norman Vincent Peale’s organization. There, I learn how people think, and how to help them think better of themselves. But that was still not the use I had in mind for the masters.      The next twenty five years I provided management consulting services focused in the hiring, training and management of people to small and large companies alike. I focused on training and development, company growth and interpersonal communications.         I’ve written nonfiction magazine articles for hiring and development since the 1980s. During all my consulting years and my seminar work, I have been called a Storyteller, and I began trying that out on the fiction in 1995. At the time, I was traveling eighty to ninety percent, alone in airports, airplanes, and hotels far too many hours. Lots of time to get in trouble… or to write. Luckily, I love to write. Now, semi retired, I live in the Tampa Bay area, in western Florida. More time to follow my passion, writing fun, sometimes scary, but always entertaining novels.      Please, enjoy the books as they are intended, a storyteller’s attempt to give you, for a short while, an escape to another realm.", "related": ["B00AJVN9B2"], "rank": 4002167, "title": "Alfuego", "author": "G.

This outstanding volume corrects that omission and provides us with an accurate and exhaustively researched narrative of how one of the most amazing musical prodigies became one of the greatest violinists in history.\" —Gramophone\"As a young student of the violin, my hero was Jascha Heifetz. His tone quality, virtuosity, technical perfection, and his unmatched energy were enormously inspiring. I own numerous books, biographies, and articles on the life and times of Jascha Heifetz, but none focus in depth on his fascinating early years in Russia to the extent that this book does.

This experience opened their eyes to the world of Medicare and the problems that seniors face. He opened the first of two insurance agencies in 2000, and concentrated on two things: the best products, coupled with first class service to all his clients. Though he had been dealing with Medicare issues with his own parents for over 25 years, upon reaching 65 himself, he got a first-hand look at the mounds of paperwork that seniors receive as they reach Medicare age. He saw how the untrained person might throw up their hands in frustration. After coming to him for assistance, his senior clients said that they now understood the process, because he was able to simplify it into understandable terms and steps. Based on this combination of experiences, Dave decided to write this book with the desire to simplify seniors’ lives as they address the issue of Medicare.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And I'm pleased that several of them took me completely by surprise.  Spunky heroine and reluctantly tenderhearted hero thrown together in a fake marriage, both with plenty of past pain and secrets of their own and both seeking revenge against the same man (without the other knowing). How could you start a story better than that?! And it only gets better from there. Also appreciated that it was clean romance.ReadyReader, Amazon ReviewerOne might be reading a Zane Grey novel, or perhaps one of Louis L'Amour's works. That's how pleasant it is to read this Tammie Clarke Gibbs' novel.\"Carl Wilson, FloridaPraise For Island of Secrets:Island of Secrets is a hard book to categorize. Yes - it's about time travel, yes - it's a mystery, yes - it's a romance, but amongst all this there are dark and strange happenings mingled in with breathtakingly beautiful moments. You are pulled into the story, and are able to see and feel all the beauty of the old south in the 1700's, and then back you come to present.Penelope Adams -Paranormal Romance Guild Team MemberDon't always read time travel books but this one I couldn't put down, hope I can find another one as good.Pauline Roach, Amazon ReviewerThe characterizations are strong, the romance is intriguing, and the story stuck in my head after I finished the book.

Aristotle \"Soc\" Socarides, a commercial fisherman and PI, helps pull the victim from the water and is baffled by the wounds that look only somewhat like shark bites. The town selectmen nervously vote to keep the beach open--until bloated corpses start washing up on shore. While Soc speculates on this sudden rise in the death rate, Tillie Talbot asks him to find out whether the official scrutiny her summer camp has recently come under--from locals checking for sanitary code infractions to feds hunting illegal aliens--is linked to a real estate agent's interest in the valuable beachfront property. Next, John Flagg, an old friend and \"spook\" at an obscure government agency, hires Soc to do a bit of diving on the quiet. Likable Soc even finds time to help straighten out his young cousin Alex, who has fallen in with a bad crowd. Leaping nimbly from mystery to mystery, the overachieving Soc may strain credibility (anyone as clever as he is should take a day off from fishing and sort out the national debt), but his good nature makes him pleasant company nevertheless.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": ["B00731Z3ME"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She'd never been popular before but quickly found herself being asked out on dates, and by handsome guys at that.  It was a new world and in her senior year, she fell in love with a young scientist who was working as a teaching assistant in one of her classes. They got married when she graduated and life was happy and complete. In her early thirties, she got pregnant for the first time. She and her husband were delighted but then a second baby came along a year later, a little faster than they had expected. Emma was taking care of two toddlers and she couldn't get rid of the extra weight she'd gained while she was pregnant. For a few years, she tried all the different diets on the market. She tried the grapefruit diet, the South Beach diet, the Atkins diet. She'd lose the weight for a while and then within a year it was back again. Her husband didn't seem to care but she didn't feel good in her clothes. He was teaching at the local university and one day she came to get him for lunch unexpectedly. A young graduate student was leaning over him in his office, chatting away and twirling her hair. She trusted her husband but watching this little scene from a distance got her motivated. She started to research diets and lifestyle changes on the internet.  She thought clean eating would be worth a try so she started to do research online to find out more about it. She collected all the information she found and organized it in a three-ring binder. Then she put it into practice with a firm commitment. Within five months, she'd lost 35 pounds and felt better than she ever had in her life. She became an evangelist for the clean eating lifestyle. She organized all her research into a beginner's primer on clean eating and published it. Today Emma helps others lose weight and feel great with her books and lifestyle-changing products. She and her husband have been happily married for 12 years.", "related": ["B00BB2RMGQ"], "rank": 1649620, "title": "Eating Clean to Stay Young: Low Fat Plan for Better Diet, Nutrition and Weight-loss (Clean Eating)", "author": "Emma Madison", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

As a reaction to these developments, several regulations have been issued: Corporate Governance, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, IFRS, Basel II and III, Solvency II and BilMoG, to name just a few. In this book, compliance is understood as the process, mapped not only in an internal control system, that is intended to guarantee conformity with legal requirements but also with internal policies and enterprise objectives (in particular, efficiency and profitability).The current literature primarily confines itself to mapping controls in SAP ERP and auditing SAP systems. Maxim Chuprunov not only addresses this subject but extends the aim of internal controls from legal compliance to include efficiency and profitability and then well beyond, because a basic understanding of the processes involved in IT-supported compliance management processes are not delivered along with the software. Starting with the requirements for compliance (Part I), he not only answers compliance-relevant questions in the form of an audit guide for an SAP ERP system and in the form of risks and control descriptions (Part II), but also shows how to automate the compliance management process based on SAP GRC (Part III). He thus addresses the current need for solutions for implementing an integrated GRC system in an organization, especially focusing on the continuous control monitoring topics.Maxim Chuprunov mainly targets compliance experts, auditors, SAP project managers and consultants responsible for GRC products as readers for his book. They will find indispensable information for their daily work from the first to the last page. In addition, MBA, management information system students as well as senior managers like CIOs and CFOs will find a wealth of valuable information on compliance in the SAP ERP environment, on GRC in general and its implementation in particular.", "related": ["B00G7W5XZM"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Readers are treated as friends, invited into the author’s decluttered world of Sweet Simplicity. Diana Beresford-Kroeger convincingly interweaves her scientific expertise and her extensive knowledge of ancient aboriginal wisdom and practices, and a path into a saner and safer world seems to emerge, a path that is open to all. Part of the magic of the book is its practical accessibility. Within the clarity of the author’s big picture of an earth in peril, there are ways forward. Small, individual decisions become opportunities to contribute to collective betterment. There is no ‘them’ and ‘us’ in the author’s approach, in spite of her sense of passionate urgency.”—Ursula Franklin, University Professor Emerita, former member of the Science Council of Canada, and author ofThe Real World of Technology “Diana Beresford-Kroeger weaves together her wealth of scientific and traditional knowledge about the natural world with deep spirituality—and courageously communicates the latter. From this infrequently encountered but insight-generating combination, she distills practical advice for everyday living that will help us to keep healthy in body, mind and spirit. Her most powerful message is that we need to have a deep love for Nature and respect for the natural, to realize how much we will lose if we do not, and that we have obligations to future generations to hold Nature and the natural on trust for them. I loved this book.”—Margaret Somerville, Samuel Gale Professor of Law, Professor Faculty of Medicine, McGill University “The very existence of this book—with its down-to-earth appeal to drink wine, eat seaweed, sleep more, enjoy yourself, eschew industrial food—is testament to the chaos and hostility of modern life. But Beresford-Kroeger is a firm and gentle guide back to kindness, back to connection, back to simplicity.”—Nick Saul & Andrea Curtis, co-authors ofThe Stop: How the Fight for Good Food Transformed a Community and Inspired a Movement “The Sweetness of a Simple Lifeis a thoughtful book with much insight into the fundamental relationship between simplicity, food and biochemistry. It’s a perfect read after a long day in the fields.”—Daniel Brisebois, vegetable and seed grower, and past-president of Canadian Organic Growers “In this book that reads like a friendly conversation over a cup of tea, Diana Beresford-Kroeger tells stories about her life, plants she has known, and how these plants may benefit humans. Her stories integrate knowledge from biochemistry, traditional medicine, herbalism, modern medicine, cutting-edge science, and global cultural practices. Though the focus is on people, this book is a gentle, humorous and fascinating window on the diversity of plants, their ecology, and especially their chemical biology.”—Susan Dudley, Associate Professor of Biology, McMaster University", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He was forced to undertake control of his adopted father's oil business, a company that allowed him to travel the globe and explore the far reaches of civilization.  As he studied the ancient carvings of the Mesopotamians, he realized just how much of our history has been covered up by powerful people.  These findings have been collected into his new novel The Relics. Or maybe this isn't true.  Maybe this is true: John Dawson Jackson is an independent author based out of the Knoxville, TN area who has a broad spectrum of interests. Predominantly, his novels integrate the genres of fantasy, history, and horror with intriguing mind bending qualities. Most of his works are based in the supernatural and exist within the same universe--a sometimes frightening, but always exhilarating place where Jackson enjoys playing with the interconnectivity of what is real, myth, and rumor.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Catherine is passionate about creating awareness for children born with talipes (club feet). Her son Alex was born in 2012 with bilateral talipes and is currently undergoing treatment at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne. Her work was initially written and illustrated as a gift for her son's first birthday; however at the request of other parents of children born with club feet she looked to get the book published. Catherine works as a full time Training and Development Officer but writes and paints in her spare time. Welcome to Dreamland is the first in a series of books, each visiting a new 'world' and making new friends. Follow Alex on his journey through treatment until the day that he no longer has to wear his boots and bar to bed. \"My son Alex was born in April 2012 with bilateral talipes. Or club feet to most people. It came as a shock as nothing was picked up on any of our scans. My world came crashing around me as I researched the treatment my tiny baby was soon to start. It has been a rough ride and a year into treatment we still have tough times, tears and tantrums.  I decided to write a book about Alex's boots and bars in an attempt to make them appear more magical and less medical. The book started off as a project during the endless sleepless nights. I found myself day dreaming of ways to help my little boy to sleep during the night.  With one eye open and a pen in my hand I wrote a few verses and found it quite therapeutic. Not only was I writing about my son being whisked away to a land of endless possibility and adventure it also became a release for me. Parents of 'clubbie' babies often paint on a smile and say everything is fine. But don't be fooled...some days are rough! You want to throw the boots out of the window never to be seen again...but we know better. We know in the long term despite all of the tears (from both child and Mummy) it will be worth it. I started dreaming about all of the things Alex will be able to do in the future because we persevered with the treatment. And so 'Welcome to Dreamland' was born....\"", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Just because I think you are a total douche bag for not liking me is ok too. I would suggest you read \"The Muppets- Learning to Get Along\". Ok I made that up and I did not really mean to call you that foul name. It is ok for anyone to dislike whomever they chose for their own reasons. It is difficult to conform to a perceived way of life when one is telling their personal story. Things are what they are and other than lying , I can't change what happened. I can say I have learned a little and do try to live life by following a higher standard of being and by treating , thinking and interacting with others in a way that is far more conducive to a social society than I ever tried to do when I was much younger.

Prior to getting published, I had dabbled with writing short stories for years, took a course on short story writing and wrote articles for a local magazine. I ve been reading erotic romances for years, but having grown frustrated with trying to find one that depicted spanking as erotic foreplay instead of a consequence of a woman s bratty behavior, I decided to write my own. I never imagined it would be published or that my first reader compliment was that Susie s Awakening was the best spanking story they had ever read! I ll always be grateful to Lizbeth at Pink Flamingo for taking a chance on me and giving me the opportunity to show my work. While the main plot of all my titles revolves around sex and all my books include a lot of erotic spanking, I started adding a touch of suspense in a few and more romance in the last couple. In Amy s Redemption, I injected a little humor, which was a lot of fun. I am currently working on a book about one of the secondary characters in Freeing Kira. My personal favorites of my titles are Amy s Redemption, Freeing Kira and My Pet in that order. I live in the Midwest with my husband and two dogs and spend my spare time with my daughter and dog sitting my granddogs . When I m not writing, I m reading or working puzzles, either crosswords or jigsaws. Some of my favorite authors are Linda Howard, Tara Janzen, Cindy Gerard, Christine Feehan, Sarah McCarty and Nina Bangs. While we haven t traveled a lot in the past few years, we have in the past and I have drawn on those experiences when writing. I admit to being completely computer illiterate and was very proud of myself when I mastered email. Thankfully, my husband is a computer whiz and is always happy to fix my blunders. He has always been very supportive of my endeavors and my sounding board for ideas. Since he s the computer expert, I call on him to do some of my research. BJ Wane is an alias as I value my privacy. Because I write only when the mood strikes me and often go months without even thinking about plotting another book, I don t keep a website.

The book has been dedicated to the four legged family members in appreciation of their (relatively) good behaviour while she was writing the book. Her three daughters have now left home.  She was born in Stratford, now the home of the Olympic Stadium, and part of the London Borough of Newham. On Saturdays if the wind was in the right direction she knew when her local football team West Ham United had scored! She continues to support them at the risk of divorce as her husband Tom is a Manchester United devotee.  She has a degree in History and Politics from Liverpool University, and after graduating she trained as a chartered accountant. After qualifying, she worked for a while in Australia, New Zealand and the Middle East.  In 1975, while working for the International Planned Parenthood Federation in Beirut, Enid was blown up in an isolated incident before the war proper commenced, escaping with relatively minor injuries.  She moved to Ireland in 1977, worked in finance for a while before setting up her own accountancy practice.  She joined the Green Party and stood as a candidate in the Dublin City Council elections in 1985 coming came close to being elected. She became disillusioned and left the party some years before it became the junior coalition partner in the Irish Government of 2007-2011.  In 2006 she went back to college, studying at Griffith College Dublin for a Higher Diploma in journalism.  She published her first book Cancer in a Cold Climate: the Shafting of St Luke's Hospital in 2010. This explored the political machinations behind the decision to phase out and ultimately close the well-known cancer hospital.  She was almost arrested in the Dail (Irish Parliament) when she shouted 'Shame' at the six Green TDs (MPs) as they came into the lobby after voting for the Bill to close the hospital.  She has also written about the outrageous expenses paid to Irish politicians. One article in the Irish Times ruffled many feathers and led to a debate with the Head of Communications at the Dail on Liveline, the main Irish phone-in radio show.  Fateful Decisions is her first fiction book.  Enid now combines writing with lobbying for causes close to her heart like improved health services and integrity in politics. She also runs a financial clinic on a voluntary basis in her local Citizens Information Centre for those who cannot afford the professional services of accountants. This service known as CAVA is run under the auspices of Chartered Accountants Ireland.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He is currently living in Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) where he combines lecturing at several International Universities, with writing for several of the main publications in Vietnam, including The Guide (largest lifestyle magazine in Vietnam) and Vietnam Economic Times (covering hospitality, culture, business and economics), as well as Saigoneer (where he is the Food & Beverage editor). He is also an active wine writer, and has created the first wine blog in Vietnam (http://wineinvietnam.blogspot.com/ ). He also worked sourcing top quality wines (at low prices) for wine importers and launched his consultancy helping start ups as well as established hospitality businesses to make money. During his time in England and Spain he organised and run wine tasting on a regular basis. His true passion for food and wine, as well as a lot of pushing from his friends led him to write his first book “ D.O./D.O.C. wine producing areas in Spain” in 2009, covering the different wine producing areas in Spain, regions, main grapes and vintages. The book was republished in 2012 as “ Wines from Spain: D.O./D.O.C. wine producing areas in Spain”. His second book, “ Restaurants: how to eat well in London at low prices” published in 2010, and compiling information and reviews for 100 restaurants in London offering great food at low prices, proved a real tool for those looking for great meals at low prices. “ Introduction to wine and wine tasting” covers the basics of wine and wine tasting aiming to pass knowledge in plain English to those who want to learn more about wine and about enjoying wine. Alfredo is currently working on his next books which will be wine related, research includes a trip to Europe to visit several of the top wineries to complement his writing.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has also won international awards for her early childhood teaching and continues to find new and innovative ways to assist children in their education. Diana has taught children with special needs since 1983.  She has a special needs sister herself and believes that music, the brain and language are intricately connected.  Using music unlocks many areas in the brain.  Thus, many of her books are rhyming books to make the most of rhythmical language. She has multiple tertiary qualifications in the early childhood arena and has been a national speaker, teaching parents and early childhood professionals since 1993. Diana teaches about early childhood development, brain development and the importance of music,  literature and language in a world that is so digital. “While digital devices have meant more things are available to our children,” she says, “nothing can replace parents reading to children and the handling of physical books.  Stories, language play, rhyming words, silly words, imagination and creativity are being stifled by video games and electronics. Developing language is so important and now with more video and TV time and less reading together time, the art of language is changing.

J. Irwin as I was called in my early years, was born during the depression in a log cabin in Ohio, the youngest of nine children. As a young girl I was told to get my head out of the clouds. I had a very active imagination and in high school, I was encouraged to write short stories. However reality ensued, I married and was blessed with four sons, who kept me quite busy. My young husbands health became an issue and when our sons were all in school, I began a retailing career, which I retired from after moving to Arizona forty years earlier and have enjoyed this part of the country very much. After losing my first husband and two sons, I married a retired military man and helped him with his antique business. A few years ago, my husband took a writing class at a retirement community in northern Arizona, where we spend our summers. He started writing his memoirs and I remembered taking a writing class many years earlier. I kept having a recurring dream and started writing my first novel Just A Little Miracle. I'm hoping my first book will be enjoyed by many and I am presently working on my second novel, (You Needed Me) I plan to follow my dream and continue writing as long as my vivid imagination keeps sending me stories.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Campbell, classical theatre director and author, married Laura Lynn (Williams) his college sweetheart in 1965. He has visited 56 different countries consulting, teaching, directing and performing. He conceived and directed the First International Mime Institute & Festival in 1974. He has consulted globally on well over a hundred theaters and convention centers. Protege of Tyrone Guthrie, Etienne Decroux and Jean-Louis Barrault, \"Dr Lou\" focuses his theatre training philosophy on a thorough and organic approach to knowledge of the body as an instrument of expression. Regarding on literacy, his publications are a diverse collection of training materials and creative fiction. His initial novel, Wind of Destiny sold out quickly and is in its second printing.  The sequel called Aunt Ida's Niece wraps the story line into a complete experience covering many places in the world in the process. A wonderful historical tale set in New England in 1898 unfolds a trilogy of work emulating Victorian letter writing.  The Echo of Silence is the first, followed by The Symphony of Silence and completed by the soon to be released A Doxology to Life.   The release of the allegory Peregrina and her Beloved, along with Ransom's Fire, a touching story set in the Philippines, and a contemporary Incident Without Honor is complemented by a collection of Short Stories about North Texas called the Trinity River Watershed, a recently released serialized book called Red Suspenders, and the latest release of a pulp romance called Someplace Close to Paradise provides a variety of genres and types of reading. Additional titles are forthcoming in the coming months. As artistic director of the Enclave Conservatory, the organization is initiating work in Southlake, Texas with many opportunities and possibilities there.", "related": [], "rank": 4010819, "title": "Paradise Discovered", "author": "Louis H.

A few years earlier in Florida, I was sitting by the pool when a woman threw herself from her balcony. She lived in the same building as me, just one floor up. She lived alone. It was Christmas day. During the weeks that followed, I couldn't get that scene out of my head. It took over my thoughts, but I eventually forgot about it. Later on, I woke up in the middle of the night at 3am. I'd had a strange dream. In the dream, I relived that awful scene, except I was looking at the woman jump but through a young boy's eyes. I had the same dream several times afterwards. The dream haunted me like a ghost. I became obsessedbythis story.

Sylvia has been writing since her early teens and her work consists of novels and screenplays.  As with most authors, Sylvia draws on her varied experience in the sometimes-puzzling tapestry of life. These days, however, Sylvia has resigned from the human race, and she lives both in the animal kingdom, with her kitty cat, Mia, (a much better place to be), and vicariously, through the many characters in her head. Sylvia has a soft spot for older female protagonists with an attitude who are on the cusp of 40 years and beyond. This is seen in her wacky, romantic comedies, and most recently, in her mystery novels. An avid fan of classic black and white Hollywood movies of the 40s including film noir, Sylvia has placed her protagonist, Mia Ferrari, in a contemporary mystery series with a bit of a “film noir” flavour. Mia Ferrari is an older, spunky, smartarse female who works in the international world of hotels. The theme is comedic, sexy, and peppered with that film-noir-hero type of attitude. The stories are fast-paced and set in the modern day world. On a more serious note, Sylvia’s work in literary fiction brings forth The Soul Bearers, an inspirational story filled with hope, overcoming fear, loss, betrayal, and discovering the healing power of unconditional love. At present, the novel is under consideration for adaptation into a feature film.

It was originally about John and his team fighting the drug gang and was named the \"Trip\". After seeing what our leaders are capable of doing to undermine our constitutional rights, it was only a short leap of faith to add a president who is a traitor to his country. When I finished the first book, several friends said that it was pretty good and helped me with some editing. I secretly hoped it would sell a few books, but never thought I'd see the success that the books have achieved. I published Hell in the Homeland on March 2014 and should have Tyranny in the Homeland published by mid summer 2014. I will keep writing The Adventures of John Harris as long as it is fun for me. I really get involved in the story and wonder what John does next.       I am also writing Grumpy, Sam and Sammy. This is a story about a couple who have had several tragedies in their lives and get a second chance by helping a wayward young girl and her dog. This is more of a religious awakening and heart warming kind of book, Not the book for the post-apocalyptic crowd, but never fear I am also outlining a series of books about our upcoming 2nd civil war. The series is named Civil War II. The first book is Executive orders. It has the scenario of a misguided president who begins to rule by decree and alienates the silent majority so much they revolt. I wonder if any other writer is writing four books at the same time. Oops I failed to mention another \"Self Help\" book that is a tongue in cheek manual for surviving the hoards of hungry city people who leave the big cities just to eat your food, molest your wife and kill you.Writing is my hobby and unfortunately I have to keep my day job for a while.Thanks to my fans for the support and great sales.Have a great day.", "related": [], "rank": 101003, "title": "Hell in the Homeland", "author": "AJ Newman", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.5455, "rating_total": 50.0}

Leguin, Kyra Halland has always loved fantasy. She has also always loved a good love story. In 1990, as a new stay-at-home mom with a young baby, she finally decided to combine those two loves - like chocolate and peanut butter! - by writing the kinds of romantic fantasy novels she wanted to read. Complicated, honorable heroes; heroines who are strong, smart, and all woman; magic, romance, and adventure; and excursions into the dark corners of life and human nature mixed with a dash of offbeat humor - all of these make up Kyra Halland's worlds. She is excited to share those worlds with readers, who she hopes will enjoy her stories and characters as much as she does. Kyra Halland lives in southern Arizona. She has a very patient husband, two less-patient cats, and two young adult sons. Besides writing, she enjoys scrapbooking and anime, and she wants to be a crazy cat lady when she grows up.", "related": [], "rank": 1305142, "title": "Sarya's Song eBook", "author": "Kyra Halland", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}
