Colette Dowling confronts the myths of female frailty, and wrestles them to the ground in a passionate meditation that is clean and true.\"--Susan Brownmiller, author ofAgainst Our WillandIn Our Time\"The myth of female anatomical and physiological inferiority has kept too many women from realizing the joys of sport, fitness, and physical activity, and developing the good health, strength, confidence, and self-esteem that has benefited their male counterparts.The Frailty Mythshatters these misconceptions and instills in all women the importance of experiencing their bodies. Five stars--a must-read.\"--Donna Lopiano, Ph.D., executive director, Women's Sports Foundation\"        In the twenty-first century, Americans are going to have to rethink the idea of the physical inferiority of women because of books likeThe Frailty Myth. Dowling overturns the old Victorian idea that women are the weaker sex by providing important evidence of women's strength drawn from studies in sports physiology and the   record book of female physical achievement. This is a call to arms for female athleticism among girls and women of all ages.\"--Joan Jacobs Brumberg, Department of Human Development, Cornell University, author ofThe Body Project: An Intimate History of American GirlsandFasting Girls: The History of Anorexia Nervosa\"        Dowling's book is an excellent resource for scholars interested in women's sport and physical activity; you will find the book in my room.

[this book] makes its own unique contribution by exploring diverse issues related to the social capital idea.\"   International Journal of Social Welfare\"Social Capital is a magisterial analysis of how social networks are a key to individual achievement and social inclusion. Nan Lin shows that those who depend only on market transactions ignore at their peril the social relationships that underlie and shape deals. Those who read this book will increase their human capital by learning how to increase their social capital.\"    Barry Wellman, University of Toronto\"This long-needed and richly detailed volume, by one of the original theorists of social capital, organizes and advances on the key intellectual challenges and accomplishments of the field of structural sociology. Immensely readable and relevant to today's most interesting sociological questions regarding economic life, Lin's book succeeds in bursting open new doors to the theoretically and substantively important consequences of social capital.\"    Brian Uzzi, Northwestern University\"In Social Capital Nan Lin takes on the long overdue task of meshing incoming network theory with social stratification and mobility theory - in both cases with guidance from empirical research. Aptly, Lin demonstrates the 'strength of weak models': by avoiding technical specifications he not only makes the book accessible to the non-numerate but also suggests how his themes can bear on different disciplinary interests and venues.\"    Harrison White, Columbia University\"Social Capital integrates Nan Lin's two decades of work on social resources and instrumental action. It carefully distinguishes the capital residing in social networks from economic, human, and cultural capital. Drawing on his original research in both the United States and East Asia, Lin presents compelling empirical evidence showing provocative theoretical extensions about the role of social capital in the formation of both networks and reputations, and argues that developments in information techmology have led to a dramatic rise in the formation of social capital.\"    Peter V.

She stared in disbelief at the owner, Denise Watson, who'd been filling her in on the details of a job opening.\"Hold on a second,\" Tricia said. \"Let me get this straight. I'm not being interviewed by the person I would be working for, this Noah Falcon? I would be taking the job, boss unseen?\"\"That sums it up,\" Denise replied. \"It happens all the time, Tricia.\"\"It does?\"\"Remember, I screen all my potential employers, just as I do my employees. If you find yourself in an impossible situation, you'll leave, but I don't think that'll be the case. Noah's a successful business owner, a widower with four children. Pillar of the community.\"\"Yet he's not doing the interviewing.\" Tricia didn't like how two and two were adding up. \"There's something you're not telling me.\"Denise hesitated. \"Well, to be honest, he doesn't know his current employee is quitting. She told Noah's brother in confidence, and he decided to take matters into his own hands and do the hiring himself.\"\"Why's that?\"\"You can ask him yourself.\" Denise opened the door, leaving Tricia no choice but to follow her inside.An attractive man about her own age stood. Denise made the introductions. \"Tricia McBride, this is David Falcon.\"Greetings were exchanged, then Denise left them alone.\"Your résumé is impressive,\" David said, taking his seat at the conference table again.It is? Tricia thought, but she said thank you then sat. \"Why me, Mr. Falcon?\"He raised his brows at her directness. \"Why not you, Ms. McBride?\"\"I'm sure Denise told you I'll be leaving Sacramento in January to move to San Diego to start a new job. I would be in your brother's employ less than three months. That seems unfair to the family.\"\"And you're absolutely committed to this other job?\"\"Yes, absolutely, unequivocally. I've given my word.\"\"Just checking,\" he said with a smile. \"You know, it's obviously not the ideal situation for us. But the important thing is that we'll have that three-month cushion to find someone perfect, someone whowillstay. Who knows, it could happen next week, and you'd be on your way. We're not guaranteeing the job for the whole three months, either. But in the past Noah has been forced into making expedient choices. You'll be giving him the luxury of time to find just the right person.\"\"By that you mean he loses employees frequently?\"David hesitated. \"My brother tends to hire people fresh out of college who don't have a clue about life yet, not to mention how to handle four children. You were a kindergarten teacher, which leads me to believe that you like children, certainly a necessity for the job, plus you have actual experience working with them. You're thirty-four, so you have life skills, as well. Denise has done a thorough background check on you, and I feel comfortable that you'll be an asset.\"She eyed him directly, not easily fooled. \"And what's the real reason you're doing this behind his back?\"He half smiled. \"Truth? Noah's children are in need of a woman like you, even if it's only for a few months. Their mother died three years ago. The house is…quiet. They need laughter. And someone who will stand toe-to-toe with Noah.\"\"Why?\"\"He needs help, but he usually resists suggestions. Noah is still grieving. He doesn't know how to deal with his children.\"\"Dealwith them?\"\"Wrong word, I guess. He loves them. He just doesn't know how to show it.\"He sounded to Tricia like a man out of his element and on the edge. \"When Denise called me yesterday to talk about the job she made it seem like a nanny position, but after the details she gave me today, I'd say it's beyond that.\"\"It's more teacher than nanny. The kids are homeschooled, so your teaching background is important.\"\"Homeschooling four children is a far cry from being a nanny.\"\"Which is why the salary is so high. But the kids are bright and eager to learn.\"\"How old are they?\"\"The boys are nine and the girls are twelve.\"\"Twins? As in two sets?\"He gave her a dry, apologetic smile. \"Which is the other reason the salary is high. Yes, two sets of twins, who aren't nearly as intimidating as you might imagine. Just the idea of them tends to scare off the prospective help, which is why I asked Denise not to mention it.\"\"I'm really not sure about this….\"\"I understand your reservations, but if you'll just give it a chance…\" He leaned forward. \"Denise is good at what she does, finding the right person for the job. In fact, she's downright uncanny at it. Why don't I just take you to Noah's house now, while he's at the office? You can meet the children and see the environment.\"The children. Tricia pictured them, sad, and lonely for a father who didn't know how to show he loved them. She blew out a breath, trying to dispatch the heart-tugging image. \"Where does he live?\"\"About an hour's drive north of Sacramento, a little town called Chance City, although not within the town itself.\"\"You mean it's in thecountry?\" Tricia couldn't contain her horror at the idea. She'd spent her entire life in the city. She liked concrete and grocery stores and fast-food restaurants.\"Depends on what you mean by country. It's in the Sierra foothills,\" David said. \"His home is large and comfortable, on ten acres of property.\"\"As in no neighbors for ten acres?\" This was getting worse and worse.\"Or thereabouts.\"\"So, I'd have to live in? What about my house? I'm getting it ready to put on the market.\"\"You could get Saturdays and Sundays off. He can hire weekend help locally, if he wants to,\" David said.Silence blanketed the room. Living in, with weekends off. Not exactly what she'd signed up for. Or expected. Then again, it was only for three months, and her mantra of the past year kept repeating in her head:Life is short. Make it an adventure.She just needed to keep her usual safety net in place, too.\"Okay,\" she said at last. \"Let's go check it out.\"Claws of tension dug into Noah Falcon's shoulders as he turned into his driveway and followed it to the back of his property. He drove into the garage, shut off the engine and sat, trying to shift out of work mode and into parent mode. The demands of owning a company were a breeze compared to being with his children each night. Somehow during the past three years they'd become almost strangers to each other.Lately he'd found himself coming home later and later, knowing they would be ready for bed, if not already asleep, thus avoiding contact beyond a query about how their day had gone and what they'd learned. When he did manage to make it home for dinner, he tried to carry on a conversation at the table, but unless he continually asked questions, they were almost silent. He didn't know how to breach that silence, to get them to open up on their own.And this was Friday, which meant another whole weekend with them.At least tonight he didn't have to worry about what to do, since it was past their bedtime. But as he walked toward the house he saw his daughters' bedroom light on and realized he'd come home too early, after all. The rest of the second-floor rooms visible from the back side of the house were dark—the master suite and the bedroom the boys shared. Although there was a bedroom for each child, both sets of twins remained doubled up, choosing not to be separated.He understood their need to be together and hadn't pushed them to split up, even though he remembered having to share with his middle brother, Gideon, when they were young, and begging to have his own space, not getting it until he was a teenager.But twins were different. Closer. At leasthistwins were. And Adam and Zach were only nine, so they probably wouldn't be ready for individual rooms for a while yet. Maybe Ashley and Zoe never would.Noah let himself into the kitchen through the back door. As usual, a plastic-wrap-covered dinner plate was in the refrigerator, along with instructions on how long to heat it in the microwave. He peered through the clear wrap and saw meat loaf, mashed potatoes and green beans. His stomach growled. He shoved the plate into the microwave, set it and headed upstairs to say good-night.As he neared the landing he heard a woman speaking, her voice dramatic. The girls must be watching a movie, because it wasn't their nanny, Jessica.He'd almost reached the doorway to the girls' room when he spotted all four of his children reflected in Ashley's floor-to-ceiling ballet mirror on the bedroom wall. They wore pajamas. The boys were nestled in beanbag chairs they'd dragged into the room from their own. The girls were lying on their stomachs on Ashley's bed, chins resting on their hands. All of them were focused on a woman standing off to the side a little, an open book in her hand.She was tall. He was six-four, and he figured she was five-ten, maybe taller. Her hair was a wild mass of golden-blond curls that bounced as she dramatized the story. She used a different voice for each character and put her whole body into the performance—her whole very nice body. Blue jeans clung to long legs; her breasts strained against a form-fitting sweater. Incredible breasts.She would look magnificent naked, like some kind of Amazon. A warrior woman—Noah scattered the image. She was a stranger in his house, in his children's bedroom. Who the hell was she? And where was Jessica?He moved into the room. The children turned and stared but said nothing, just looked back and forth between the woman and him.\"Good evening,\" he said to them.\"Good evening, Father,\" they answered almost in unison.He saw the woman frown for a moment, then she came forward, her hand out. Brilliant green eyes took his measure. \"Hi. You must be Noah Falcon. I'm Tricia McBride, your new schoolmarm.\"\"My new…schoolmarm?\" he repeated as he shook her hand. \"But, where's Jessica?\"\"Watching television in her bedroom.

In this fast-paced history, Waterfield, who has translated many works from ancient Greek, chronicles the rise and fall of Athens, from ancient days (the bulk of his narrative) to the political revolutions of the 19th century. Legend has it that the great Theseus, who killed the Minotaur, was one of the city's founders and fostered its democratic spirit. Athens's location near the coast (facilitating trade) and its fertile land attracted migrants from the Mediterranean world. For Waterfield, the period of Athens's greatest glory came in the fifth century B.C., when Pericles overturned its aristocratic rule and established a democracy. For 30 years (446-416 B.C.), Athens reached a glorious pinnacle during which philosophy, religion, art and architecture flourished. The grandest accomplishment was the building of the Parthenon, completed in just nine years. During its peak years, Athens also attempted to reign over neighboring states, and its increasingly arrogant imperialism and materialism eventually resulted in war with Sparta and other Greek states that destroyed Athens's splendor. As Waterfield observes, Athens would never again achieve such glory, and it became a territory ruled over the years by Persia, Rome and Turkey. Waterfield sandwiches his helpful history between an opening section on the ancient Olympics and a closing one on the forthcoming games, which jars readers out of their pleasant excursion though the ancient city. 8 pages of b&w photos, not seen byPW.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Jesse and Vicks have been friends for ages, but now there is a wedge between them. Jesse is a devout Christian who frowns on drinking and premarital sex; her unmarried mother calls her Goody Two-shoes and Vicks is getting fed up with her friend's \"holier than thou\" attitude. In fact, this is a large focal point of the story, and readers are sometimes left to wonder why they are still best friends, and when and how Jesse became so religious. Mel is a wealthy newcomer who has offered to pay for the trip, hoping to be accepted by them. Once they get into the car, infighting (and outright fighting) takes over. Still, the girls have wild adventures, including a party at which Vicks and Mel get drunk, a hurricane, a fistfight, and a run-in with a live alligator in order to save a baby duckling. Through confrontations with one another, with boys, and with family, the teens work through the issues they are facing and learn the importance of relying on friends. The presentation of three voices is effective since they come from three different authors, giving readers a variety of perspectives to consider. Teens are left with a satisfying conclusion that ties up most ends and creates hope for those issues left unresolved.—Emily Garrett Cassady, North Garland High School, TXCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They are even more intrigued when they learn that her great-great-grandmother sailed on the Titanic, and that the box contains mementos of her voyage. Suddenly the whole class takes an interest in ships, and Harry suggests that they take a sea voyage of their own. Miss Mackle arranges for them to travel on a riverboat, and buys them all sailor hats for the outing. On the day of the field trip, everyone is thrilled to be onboard, until suddenly Sidney disappears and Song Lee sees his hat floating in the river. They soon find him by the snack bar, however, and enjoy the rest of the ride. In this 13th book about Harry and his friends at South School, Kline has created a lively, entertaining story filled with fascinating facts about pirates and sailing.

That is an accomplishment that needs to be noted. In this election we also saw the first African-American first lady in the White House--another accomplishment to note. This book relates the story of the woman behind the man in the White House. It is what my son would call a \"chapter book.\" The author gives the story of not only Michelle Obama, but also her family and background. The book contains photos of the first lady as she grew up and in his career. Boxes called \"Fact Files\" give sidebar tidbits about this historic first lady. Did you know Michelle's first job at Sidley & Austin was handling the account for Barney the dinosaur? The Fact Files make references that are compared to British equivalents; looking at the front of the book shows the book is of British origin. There is no age range given, but my son in fourth grade had no trouble reading it. -- John L.

The reader is meant to navigate this work with three rules in mind: 1) reading in an atmosphere that allows for reflection without distraction; 2) reading during a time when one is most receptive to meditation and reflection; and, most importantly, 3) allowing for the freedom to accept oneself without judgment. Following an introduction as well as an account of Nouwen's life and spiritual practice, this book is divided into fifteen chapters that interweave Nouwen's spiritual teachings and his love of visual art. Each chapter ends with thoughtful reflection questions and calls the reader to participate in meditation and prayer on a specified topic. Particularly noteworthy are Waldron's chapters on 'The Cup of Life' and 'Writing,' where the reader is invited to embrace the life given by God and to seek an emotional outlet that allows one to recharge and discover one's latent abilities. This book constitutes a good primer for individuals seeking to enhance their spiritual life. It is accessible to both beginners and seasoned meditators alike, and would be a great asset to individuals, parishes, and retreat centers.' --Religious Studies Review", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They are His means for us to know Him.In Christian Disciplines, Oswald Chambers concentrates on six major “disciplines”—or areas of concern—for the growing Christian.DIVINE GUIDANCE and the childlike expectation we should have when we come to God for leading.SUFFERING, an expected part of the Christian life and an opportunity for God’s glory to be revealed.PERIL and how our dependence on God makes us more available to His work.PRAYER, an avenue to Christlikeness in its expectancy, relinquishment, and power.LONELINESS, or solitude, an opportunity for intimate communion with God.PATIENCE, an anchoring in God that holds us through the troubles and circumstances of the world.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

She has since worked in states like Virginia and Iowa to do the same thing. She convened a group of Hispanic leaders to pray and strategize together to form a national Hispanic organization, which led to a meeting of over 700 Hispanic pastors and spouses in Austin with the Governor of Texas. She hosted a summit of 300 African American pastors and leaders to meet with the Governor and other elected officials about the plight of Black children in inner city schools.

The first pages hurl the reader into a torrent of myth and prophecy and then drive headlong into a fiery cluster of futuristic aeronautic warfare. The author only briefly touches upon the story’s time and setting for a few passages as readers surge through the tense atmosphere created by a commanding prose style and the author’s precisely martial imagination. Eventually, though, between the intense training sessions of space warriors with names such as Hunter and Prowler and interstellar fleet conflicts between the Pack and the Swarm, the novel’s mythos takes shape amid a barrage of barking admirals and powerful queens. Between two worlds, evocatively named Lycera and Nefera, lies the Void, a mysterious abyss in space that separates the planets and makes travel to each system’s borders costly and protracted. Surrounding the nothingness are the anxieties and myths of the warriors, as many assume that the Void devours all who attempt to transverse it. But when a passage is found through the Void and a group from the Pack are forced to abandon ship on the surface of their target, the war, and perhaps eventual peace, between the worlds takes on a new dimension. It’s an unapologetic space opera and even the habitually italicized dialogue doesn’t distract from the legitimacy and gravity of the novel’s epic events. As with most science-fiction series, the finale is bittersweet, but Laborde answers just enough questions and coaxes out just enough mystery at the conclusion to leave readers wanting more adventure, more revelations and the crowning resolution.A successful and compelling space opera full of grit and imagination.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 7, "rating_average": 4.7143, "rating_total": 33.0}

Her account of what acting means to her is a classic, and I'm sure will be often quoted.' Michael Frayn 'Delightful, touching and honest. A vivid and moving account of a way of life that wrenched families apart; extraordinary to us now, though considered quite normal at the time.' Geoffrey Palmer 'Isla Blair is known as a fine actress.  Now, without doubt, she will be known as a fine writer.  This is an acute and fascinating evocation of a vanished world, the world of the British Raj: painful, funny and eventually joyous because, above all, this is a beautifully written book about survival at a triumphant level.'

Benjamin Tracy’s historical novel of the young  Macedonian in the years before he went off to conquer most of the known  world is more than just another typical work of hero-worshipping  biographical fiction. In drawing on his many years of teaching Latin to  adolescent students, Tracy has managed to capture the innocence, the  excitability, the playfulness, and theoverwhelming sense of indestructibility of the youthful Alexander and his playmates.That Tracy the teacher is also Tracy the student is evident on  almost every page. The author knows his subject well. He has drawn  heavily from the classic accounts of antiquity to explain and enliven  the story of Alexander’s boyhood, from his tutoring by Aristotle to his  falling out with, exile by, and eventual reconciliation with his father,  Phillip. There is little newmaterial here, but that is not the point of the book. Whether  retelling the legend of how the boy prince tamed the wild stallion  Bucephalus or describing Alexander’s exuberant battle-winning cavalry  charge on the field of Chaeronea, the author manages to give the  familiar a bit of freshness.Told from Alexander’s perspective as if he were writing his memoirs,  In the Theater of the World is seasoned with personal observations  about the people who taught, teased, and tested him during his  adolescence. The book focuses on Alexander’s younger years, before he  crossed into Asia to take on the mighty Persian Empire. A pampered  prince surrounded by fawningfellows and comely courtesans, Alexander wants for nothing and gets  everything he wants whenever he wants it. He expects no less, and makes  no apologies for that. Even his introductions to sex and battle are  experiences of fun and wonder, and he takes to both with the eagerness  and temerity that only a young prince with Alexander’s inherent vanity  and sense of invulnerability could.There is drama in the book, for Alexander’s youth was not all  privilege and play. A pawn in a battle for royal power between factions  dominated by his mother and his father, Alexander was played by and  played against both sides, even to the point of plotting with a foreign  king to march upon his homeland and overthrow his father. Tracy handles  that contentious episode well, as he does the final act in his  drama—Alexander’s reaction to watching the assassination of Philip and  his own subsequent grasping of the crown.In the Theater of the World does not add much, if anything, new to  the history or to the legend of Alexander, but in focusing on his  adolescence, C. Benjamin Tracy provides a teacher’s insight into what  helped make that young man of Macedon earn the title “the Great.” Mark  G.

Most of the toys are made from one or two sheets of standard origami paper, and all come with hand photos showing how to hold or move them to best effect. The particularly clear step diagrams use standard origami notation, and the directions that accompany them are just as easy to follow. The thick package of square paper attached to the rear cover won't last long once children (and folders who are children at heart) get their hands on this above-average offering.—John Peters, New York Public Library(c) Copyright 2010.

My\nfirst book, Fruitflesh: Seeds of Inspiration for Women Who Write, had just been\npublished by HarperSanFrancisco (now HarperOne), and while I was on my book\ntour, I found out that my novel, The Book of Dead Birds, had won Barbara\nKingsolver's Bellwether Prize for Fiction in Support of a Literature of Social\nChange and would be published by HarperCollins the following year. In addition\nto Barbara Kingsolver, the other judges had been Toni Morrison and Maxine Hong\nKingston, my three favorite writers in the world. All of them had been (and\ncontinue to be) role models for me. My pantheon of literary goddesses. To get\ntheir blessing was so incredibly thrilling and affirming. It was also discombobulating.\nI came down with writer's block for the first time in my life; I let myself\nbelieve that every word I wrote from then on had to be worthy of a national\naward, worthy of the praise of the three amazing women who had chosen my novel.\nAfter months of frozen creativity, I decided to participate in National Novel\nWriting Month, figuring that if I tried to write 50,000 words in 30 days, I\nwouldn't have time to worry about whether those words were any good. It worked.\nNaNoWriMo helped me get back out of my own way; it returned my writing to me in\nall its messy, juicy glory. The Book of Live Wires is the result. I chose to reconnect with my characters from The\nBook of Dead Birds that November since I had wondered what they had been up to after the first\nbook ended. Dead Birds had taken five years to write; writing the sequel was\nlike a month-long family reunion, catching up with the people who had spent so\nmuch time in my head, and who I loved dearly. It was hard to see them going\nthrough new, painful struggles, but I was grateful to hang out with them again. Over the years, I've mentioned The Book of Live Wires at my readings and\nbook club visits. Readers have always expressed interest, but I've told them I\ndidn't have any plans to release it--it was too raw, too much of a personal\nproject. It didn't feel right to share it, somehow. But enough people asked\nthat I finally decided to take another look and was surprised by how much life\nI found inside the story. I shared the draft with my first reader and dear\nfriend Laraine Herring, who thought the book contained some of the best writing\nof my life (which was both awesome and awful to hear--had I really not written\nanything as good in almost a decade?!) After some revision, I started to think about how to go about\nreleasing the book. The publishing world has changed a lot since 2002. I have\npublished five books with major presses (including another NaNoWriMo novel,\nSelf Storage) in the intervening years, and have watched budgets for promotion\nof said books plummet. Publishers have gone from arranging multiple city book\ntours with fancy hotels for midlist authors like myself to setting up a couple\nof local readings within driving distance of home. Much of the promotion has\ngone online--blog book tours, book trailers on YouTube, Skype visits with book\nclubs. It's a whole new world, one authors need to learn to navigate and be\nproactive about if we hope to stay relevant. When I first started hearing about the shift to digital\nbooks, I was horrified, but eventually I let myself realize how exciting it is\nto live during a time of transition, of change. I decided to embrace that shift\nrather than resist it--to see it as an opportunity, an adventure, rather than a\ndeath knell. And I realized that it behooves writers, who are increasingly in\ncharge of our own promotion, anyway, to learn how to take publishing into our\nown hands. So I decided to do just that. Nine years after I sat down to write it, The Book of Live\nWires is now available as an ebook. I released the novel in November to\ncelebrate NaNoWriMo and to get a head start on celebrating the 10th\nanniversary of the Bellwether Prize this coming January. Self-publishing has\nrequired a steep learning curve, but it's been a fun and illuminating journey.\nBeing in control of every aspect of the process--from finding and negotiating\nthe use of a cover image on flickr to choosing which platform to use (I decided\non a combination of Smashwords and Kindle) to obtaining ISBN numbers and taking\nout all the tab indents, page breaks, etc. in order to format the manuscript\nproperly--is exhilarating and at times overwhelming. And of course now all the\npromotion is in my hands, too (although I've enlisted a professional publicist\nto help with this, something I've done on occasion when I've published books\ntraditionally, as well, to get more muscle behind the book and reach further\nthan I could on my own.) I see this all as a grand experiment. I do hope to continue\nto publish books the old fashioned way--I am grateful for the support and\nstoried tradition of the established publishing world (plus I want to help keep\nbrick and mortar bookstores alive!)--but I'm happy to know that I can always\nchoose to release my work on my own, if I so desire. We have the power--the\npower of the pen, the power of the pixel. Let's use that power to create a\nbrave and beautiful new world of words.", "related": [], "rank": 1260061, "title": "The Book of Live Wires", "author": "Gayle Brandeis", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Tom served as CEO for six years and took the company public in May of 1999. He served on the Board of Directors until February 2003. In January 1999, Tom and a business partner purchased Tecniflex, Inc., a company that sells mission-critical equipment and provides hardware maintenance to community banks. Tom formed a sister company, Imagic Corporation, that develops and supports check-imaging systems to community banks. As CEO, Tom expanded both companies from small regional providers to national sales and service organizations. Under his leadership, Tecniflex has gone from a regional company to serving 4,000 banks in 49 states.

Her best-known novels are The Edwardians (1930) and All Passion Spent (1931). Both titles were reissued alongside her earlier novel, Challenge (1923), by Virago in Spring 2011. In 1946 Sackville-West was made a Companion of Honour for her services to literature. The following year she began a weekly column in the Observer called In your Garden. In 1948 she became a founder member of the National Trust's garden committee. Sissinghurst Castle is now owned by the National Trust and the garden Vita Sackville-West created there is open to the public.

His parents were starving artists in Paris when the Nazis marched in. They had to bolt back to Budapest in a cattle car. Their history takes off from there. The book is essentially a memoir with a blood-freezing escape from the Beastly Hun, and an odyssey afterwards through America. It's an intelligent work, with a great sense of humor. --Ann Weldy, author of I am a Woman, Odd Girl Out and other booksA gripping and highly entertaining story, and a fascinating narrative of 20th century history, based on the author's eventful life. In Forrest Gump-like fashion, Tom keeps bumping into historical figures and experiencing historical events first-hand. The book is reminiscent of Tom Wolfe's and E.W. Johnson's New Journalism, which mixes journalism and the novel. It is written with humor, multi-cultural sophistication and realism. It captivates the reader, who will recognize places, events and experiences. --Phillip Richard, Professor of Literature", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Unfortunately, the sonorous prose and Moser's haunting engravings fail to camouflage a simplistic plot and shaky premise. A vast Iron Woman arises out of a marsh and vows, to a schoolgirl named Lucy, to destroy those who have poisoned the waters. Afraid for her father and the others who work at the toxin-dumping Waste Factory, Lucy contacts Hogarth, the boyish handler of the Iron Man (a figure introduced more than 20 years ago in Hughes's The Iron Giant). The children's warnings do not stop the polluters, and so the Iron Woman, after being energized by Iron Man's Space-Bat-Angel-Dragon from outer space, turns every adult male in the country into some type of water creature. They resume human form only after a monstrous Cloud-Spider gets sucked off into space, which also causes the country's refuse to transform, miraculously, into a nonpolluting fuel/fertilizer/pesticide (\"'Our problems,' said the prime minister, 'seem to be strangely solved'\"). Hardly a timely or instructive parable for readers who, despite their youth, know that there are no magical solutions to a pressing global concern.

This collection brings together the books from the second half of his career, forming a companion to a volume covering 1945-1975. This book doesn't contain Creeley's breakout volume, For Love (1962), but it does have some magnificent poetry. There are elegiac poems throughout-the first poem from Later (1979), \"Myself,\" begins \"What, younger, felt/ was possible, now knows/ is not.\" There are nine books collected here in all, plus four previously unpublished poems. In a short note, Creeley's wife Penelope mentions that they had discussed his writing a preface for this book: \"He had thought about what he wanted to say: 'These are my poems. I love them and stand by them.'\" Readers will do the same over the course of the 21st century.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She describes the venture as 'great fun, but sadly, only mildly lucrative'. In the 1980's a lifelong passion for animals led her to build and run Spikes Island, a highly successful boarding cattery. In the 1990's, asked to write a short piece for a local magazine, she continued writing only to find that the article had turned into her first novel, Lillian's Story, One Woman's Journey through the 20th Century. Astounded and delighted by its success, she has since written The Sweetest Empire and Painting by Numbers. Her fourth novel, Finding Cordelia, will be published soon and like the other three, be available on Amazon Kindle and in paperback. Sally is proud to be Chair of Shorelink Community Writers,a long-standing and thriving writers group in Hastings, which believes that laughter is essential to the creative process. Sally lives in rural Sussex with her husband, Roland, also a writer, and assorted rescued animals. Their daily walk with their dogs in the woods nearby is an important part of their lives, although they could do without Bengy the spaniel's penchant for going off and leaving them gnashing their teeth while they wait for him to reappear!

He has sold over five million books, and is in demand as a team-building, life-changing, and leadership speaker and consultant for his Who Dares Wins concept. Born in the Bronx, Bob attended West Point and earned a BA in psychology with honors and then served as an Infantry platoon leader, a battalion scout platoon leader, and a brigade recon platoon leader in the 1st Cavalry Division. He joined Special Forces and commanded a Green Beret A Team. He served as the operations officer for 2nd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) and with Special Operations Command (Special Projects) in Hawaii. Later he taught at the Special Forces Qualification Course at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg, the course which trains new Green Berets. He lived in Korea where he earned a Black Belt in Martial Arts. He's earned a Masters Degree in Education. Mayer's obsession with mythology and his vast knowledge of the military and Special Forces, mixed with his strong desire to learn from history, is the foundation for his science fiction series Atlantis, Area 51 and Psychic Warrior. Mayer is a master at blending elements of truth into all of his thrillers, leaving the reader questioning what is real and what isn't. He took this same passion and created thrillers based in fact and riddled with possibilities. His unique background in the Special Forces gives the reader a sense of authenticity and creates a reality that makes the reader wonder where fact ends and fiction begins. Mayer's military background, coupled with his deep desire to understand the past and how it affects our future, gives his writing a rich flavor not to be missed. He has taught organizations ranging from Maui Writers, to Whidbey Island Writers, to San Diego State University, to the University of Georgia, to the Romance Writers of America National Convention, to Boston SWAT, the CIA, Fortune-500, the Royal Danish Navy Frogman Corps, Microsoft, Rotary, IT Teams in Silicon Valley and many others. He has also served as a Visiting Writer for NILA MFA program in Creative Writing. He has done interviews for the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Sports Illustrated, PBS, NPR, the Discovery Channel, the SyFy channel and local cable shows.

During her youth, she got caught up in the euphoria of drug experimentation that defined the '60s and '70s, moving swiftly from alcohol to pills to cocaine and heroin before she was even out of her teens. The stigma attached to drugs wasn't as serious then as it is today, but the negative reputation we now pin on drugs is due, in part, to the experiences endured by Peggy's generation. As it turns out, the legacy of the '60s isn't just peace and love; there is a darker side, one of life-long addiction, a battle that many continue to wage to this day. In her Kindle Single,The Damage Done, emerging talent Victoria Turk explores whether this battle against addiction can be won, and how. Peggy, with her periods of struggle and false hope, with a life literally given over to the pursuit of drugs, and with all the experience of her hard years, is the embodiment of that battle.--Chris Schluep", "related": ["B007BBJR7I"], "rank": 1304102, "title": "The Damage Done (Kindle Single)", "author": "Victoria Turk", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

This was my first short story ever to get published in a magazine way back in 1992. It is a work of Social Horror. I have updated it for this book as the technology in it as it was getting dated. I had also updated it before it was originally published as I had written it some years even previous to that, in the 80s. Originally it was written as a dare, a lark, a challenge, when I had jokingly said one day to some friends while we were partying together one night, that I could make any storyline plausible. Due beware of making such claims as it was a lot of work from then on.\"Gumdrop City\" was published in 2010 in Zilyon Publishing's \"The Undead Nation Anthology\". It is a horror story, pure and simple. I originally heard about from a Professor in my University Abnormal Psych class. He told it to us as a psychological study. It is however, a true crime story. I fictionalized the father and daughter in it, as well as a few other things but once you walk through a certain door, the fundamentals there are despicably true. I have since worked up a treatment for this story as a screenplay with the help of a Hollywood Producer. So it is possible that one day, this short story could hit the silver screen.\"Quantum History\" was done as a friendly experiment between three friends to choose a theme and write it, then compare stories. It is a Science Fiction Comedy for all intents and purposes. There are two other versions of this theme floating about and I'm willing to bet that other than mine, those other two will never see the light of day.\"The London Mea Culpa Document\" is a document about the document called \"The Mea Culpa Document\". It is a one page description from the \"authoritative journal\" it was published in.\"The Mea Culpa Document\" following the \"London\" piece, was originally written back in college with the help of a Theater Professor who is into Medieval Literature (he also helped me with \"Poor Lord Ritchie\", see below). It is a story about a great burden that an idealistic Witch Hunter has to bear in the Medieval Ages in England. Mea Culpa documents used to be documents that some used to write out all their sins and then typically burn them. But in this case, this document was stored for posterity, for reasons that will be made clear.\"Poor Lord Ritchie's Answer to a Question He Knever Knew (on the Night that the Knight Lost All)\", was chosen by actor Rutger Hauer (as the \"Replicant Roy Batty\" in the Ridley Scott film, \"BladeRunner\" and so many other films) as a winner in his International Short Story contest that he ran for two years back in the late 1990s. I entered it because I just knew that he would like this story most out of all of my stories. It is a surreal tale of a confused Medieval Lord who has been abused by genetics and his position. It is about a man lost and his descent into either temporal displacement, or madness; in the end, let it be your decision.\"Sarah\" has now been built into my screenplay, \"HearthTales\" which I've been sending out to production companies. Sarah is a woman lost in the misery and dementia of Alzheimer's Disease. I had heard some examples of what it was like to live with someone suffering from this disease, from a girl in, once again, my Abnormal Psych class at our University. She told me about her grandmother and some of her experiences. They were such moving stories that I had to find a way to share them.\"The Fall\" was a recent exercise in an online writer's group I participate in; one of several. Another story, \"Simon's Beautiful Thought\" (on Amazon KDP and Smashwords) was another exercise coming out of that group, just previous to \"The Fall\". \"Simon\" was about obsession. \"The Fall\" is about madness or the descent into it, depending how you take it. It is about how romance can intertwine with insanity to lead to the worst of all possible of life events.\"Japheth, Ishvi and The Light\" is my first attempt at a full blown Zombie story. It is based on the Biblical tale of Abraham and his son Isaac and is about the religious commune they live in. Throw in some devastating confusion, a few soldiers, God, and well, there you have it.\"Andrew\" is the story of a very young boy, the child of a very brilliant married couple who were also rather unusual scientists. It is a story about how Andrew tries to deal with an event more traumatic than anyone should ever have to experience, no matter what age they are. This is then juxtaposed with how he learned to deal with it as an adult, who he developed into by that point in his life, and where his parent's efforts end him up. Yes, there is certainly a lot more than that going on.I hope you find these tales as entertaining to read as I found them to write.-JZ Murdock", "related": ["B00AP83CL6"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I was a sugar-holic and totally addicted to it.  But 25 years ago I read a small paperback by a doctor who had cured himself of cancer through diet. It impacted me and as I looked around at people in their 40’s, 50’s and 60’s and beyond, and saw how their health was deteriorating, I said to myself, “that’s not how I want to end up”. So I immediately made a transition. One day I was a sugar-holic and the next day I wasn’t. I know God had His hand upon me and delivered me from my addiction and placed in me a passion for the prevention of disease and natural health. From that point on I consumed information on health and have lived the lifestyle ever since.  Every day I watch people give away their health; one meal, one beverage, one day at a time. I understand that most people have never been educated to eat or live in any other manner.  Today, as a Health Coach, my goal is to help those who want to live healthy and avoid unnecessary diseases. God designed the body, provided everything we need to sustain it, but it is our responsibility to care for it according to its design. With my book and through conducting wellness workshops, my goal is to give people a new perspective on health, simple steps to follow, and encouragement so they can live and enjoy life into their later years, being an example of vitality to others.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The son of a solicitor, he qualified as a barrister whilst still finding timeto contribute stories to the Windsor Magazine. After the first world war hegave up legal work in favour of writing, which had become his great passion, and completed somethirty books. These rangedfrom light- hearted farce to adventure thrillers. For the former, he created the 'Berry' books which established Yates' reputation as a writer of witty, upper-crust romances. For the latter, he created ther character Richard Chandos, who recounts the adventures of Jonah Mansel, a classic gentleman sleuth. As a consequence of his education and experience, Yates' books feature the genteel life, a nostalgic glimpse at Edwardian decadence and a number of swindling solicitors. In his hey day, and as testament to hisfine writing, Dornford Yates' work was placed in the bestseller list. Indeed, 'Berry' is one of the great comic creations of twentieth century fiction; the 'Chandos' titles also beingsuccessfully adapted for television. Along with Sapper and John Buchan, Yates dominated the adventure book market of the inter war years. Finding the English climate utterly unbearable, Yates chose to live in the French Pyrenees for eighteen years, before moving on to Rhodesia where he died in 1960.

It didn't take all that long, just about half an hour, really. I send out copies to some of my best friends who gave me generally good feedback. After taking a few suggestions, and thinking it over for a few months, I decided it wouldn't hurt to try publishing it. Well, it turns out that it's fairly easy to publish a work on Amazon, so here we are.I hope you enjoy this little story.

She holds a BSc in sociology with minors in psychology and education, and an MBA degree.After completing her MBA, she started working as a consultant on Quality Management Systems. She considered the Total Quality Management (TQM) a tool that promised five-star results in producing successful organizations. A few months of working with people from all levels in different organizations taught her a lesson: people were not as enthusiastic as she was for the quality applications. Almost no one was willing to participate actively; motivation level, leadership skills, teamwork, and initiative were poor.At that point, she started working on a self-improvement model that would guide people in becoming happier, healthier, more successful, more productive, and more competitive in life. She developed the Personal Quality Management (PQM) model in 1997. PQM was a structured system for self-improvement with twelve components: self-knowledge, accepting change, setting up goals, positive energy, self-esteem development, time management, creativity, effective communications, conflict resolution, stress management, motivation, and teamwork. From then on, she assumed the responsibility of helping organizations develop their organizational structures by implementing OD methodologies and TQM principles, and training human resources in soft skills by putting the PQM fundamentals into effect.Coming from a positive background and actively practicing the self-development principles along the way has contributed tremendously in solving the challenging situations she encountered in her life, as well as successfully mentoring and coaching other people.Tuana Dowan lives in Cupertino, California, and works on the second half of her spiritual development story.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Chillemi's most recent original paperback,The Complete Herbal Guide: Heal Your Body Naturally and Maintain Optimal Health Using Alternative Medicine, Herbals, Vitamins, Fruits and Vegetables(December 2012) debuted at # 1 on Amazon's best-seller list and has been rated five stars fromnumerous readers who purchased the book.Chillemi's first published book, Epilepsy You're Not Alone in 1998, helped millions of people understand and cope with their disorder enabling them to live a happy, healthy and productive life. Since that time, Chillemi has published numerous non-fiction and fiction books includingThe Complete Herbal Guide: A Natural Approach to Healing the Body, Epilepsy and Pregnancy: What Every Woman Should Know, Co-authored by Dr. Blanca Vasques, M.D., Faith, Courage, Wisdom, Strength and Hope, Natural Cures for Common Conditions and The Secrets of Happiness and Success: The Power Of Positive Thinking.Her love affair with non-fiction and with health genre in general, began during her junior year of college when she was having faced by numerous obstacles due to her epilepsy disorder.Hoping and praying that she would be able to finish college and not let her epilepsy disorder get the best of her, she decided to research her disorder hoping to find out more about her disorder and ways to cope with it.Sadly, there were not many books written about epilepsy during that era.The few books written were by doctors and the medical terminology flew right over your head.Determined to find the answers to my questions,\"How can I graduate college when I am constantly having seizures?\", \"How can I become a success in life and not let epilepsy destroy my hopes and dreams?\", \"How do people with epilepsy cope with their disorder?\"I decided to write an article to epilepsy foundation and asked them to publish it.I wanted to learn how others coped with their disorder.I received hundreds of letters from all over the United States and Canada. I decided to use the knowledge I gained to help myselfand others by writing a self-help book called, Epilepsy You're NotAlone.Writing that book changed my life.Letters poured out from readers thanking me for writing the book.I never realized how powerful words could be.My greatest gift was not figuring out how to help myself, it was being able to help others who struggled from the same problem.There is no greater gift in life than the gift of giving.I graduated college, received an Associate's Degrees in Business, and then went on to receive a Bachelor Degree in Marketing and Advertising, but in the end, I changed my career choice to journalism. I graduated Richard Stockton College in 1996.I began writing seriously in 1994, penning the manuscript that would become Epilepsy You're Not Alone.I held many jobs during those first years as a writer, finally settling in (much to our delight) to write full time in 2000.Chillemi is an active member of her community and helps organizations in New Jersey.Shehas written features for journals and newspapers. Her articles have appeared in dozens of newspapers and magazines in North America and abroad.

After two years in ChemEng. at Niagara University, and employment at Eastman Kodak Company, I entered the U.S. Naval Academy in June 1939, and graduated with a BS Degree in June 1942. I served 27-months at sea on the destroyer USS Edison DD-439, providing convoy support, and acting as amphibious gunfire support for Allied troops at Casablanca, Sicily, Salerno, Anzio, and Southern France. By then I was the ship's Gunnery Officer. This led to flight training and Navy wings in Oct. 1945, service as a pilot of PB4Y-2 Privateer aircraft in the Aleutians, back to school at the US Naval Postgraduate School for a BS EE, then MS in Physics at University of California. Flying F6F 'Hellcat' drone aircraft and F8F 'Bearcat' chase planes came next, followed by shore duty as Underseas Weapons Officer at NOL Whiiteoak MD. A shift to the Naval Reserve led to command of a reserve VP squadron of P2V 'Neptune' aircraft at NAS Niagara Falls NY, and commission as Captain USNR. The move back to civilian life, first in Rochester NY, then San Diego CA, ended as Vice President R&D for a subsidiary of Scott Paper Co. in Massachusetts in 1976.An authoring career followed, first contract publishing of business reports, then publishing the books below.

A resident of Southern California since birth, except for his studies at the University of Miami in Florida, he initially intended to become a marine biologist. The story of how he arrived at a different calling is revealed in one of his stories of amazing sequential events described in Fingers in the Light. These events led to his decision to become a fine artist and commercial graphic designer—a profession that became life-long. During the 1970’s Jon also participated in a 9,500 mile run marathon, called “Liberty Torch” in which he placed a foot in each of the continental United States. He also taught math and coached swimming at a private school in Florida, as well as having traveled the world. But the external biographical facts don’t necessarily reflect a person’s inner life or what is most important. Jon’s real story is about his quest to understand his true path and his place in life in relation to his amazing experiences of divine guidance and his God-given gifts and abilities, one of which is his award winning writing. This quest and all that he has learned through his experiences is now being told for the first time in his non-fiction books and now through his science fiction books. Jon’s love for and advocacy of marine mammals continues, as does his sensitivity to the natural world and its creatures. These avocations are explored in True Tails, which was his first award-winning autobiographical book and centers around his gift of coherent two-way communication with animals and other many-legged creatures. He also works for the preservation of marine mammals—his gently persuasive and rational arguments for ending the killing of whales and other sentient marine creatures are expressed in his popular website blog, The Whale People (www.thewhalepeople.com). And although his first books are of a non- fiction nature, Jon has began his debut as a science fiction writing with the release of his science fiction adventure called “Element 238 – The Search for Truth.” The first five volumes are now available in exclusive Kindle format. His author website: http://www.jhsoeder.com also has links to his short stories, both fiction and non-fiction. Jon lives in Ventura County. His books are widely available in softcover and e-book format. You can follow Jon on Twitter or Facebook.", "related": ["B009NZG2F0"], "rank": 4272792, "title": "Element 238 - The Flight for Survival - Episode 3 eBook", "author": "J.H.

The volume contains comprehensive, clear and up-to-date descriptions of the current knowledge of neonatal diseases and of their pathophysiology and treatment, and provides a selection of other relevant information with an evidence-based approach. Figures and diagrams are used to improve understanding of complex problems, and references have been chosen to enable in-depth evaluation of clinical problems. The text pays particular attention to the various diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures for which reliable guidelines are not yet available. The use of summaries, tables, and accurately selected guidelines or recommendations that will accompany the text will supply quick references and instant solutions to the concerned specialists during their daily practice.This book aims to provide the scientific community with the state of the art on neonatal care in order to avoid as much as possible, or at least limit, the  tragic disabilities due to prematurity, abnormal delivery, and diseases affecting these patients. Expert pediatricians, neonatologists, obstetricians, anaesthesiologists, training doctors in these areas,  as well as all child caregivers will find it this volume a  fundamental tool for their activity, thanks to the schematic and practical information it offers and to the indications of clinical solutions.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The premise of the book is simple: Only by knowing ourselves as human beings, the kind of creatures we really are, can we hope to understand cultural evolution and find valid answers to our human problems.There is no way to achieve such understanding without knowing how information is acquired, processed, and transmitted by the human brain, Lin argues. To solve these difficulties, the book takes a radical approach in two steps. Part 1 of the book,How to Build a Conscious Robot with Feelings, investigates information processing in the mind by breaking it down into purely mechanical components for analysts and implementation. Part 2,Cultural Evolution, uses the findings to formulate an original theory of cultural evolution and apply it to elucidate cultural phenomena such as morality, ideology, and religion.By delving deeply into the workings of the human mind, this book is the first to address the obstacle faced by memetic theorists in their analysis of culture: that nobody really knows what goes on inside the mind or how mental experiences may direct cultural evolution. Creative, persuasive, and comprehensive,The Origin of Culturesis full of insights and revolutionary thinking. It provides novel solutions to many age-old questions, such as those concerning the nature of consciousness, the roles of the unconscious and emotions in human thinking and reasoning, free will, the pursuit of happiness, the goals and mechanisms of cultural evolution, the possibility for a biologically based morality, the truths in ideologies, the origin and validity of religious beliefs, and more.Determined to knock humankind off its last pedestal of smug self-reassurance, the answers to these questions will change forever our perceptions about the world and ourselves. The aim is not to humiliate or discomfit, however, but to put humanity on a more solid and authentic ground so it can realize its true potential. By giving us a glimpse of what the future can be, this book tells how we as human beings may evolve into a better, fitter, and happier species, living and succeeding in accordance with our nature. --Editorial Press ReleaseWinner, Silver Medal  Finalist of the 2012 IBPA (Independent Book Publishers  Association)Benjamin Franklin Book Award in the Category of Science. --  Publisher Press Release", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Politics & Social Sciences", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His culinary skills were nurtured by his father, a renowned master chef in Chinese cuisine. To further refine his skills, Charles attended the Malaysian Chinese Cuisine chef training course, as well as the prestigious Le Cordon Bleu culinary workshops. Besides, he also graduated with a diploma in hotel management from the American Hotel & Motel Association (formerly known as AHMA, now AHLA). Academically, Charles holds a Bachelor Degree (B.A. Hons) in International Business Administration from the University of Northumbria U.K and also possesses a Diploma in Management from the University of Malaya. Throughout his career, Charles has been featured numerous times in food and cooking magazines as the master chef in Chinese cuisine and also acknowledged as \"Asia Food Guru\". As an authoritative & professional chef, and also an expert on Asian Cuisine, Charles has successfully demonstrated his special techniques and recipes which delighted his audience, including the community of the Western World. By extensively travelling and accumulating the most authentic recipes of all Asian countries, that were prized as family secret recipes, Charles Ho wrote numerous articles and reports on Asian cuisine. He also contributed with his recipes and features on regional cooking ''Home Cooking'' magazine, local publications, newspapers and is currently working on two other cookbooks. Charles Ho has retired, and now, with more hours to spare, indulges in his favorite pastime - writing (holding a pen rather than a pan).", "related": ["B00DAG90LG"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Cookbooks, Food & Wine", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

However, with constant optimism he displayed a remarkable ability to turn his hand to just about anything and by the time he was thirty had started businesses in fast food, property, antiques and manufacturing. He has observed and recorded candidly the vicissitudes of his business and private life.

It led to him being dubbed 'Lord Lust' by the Sun and 'Lusty Lord of the Manor' by the Sunday Mirror. But as the Chronicle reported he is everything many rich and 'important' people are not. He is friendly, courteous, bears no hint of snobbery and is always willing to battle for the underdog if he thinks he has a case.

The discovery of a dead body nearby is not the way Jake wants to end his day, especially when it turns out the dead man is a local farmer who had been embroiled in a battle with other members of his family over the potential sale of some of their land. But was he murdered by a member of his own family, or by someone else entirely? Jake is a likable narrator, a guy with a good head on his shoulders and a no-nonsense approach to his job, and Gunn’s latest is plenty intricate enough to keep Jake and the reader guessing. Perhaps not as well known as it ought to be, the Jake Hines series has been around since 1997’s Triple Play and always delivers a satisfying mystery built around an engaging protagonist. Fans of Steven F. Havill’s Bill Gastner novels will want to meet Jake. --David Pitt", "related": [], "rank": 633136, "title": "Eleven Little Piggies (The Jake Hines Mysteries Book 9)", "author": "Elizabeth Gunn", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Long overdue, these books will be a valuable resource for teachers, students, and the public at large.” —Cokie Roberts, author ofFounding MothersandLadies of Liberty", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Luckily it's currently on the up as she has landed her dream job, she is determined to make this her sole focus - that is until she can't stop thinking about her gorgeous, steamy and determined boss. Oh dear...Becky Jordon is an instantly likeable character, who manages to get herself into some of the strangest (and rather amusing) situations. She is the first reason I got carried away reading this book, she's young, energetic and strong (unless her sizzling-hot boss is around). I had an instant liking for her and was one 100% behind her new 'no men' lifestyle change (that was until I decided she HAD to get with her boss or I might throw the book across the room).The story line follows the traditional chic-lit plot; fall for a guy, things go up the shoot, you desperately hope they get back together again and then... I won't give it away! This is the second reason why I couldn't put this book down. The plot is pacey, a little unpredictable and leaves you desperate to find out what is going to happen next. If I could however find one fault with this book, for me, it was that the end seemed a little rushed... I felt like I'd only just finished the middle and suddenly there were no more pages left.That one little fault however did not stop me from reading this book in 2 days (Yes 2 days!), 2 extremely late nights mid-week and 2 very hazy days at work. I was completely hooked and... swept away with the whole story.  Maggie Le Page has certainly set the bar high for her first book.", "related": ["B006IEWH1M"], "rank": 84569, "title": "A Heat Of The Moment Thing", "author": "Maggie Le Page", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 12, "rating_average": 4.1667, "rating_total": 50.0}

Hallett could have called his book `There Be Blood, Gore, Torture and Other Really Horrible Things', but that's not as catchy a title.' 'Perfect for anyone who wants an adventure, anyone who wants to be thrilled, anyone who wants to be scared, and anyone who isn't afraid of the nightmares that are prone to follow.' 'This is not some fantasy book dealing with wizards and spells. No, these are regular soldiers who find themselves pitted against dragons and enemy forces. And the result is a really fun read.' 'I grew tired of Vietnam war stories a long time ago, but Hallett has done enough here to make it interesting again.

We have two grown children and a precious grandbaby, special deliver from Africa. When not teaching, I love to hole up in our lake cabin and write--usually with a batch of popcorn within easy reach.

The story was a bit of an experiment, as I wanted to see if I could write something short. Like really, really short, while still telling a complete story. You see, I'd tried this in the past; every effort turned into a much longer work than what I had originally anticipated. Fine Wine, however, went as planned, taking all of an hour or so to get the first draft down.In the process of writing the story I discovered a character I liked enough to want to revisit. So I wrote Killing the Dead, which was planned as a longer, more involved story meant to reveal a bit more about the character and the world he lives in. With the first two tales forming a base for the character, I decided to expand the series by introducing additional supporting characters, a number of organizations whose motives our witty assassin finds himself opposed to for one reason or another, and a diabolical plan which just might mean the end of everything the Assassin Without a Name holds dear. This larger direction starts with Night of Zealotry and continues into subsequent stories from there.Each story is a tale unto itself, however, so no cliffhanger endings. While I want readers to come back for the next story, I also want them to leave with a sense of fulfillment. I know how some readers feel about serial style works; rest assured, the Assassin Without a Name series is not a collection of serials, but actual short stories and novellas, each with its own beginning and end.I hope you enjoy following along with the principal character in these\nshorts as I write more of them. Who knows? Maybe he'll get a novel of his own someday.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He usually rides the bus to his 'day job', and draws and writes a lot of his books while on the bus, during his lunch hour, or after the kids have finally gone to bed.To learn more about Riley visit RileyWeberArt.com", "related": ["B00COQNIXE"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Doug's book is a joy to follow, well thought through and well written. The camera company should be employing Doug to write their cameras manuals!-Robert D.A Pro Right There with You- If you want to get the camera up and running with the feeling of a pro right there with you then I would strongly recommend it. He walks you through setting the camera up and gives you his reasoning for the settings. He leaves the door open to change them based on your level of experience. After the basic settings tour Doug then gets down to the heart of this great camera: the custom settings and focus system. His explanation is first class and he explains how various custom settings are related to each other. The focus system on this camera is top drawer and Doug does a fine job explaining what can be a very intimidating area of this camera. All in all a great read.  Camera in one hand and reader in the other and dig in.-Tim S.A Must-Have Accessory- What a great addition to my bag. This is a well written, full body of work that explains, in plain English, how to get the most out my new camera. Doug provides the knowledge and experience to bring you to the next level. I look forward to learning more every time I open the book.-StevenI now feel that I have control over the camera.It's the first guide I've read which has taken me through all the settings in an understandable way.-Peter S.Really Focuses on the \"Why\"- I found the (official) manual good for understanding how to set things up but not much on the why - this book really focuses on the \"why.\"-Benoit A.This manual is a clearly written,concise and useful explanation of the rationale for the seemingly infinite and often confusing settings options.-W.L.S.It's clear, concise and gets to the heartof the camera's multiple and often confusing options.

Sandra Mahoney, a self-described \"wife on pause,\" is feeling stifled after her husband departs Australia to work in the States for a year, leaving her behind to take care of their young son. Sandra takes a job at Canberra's Department of Labor Relations, where she oversees a report on discriminatory wage practices against home-based workers. Her boss, the cool and reserved Rae Evans, has been suspected of siphoning off department money by illegally adjusting a large grant given to a bogus company. Convinced that Evans has been framed, Sandra devotes herself to quietly investigating the case. Readers will applaud as she comes into her own, aided by a gregarious and eccentric co-worker, Ivan Semyonov, who soon becomes her lover. Though there are a lot of interesting technical details about computer hacking and fraud, the sluggish, murder-free plot may frustrate some American mystery readers. Another weak point is a largely unexplored plot strand involving Rae and Sandra's now-deceased mother. Still, to quote from Ken Bruen's blurb, Sandra is \"a terrific creation and achingly real.\"Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A sexy, entertaining read\nrecommended for fans of chic-lit and romance. (5 stars).Stacy Decker, Shelfari  \"Great dialogue.\"  A Year of Being Meis the first book I've read from\nthis author Whitney Wellcroft, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I\nliked it!  The dialogue and interaction between the\ncharacters was natural and kept the book moving along at a very fast pace.  There\nwere some really steamy scenes that even though were pretty graphic, but it wasn't gratuitous. Looking forward to reading more from this author\nsoon! (4 stars).Karen Matthews; Librarything \"Lighthearted and fun.\"   I read the first 60% in one sitting .  I was never really sure what\nwould happen next... a sign of a good writer! The lighthearted tone helps to\ncarry the story forward and balance out the more intense and deeper conflicts. An\nenjoyable novel that I'd recommend to others.

Eleven chapters from leading researchers describe innovative methods from comparative psychology, ethology, and behavioral biology, which are combined to create a more comprehensive picture of the behavior ofCanis familiaristhan ever before.Each of the book’s three parts highlights one of the perspectives relevant to providing a full understanding of the dog. Part I covers the perceptual abilities of dogs and the effect of interbreeding. Part II includes observational and experimental results from studies of social cognition – such as learning and social referencing – and physical cognition in canids, while Part III summarizes the work in the field to date, reviewing various conceptual and methodological approaches, and testing anthropomorphisms with regard to dogs. The final chapter discusses the practical application of behavioral and cognitive results to promote animal welfare.This volume reflects a modern shift in science toward considering and studying domestic dogs for their own sake, not only insofar as they reflect back on human beings.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Just prior to the performance, Stacie visits an elderly Indian healer; as the show begins, rifle shots are fired, Stacie falls unconscious--and awakes to find herself in 1872 living the life of Anastasia. She has been found by the dark, handsome Joseph Muldoon. Half Indian and half Irish, he has some lessons in love to teach the young widow whose own marriage had been without passion. Stacie's efforts to leave her great-grandmother's life and reenter her own are complicated by her growing feelings for Joseph. Another aged Indian shaman advises her: \"You will find your way back to your time . . . only after you learn something here. Then you must go through a tunnel if you are to get back.\" The triteness of Bond's ( Deep Purple ) writing and the rather improbable plot complications--such as Stacie's marriage to her own great-grandfather--are balanced by the tenderness of Stacie and Joseph's love.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 6, "rating_average": 4.5, "rating_total": 27.0}
