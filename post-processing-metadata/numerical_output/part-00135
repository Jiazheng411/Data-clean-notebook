Building on these  foundations, Part II of the book considers the question that dominated theology-and-science debates during the 1990s: \"How we may conceive of divine agency in a  way that respects the integrity of the scientific account of the process of the  physical world and which also does justice to the religious intuition and  experience of God's providential interaction within history?\" Finally, Part III  provides Polkinghorne's assessment of the entire English tradition of thinking  about theology and science as well as his opinions regarding the work of his  eminent colleagues in the field. Polkinghorne's lapidary English prose polishes  his insights to a fine luster; this is not the kind of plain talking you'll find  in Richard Feynmann. But the reader's patience is rewarded.Faith, Science &  Understandingis a short book that expertly surveys a long history--an  excellent orientation to a complex and important set of questions.--Michael  Joseph Gross", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Through the open, gilded double doors she could see a throng of guests milling about the foyer, dressed in sparkling gowns and tailored tuxedos. Waiters carried trays of mouthwatering hors d'oeuvres and champagne in delicate crystal flutes. From the ballroom she could hear the orchestra—the one she herself had chosen—playing a waltz. She could just imagine the couples dancing, swirling across the floor, so graceful and light they looked as though they hovered an inch above ground.Everything in her wanted to turn around and run, but she’d come this far. She had to see this through.Gathering her courage, she approached the guard posted at the door and handed him her invitation. Normally palace employees were strictly forbidden from attending royal parties, but this was the gala celebrating Morgan Isle's five hundredth anniversary. The party of the century. And because she held one of the highest positions—the queen's personal assis-tant—her name had been included on the guest list.Her married name, that is. She didn't want people to recognize her. It was silly, but just for tonight, she wanted to feel as if she was one of them. The beautiful people. She certainly looked the part.The golden-blond hair that she normally kept pinned back and fastened primly at the base of her neck now tumbled in loose tendrils across her shoulders and down her back. She'd ditched her glasses for contacts. And she'd abandoned her usual shapeless, dull—but proper—business suit for the formfitting, shimmering gold, Carlos Miele gown she had rented.At the risk of sounding arrogant, she looked damn good.The guard compared the name on the invitation to his list then motioned her through without a second glance.As Lizzy stepped through the door into the foyer, one by one heads began to turn her way until what must have been a hundred pairs of curious eyes fixed right on her.Don't get too excited, she told herself. They're only looking because they don't know who you are.But she couldn't help noticing some of those looks, particularly the male ones, conveyed more appreciation than curiosity.Head held high, she made her way through the crowd to the ballroom, nodding graciously and returning polite greetings with people she'd only read about in the papers or seen on television. Heads of state, Hollywood film stars and business moguls.She was way out of her league. The value of the jewelry alone would probably feed an entire Third World country for a year. She hadn't even made it out of the foyer and she was a nervous wreck.Lizzy, you have just as much right to be here as anyone else.She swiped a glass of champagne from a passing waiter and took a generous swallow, the bubbles tickling her nose. She was only a few steps from the ballroom doors.Just do it, walk in,her conscience taunted. So she took a deep breath and forced her feet to propel her forward.Stepping through the doors and into the ballroom was like entering some ethereal, fairy-tale fantasyland where everything sparkled and shimmered. Handsome couples swished across the dance floor while others congregated in small groups, sipping their champagne and chatting, nibbling on decadent treats.It was just as she had imagined. And for an instant she felt swept away.\"Excuse me,\" a male voice said from behind her, and the first thing that struck her was the very distinct American accent.Taking another fortifying sip of her champagne, she turned and nearly spit it right back out.Not only was he American, he was the Prince of Morgan Isle. Illegitimate half brother to the king. Half brother-in-law to the queen, Lizzy's boss.Georgeous, rich, undeniably arrogant but charming to a fault. Of all the men who could have approached her, the one who was by far the most off limits, did.\"I don't believe we've met,\" he said.She thought he was toying with her, then she realized, by the look on his handsome, chiseled face and the curiosity in his charcoal-gray eyes, he honestly had no idea who she was. And why would he? The few times he had passed her in the halls of the palace, he hadn't given her more than a fleeting glance. And why would he? She was an employee.\"I don't believe we have,\" she said.He offered his hand. \"Ethan Rafferty.\"When she took it, instead of shaking her hand, he bent at the waist and brushed a gentle, and dare she say seductive, kiss across the top. No big surprise there. She didn't know a lot about the prince, only that he was a confirmed bachelor and a shameless womanizer. She had overheard the queen countless times commenting on the rather scandalous state of his very public personal life. She had also heard the king complain of Ethan's lack of respect for their royal customs and policies. Which would explain why Ethan was dressed in a tux and not the royal uniform. The dark hair was slicked back away from his face. A face that bore an uncanny resemblance to his brother's.Ethan's recent acceptance into the royal fold, and his new business partnership with the family, was all anyone at the palace talked about these days.Though she couldn't deny that seeing him like this, watching the way his eyes raked over her, was the tiniest bit thrilling. He was the epitome of male perfection, and he smelled absolutely delicious. Just as a prince and a multimillionaire should, she supposed.Her ex-husband had been gorgeous, too, and smelled just as nice, though he was lacking the millions of dollars or the motivation to earn even a fraction of that. And like the prince he was also an arrogant, womanizing, philandering dolt.But because Ethanwasroyalty, she curtsied and replied, \"It's a pleasure, Your Highness.\"He actually cringed. \"I'm not much into titles. I prefer just Ethan.\"She was pretty sure that if he knew who she really was, he wouldn't be so gracious. And while this had been kind of fun, it was time to move on. Find a guest who wasn't quite so far out of her league. And against policy. Palace employees were strictly forbidden from intimate relationships with the royal family.\"Well, it was nice to meet you.\" She nodded and curtsied—force of habit—then turned and headed in the opposite direction.\"I didn't catch your name,\" Ethan said from behind her, and her heart sank.Bugger. Couldn't the man take a hint? She set her empty glass on a passing waiter's tray and grabbed a fresh drink. \"That's because I didn't tell you my name.\" She tossed the quip back over her shoulder.\"And why is that?\" he asked, right beside her now.She took a long swallow for strength. A smart person was not rude to royalty. Even though the last documented beheading had been well over two hundred years ago.Of course, he had no idea who she was, so really, what did she have to lose? And who knew, maybe it was time someone put Mr. Wonderful in his place.\"Because you're not my type,\" she told him, and he had the gall to laugh.\"You're a liar.\"She stopped so abruptly the contents of her glass sloshed over and dripped onto her fingers. He stopped, too. \"I beg your pardon?\"\"Look at me,\" he said, spreading his arms. \"What's not to love?\"She couldn't tell if he was joking or actually had such a high opinion of himself. Could he honestly bethatarrogant? \"I have to know, does that pathetic excuse for a pickup line actually work?\"He grinned, a sexy, playful smile that made her heart flutter. \"I'll let you know in a minute.\"He was adorable, and he knew it. And she knew, before she opened her mouth, that telling him her name was a very bad idea. But maybe if she did, he would lose interest and leave her alone.\"Lizzy,\" she told him, since everyone at work knew her strictly as Elizabeth. And instead of Pryce, the name she had switched back to before the ink was dry on the divorce papers, she used her married name. \"Lizzy Sinclaire.\"\"Would you do me the honor of a dance, Ms. Sinclaire?\"Because she so hated that name and everything it stood for, she told him, \"I prefer Lizzy.\"\"All right, Lizzy.\"\"And no, I won't dance with you. Because as I said, you're not my type.\"Rather than be insulted, or discouraged, his grin widened. \"I'm not asking for your hand in marriage. Just a dance. Unless…\" His brow wrinkled. \"Oh, I see. You don't know how to dance, do you?\"Oh, please, did he really think she would fall for his pathetic attempt at reverse psychology?The truth was, she and her ex had taken ballroom dance classes several years ago. Only later had she learned that he'd been the one giving personal lessons to the instructor.\"You've found me out,\" she told him. \"Now, if you would please excuse me.\" She spared him one last dismissive nod then turned and walked back in the direction of the foyer, chanting to herself,Please don't let him follow me. Please don't let him follow me.\"I could teach you,\" she heard him say, and cursed under her breath. He was right back beside her, matching her step for step.\"I might step on your foot and scuff your shoe,\" she said.He shrugged. \"It's been stepped on before.\"She stopped again and turned to him. \"Why is it so important you dance with a woman who has no desire to dance with you?\"He flashed her that grin again, and she swore she could feel it all the way through to her bones. \"Because the woman in question is the most captivating in the room.\"Oh, man, was he good. He almost had her believing he was sincere. Ethan's words could have melted her into a puddle. Which she was sure was exactly his intention. Men like him didn't see women as people. They were conquests. A notch in the bedpost, so to speak.She drained the last of her second glass. \"I just don't think it would be a good idea.\"Ethan took her empty glass and set it on the tray of the waiter who magically appeared at his side. \"Please, one dance.\"She didn't think a man like him used the wordplease.And there w...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

They kidnap a suspected terrorist, code-named SNAKE, to prevent a bomb from going off at school. Bumbling doesn't begin to describe the ineptitude and neediness of this sorry gaggle of disaffected misfits who liberally sprinkle their dialogue with racist and misogynist epithets throughout the repetitive and convoluted plotline. Will Jon complete his initiation into the Brotherhood by complying with Jeremiah's order to hang SNAKE, aka Padma Laxsmi, a beautiful and terrified classmate, against whom Jeremiah seems to harbor a personal grudge? Or will Jon succumb to his desire for SNAKE and somehow help her escape? From the dead body of an elderly woman festering near their hideaway to the adolescent Hebethian \"scriptures\" and rules Jeremiah spouts to control his small flock, this is a putrid tale, albeit in keeping with various nutcase religious personality cults throughout time and from around the world. Unfortunately, the plot has too many holes. Significant details, such as Jon having twice had access to weapons that he could have used to free Padma, are dropped without explanation. Absurdities, such as killing for peace, are hammered home without subtlety, but relationships among the lads, between Jon and his estranged father, his mother, and Padma are unresolved, leaving a story that is raw and muddled.—Joel Shoemaker, Southeast Junior High School, Iowa City, IACopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Which was odd, because he admired, respected, and yes, loved the man. And he would never do it, since at his own six-foot-one he towered over the slighter man.\"He's right, dear,\" Gwen Waldron said quietly, agreeing with her husband. She usually did. Not that she wasn't more than capable of standing up for herself if she truly disagreed; it was just that the forty-years'-married couple rarely differed in opinion.\"Just like that?\"Gabe's voice came out low and harsh, which startled him. Shouldn't he be over it by now? They all—meaning every well-intentioned person who knew what had happened—told him it was a process that was individual, that everyone had to do it at their own pace and in their own way. But despite the platitude, he was fairly certain most of them would expect his world to have gone on by now.\"Do you think we like this any more than you do?\"For the first time the undertone of emotion broke through in Earl Waldron's voice. Somehow that made the tightness in Gabe's gut ease a little.\"But it's been eight years.\" Gwen put her hand on his arm then, a touch he treasured because of who she was and hated because of who she wasn't. \"You know she'd have been in touch, no matter what happened, if she could.\"He supposed the worst part of what he was feeling was the knowledge, somewhere buried deep, that they were right. He fought to keep it buried, but with both of them digging at it now, he wasn't sure he could. The simple fact was, his wife was gone, vanished so completely that not having found a body didn't make it any less likely she was dead.\"We're not asking for a decision here and now. Just promise you'll consider it,\" Earl said. \"Really consider it, son. We need to move on. And so do you.\"\"All right.\" He owed them that much, and he couldn't help it if the words came out a little sharp.He stood there on the deck of the hundred-and-forty-nine foot boat that was his world these days and watched them walk down the gangplank. They'd been a huge part of his life for so long—accepting him as the son they'd never had and still treating him that way, even though the link between them was gone— that he couldn't imagine going on without them.But then, he'd gone on with an even bigger piece missing. Not well, or with any particular grace, but he had gone on.\"Everything all right?\"The soft inquiry came from behind him, and Gabe turned to look at his friend and boss, Joshua Redstone, who was also the designer and builder of this dream ship. Gabe had been in the depths of the darkest hole when Josh had offered him the job of heading up his boat-building enterprise. And when the desk-oriented job had begun to pall a couple of years ago, Josh had seemed to sense it. He'd given Gabe the chance to be at sea again, with the captaincy of this lovely vessel, the latest and biggest to bear the Redstone name.It was to be, Josh had told him, the literal flagship of Redstone, not to be sold as others had been, but to be kept for the use of the Redstone family. From division managers to file clerks, anybody who worked for Redstone, Incorporated and had the need would have access to the boat.And Gabe had been among the first to learn exactly what Josh meant; the first weeklong cruise he'd captained had been for the concierge of one of the Redstone Resorts, whose husband had died in a traffic accident. She was but one of thousands of employees, and at a relatively low level on the Redstone chain, but Josh, as he always did, had heard about the death and had offered the boat to the entire family.\"Gabe?\"He snapped out of the memory as Josh gently prodded. \"I…I'm not sure.\"\"Were they your in-laws?\" Josh's drawl was barely discernable, telling Gabe how carefully he was picking his words. \"Hope's parents?\"\"Yes.\"\"Tough,\" Josh said.Gabe turned to look at his boss then. \"Yes,\" he agreed.\"They made a special trip out here to see you?\"Gabe nodded. And then, because no one knew better exactly how he felt, he let it out.\"They want my wife declared dead.\"Josh was silent for a long moment. If it had been anyone else, Gabe might have assumed he had nothing to say, but the head of Redstone, Inc., was never one to speak lightly or without thought. That characteristic delay—and the drawl—gave some, to their detriment, the idea he was slow or lazy. They inevitably spent time afterward musing on the cost of their assumptions.\"They want their daughter declared dead?\" Josh finally said, quietly.And there, with the insight typical of him, Josh reminded him gently that their loss was as great as his. Greater, perhaps; they'd had Hope Waldron for twenty-nine years, he for only six of those.\"I know, I know.\" Gabe shoved a hand through his dark hair, realizing only after he'd done it that he'd still, after all this time, raised both hands as if he were wearing his officer's combination cap, to be removed before the gesture and resettled after precisely an inch and a half above his eyebrows, according to navy regs.\"Old habits die hard,\" Josh observed mildly, and Gabe knew he'd caught the lapse. \"Old thoughts sometimes die harder.\"\"How long did it take you?\"The question escaped him before he could block it. Not for anything, even to ease his own pain, would he intentionally call up bad memories for this man he admired, respected, even loved, as did most who worked for him. Josh Redstone had built an empire that spanned the globe, employed thousands, and Gabe would be willing to bet there wasn't one of them who wouldn't walk into hell for the man. In part because they knew he'd do it for them—and had.\"I'm sorry,\" Gabe began, but Josh waved him to silence.\"How long did it take me to accept that she was gone?\" Josh asked. \"In my head, I knew it right away. But then, she died in my arms. I felt her go.\"Gabe's breath caught. He hadn't known that. He'd known Elizabeth Redstone had died of cancer several years ago, known that Josh had been alone ever since, knew the common wisdom at Redstone was that she'd been his soul mate and he would never even try to replace her. But Gabe had never really thought about the details of it. Hope, he thought, would likely have had the whole story within minutes of meeting the man; she had always been good at getting people to open up.An odd smile curved Josh's mouth, lifting it at one corner in an expression of ironic sadness. \"I never thought of that as a particular advantage before, other than being with her until the end. But from your view, it is, isn't it? At least I knew, without doubt.\"Gabe couldn't deny that, and instead fastened on Josh's answer to his question. He repeated his boss's words back. \"You said you knew it in your head.\"Josh's mouth quirked, and the steady gray eyes closed for a moment. Then he opened them and looked at Gabe. \"You always were detail oriented.\"\"Comes from years of dealing with politically oriented navy brass,\" Gabe answered. \"Most of the time what they didn't say was more important than what they did.\"\"I'm sure,\" Josh agreed. And then, after a moment, answered what Gabe hadn't really asked. \"I'm not sure my heart, my gut, have accepted it yet. I know, logically, that it's crazy after all these years, but I still catch myself expecting to hear her voice, or thinking that she's just in the next room….\"Gabe smothered a sigh. That was not what he'd wanted to hear. He'd wanted to hear that it was over, sealed away in some silent, impenetrable place in Josh's mind, never bothering him, never surfacing unless he wanted it to. If Joshua Redstone, one of the strongest—and strongest-minded—men he'd ever met, couldn't get past this, what hope did he have?\"What brought this on now, after all this time?\" Josh asked.\"The U.S. Postal Service,\" Gabe said wryly.Josh blinked. \"The Postal Service?\"\"They just delivered a postcard to Hope's best friend. From Hope, mailed right before she disappeared. It really upset them.\"Josh let out a low whistle. \"Ouch. Eight years?\"To his own surprise, Gabe had to stifle a chuckle. Josh, he knew, would never tolerate that kind of thing. Redstone wasn't consistently in the top five highest-rated places to work because it was easy. It was Josh himself, and his reputation, that made a Redstone job among the most coveted. He hired the best, let them do what they did best, paid them well, treated them all with fairness, and mostly stayed out of their way. But above all he let them know that if they needed it, the full power of the Redstone empire was behind them.\"Why don't you head for open water?\" Josh said.Gabe drew back slightly. \"What?\"Josh shrugged. \"Take her out. Clear your head.\"Only Josh Redstone would make an offer like that, to take a hundred-and-forty-nine-foot luxury yacht, complete with a media room and helipad, out for a spin as if it were a new car rather than the latest, and as yet unnamed, design from his fertile and incredible mind.\"Thank you,\" Gabe said automatically, \"but—\"\"You saying you don't do your best thinking at sea?\"Gabe's mouth quirked. \"You can take the boy out of the navy, but you can't take the navy out of the boy?\"Josh grinned. \"Something like that.\"Neither of them mentioned that in Gabe's case, he hadn't been taken out of the navy, he'd quit. Gabe knew he'd had no choice, and Josh, when he'd learned the full story of what had driven a man who'd once chosen the navy as his career to leave, had answered in the best possible way: he'd offered Gabe a way out that didn't require him to leave his love of ships and the water behind.\"I've got to head back to my office,\" Josh said, and Gabe knew the reluctance he heard in his boss's voice was real. Josh was not an office-bound executive, even at Redstone Headquarters, which was as much a paragon of comfort and thoughtful design as this boat was.\"Take her out,\" he said again. \"Put all this on the back burner, focus on something else for a while. It'll help you work through it, where chewing on it up front won't.\"Gabe smile...", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Set in 1865, McKernan's (Shackleton's Stowaway) gripping novel follows the westward journey of 16-year-old Aiden, with his younger sister, Maddie, from their late parents' farm in Kansas. Harsh conditions and a devastating fire have prompted the exodus of most of the townsfolk,  and the siblings have nearly starved to death when the story begins. New opportunity comes in the form of a wagon train and its guide, who offers Aiden a chance to pay off the cost of his and Maddie's trip with labor at a logging camp. Traveling across the country and deep into Aiden's experiences of despair and hope reborn, McKernan's supple prose (a bowl of jam shimmers in the sun like a pot of melted rubies) immerses readers in a sometimes brutal history; a story line about the threat to Indians from smallpox (the devil's paintbox) and the policy of denying them vaccines, builds to a powerful conclusion. Flawless attention to detail and steady pacing keep readers fully engaged. While the Indians Aiden meets may come off idealized, the other characters are fully fledged. Readers will be riveted.

The more interesting is the first person account of 85-year-old matriarch Ruth Mondschein, as told to a dying young man in the Christopher Street AIDS Hospice, to which Ruth treks most days from her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Ruth hails from an upper-middle-class Jewish household in Vienna, where at a young age she falls into a disastrous affair with a wealthy gentile, then a stable marriage to the gay doctor who treats her father. The couple are eventually taken from a hospital where they are working in the Austrian Alps and deported to a Nazi concentration camp in Czechoslovakia (called, fictitiously, Pribor), where Ruth's baby, Clara, is miraculously and safely delivered. Alternately, teenaged Deborah Gelb tells of growing up in Englewood, N.J., around a mother (Clara) who suffers severe fits of debilitating depression, probably stemming from her traumatic camp birth. Deborah's voice is chatty and na‹ve, and her narrative is full of schoolgirl details. She tries to please her mother, but tends to awaken painful memories instead, as when mother and daughter flirt with the same lesbian painter, Marisol, on a trip to Madrid. In the end, Clara's so-called melancholia, depicted second-hand, remains incomprehensible to the family and to the reader. Ruth's tale, in contrast, is harrowing, and her voice luminously straightforward. Although its outcome is known from the start-allowing for little suspense-the novel is rich in detail and insight.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A didactic lesson thinly disguised as a story. Set in the wildlife sanctuary of Ranthambhore in India, the book's main protagonist is a hot-tempered young tiger named Mallika. After losing her prey because of her hotheadedness, her mother attempts to teach Mallika to manage her anger by making better behavior choices. After several mishaps, she controls her emotions and extricates herself from a tight spot, thereby learning her lesson. The detailed watercolor illustrations fill the oversized pages with warm oranges, yellows, reds, and lush greens, depicting the sanctuary with its picturesque ruins and exotic wildlife. The endpapers offer information on India, the sanctuary, and its flora and fauna. The text, however, is preachy and humorless. A page at the end presents strategies for parents and educators to help youngsters deal with their tempers. The subject is treated with a lighter touch in Marjorie Sharmat's Attila the Angry (Holiday, 1985) and Norma Simon's I Was So Mad (Albert Whitman, 1974).?Judith Constantinides, East Baton Rouge Parish Main Library, LACopyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 8, "rating_average": 4.375, "rating_total": 35.0}

While learning his craft and churning out copy to pay the rent, Silverberg imitated the styles of well-known writers, with such stories as \"The Songs of Summer,\" which borrows the technique of multiple viewpoints from William Faulkner to tell a first contact tale, and \"The Silent Colony,\" which seeks to replicate Robert Sheckley's clarity. Silverberg also wrote stories to match cover art, a literary exercise that resulted in \"Why?\" and in the often-anthologized \"Sunrise on Mercury.\" Though none of his best-known or award-winning stories are included, these selections, which Silverberg deems the best of his early era, illustrate his apprenticeship and presage the Grand Master he has become.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He was a brother of noted mural painter Gilbert White. White's books were popular at a time when America was losing its vanishing wilderness. He was a keen observer of the beauties of nature and human nature, yet could render them in a plain-spoken style. Based on his own experience, whether writing camping journals or Westerns, he included pithy and fun details about cabin-building, canoeing, logging, gold-hunting, and guns and fishing and hunting. He also interviewed people who had been involved in the fur trade, the California gold rush and other pioneers which provided him with details that give his novels verisimilitude. He salted in humor and sympathy for colorful characters such as canny Indian guides and \"greenhorn\" campers who carried too much gear. White also illustrated some of his books with his own photographs, while some of his other books, were illustrated by artists, such as the American Western painter Fernand Lungren for \"The Mountains\" and \"Camp and Trail\". Theodore Roosevelt wrote that White was \"the best man with both pistol and rifle who ever shot\" at Roosevelt's rifle range at Sagamore Hill.", "related": ["B00BACDMDO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Nonfiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The words available to describe the novel sequence are all in some ways misleading.What can I say about the novels that is not misleading? I can say that I've tried to create characters you can live with as they grow and develop; and I've tried to create an imaginary world for them to inhabit that will be memorable for the reader.

In 1944, after both his parents had passed away, 12 year-old Chinmoy entered the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, a spiritual community near Pondicherry in South India. Here he spent the next 20 years in spiritual practice - including long hours of meditation, practising athletics, writing poetry, essays and spiritual songs.In his early teens, Chinmoy had many profound inner experiences, and in subsequent years achieved very advanced states of meditation. In 1964, he moved to New York City to share his inner wealth with sincere seekers in the West.Sri Chinmoy sees aspiration - the heart's ceaseless yearning for ever higher and deeper realities - as the spiritual force behind all great advances in religion, culture, sports and science. By living in the heart and aspiring for continual self-transcendence, men and women can bring forward the best in themselves and find their path to true satisfaction. In his words:\"Our goal is to go from bright to brighter to brightest, from high to higher to highest. And even in the highest, there is no end to our progress, for God Himself is inside each of us and God at every moment is transcending His own Reality.\"Sri Chinmoy serves as spiritual guide to students in some 60 countries around the world, encouraging a balanced lifestyle that incorporates the inner disciplines of prayer and meditation with the dynamism of contemporary life.Sri Chinmoy's life was an expression of boundless creativity. His vast output spans the domains of music, poetry, painting, literature and sports. His contributions in each of these fields have been striking and far-reaching.Sri Chinmoy frequently travelled throughout the world to offer free concerts, lectures and public meditations, to meet with his students, and to meet and discuss spirituality with world and community leaders. Sri Chinmoy did not charge a fee for his spiritual guidance, concerts, lectures and public meditations.Sri Chinmoy entered Mahasamadhi - the mystic process through which spiritual Masters leave the body, on the morning of 11 October 2007.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It is also the story\n of Jack Ross and his struggle to save his marriage, save his struggling\n partnership and most of all, save his idealism and belief in justice\nafter working too long in a legal system he doesn't believe in anymore. Rasley has created a very likable and credible character in Jack\nRoss, who fights for the underdog while actually being something\n of an underdog himself. Jack's most redeeming qualities are his\nstrength and determination, something nurtured during years of high\nschool athletics, and his loyalty, demonstrated by his walking away from\n the largest and most prestigious law firm in the state in support of\nhis best friend... There is a compelling sub-plot - Jack's\nthreatened marriage - which is woven alongside the lawsuit and dispersed\n in timely increments that complement the main thread of the novel. The\npolitics, greed, and ruthlessness of those in the top tiers of society\nin Indianapolis ring true. The strengths and frailties of the\n characters are subtly but effectively portrayed and the portrait of our\n legal system in action is vividly rendered. I eagerly await the next one by Jeff Rasley.\"This gripping legal thriller offers an insight into the workings of the legal\nprofession while abounding in action, class action, intrigue, and passion. ... I enjoyed the setting and intimate details of life in Indianapolis, and I\nespecially enjoyed getting an insider's look at the legal system including a\nlawyer's thought processes and strategies.\" examinor.com examiner.com/review/review-of-false-prophet-a-legal-thriller-by-jeff-rasley", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It and the others were written in part as a self-indulgent creative exercise rather than with strong ideas of getting them published. The months spent at the keyboard while allowing the imagination to create its own worlds and characters were most enjoyable. The bonus came when many friends who read my stories gave a very positive feedback and encouraged me to aim for publishing. All four are now available as ebooks on Amazon at low cost.The main genre of three of my novels, Gambling Gods, The Last Resort and The Phlopplings, are Comedy with a touch of Si fi thrown in. My fourth book, Guardian Aliens, is a serious plausible Si-Fi adventure.Brian Towers", "related": [], "rank": 2590474, "title": "GAMBLING GODS", "author": "Brian Towers", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I wrote my first proper story about a huge tsunami hitting my primary school (ahead of my time, I know!), which was imaginative given that we lived 30 miles inland. I killed off the headmaster's daughter at the end, while saving family and friends, which of course led to my first bad review. I wrote my first novel in my late twenties - a rites of passage type of thing - and it was terrible. After that I wrote the opening to a Chandleresque detective story transposed to Northern England but gave up after seven chapters. Then I got married, had a family and didn't write another creative word for twelve years. My return to writing was a story for my children - 'Warwick The Wanderer and the Battle of the Bands' - and this will soon be my second book published through Amazon. After another lean period, I went back to my detective story, re-wrote the opening, got some invaluable feedback from the Authonomy community and spent a year completing the full manuscript. And so it came to pass that 'Weekend in Weighton' was finally published. Hope you enjoy it. Oh, one more thing, it's been emotional, Snapperheads!

Lexi's unexpected run-in with an American spy rekindles the passion they shared long ago; Lexi's childhood friend Kathleen discovers a devastating secret about her own past; and John begins to understand himself and his feelings. The dramatic depictions of war-torn locales are undermined by Chambers's clumsy handling of historically accurate racism (The Australian soldiers referred affectionately to their New Guinea native allies as Fuzzy Wuzzys because of their tight crimped curly hair), and her impressive research fails to rescue the story from lackluster characters and absurd twists of fate.(Oct.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

No other work brings together so comprehensively and so adroitly the rapidly growing evidence on the many, often surprising, ways that perception of the body interacts with and affects a wide range of perceptual, cognitive, and motor activities. Many of the major advances in this field have been made by the contributors to this book. Their skill, coupled with the editors' deft organization of the volume as a whole, leaves one confident that this work will remain close at hand for many generations to come.\" --David A. Rosenbaum, Distinguished Professor of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University\"At one time, psychology considered information processing as an abstract process, defined without regard to the physical characteristics of people. A new, more powerful way of considering interactions with the world starts with the human body, and interprets cognitive and perceptual processes as interactions of the body with its environment. Here the world's leading experts in this new way of doing perceptual psychology assemble an international and interdisciplinary team to explain body-based perception at every level, from the body sense itself to intention and action in a body-based perspective. The volume is destined to become the 'bible' of body-based perception for the next generation of perceptual psychologists and neuroscientists.\" --Bruce Bridgeman, Professor of Psychology and Psychobiology, University of California, Santa CruzKnoblich and colleagues have artfully organized a collection of wonderfully written chapters that manages to contiguously span multi-sensory integration, self-perception, biological motion, imitation, action, and intention--all in the service of elucidating how the human mind perceives its own and others' bodies. With a delicate balance of cognitive and ecological psychology, neuropsychology, neurophysiology, and cognitive neuroscience, the book documents the privileged role of the human body in human perception and the special relationship between perception of one's own body and perception of other human bodies. In the burgeoning theoretical frameworks of body perception, of embodied cognition, and of social cognitive neuroscience, this generous volume will serve as a cornucopian resource for many years to come.\" --Michael Spivey, Associate Professor of Psychology, Cornell University\"Of all our everyday activities, surely none can be more important than knowing about people, ourselves included. Indeed, this is why the nascent field of social neuroscience is burgeoning, and it's why this book is important and timely. By integrating multiple research perspectives on body perception, these chapters--contributed by leaders in the field--provide a comprehensive overview of work on the cognitive and neuronal bases of human body perception, including self-awareness. Anyone already in the field will greatly appreciate the synthesis, and those just discovering the field will become hooked when they read this book.\" --Randolph Blake, Centennial Professor of Psychology, Vanderbilt University\"This volume offers some of the keys that will eventually release us fromt eh Cartesian prison of spirits, which Descartes bestowed on us some 360 years ago.\"--PsycCRITIQUES", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Martinez examines the politics of race relations in the nineteenth century, from Lincoln’s struggles with his personal conscience and with the Radical Republicans to economic, social, and political factors that contributed to unfulfilled promises of Reconstruction and the political atmosphere that resulted in severe injustices codified into law. Martinez focuses on the Radical Republicans, particularly Thaddeus Stevens, Charles Sumner, and Benjamin Wade, and a host of fiery figures who fomented the issue of racial justice, including William Lloyd Garrison, John Brown, Wendell Phillips, and Frederick Douglass. This is a compelling look at the heat and vituperation still evident in contemporary politics, with historical particularities of the nineteenth century, and the underlying issues of race that resonate today. Photos and illustrations, including political cartoons, offer a feel for the political sensibilities of the time.(Booklist)In this unflinching portrait, personalities come alive; the policies, philosophies, visions, aspirations, and foibles of political leaders provide high drama as well as compelling history. This book is an important contribution to our understanding of the history of politics during a critical half century of changing race relations.(Orville Vernon Burton, Burroughs Chair of Southern History, Coastal Carolina University, author of The Age of Lincoln)J. Michael Martinez, inComing for to Carry Me Home, offers a sweeping yet incisive history of the politics of race in the tumultuous years between the rise of abolitionism and the advent of Jim Crow. The strength of Martinez’s narrative is the rich mixture of ways the author invites readers to feel the tensions and experience the ambiguities of known and unknown Americans who struggle with the nation’s most enduring moral dilemma.(Ronald C. White Jr., author of A. Lincoln: A Biography)InComing for to Carry Me Home: Race in America from Abolitionism to Jim Crow, J. Michael Martinez claims that \"the story of Abraham Lincoln and the Radical Republicans could be understood and appreciated only in the broader context of nineteenth-century race relations.\" Martinez has written a very nice examination of how the issue of race influenced and directed politicians, antislavery advocates, and policy makers from the years before the war through the end of Reconstruction.(The Journal of Southern History)", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In our culture, the idea of sacred prostitution seems so strange that it piqued my curiosity. After reading and ruminating about what the lives of such women might have been like, the seeds for my novellaSeventh Sanctuarysprouted. For a couple years, I wasn't sure where the story was going -- if anywhere. Then a second idea, inspired by myth, germinated into sort of a subplot for the first. Suddenly, the book erupted into being.I'm not sure how to classifySeventh Sanctuary. The story is in many ways about the spirituality of sex, and there is quite a bit of sex in the novella, but I wouldn't call it erotica. The depth of emotions of the characters makes it more romantic or possibly even literary. And the goddess Inanna is important to all of the main characters, so you might say that she is the inspiration for the story. For me, ancient goddesses are a source of wonder, nostalgia, grief and inspiration. Hopefully, that awe comes through in the book.For more info and sample chapters for all of my books, please stop by my blog at jenmalin.com.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

At age ten, while living in Springfield, Mass, She discovered her love for ‘poetry’ while in 5th grade after being challenged to write about any topic. She happily avenged the request, writing her first poem entitled ‘Hot Sauce.’ She’d go on to join various Drama Clubs and multiple Writers’ workshops in High school, fueling her flame to create ideas for screen plays and one-woman shows.  In 1998, while at a Jacksonville, FL., lounge and thriving with an abundance of raw creativity, Dawn Nicole discovered a new way to bring her words to life, Spoken Word Poetry. Joining forces with a local performance troop enabled her to transform her words, get her voice heard and provided an outlet of which, she could channel her creative energy.  Although she became notably known for her poetic flare, after later moving to Atlanta, GA., Dawn Nicole, formerly Koffee, would never let go of her passion to write short stories and one-woman shows, only shared during public forums or to entertain family and friends at private gatherings. ‘The Velvet Whisper’ due for release in December 2011, will make her first ‘official’ published novel.", "related": [], "rank": 3943708, "title": "The Velvet Whisper", "author": "Dawn Nicole", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's a book of both charm and heartbreak... It is Shelly Reuben's tribute and the reader's pleasure.   Dorothy Salisbury Davis - Awarded Grandmaster, Mystery Writers of America", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

His parents were farmers, and his father was a small business owner, as well, in the construction industry. He is happily married, and often wonders what he would do without his wonderful wife, and has two sons; the older of which already shows a great talent in art that his father is immensely proud of. He is currently possessed of two Bachelor's degrees, and is working on his MA in Sociology, while simultaneously working on various writing projects, both solo and in conjunction with his friend and co-author of \"The Dragon's Passage\" series, Samir Abdel-Aziz. While his educational background has pointed his future towards a career in education and social research, his first love has always been literature. Whether it's a well-written dissertation on social theory or law, historical texts, or a myriad of different genres in fiction, he can be found with his nose buried in a book. Jeremiah's love of literature, and his dream of joining the ranks of those wonderful authors, is the driving force behind his work in creating worlds for readers to escape to, and enjoy. Samir Ali Abdel-Aziz was born July 6th, 1985, in Brooklyn, New York, but he spent most of his life in Huntington, WV. His mom always told him to write down all these crazy story ideas he had so it’s her fault you’re reading this now.  He is currently possessed of a Bachelor’s degree in Journalism and Master’s degree in English Creative Writing, all the while working on a number of writing projects, both solo and in conjunction with his friend and co-author of the “The Dragon’s Passage” series, Jeremiah Williamson.  Samir currently works as an adjunct professor of English at Marshall University and when he’s not scowling at his students, he’s got his nose stuck in a book or playing the occasion video game. His biggest ambition is to have his novels brought up in a college English class only for the professor to scoff, “That’s not literature!” His second great ambition is to be able to inspire the imagination of the next generation of fantasy readers the same way he was inspired and to promote a better world where you can read about monsters, dragons, goblins, and ogres, and not have to be talking about anything than what is written on the page.", "related": [], "rank": 4198531, "title": "In Honor and Blood eBook", "author": "Samir Abdel-Aziz", "category": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Whetton worked in the Operations office directly with Mr. Hughes and later became General Manager of the Desert Inn during most of the period it was owned by Hughes. James Leo Wadsworth, an attorney licensed in Nevada, was responsible for Hughes legal work on land and mining claims, and was involved in Nevada s transition from mob to corporate control, thus changing the face of the State. Hughes essentially bought the mob out and brought corporate control to Nevada. He joined the Romaine Street staff in 1953 in the communications group. He was also hired at Hughes request to handle an important personal project for Hughes concerning Hughes wife at the time, Jean Peters. Wilbur Thain, MD, a family physician, worked in operations and communications from 1948 1952, later returning as one of Hughes rotating physicians in 1972 until after his death in 1976. Dr. Thain was the doctor who pronounced Hughes death on a jet en route to Texas. Dr. Thain s personal journals detail medical and health aspects of the last three years of Hughes life. Ellie Pugmire was Hughes only personal secretary from the day she was hired until his death. She has recorded her memoir in wonderful detail to contribute to the staging of this book. You will find many of her writings interspersed throughout We Knew Howard Hughes, but her memoir, in its entirety, is also located in the Appendix. Gordon Bench s role is unique in that, in addition to working in the Operations Center, he was often called upon to work with Hughes on various sensitive and personal projects. For example, per Hughes instructions, Gordon purchased and delivered a $10,000 fur coat to Jean Peters.", "related": [], "rank": 1926416, "title": "We Knew Howard Hughes", "author": "Wilbur Thain", "category": "Biographies & Memoirs", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I decided to use Diamond as a voice for those who are growing up in Camden today. Many will leave and never come back. Many don't know the history of the city. Hopefully, readers will visualize and feel the pain of the old and young in the city, and why we can't turn our backs on the children in the city. I have fond memories of growing up in Camden. I also had role models. What the children are seeing on the front pages of the newspapers today is horrible. They need to see a better way of life. It's going to take a lot to happen for the city to come back.I talked to many residents over the years, especially those who were around during the sixties, and seventies.

He enlists the help of his trusty friends Ralph, the hypochondriac son of physicians, and Munch, a nose-picking, human garbage disposal. The cast of characters also includes the requisite archenemy, in this case, Mike McAlpine and fruity-smelling Stacy, whom Simon refers to as \"foul girl.\" She inspires Simon to form a band, much like the popular Funkee Boyz, in order to claim the show's grand prize. The fact that neither he nor his friends play instruments or are musical in any way is not considered. They soon begin practicing in Simon's backyard, only to be thwarted by Simon's crotchety old neighbor, Mrs. Annand, who throws rock-hard bran muffins at the boys to silence them. The text is sprinkled throughout with Simon's extraordinary vocabulary choices, which are highlighted and far above the comprehension level of the intended audience. A glossary is included to aid readers, but the sheer number of words makes using it an almost impossible task and certainly interrupts the flow of the story. Simon is supercilious and often downright rude. Munch's habit of putting anything and everything in his mouth is disgusting and often disconcerting. There is not much to recommend this title, which seems as doomed as the victims of Mrs. Annand's bran muffins.-Mary Beth Rassulo, Ridgefield Library, CTα(c) Copyright 2011.

They educated me regarding the problems gay people have regarding their rights. They also introduced me to gay movies and books. So many of the stories have such tragic endings, that I decided to write about gay men who love one another and how they are really no different from straight people. As to the name: About twenty-five years ago, I joined a group that recreates the Middle Ages. In that group, I am known as Alisaundre, a nickname of which is Alix. I do dying, spinning and weaving. When I set up my first email account, every combination of my legal name had been taken and I finally came up with alixtheweaver. I didn't want to embarass my children by using their surname on a gay novel. Thus A.(Alix) T.(The) Weaver.", "related": [], "rank": 1743518, "title": "The Boss's Son", "author": "A. T.

For me, that was The Killing Game. A true love story couched in suspense and drama, The Killing Game certainly kept me turning pages. One of the main reasons was its heroine, Allina.Allina is a female character we don't often see in writing today. She embodies the ultimate in femininity, with living by a code of ethics and a sense of morality that make her all the more alluring. And at the same time, she's incredibly brilliant and brave. She moves seamlessly through a man's world and with every step she takes she defines herself more as a woman. Allina, reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn, is the perfect counterpoint to Ives, head of the New York Division of the FBI, who falls madly in love with her. Her softness and vulnerability pitted against his iron will and determination to protect her at all costs, makes for a great read.The Killing Game is a wonderful love story and outstanding crime novel all in one. I also loved learning about the internal workings of the FBI. The only thing about reading this book is that now I'm dying to know what happens in Part II. Where is it?! --S. Sacks - Novel AficionadaThe Killing Game - Wow! What a dramatic look into the lives and loves of both the Mob and the FBI! People love reading about such topics (as even Allina knows from writing The Blood Negotiators) so this should captivate your audience. There were some really surprising twists (Agent Johnson's betrayal, Shepherd's reappearance, Fogherty...the list goes on!) Good work! --Ms. Dina - First EditWell, you have taken me on a veritable roller-coaster ride of exciting events and emotions. You have created a very well-planned, well-designed, and very well-written narrative. The evolving intrigue and sudden twists and turns completely grips the reader as curiosity mounts and tension builds. I read with much enjoyment and so will your future readers! --Dr. Marian - First EditThe Killing Game - Part One - The Blood Negotiators (The Killing Game Series) (Volume 1) by The Black Rose takes us into the New York division of the FBI. Ives, the Director, must investigate the woman that he has waited a lifetime to find because she wrote a novel that is more than accurate about an Italian crime boss. The FBI takes it upon themselves to recruit her help in getting into the organization of the Mob Boss and then the plan all falls to pieces. When that happens, Ives puts himself on the line for the one woman he loves.If you want action, adventure, a little mystery and a dash of a love story, then this is the right book for you. I think that The Black Rose is into something with The Killing Game and this makes a thrilling opener to the series. I am personally looking forward to reading the next book in the series. I started this book and had some trouble putting it down once I did; I couldn't guess when certain turns would happen in the action when reading this one, which I enjoyed. The book is well written with a flow to it that works for the story; the action is well paced throughout. One pitfall to these kinds of books is sometimes too much action at one point and not enough at others, but that doesn't happen with The Killing Game. I would recommend this book with two thumbs way up. --Kathryn Bennett for Readers' Favorite--Lit Amri for Readers' FavoriteIn order to uncover crime, the FBI will occasionally go undercover. After all, what better way is there to make someone talk than to befriend them and convince them that you re on their side? In Ives case, that means befriending the lovely Allina, author of The Blood Negotiators, a woman the FBI is positive knows the crime boss they re looking for. But Ives isn't happy just getting to know Allina; he wants to make her love him as he loves her, and that s where this story takes a turn from adventure and intrigue to romance and mystery. The Killing Game by The Black Rose will keep you breathless as you turn one page after the next.I was drawn in by the first few pages of this book. The relationship between Allina and Ives is electric and the way the two relate to each other just in those first pages is something that you can almost feel for yourself. I found myself wishing for a relationship like the two of them had and a man who would do anything to protect me, just like Ives. This relationship is definitely a wild ride and there s way more going on behind the scenes than anyone would ever know. I wanted to learn even more about these characters and that s why I ll be looking for the next book as soon as it comes out. The Killing Game is a book you re going to want to read and one where you ll be hanging onto every word.Samantha Rivera for Readers' Favorite.As the Director of the New York Division of the FBI, Ives Andrich is frustrated with the Bureau regarding his investigation of a novelist, Allina Kovar, whose manuscript titled Blood Negotiators is a bit too accurate about Vincent Luca, an Italian crime lord. The Bureau, against Ives' wishes, asks for her help in infiltrating Luca s inner organization. However, the Bureau s plan fails and Allina s life is in danger. Ives s frustration with the Bureau s incompetence reaches its limit. For the sake of the woman he loves, he will risk anything to save her. Written by The Black Rose, The Killing Game is a thrilling crime novel series, with The Blood Negotiators as its first installment. It is a template for what a crime thriller should be, with all the elements laid out in the right scope, including suspense, romance, betrayal and intrigue not forgetting the long-standing wars between the FBI and the mafia.Protagonist Ives Andrich falls in love with Allina Kovar as soon as he sees her photo; Miss Allina Kovar, you are the woman I will marry. Somehow, I will prove to you that I am worthy of you. The romance aspect of The Killing Game is as strong as the out-and-out roller-coaster ride of suspense and action that The Black Rose has provided for readers to enjoy. The ending promises an exciting continuation in Book Two, The Chase. All in all, this is a thrilling story that will appeal to die-hard crime thriller fans who would be happy to add The Killing Game to their collection and follow the series. --Lit Amri for Readers' FavoriteAs the Director of the New York Division of the FBI, Ives Andrich is frustrated with the Bureau regarding his investigation of a novelist, Allina Kovar, whose manuscript titled Blood Negotiators is a bit too accurate about Vincent Luca, an Italian crime lord.

In late 2012 a freak accident finally allowed time for Charmain to indulge in her passion for writing. She says of this \"Then a few weeks ago I fell over whilst trying to catch chickens and ended up breaking my ankle! Quite a comical way to break your ankle - I know; especially when I have kept horses for the majority of my life and have never yet broken any bones where they are concerned! Suddenly I had six clear weeks in which I wouldn't be able to move very well? Help! How was I going to cope with doing zilch for that long? Then I thought maybe I should do a bit of writing, and that is what I did, and the strange thing is, is that I haven't been able to stop since!\" She says of her writing \"I love writing, it is truly my passion!  I love the way that through words I can make people think and feel differently, feel passion, sometimes pain, and get totally lost in my words.  I love the fact that a brilliant writer will live forever, and will in some way influence generations to come.  Is it not marvelous that we can still look back to writing from over two thousand years ago and believe in it and still learn from it? The human imagination is a wonderful thing, it creates and then brings to life stories on a screen, and sometimes we believe in these stories so much that they become our passion.  I'm talking about for instance: The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Star wars etc...  I think we actually forget sometimes that all of these stories were started with a simple idea on a piece of paper, and they grew to be something that some of us forget started from the author's imagination\".

Davis offers his own excellent effort withBeowulf: The New Translation.Davis'sBeowulfis prose but still honors the alliteration and kennings of the original manuscript. The little that Davis loses in terms of strict poetic faithfulness is more than made up for in simple, inspiring readability. Davis chooses to avoid footnotes, and it's a wise decision--it's easier to become engrossed in the story without them. As a result, he's shaped the text intoa rousing adventure that could easily find a place on the Fantasy shelf at the local bookstore. Readers who've sampled other interpretations ofBeowulfwill be pleased to explore Davis's take on the tale. But truly to be envied are those for whomBeowulf: The New Translationwill be an introduction to the world of heroes and honor, monsters and evil. Davis has created a version that helps us to imagine sitting around a fire, a thousand years ago, listening to a great story.", "related": ["B00400MQ5S"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Janey is a big fan of romance - writing and reading. The mother of one, she currently spends her days writing, reading, procrastinating, and protecting her son from himself as he pretends that he is a superhero.

Crusan-Kramer is the second book in the Saga of Samantha Skylar, who experiences throughout the trilogy both an intense passion and a terrible act of brutality. Samantha's life goes from a small town in West Virginia, a coal mining town of closed minds and poverty, to a rich old estate in Atlanta that is owned by one of the oldest and wealthiest families of the area. As of 1987, Samantha is living a life she could only have dreamed of. She has a good job, lives in her own apartment, and has a best friend. Loving is not easy for Sam and when she has heart breaking loss it takes time to recover. In 1992 however, she becomes the personal assistant to the democratic candidate for vice president and life takes her on more turns that are both good and bad when someone from the past turns up.While part of a trilogy and clearly well blended to be so, it could also stand alone as its own book because it is so wonderfully written. From cover to cover, this book draws you into its pages and shows you how far along Sam has come from the small coal mining town where she started out. You feel a kinship in getting to be part of her journey of growth and discovery. It is so easy to feel connected with Sam because we all follow some path of growing up and discovery and many would love to find themselves where Sam does, even with the bumps in the road that come along. If you want to read a book that you can truly enjoy and feel some connection with, while enjoying it as a whole, I would recommend Sam's story.", "related": [], "rank": 2333037, "title": "Sam's Story", "author": "Amy D.

All governments tend toward greater control and less freedom.\nHe called for armed resistance as the best guard against it.How long have you been writing?Since I was ten years old.What authors have inspired you?C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Stephen King, among others. I'm drawn to\n dark stories that pit good against evil in breathtaking, apocalyptic\nways. For this series, I especially drew inspiration from Dostoyevski'sCrime and Punishment, Ayn Rand'sAtlas Shrugged, Sinclair Lewis'It\nCan't Happen Here, and Pat Frank'sAlas Babylon.Where did you get the idea for the novel?I've always wondered what happened to America. I knew something had gone\n wrong. Our country wasn't anything like what it had once been. Did\nsomething drive us from the vision of the Founding Fathers? And what\nwould happen if we continue down this path? In the last few elections I\nsaw how divided we were as a country. How long the fabric of our\ncivilization will hold together? What will happen when it finally tears\napart? Jefferson's Road is my prediction about all this.Who is your favorite character?The characters are all based on \"types\" - bits and pieces of people I've\n known, and they are all very real to me. Peter is the hero, or perhaps\nthe anti-hero, of the novel, but Martin has the best lines. Jerry is a\nlovable doofus who gets caught up in all this, and for that reason is\nall the more tragic. Grant plays the role of villain, but despite his\nlies, he is the most true to who he is. There's an air of mystery about\nhim. You never quite know whether or not he's going to shoot someone.Do you want the President assassinated?God no. I think that'd be an utter disaster for this country. But I do think\nthat if change back to the Constitution doesn't come by the ballot, it\nwill come by the bullet. Will freedom-loving Americans really allow us\nto become a socialist state or a Marxist dystopia? Someone will do\nsomething rash, and it'll all explode or, more likely, implode.", "related": ["B00K31USUS"], "rank": 620017, "title": "God And Country (Jefferson's Road Book 4)", "author": "Michael J.

It did for me and before I knew it the time was 3 A.M. It made for a long day of work the next day.In short, this is not your run of the mill sports novel, in fact I don't look at it as a sports novel at all. Yes, football does set the backdrop for the storyline and if you are an avid fan/lover of football like I am, then yes, you will get all the more out of this book. However, it's the depth of main character Gavin that is truly profound and unique. There is great power in the message that is being portrayed in this novel. For me it was the message of personal growth, challenges and in some ways spirituality through symbolism that sets this apart from anything that I have had the chance to read as of late.Words to describe this book are: Inspirational, Unique, Original, Captivating, Thought Provoking and Well Written in a multi-leveled, multi-dimensional way that will engulf the mind and senses well after you are done reading.5 Stars, a Must Read and I will definately be on the lookout for more from Author Charles L.

The 50 tips in this work touch on everything from packing for the hospital to recovering from labor and discuss various options, including water birth, medicated births, and C-sections. Each tip includes two or three stories from real moms that show the wide range of normal when it comes to childbirth and offer advice that readers might not get elsewhere.--Library JournalIt provides advice on everything from what to take to the hospital during labor to the pros and cons of epidurals. However, this book stands out due to its encouraging, nonjudgmental tone. Peery says up front that she’s no expert, but this fact makes her book all the more appealing. Readers will feel from the get-go that she’s on their side, rooting for them.... Mostly, she quotes other women, who offer stories and advice about their own birth experiences.... Pregnant readers who finish this book will likely feel more knowledgeable and more secure about what’s ahead. A solid, supportive advice book to help women through the physical and mental work of childbirth. --Kirkus ReviewsThe perfect must have for every expectant mom.

This has some great tips, and I know my women will read it.--Karen K., Crisis Pregnancy Center, Philadelphia, PAEasy to read.

It should be on every baby shower gift list.--Joyce S., Sag Harbor, NYI LOVE this book! I wish a resource like this existed years ago when I had my two daughters.

His dream is to spend a whole year circumnavigating the globe and visiting every continent. He lives in Marin County, California, with his wife, Katherine Applegate, their two children, and far too many pets. You can visit him online at www.themichaelgrant.com.
