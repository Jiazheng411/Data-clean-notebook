How can these Jehovah's Witnesses persist in their belief that the end of the world is imminent? In this academic study, Holden, a British sociologist, attempts to understand why the strict and austere Watch Tower Society continues to enjoy rapid growth. This is neither a primer on the danger of \"cults\" nor an endorsement of the Witnesses' distinctive beliefs, but a balanced ethnography that draws upon interviews with both adherents and ex-members to help readers understand what it is like to be part of the Society. Holden's main thesis that the Watch Tower is engaged in careful and ongoing negotiations with the secular culture that surrounds it is a nuanced one, especially compared to previous studies that have depicted the movement as little more than an extremist rejection of modernity. The study bears the marks of the dissertation that it once was: it overexplains how data were collected and analyzed, surveys the historiography of the topic (which, as Holden points out, is all but nonexistent in the case of the Witnesses) and relies heavily on a few theorists (in this case, Clifford Geertz and Mary Douglas). But the topic is compelling enough that readers who are interested in the Watch Tower will be obliged to put aside Holden's academese and be grateful for what he has given them: a thoughtful book that takes the Witnesses' own beliefs and words seriously.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

And in light of recent events, these clients-defined here as those having $50 million or more in liquid assets-need help on a variety of fronts. That's why author Michael Pompian, an experienced investment consultant in the private wealth arena, has created this timely guide.Advising today's ultra-affluent clients (UACs) and family offices requires solid investment knowledge and the skills to deal with \"soft\" issues such as family governance and philanthropy. Understanding this idea and integrating it into your professional endeavors will put you in a better position to serve your clients as well as excel in one of the most-dynamic segments of the financial services industry. Although targeted at financial practitioners, this book is also a valuable resource for families considering whether to establish or join a family office.Divided into four comprehensive parts, this thoughtful resource opens with an informative introduction to advising UACs, including a detailed discussion of which clients are considered \"ultra-affluent\" and an in-depth look at their attitudes, aspirations, and investment behavior. Part II outlines various investment strategies for UACs, examining the best practices of top investment organizations and reviewing many of the alternative investments available to UACs. Part III takes the time to outline the key aspects of advising multigenerational families-including selecting an adviser, considerations for creating a family office, selecting an investment vehicle structure, and wealth transfer. Part IV rounds out this extensive exploration of advising the ultra-affluent by covering special topics in advising UACs, such as family governance, equity risk management, philanthropy, asset protection, and developing a multigenerational asset allocation strategy.Working with the ultra-affluent has great upside potential, especially given the generational transition of wealth that is taking place globally. In order to take advantage of this opportunity, you need to gain a fundamental understanding of both the investment and noninvestment issues that affect ultra-affluent clients. Advising Ultra-Affluent Clients and Family Offices contains the practical insights and expert advice that will allow readers to successfully navigate this complex field and effectively serve some of today's most sophisticated investors.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Business & Money", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

With thoughtfulness and insight that call to mind le Carre, Hill reconsiders an aspect of the German occupation of France during WW II that many Frenchmen would prefer to forget--the collaboration. Set primarily in Paris, the novel follows the lives of Jean-Paul and Janine Simonian, he a Jew, she a boulanger 's daughter married against her parents' wishes. Upon his release from a military hospital after France's humiliating defeat in 1940, Jean-Paul joins the Resistance. For her part, Janine worries--about her two children and the husband who has become emotionally so dark and distant. Gunther Mai, an otherwise kindly German officer in the Abwehr , befriends Janine and uses her as a source of information on her husband's activities--a relationship that works well until he falls in love with her. What Hill portrays so successfully is the conflict between social and personal responsibility. Through a wonderful range of secondary characters, he skillfully characterizes the collaborator in his various guises--from the self-serving black marketeer to the loving mother and wife. Best of all, Hill captures the collapse of morality in occupied France.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In each of six impressive chapters, Volkov focuses on an era and on a typically Petersburgian art form of the time. From Peter the Great's imperial mandate impelling the city from the marshy Baltic coast in 1703, Volkov moves on to Gogol's and Dostoyevski's cynical anti-Petersburg writings; the passionate, European/Russian hybrid of Tchaikovsky and the Mighty Five (Musorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin, Balakirev, Cui); the waxing sense of doom and the concomitant nostalgia of Anna Akhmatova and Alexander Blok; the emigre Petersburg created abroad by Balanchine, Stravinksy and Nabokov; Shostakovitch's city, depleted by the Great Terror and pounded during the Siege of Leningrad; and finally, to the beleaguered postwar city of Joseph Brodsky. This is a complicated strategy involving a tacking back and forth to pick up numerous themes and biographies and there are, perhaps inevitably, redundancies. Also Volkov, a musicologist by training and a devotee of literature by inclination (his previous books include Joseph Brodsky in New York and the controversial Testimony: The Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich) is sketchier in his treatment of the visual arts. But this well-researched and deeply personal book gives a complex, subtle view of the city's haughty and tortured history.

McMillen, who chairs the history department at Davidson College, presents a fine history of the 1848 Seneca Falls convention, which galvanized the women's movement through the remainder of the 19th century and also affected concurrent struggles for temperance, abolition and educational reform. Narrowing her focus to four suffragists—Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Susan B. Anthony and Lucy Stone—McMillen nimbly weaves their stories with the larger narrative of reform. After a splendid introductory chapter that outlines the legal injustices most women suffered (typically, they could not vote, hold property or receive equal pay for their work), McMillen describes the convention itself, about which we know relatively little (Stanton gave it just two sentences in her mammoth memoir) and then traces its unexpectedly weighty impact on reformers through the decades. She does an outstanding job of discussing how religion functioned as both an impetus and an obstacle to reform, and pays particular attention to how the women's movement broke apart during Reconstruction because of internal bickering, racism and class divisions. This is not a revisionist work or a substantial challenge to the conventional historiography of suffrage, but a well-written and cogent synthesis accessible to the general reader while remaining firmly grounded in primary sources. 20 b&w illus.(Feb.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Essie Lewis, a 30ish oceanographer, returns to the island from Perth to become the lighthouse keeper, a position that has played a prominent role in her family history. As she settles in, she runs into former childhood friend Pete Shelverton, a welder and metal sculptor who has buried himself in the task of ridding the island of feral cats. Wood details Essie's life through a series of diaries and documents from her past that outline the arc of her family; Pete's difficulties with women and socializing in general are less fully drawn. When they do come together, it is brief, awkward and incomplete. The one-note plot and sketchy romance put all of the burden on the island-as-exotic-locale and its history, and on Essie's own past there. The results are often lyrical, but end up less than satisfying.(Jan.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A father of six, he wrote over fifty books for children, some under the pseudonyms of Patrick O Connor and Christopher Webb. His excellent historical fiction includes the seven volume Treegate series, which takes place during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. John Treegate's Musket opens this series with the events leading up to the War. Peter Treegate's War leads us straight into the first years of the conflict, beginning at the Battle of Bunker Hill. In addition to historical characters we encounter a new fictional personage who will take center stage in this book: Peace of God Manly.Part of Wibberley's success in writing for children is related in his own words: Basically it is for the child inside myself that I write my children's books, for that child lives on into my more somber years. Like Stevenson and other of his favorite authors, Goldsmith, Milne, Lewis and Tolkien, Wibberley's main concentration in his stories is on the characters, from which he usually developed the plot. Using this method and liberally implementing his wry sense of humor, he produced his numerous works, ranging from fantasy to biography.As an adult novelist, Wibberley is most remembered for The Mouse That Roared, an amusing satire about a duchy that defeats the United States with the long bow.A native of Ireland, Leonard Wibberley lived in California for many years.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He sat cross-legged with his arms wrapped around his chest, his teet h chat ter ing li ke casta nets. \"I'm f-f-f-f-freezing! \"As urgently as an outlaw with a posse at his heels, five-year-old Orlando dove into bed beside his big brother, shaking his legs with enough force to make the headboard rap against the wall. \"M-m-me t-t-t-too! I got goose bumps all over me.\"\"My lips are frozen.\"\"My tongue is. Listen—I ca' har'ly talk.\"Refusing to be outdone by his younger sibling, Will rose to his knees. \"I'm so cold, I'm pissin' ice cubes.\"\"William Romeo Dobbs!\" At the sound of their mother's voice, both boys made bug eyes at each other and scrambled beneath the sheets.Claire hustled to her sons' bed, a tattered but thick blanket folded in her arms. She stared down at them. \"Where on earth did you learn that expression?\"Will mumbled from under the sheet. \"Sorry, Mom.\"\"Well, I should say.\" After an admonishing glare for good measure, she shook out the cover, spreading the thick wool across the bumps and angles of their small bodies. \"Besides, it's hardly a contest. Y'all are both human Popsicles. I better warm you up quick or I'll find two icicles in bed tomorrow instead of little boys.\" She began to tuck them in with exaggerated urgency, making them giggle.Will offered another exaggerated shiver, mostly, his mother hoped, for effect. \"Is Oregon always cold?\"\"Nope. By summer it'll be so hot we'll wish for a frost.\"\"Mom?\" Pulling the covers up to his chin, Will frowned. \"Are we staying here forever?\" He watched carefully for her response.Gazing down at him, Claire felt a rush of love and regret that made her heart feel like a sponge with the water squeezed out. Sitting on the bed, she let their hazel gazes settle into each other. Will was the one of her offspring that most resembled her, particularly in his tendency to fret about the future. Smoothing his wheat-colored bangs, she tried to sound like a woman with a great plan. \"I expect to live here for years and years, Will. I figure you and your brother and sister will live here until you go off to college. Then I hope you'll come home for Thanksgiving and Christmas.\" She went nose to nose with him. \"At least you better, or I'll bake your favorite pies and eat them all myself.\"Orlando popped up in bed as if his spine were a spring. \"I'm gonna stay with you, Mom. Me and my wife are gonna live here and drive you around in our car.\"\"You gotta get a job before you buy a wife and car.\" Will rolled his eyes and tugged at the blanket his brother had pulled off. \"That's how come I'm going to college.\" He nodded importantly at Claire, who nodded importantly back. She'd done a thorough job of impressing upon her eldest that he would the first Dobbs to go to college, not to mention the first to graduate from high school.Orlando ignored them both, his unleashed enthusiasm making him bounce on the bed. \"I'm gonna work in a mine like Daddy. I'm gonna wear a hard hat with a light on it and big boots for my feet.\"The sweetness of the evening drained abruptly for Claire, replaced by a nausea she had grown used to over the past year. Before moving lock, stock and barrel to Oregon, she, her boys and their father had lived in eastern Kentucky, in a town where any man worth his salt worked as a mountaintop miner. Arlo Dobbs had definitely been worth his salt. He'd lied about his age and gone to work for the mining company when he was only sixteen. By eighteen, he'd saved enough money to rent a home and buy a wedding band, and the day he'd asked Claire to marry him, he'd looked as proud and notable as a millionaire.Glancing out the rectangle of window above her sons' bed, Claire wished she could see a star through the thick cloud cover. She needed a reminder that heaven could sometimes be seen right here on earth. She'd become Arlo's wife before she'd been able to vote and had never regretted it. He had been a man easy to love and easy to honor, but she didn't want any of their babies following his footsteps.Or mine, either.Her jaw tensed. Somewhere under that great big sky was a kinder, better life. She intended for her children to have their fair share of it.\"You don't look happy.\"Will's worried voice jerked Claire to her present. She smiled to ease her boy's fears. \"I'm always happy when I'm with you and Orlando and Rozzy. I was just thinking about how I've got to sew the curtains for your window.\"\"And you don't like to sew?\" Orlando guessed, up and jumping on his knees now, making the tired mattress sag.\"It's not what I'm best at.\" Gently but insistently, Claire pushed him down to his pillow.\"What are you best at?\"She pretended to have to think about it. \"Good-night tickles.\" She dove for their ribs, eliciting easy laughter from Orlando. When Will chortled, too, Claire counted herself a success and left her sons to what she hoped would be a good night's sleep.Trudging across the short hallway to the room she shared with her baby girl, Rosalind, Claire felt too stiff and tired to be twenty-five, too young to be a widow—but life hardly ever asked permission before it changed on a person.There were plenty of risks associated with working in a mine, but Arlo hadn't succumbed to those. He'd died in a single-car accident along a winding road on the way home from work. At the time, Claire had had two children under six and a baby ready to be born. There hadn't been any family or education to fall back on, and she'd begun to think God might be teaching her a lesson when life had shifted again and suddenly she'd been back in His good graces.Her great-aunt Faylene on her mother's side had passed on at the comfortable age of ninety-two, bequeathing Claire this two-bedroom, one-bath, totally paid-off house about sixty miles east of Oregon's central corridor. Except for Arlo's 1980 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme with cruise control, it was the first time Claire had owned anything bigger than a suitcase. Such a windfall—a house that was all hers with no questions asked and roomfuls of furniture to go with it—had sent her straight to her knees in gratitude and relief.Walking softly to the crib where her eleven-month-old slept, Claire gazed at the fair, Ivory-soap skin Rosalind had inherited from her father. Rozzy would never know Arlo, and the boys were still so young…. The details they remembered now would blur until the time came when their daddy was a memory and no longer a feeling. It killed Claire to think of it.Putting two fingers to her lips, she pressed a kiss softly against Rosalind's cheek then headed downstairs, flipping off lights on her way to the living room. There, she checked the thermostat: fifty-one degrees if she squinted, and it was only early November; winter in eastern Oregon had not even begun.Belligerently overriding the financial fears that never left her now, she shoved the thermostat up a good ten degrees. Letting her babies turn blue in their beds was not part of her plan.She needed a job, and she needed it yesterday. She'd barely driven across the Oregon border before she'd started looking for employment, but her search had left her bone dry. Until today. This afternoon, she had spied her first golden ray of hope—an employment notice in the local paper.Two years' guaranteed employment for an honest, hardworking woman. Can you cook, muck a stall, bake a pecan pie? Integrity and loyalty a must to join the team at Pine Road Ranch. Apply in person. 120056 Old Pine Road. Benefits.Heart skipping with excitement, Claire had clipped the ad and stuck it to the refrigerator using one of her aunt's \"Faith, Hope and Love\" magnets for good luck. Every chance she'd gotten tonight, she'd reread it.Pine Road Ranch.It sounded like the kind of operation that had been around for years, would be around for years to come. This could be the job that saved her.Claire didn't hold with being disrespectful to her elders, but before Arlo there hadn't been a Dobbs in all of Willow Hills, Kentucky, who'd worked an honest day in his life. Her family hadn't been much better. The one thing she had made Arlo swear to before she'd agreed to marry was that their kids would feel secure and protected. Never, ever would their own parents give them cause to lower their eyes in shame.She intended to have that job. Since cooking was a skill she'd perfected in grade school, Claire decided to give the folks at Pine Road Ranch samples to make their mouths water for more.In her kitchen, the cow-shaped clock Aunt Faylene had hung between the tile counter and the nicked, cream-painted cabinets read seven thirty-five. Time to get to work. There were cinnamon rolls to ice, homemade-jam cookies and a butter-soft egg bread to bake, plus a chicken she planned to roast with carrots, pearl onions and parsnips. It didn't matter if morning rose before the bread did or if she fell asleep standing up; she wouldn't go to bed until every last thing was perfect.Taming her fatigue with determination, Claire headed to the pantry and filled her arms with ingredients.If she had to clean from dusk till dawn to keep a roof over her children's heads, food in their bellies and self-respect in their hearts, then by God she'd do it. She would muck out any stall, cook a million meals. Whatever it took. No matter what, she was going to wipe the fear and concern from Will's eyes—and keep the innocence in Orlando's and Rosalind's.Hungry ranchers? Messy house? Filthy barn? Bring it on.I'm your woman, Pine Road Ranch.Bat dung and cobwebs. Those were the first things Fletcher Kingsley saw when he opened his eyes on… What day was it? Thursday?

Chancellor Shanahan and Tucker McBride are firemen, paramedics who spend their careers in and out of fires, but the real heat comes from their reaction to each other as soon as they meet and the relationship they attempt to create with one another.Stubborn, willful and dedicated to his job, Chance has one eye on his career and the other on the rookie in the station house, Tucker. Unwilling to compromise his job, Chance keeps himself away from Tucker as much as he can, but given that they're partners it isn't that easy. It gets even harder when Tucker proves to be just as stubborn as Chance, and willing to take a few risks to get what he wants: Chance.Luckily for the reader Chance lets himself be swayed by his lust in one of the hottest frottage scenes I've had the pleasure to read in a long, long time. Things only heat up from there, and it's not long before the story is swept along by the passion these two men have for each other and their job.Before they can really get settled however, the two facets of their life begin to merge. Job stress, injury and secrets pull them together and try to tear them apart at the same time. Chance and Tucker are stubborn and passionate, but are they strong enough to deal with everything life throws at them?Tory Temple has graced ''Heat'' with vibrant characters, hot sex and a compelling story. She never backs away from the difficulties of real life, and she doesn't compromise on the flaws in her characters. ''Heat'' is a wonderful, steamy read--the perfect story to warm you up this winter.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

So, while it can be read without reading the first, I highly recommend reading the first in order to full enjoy the second. It's kind of tough to jump into a book at chapter fifty-one!The first third of the story was very difficult for me to get involved in. It seemed disjointed and didn't flow well (again, this could be because I haven't read book one). But, as I continued, the last two-thirds of the book were just phenomenal. It flowed well as we experience the further training of Cara and how each stage impacts her emotionally and physically.I have to say that some of her training went way past what I consider my limits. Although I didn't find the reading of this erotic, I did find it psychologically fascinating. Admittedly, I was enthralled with the story telling and the experiences of Cara. Each stage she went through was more and more difficult and while I wish I could have the chance to experience her emotions, I don't know if I could have handled the scenario's as well as she did.If you are looking for a well written story from a submissive/slave point of view, pick upSymphony of C Vol 2(I still suggest Vol 1 first). Take your time to read it and enjoy learning about one woman's experiences and emotions as she learns what it truly means to feel free in her submission.Star - BDSM Book Reviews", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Zangwill was born in London on January 21, 1864 in a family of Jewish immigrants from Czarist Russia, to Moses Zangwill from what is now Latvia and Ellen Hannah Marks Zangwill from what is now Poland. He dedicated his life to championing the cause of the oppressed. Jewish emancipation, women's suffrage, assimilationism, territorialism and Zionism were all fertile fields for his pen. His brother was also a writer, the novelist Louis Zangwill, and his son was the prominent British psychologist, Oliver Zangwill. Zangwill received his early schooling in Plymouth and Bristol. When he was nine years old Zangwill was enrolled in the Jews' Free School in Spitalfields in east London, a school for Jewish immigrant children. The school offered a strict course of both secular and religious studies while supplying clothing, food, and health care for the scholars; today one of its four houses is named Zangwill in his honour. At this school young Israel excelled and even taught part-time, moving up to become a full-fledged teacher. While teaching, he studied for his degree in 1884 from the University of London, earning a BA with triple honours. Zangwill married Edith Ayrton, a gentile feminist and author who was the daughter of cousins Matilda Chaplin and William Edward Ayrton. In later life, his friends included well known Victorian writers such as Jerome K. Jerome and H. G. Wells.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Reference", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Sickels III was born in Camden, New Jersey in 1982. He lived his younger years in Atco, New Jersey where he began his attendance at The King's Christian School of Haddon Heights. He, his mother and younger sister then moved to Audubon, New Jersey where James continued to attend King's Christian then rounded out his later years in Williamstown High School of Williamstown, New Jersey.  He attended various colleges in hopes of finding his purpose through Computer Science, Architecture, and Elementary Education.  Although excelling in each field, he found himself unable to be defined in any of these careers. Throughout his childhood, James found comfort and escape in the world of books. He enjoyed reading fantasy stories, comic books, and choose your own adventure novels. Later, he began reading the work of authors like Stephen King, which greatly influenced his writing style and genre preference. James always felt the need to express himself creatively through music, art or writing. He always returned to writing because it was through that he found real fulfillment.  In the early nineties, James first began his forays into writing, combining mysteries, super heroes, elves, death, and the bible into a series of stories which he wrote about on and off.  James also has a passion for writing because he believes in the power of the written word to not only entertain but to expand the mind. He uses writing to reach others in a unique way and to reach himself as well. In his words, “Writing is like a form of improvisational acting.

Later, about 2007 I think, fantasy author Peter S. Beagle gave me even more to think about, and after speaking at length with him and his manager, Connor Cochran, Shahly was revised yet again, but I worked to retain as much of the original story as I could.So, here's a story that dates back to the eighties, penned by a twenty-two year old, fledgling author.

Prior to washing up on the beach in Oregon, Howe spend 10 years with CADA: Career Attention Deficit Disorder. Always finding something more interesting to do after a few months on the job, Howe worked as a valet, hotel manager and skiiing moose for Vail Resorts, a tour coordinator for Feld Entertainment, and even served for brief as the dinosaur mascot for the Colorado Rockies Major League Baseball team. In the middle of all that, however, he found time to be Max the Dog in \"The Little Mermaid\" production of Disney On Ice. Touring the world and nation, he went to 48 states, more than a dozen nations, and even had time to get run over by a bus in Vancouver, British Columbia. Following a lay-off brought on by being the only non-skater on an ice-skating show, Howe returned to graduate school at the University of Missouri where he got a masters degree in journalism. While there he won many writing awards, as well as being crowned the NCA National Champion mascot as Truman the Tiger. Today, he continues to dress as furry animals, be married and be a father — sometimes simultaneously — with his family on the beach in Oregon. He is very happy.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 5, "rating_average": 4.2, "rating_total": 21.0}

This predictable episode opens in a bookstore run by friends of the Boxcar children, Martin and Dottie. A customer lingers in the store, attempting to buy books by a popular mystery writer whose disappearance has never been explained. When this causes mild-mannered Martin to become angry and order the man from the store, the four children are alerted that something is going on. At a Chinese restaurant, the Alden children open fortune cookies with handwritten riddle clues inside, which eventually lead them to suspect that Martin is trying to get full control of the bookstore and cheat Dottie out of her share. In the end, there are several revelations that will surprise only the most credulous readers. Narrator Aimee Lilly has a pleasant voice and tries to distinguish the various characters. However, Henry and Benny's voices have an unpleasant, grating tone. Libraries with a high demand for the Boxcar Children series might consider this audiobook, but youngsters looking for an exciting audio mystery will need to look elsewhere.Kathy Mortensen, Adams Elementary School, Midland, MICopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Sahara of the Bible was a green and pleasant\nplace. The coast of Egypt was miles offshore from where it is today.\nFrom the Middle Ages until Victorian times, London's River Thames\nfroze so hard many winters that Frost Fairs were held on the ice;\nduring the last freeze of 1814, an elephant crossed the frozen river.\nClimate change has felled civilisations; our present civilisation\nprobably has the technology to survive major changes in climate,\nproviding foresight, conservation, organisation and discipline are\nexerted in sufficient time.It's hard, however, to write about\nthe politics of global climate change without sliding into the comedy\nof despair. Even the greediest, the most stupid and the most\nself-centred should be able to see that climate does change and\noften does so within decades. Unfortunately, too much effort has been\nwasted arguing whether human activity is the cause of climate change\nor not; that argument sidesteps that thereisclimate change. Unfortunately, there has been dubious science\nenlisted by ecological zealots, much to the relief of anti-science\nbigots. Even more unfortunate are lunatic proposals surfacing about\nclimate engineering when we don't even have the ability to predict\ntomorrow's weather accurately; we can rest assured that climate\nskeptics will happily join in that feeding frenzy. Most unfortunately\nof all, the inhabitants of today's consumerist society refuse, in the\nface of compelling evidence, to acknowledge that we live in a\nchanging world of limited resources.I finishedGlass\nHousein 1989, long before global climate\nchange had any serious visibility - a scientific reviewer for\nGollancz (science fiction!) recommended rejection because it was\n\"implausible\". Within a year of finishing, I'd been appointed\nprofessor in medicine and computer science at a fairly respectable\nEnglish university and I stopped seeking publication. It was pretty\nmuch out of cowardice - after all, I was educated as a geologist\nand oceanographer; adding \"novelist\" to my irrelevant\nqualifications might have been my final disqualification for the new\npath I set upon. Personal triumphs, private disasters and growing\nbourgeois responsibility conspired over the decades to ensure thatGlass Housestayed\ntucked in an obscure directory of my backups.Soon after retirement from academic\nlife, however, my father asked to readGlass\nHouseagain. I fumbled around trying to\nproduce a printed copy for him. Not surprisingly, revision to\nexercise the outrageous personal fortunes of two decades burst forth\nand that led to further procrastinations. Stung by my father's death\nwithout having his ever having received the requested read, I finally\nslid down Kindle route to publication. RIP, GRS, you best of all\neditors.The most alarming thing aboutGlass\nHouseshould be that a novel about the\npossibility of an impending global ecological catastrophe could have\nbeen written almost 25 years ago and only require minor revision to\nbring it up-to-date in 2011! Over this time, there has been much\nuproar and counter-uproar about global climate change, raising of\nawareness, but very little actual progress preparing for it. Let's\nhope it's only an improbable novel, a black comedy that never comes\nto pass!", "related": [], "rank": 3021043, "title": "ebook,M F Smith,Glass House: Climate Change in the Third Millennium,FICTION / Science Fiction / Adventure,SCIENCE / Environmental Science\" />", "author": "M F Smith", "category": "Professional & Technical", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He sat at the wheel of his pickup and watched her unloading her things onto the porch, with a vague sense that he was spying, while he gave about thirty percent of his attention to his sister Scarlett's voice in his ear. \"…so there was nothing we could do, and it was so fast…\"A very nice wheeled designer suitcase thumped up the wooden steps. The new tenant paused to stretch her lower back, placing a hand there for support.The bump of her pregnancy was unmistakable in this pose, neat and round and firm, but as soon as she straightened again it almost disappeared. She had the kind of long, lean, gym-honed body that made a pregnancy look like this season's hot fashion accessory, and she was probably a little chilly in those threequarter-length sleeves, since it was only the beginning of April and the clear air had a definite bite.\"…so I've been thinking I might take a week off, just some quiet time, but not here in the city…\" Scarlett had called Andy on his cell just as he was about to drive past his own house on his way from his office to the store, so he'd pulled over in front of his neighbor's place to take her call, only a few yards from his own driveway. He hadn't intended to watch his new tenant unloading her car, it had just happened that way.\"…and if it wouldn't create problems for you and Laura.. \" he heard Scarlett say into his ear.He put his reply in fast. \"Laura and I have split up.\"\"Oh, Andy! When?\" His sister sounded distressed.\"February. It's okay. It's not a problem.\"There was a beat of silence as Scarlett absorbed the news. \"She tried too hard, didn't she?\"\"Yeah, she did,\" he admitted, glad that Scarlett understood, so he didn't have to explain.\"Was she upset?\"\"She was the one who made the move. I came home from work and there was a note and a whole lot less stuff.\" The extent of Laura's stuff had been part of the problem. \"But we both knew it was coming. She's found someone who appreciates her for who she truly is, the note said.\"\"Ouch!\"\"And she was right. I really didn't do that.\" Speaking of ouch.The tenant heaved a second suitcase out of the trunk of her car and paused once again to arch and rub away the ache in her back. Her outfit looked brand-new and designer label, the soft sage-green stretch fabric gathered at the side seams so that it made her bump into a graceful curve instead of an inconvenient bulge.Her dark brown hair shone with rich chestnut lights, and the artfully casual topknot looked as if it had been twisted and pinned in place at a Manhattan salon not more than half an hour ago, just as the fringed and patterned scarf around her neck could have been draped by a Hollywood stylist. Her sunglasses saidexpensiveloud and clear.But it was the bump that had him thinking.\"Definitely pregnant,\" Andy muttered. \"Wonder when she's due.\"\"Sorry?\" said Scarlett.\"My new tenant seems to be pregnant.\"\"Oh, you have a new tenant? Ohh.\"He couldn't miss the disappointment. \"Is that a problem?\"Seemed to be the tenant that was the problem for his sister, not the pregnancy. He didn't have a problem with either the tenant or her fashionable bump, but he was a little curious about why a woman like this—all big-city sophistication and style—was here in a small, scenic town in Vermont, renting solo, on a short-term lease. Where did the pregnancy fit in?\"Well, see, that's what I've been working up to,\" Scarlett said. \"I'm taking some time off. Hoping to. Thinking about it. I'd been wondering if I could use your rental half, since it's been empty. You know, just sit in a porch swing for a week.\"\"You can sit in my porch swing, instead of the rental one.\"\"I know, but it's not the same.\"\"It's almost the same,\" he pointed out, \"since my place and my rental are two halves of the same house.\"He'd loved the extravagant Victorian on sight, four years ago, and since he hadn't needed such a big place, he'd been happy that it was divided into two generous apartments. He was casual about renting out the half he didn't live in, relying on word of mouth and a couple of low-key listings on the internet, preferring short leases for the variety. He hadn't hugely cared when it stood vacant, as it had been all this past winter, while his two-year relationship with Laura had done its slow, splintering crash, like a felled tree.\"Yeah, but that's… No, I can't explain.\" Scarlett sounded very flat, and very tired.\"This is only a three-month rental,\" he began.This was what made him curious. Three months renting to a pregnant tenant from New York City, who had most definitely told him on the phone that she'd be living there alone, and that she didn't want a longer lease because she was only subletting her condo in Manhattan for the first two months, and didn't want it sitting empty for too long. She was a corporate accountant, she'd said.So where did her due date fit in to her stay here? What was her plan? What were her intentions once the three-month lease was up?\"So if I hold off on my vacation until July…\" Scarlett said.\"You may actually be able to come up here and get a Vermont tan,\" he finished for her. \"And make it longer than a week. Make it as long as you want.\"He'd experienced for himself the therapeutic benefits of escaping the city and coming to the Green Mountain state. Five and a half years ago, one weekend here had led to a major change of lifestyle and priorities. Scarlett had been largely responsible for the whole thing, and now he had a chance to return the favor.\"But, no, I'll never get July,\" she said. \"New rotations start. I have a shot at August. Just a week…\" She was talking to herself more than to him, mentally adjusting her heavy schedule.Like every member of the McKinley family except Andy, she was all about crammed schedules. He remembered all too well what that was like.On the porch, a heavy-looking cardboard box was about to join the two suitcases. This time, the arch-and-rub was followed by a hard lean onto the seat of the porch swing. The swing rocked too much and the pregnant tenant…Nelson, Claudia Nelson…almost lost her balance. She grabbed the swing chain, pivoted on one foot and sat on the moving seat with a hard thump, and Andy had to fight an impulse to leap out of the pickup and rush to her aid.Which she might not have appreciated, since she would have no idea who he was at this point. Anyhow, she'd recovered her balance now.Recovered her balance, but not her built-in cool. She flattened her hand over her upper chest and took some breaths that looked as if they'd been learned in prenatal class and practiced diligently since. In through the nose. Out slow and steady, through rounded lips.Shoot, she wasn't in labor, was she? She only looked around six months or so, but as he'd already observed, she had the kind of body where it was hard to tell.\"I'd better go,\" he told Scarlett. \"Think about it for August or whenever, and call me back when you decide.Please.\"\"I will.\"\"I'll hold off on another tenant for a while when this one moves out. Meanwhile, if you want to come up sooner, I can check out some of the bed-and-breakfasts around here. They're pretty quiet. And I can make sure a porch swing is part of the deal.\"\"Thanks, Andy. But, no, it was probably a dumb idea.\" Down the line, Scarlett sighed to herself and began planning again. \"I'll wait. Even August, with the new interns… I'll check the calendar. Maybe October.\"Scarlett disconnected the call before Andy could tell her that October sounded too far off, given the stress and fatigue in her voice. He knew what his father, Dr. Michael James McKinley, Senior, would have said to her: \"Get a good night's sleep and pull yourself together, Scarlett. You're a cancer specialist. You're going to lose patients. You can't let it get too personal.\"Speaking of personal, it was time for Andy to introduce himself to the lady with the bump. The trip to the store for some steak and potatoes to accompany salad and a beer as tonight's meal would have to wait.There was a man in the front yard. Claudia had been vaguely aware of him since he'd pulled to the curb thirty feet down the street to take a call on his cell, but then she'd taken her eye off him for a few moments while she caught her breath after that scary near-fall.Now, instead of ending the call and driving away as she would have expected, he was suddenly here, coming toward her, smiling as if he knew her.Or as if he had suspect intentions.She had a moment of vulnerability, unfamiliar and unwanted. The baby crammed itself against her lungs, making her breath short. Her female friends—well, her one best friend, Kelly, plus her work colleagues and her hair stylist—kept telling her approvingly that she barely showed. But, oh, the baby was there, and if she didn't show much from the outside it was only because the pregnancy was crowding out her internal organs, instead.What did this man want? Around her own age of thirty-four, he looked strong and competent and sure of himself, dark haired, square-jawed, crooked-nosed, dressed in conservative dark pants and a pale polo shirt, with sleeve bands that stretched tight around hard biceps. His stride was long and he had an aura of casual ownership.Of the moment.Of the situation.It might have been appealing in other circumstances. She liked competence and control in a man.Right now, however, there was no traffic going by and the air had filled with ...", "related": ["B00FTQ1IPQ"], "rank": 1003440, "title": "Daddy on Her Doorstep (McKinley Medics)", "author": "Lilian Darcy", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Humiston and her investigator colleague, Kron, begin their investigation with a tip that leads to a pair of con men who seduce wealthy young women and spirit them off to Argentina to sell them into prostitution. After an attempt is made on Grace’s life, she realizes she must go to extremes to stop the villains. She and Kron book passage on the same ship as the traffickers to prevent them from selling their latest victim. When the traffickers try to kill her, Grace kills one and arrests the other, but discovers that they may have less to do with Ruth's disappearance than initially thought. Upon return to New York, the truth about Ruth finally comes out, and has far-reaching consequences. Well-paced, superbly plotted, and intricate in detail and suspense, this manuscript is a winner. The only flaws are an under-developed romance between Humiston and Kron. Overall, though, this is quite excellent and could even kick off a series.", "related": ["B0075C0N3A"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

A rematch of the previous year's championship game, which the Eagles lost on a snow-covered Chicago field, the game was nearly canceled when inch upon inch of snow blanketed Philly's Shibe Park. But the teams insisted on playing, even though Eagles star running back, Steve Van Buren, had to ride trolleys and buses and trudge through snow drifts to reach the stadium. Though the game was a thriller--won on a fourth-quarter Van Buren run, breaking a 0-0 tie--this is as much a story about football in the aftermath of World War II and an ode to the scrappy veterans who helped bring the game into the modern era. It was the first televised championship game, and Bunch flushes out his story with fun asides and arcana, like the history of the plastic helmet and the backstories of the ethnic and working-class players, many of whom held jobs and played ball on the weekends. It's a worthy trip back in time, to the earlier, simpler days of NFL football. --Neal Thompson", "related": [], "rank": 300711, "title": "Give It To Steve!

First, I'd like to share the experiences of deployed soldiers to help those who haven't served better understand those of us who volunteer our service, hopefully providing a more personal connection to the military and the war in Afghanistan than watching the evening news.  Second, through my own story I'd like to help document some of the history of the Army's Science & Technology Advisory Teams, and give soldiers and civilians alike a better idea of some of the ways we go about getting technology in the hands of soldiers.  In doing so, I hope to be able to provide a different perspective on the uniquely materiel-driven machine that is the American way of war. As a personal journal, my notes are a frank recording of what occurred on a daily or weekly basis during my deployment.  I have added commentary on the individual journal entries to help fill in some of the gaps, and where possible better translate my experiences to a broader audience. Enough time has passed that the information here should be neither current nor exploitable, though I have chosen to remain vague in some areas to ensure that that remains the case.  Many of my observations were shared with my family as emails home at the time, and I was careful not to put too much detail into my letters so that I would not reveal anything potentially compromising that might put me and my fellow soldiers at risk.  This work contains no classified information; I have also disguised the names of most of those soldiers referenced in my journal, to protect their privacy.  Otherwise, the words and emotions recorded in the journal entries remain unchanged from when I originally wrote them in theater.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "History", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The wealthy Countess of Rothes takes command of the lifeboat as her maid, Roberta Maioni, clutches a photograph of her beau, Jack Phillips, the ship's radio operator who stayed aboard ship to send out the world's first SOS signal. (Kaye argues that Maioni and Phillips may have inspired the Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet romance in James Cameron's movie.) Drawing on official testimony, written accounts, interviews, and survivors' letters, Kaye recounts the hours of terrified rowing through the icy blackness, in a boat with no drinking water or compass. She also reveals how the survivors would forever suffer a \"private grief.\" Fast-paced, well-researched, and moving, this is a compelling addition to the literature of the Titanic.--Neal Thompson", "related": ["B00IDCH6YA"], "rank": 3778605, "title": "ebook,Elizabeth Kaye,Lifeboat No. 8: An Untold Tale of Love, Loss, and Surviving the Titanic (Kindle Single),Byliner Inc.,TRANSPORTATION / Ships & Shipbuilding / History,HISTORY / Modern / 20th Century\" />", "author": "Elizabeth Kaye", "category": "History", "review_number": 35, "rating_average": 4.2571, "rating_total": 149.0}

Frail, slight, and suffering from a heart condition, his imperfect health made it all the more remarkable that in 1853, he and seventeen men left New York on a high-risk mission in search of legendary British explorer John Franklin, who had vanished in the Arctic with 129 men and two ships. Todd Balf expertly recreates Kane's little-known expedition, among the earliest American Arctic explorations. While Kane never did solve the mystery of Franklin's disappearance, his men managed briefly to advance beyond 81 degrees latitude--setting a new \"farthest north\" record. They suffered miserably for it, and Balf is at his best describing the brutal conditions, the minus-75 degree cold, the ice that loomed \"everywhere and grew by the day,\" and the subsequent \"starvation and madness\" of the crew. Kane was a diligent journal keeper, and Balf deftly exploits Kane's words, bringing this overlooked story to vivid life. Kane and his men spent two winters in earth's most remote and unforgiving outposts, swaddled in bear furs and walrus-hide moccasins, under constant assault from scurvy, frostbite, hypothermia, lockjaw, snow blindness, and typhoid. Remarkably, Kane lost only two men. Decades before Scott, Peary, and Shackleton, he was the original polar explorer. His premature death at age thirty-six forms a poignant code to Balf's riveting, well-researched tale. --Neal Thompson", "related": ["B00GB9ZQHQ"], "rank": -1, "title": "Farthest North", "author": "Todd Balf", "category": "History", "review_number": 14, "rating_average": 4.6429, "rating_total": 65.0}

We understand that the first novel published,The Baby Blue Rip-Off, was actually the second Mallory novel.Max Allan Collins:That’s right.No Cure for the Deathwas written first, at the University of Iowa’s Writers Workshop. I probably began it around 1969, when I was studying with Richard Yates, the great mainstream novelist. I wrote three novels as my MFA thesis,Bait Money,No Cure for the Death, andQuarry, all sharing the same small Midwestern setting, Port City, but otherwise unrelated. The idea was to demonstrate that a mystery or crime novel could be written with a non-urban setting. Private eye-type stories were usually set in New York or Los Angeles, and I wanted to use a setting where I’d actually lived. Port City was Muscatine, Iowa, the small town where I still live.Q:But Mallory isn’t a private eye.MAC:Not technically, but the novels use the Raymond Chandler-style first-person technique, and the general investigative approach of a private eye novel, though these stories are probably more “medium-boiled” than “hardboiled.” Mallory is a mystery writer, which is the excuse for him getting involved in mysteries, but he was not intended to be a series character.  Neither was the pro thief Nolan inBait Moneyor my hitman Quarry.  The three books in my MFA thesis were all designed to be standalones.Q:Why series then?MAC:Bait MoneyandNo Cure for the Deathboth sold in late 1972 to Curtis Books, where the editor asked for sequels to both. Later,Quarrysold to Berkley Books, and that editor asked for a series, too. I was glad to comply in all three cases, but it caused me trouble.  Nolan originally died at the end ofBait Money,Quarrywas awaiting seemingly inevitable assassination, and Mallory, well...he was just a mystery writer. I’d have given him a better excuse to solve mysteries if I’d known he was going on to four more books!Q:No Cure for the Death, why was the first book published second?MAC:Curtis Books bought two Mallory novels, but the company was swallowed up by a bigger publisher, Popular Library, who consigned my novels to the purgatory known as inventory.  For years, Popular Library’s editor assured me the books would be published, but before that ever happened, the rights reverted to me.No Cure for the Deathhad been very much of the late ‘60s/early ‘70s, with a strong Vietnam theme – some have called Mallory a hippie private eye.  By the early ‘80s, the book seemed dated.  The second novel,The Baby Blue Rip-Off, hadn’t dated at all.  So it came up into the first slot.  WhenNo Cure for the Deathwas published next, I added an author’s note to label it a prequel.Q:What were the circumstances of Mallory finally finding his way into print?MAC:In the early ‘80s, I wrote an eco-thriller calledMidnight Haulthat I submitted to Walker Books.  An editor there loved it and told me she was buying it, but then the top editor at Walker, Ruth Cavin, a very famous editor, called me to say that she likedMidnight Haul, but that it was too dark, and too much of a thriller, for the Walker line.  If I ever did a mystery, though, she wanted to see it.  As it happens, I had just gotten the rights back to the two Mallory novels, bundledThe Baby Blue Rip-Offoff to Ruth, who bought it in lightning speed.  Shortly thereafter,Midnight Haulsold to Foul Play Press.  The eco-thriller really is similar to the Mallorys, and if I had it to over, I’d probably rewriteMidnight Haulinto a Mallory novel.Q:The smalltown setting does seem to be part of Mallory’s appeal, though you take him out of Port City in bothKill Your DarlingsandNice Weekend for a Murder.MAC:That indicates the autobiographical nature of the books.Kill Your Darlingsis set in Chicago at a Bouchercon, the big mystery fan convetion, andNice Weekend for a Murderis set at Mohonk Mountain House, in upstate New York, where real mystery writers used to stage fake mysteries for guests...maybe they still do.  Anyway, my late friend and mentor Don Westlake was good enough to invite me there to participate, which became the basis forNice Weekend for a Murder.  Those two books seem to resonate very well with mystery fans, but my favorite of the Mallory novels by some distance isA Shroud for Aquarius, which is extremely autobiographical, as it deals with the death of a high-school friend of mine, my best friend actually, who was an apparent suicide ten years or so after graduation.Q:Have we seen the last of Mallory?MAC:Let’s see what new readers think, now that Thomas & Mercer are bringing the books back into print.  With Quarry, I’ve gone back and written new novels set in the ‘70s and ‘80s.  If I did Mallory again, though, I would bring up him into the present day, at my own present age.  He’s me, for better or worse.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "review_number": 11, "rating_average": 4.2727, "rating_total": 47.0}

On a rooftop across the street, 14-year-old orphan Buddy Easter watches the game with his invisible friend, Abner Doubleday. Outside the ballpark a dime-a-dance girl named Alice de Minuette tries to get a message to Babe Ruth, with whom she once had an affair, while being chased by Al Capone's men because she spurned his advances and unknowingly grabbed an envelope containing the gangster's business secrets. On the other side of town, Loren Woodville, a brilliant scientist with a controversial theory about Martians, prepares to jump off a bridge. At this moment, the Babe \"calls\" his famous home run and launches the ball literally into the stratosphere. It clears the stadium, the neighboring apartment buildings, the city itself. Buddy watches the ball and determines to follow it across the country so he can catch it when it lands. Loren, dangling upside down off the bridge, sees the magical baseball and is convinced that he's finally spotted an alien spacecraft. McAlpine is a gifted stylist, with clean, clear and muscular prose. Unfortunately its effectiveness is reduced because the story line--while striving for the \"magical\"--settles sometimes for the sentimental or the cute. Still, this baseball fantasy is a strong debut, and leaves us hoping that the author's vision will eventually rise to the level of his impressive literary talent.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "related": [], "rank": 2021249, "title": "Joy in Mudville", "author": "Gordon McAlpine", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

Writing articles for various prominent magazines, he began to develop a reputation as a competent investigative journalist. Phillips' novels often commented on social issues of the day and frequently chronicled events based on his real-life journalistic experiences.

Childhood holidays were spent in the Borders, for which he had a great love.  He was educated at Glasgow University and Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was President of the Union.

I signed 39 publishing agreements with a host of publishers and almost realized a cut on Vanessa Williams' \"Sweetest Days\" album; however, 39 times my dreams did not come to fruition. I have written many poems and short stories and one screenplay. I love movies and had seen over 1,500 by the age of 13 when there was snow on 13 channels after midnight. I have always enjoyed horror and from an early age wrote numerous short stories in that genre. Some of those early stories are in my first book entitled \"Black As Night. My favorite horror movies are Halloween, Night of the Living Dead, and the Evil Dead. My favorite movie of all time Is Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life with James Stewart.

Although they follow a definite pattern (as is the case with episode's)\neach episode is written as a stand-alone story in its own right - so don't be\nafraid to 'jump in' anywhere along the line.Aviemore, the small town at the centre of\nthe story, is very much a real place and certainly worth a visit if you are\never in Scotland. Indeed, most of the places mentioned in the stories are in\nfact real places, though the names may have been altered for privacy's sake.\nThe green lochan for instance is a fantastic place for a picnic - and it is\nactually an opaque green colour. Do fairies really wash their clothes there?Although these episodes are categorised as\ncontemporary romance, I have to admit that there is as much action and\nadventure included, especially in the later stories. Contemporary romance it\nseems, is a little more 'gritty' these days than Sally and Robert would be\nhappy with - the Highland idea of morals a little more adverse to 'getting you're\nkit out' perhaps!I have visited and stayed in Aviemore many\ntimes, and continue to do so whenever I get the chance. It is a quiet peaceful\ntown, surrounded by spectacular mountains and beautiful highland scenery. - Ideal\nfor long walks and planning the next Sally book! This Highland town is popular\nboth in summer and winter for the many outdoor pursuits available; with Skiing\nin the Cairngorm Mountains, being the\nmajor draw over the winter period.Through these stories, I invite you to share\nand experience (albeit vicariously) the life of Sally and Robert, along with\ntheir growing family; as they settle into life in the highlands of Scotland. Encountering\nadventure and tribulation as well as love and romance - even murder mystery ! - life's twists and turns ensure that drama\nand intrigue, is never far away from the Lindsey household.", "related": ["B00CH40Z6G"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Children's eBooks", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I wrote this book after I figured out ways that actually worked to keep track of everything without becoming overwhelmed...well, most of the time, anyway!Using the methods that I detail in this book, I have centralized my to-do tasks, relieved a lot of the stress I used to feel, and gained empowerment and control over my days. I don't often feel frazzled anymore, and I think that my family senses it. We are definitely living more peaceful, if still quite busy, lives.My tips are mostly based on using digital tools, although they can also be implemented using a regular paper and pen. Digital tools are my favorite because at least in my life, they are the most accessible and easy to sync together such as using a phone app that is also available on the web.The format of this book is easy to read, simple to follow, and easy to implement using a method of your choice...even if that's not a digital tool. I ultimately decided against two things:including a recommendation for one particular reminders app because every phone is differentincluding checklists in this particular book because everyone's priorities and to-do lists are differentI do have plenty of checklists in an upcoming book, however :)But I digress! I hope that the information in this book helps you get more from every minute in your day, that it helps eliminate some stress, and allows you more time for the things you want to do instead of just fitting in the things you need to do.Please enjoy and keep that feedback coming.

The magic began at the young age of eight years old, when Kyle stumbled upon a bookstore in Southeastern Massachusetts and a book called Good Magick. For the next few years Kyle practiced Witchcraft \"in the broom closet\" until he was fourteen, when he gave his aunts a tarot reading for the first time, surprising himself, and especially his aunts. This ignited a passion for the Old Religion in the young man, and thus his training began. He has now practiced Witchcraft for over two decades, being trained in - and now teaching others - the Old Ways of Witchcraft in five Traditions of Wicca and Witchcraft. At the age of eighteen he received his Certification in Crystal Healing Therapy. He is acknowledged as a Certified Clairvoyant by the School of Theology, and has privately worked for numerous local police departments along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. Though he began offering psychic readings professionally in Boston as a Boston Premier Psychic, he quickly became nation-wide.  He is the author of \"Firewolf's Book of Spells Book One,\"  \"Firewolf's Black Mirror Magick,\" and\"Simple Spells for a Happy Home.\" Kyle is also a popular and out-spoken lecturer and teacher on the Ancient Craft of the Southeastern Mediterranean Religions, The Science of the Craft, Herbalism, Tarot, Divination, Love Magick From Around the World, Benedicarian Witchcraft, and has been featured on talk-shows, radio interviews, magazines and popular publications such as The Union Tribune, City Beat Magazine, Channel 8 News with Larry Himmel, The Espresso, and much more. Since 2003, Kyle has founded three Witches' Covens in the United States, spanning throughout the country from the East Coast to the West.﻿", "related": ["B00934KDDI"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Religion & Spirituality", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He spent most of his childhood with his grandmother Efrosinia Verkhusha, a village healer.As a teenager Vladimir occasionally visited Father Feodorit, a priest of the Trinity-Sergiyev Monastery. Later he was shown there the picture «The One and Only» which he described in his second book before the picture was revealed to the world.Vladimir started an independent life early and left the parents' house at the age of 16. Since 1974 he lived in Novosibirsk and worked as a photographer with Novosibirskoblfoto, a service company.At the beginning of Perestroika (reforms of the late 1980s) he was the president of the Inter-Regional Association of Siberian Entrepreneurs. In 1994-5 he organized two large-scale trade expeditions with a fleet of river steamers along the River Ob along the route Novosibirsk -- Salekhard -- Novosibirsk at his own expense. On this trip, an encounter with Anastasia in the Siberian taiga changed his entire life.It had been a secret for a long time for relatives and friends what made him, an entrepreneur with ten years experience, to pledge his property and spend his savings on unprofitable trading trips. The mystery was revealed in his books with Anastasia as the main character. Vladimir Megre brought something really invaluable from the trips.Throughout 1996-2006 nine books were written by Vladimir Megre (The Ringing Cedars of Russia Series: Anastasia, The Ringing Cedars of Russia, The Space of Love, Co-Creation, Who Are We?, Book of Kin, The Energy of Life, The New Civilization, Rites of Love).In 2011 the author became Laureate of Gusi Peace Prize.", "related": ["B00CN1W1RO"], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Crafts, Hobbies & Home", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

The mother of five sons and the author of thirty-five published novels, she is the co-founder of Southwest Writers Workshop and cofounder and first vice president of Romance Writers of America.       Although she wrote her first novel at the early age of five (The Blackhawk Women Ride Again), she didn’t publish professionally until she began free-lancing while living outside the United States. When she moved back to the States, with more than a dozen articles and short stories to her credit, she decided to tackle novel writing again. Because of the explosion of the romance novel at that time, she wrote and sold her first submission, the historical romance Sweet Golden Sun, to Popular Library. Her editor was Kate Duffy who went on to establish a stellar name for herself in the publishing industry.      Ms. Bonds attributes her particular fascination with historical romances and, in particular, Native Americans, to authors she had read as a child and young woman such as Frank Yerby, Rafael Sabatini, James Fennimore Cooper, Dale Van Every, and Edna Ferber. The plight of the Native American as described in the novel Romana by Helen Hunt Jackson, most influenced Parris Afton Bonds.       Declared by ABC’s Nightline as one of the three best-selling authors of romantic fiction, the award-winning Parris Afton Bonds has been interviewed by such luminaries as Charlie Rose and featured in major newspapers as well as published in more than a dozen languages. She donates her time to teaching creative writing to both grade school children and female inmates. The Parris Award was established in her name by the Southwest Writers Workshop to honor a published writer who has given outstandingly of time and talent to other writers. Prestigious recipients of the Parris Award include Tony Hillerman and the Pulitzer nominee Norman Zollinger.", "related": ["B00ERBW21S"], "rank": 999959, "title": "The Flash of the Firefly", "author": "Parris Afton Bonds", "category": "Romance", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

He has been writing ever since, but his passion was re-sparked in the fall of 2009 when he decided to take his craft seriously. Since then, he has been very active in the entire writing process and community. In the spring on 2012, Burns founded The Ottawa Writer's Guild (www.theottawawritersguild.wordpress.com) - a collection of writers in Ottawa, KS dedicated to the love of writing. In addition to writing, he is also teaching Creative Writing in the Ottawa, KS community. Books and Projects: The Movement: A Children's Story for Grown-ups is his third completed work; second complete novel - yet first publication. The sequel, The Movement: Revisited, is the completion of the tale begun in the first installment. Edem's Flight is the third book in The Movement Series. It is a spiritual successor and side story to the first two works. The Movement: Concluded - is a complete anthology including all three works in The Movement Series. His other works include Pieces of Me and a million little gods: the clearwater chronicles. All his books are available in paperback at most online retailers, as well as on Kindle. Dave has also created a magazine entitled Uncarved: The Literature and Arts Magazine. The second issue is now available.

Liora is considered one of the leading experts in Israel in the field of nutrition and dieting with NLP. She is a sought-after speaker on clinical nutrition, Chinese medicine and healing herbs, NLP and guided imagery, both by doctors and dieticians and by the general public. She is a consultant to companies on nutrition and organizing conferences. Liora discovered Chinese medicine and healing herbs after concluding that clinical medicine and nutrition do not provide a comprehensive solution for all health-related problems. At 1996 she began exploring the possibilities offered by Chinese medicine, herbs and aromatherapy and has since used them in all her work as a healer, writer and speaker. She has a master's degree in Chemistry and Pathology from the School of Medicine at the University of Tel Aviv. During her studies she published several articles in important scientific publications in the field of nutrition. Her clinical experience encompasses working with thousands of patients including kids, in hospitals, public clinics and her private clinics. Liora writes columns in the press, and on the Internet, about nutrition and healthy and dietetic cooking. She is a popular guest on radio and television shows and has a regular television spot of her own. Liora developed her method for changing nutritional habits, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and slimming, set out in her book The Chinese Diet For REAL Slimming and Health, (which was a bestseller in its expenditure immediately published) after she realized that Eastern wisdom and Western lifestyles could be combined to produce valuable health-related rewards. The method is based on a wealth of experience as a practitioner and is offered to the reader as a user-friendly guide after being tried, tested and proven with thousands of patients including kids. Another book written by Liora -365 days without excuses was published in Israel in 2009 and was a best-seller.

He has written extensively about being an ex-pat, but prefers fiction.  He experimented with Amazon as a platform for self-publishing by making public a short science-fiction story called 'Like Minded'.  He followed that with a longer, novella-length YA/Crossover story called The Wonderful World of Linus Bailey, and then a full novel for adults, The Midlife of Dudley Chalk. Further experimentation resulted in an audio version of The Wonderful World of Linus Bailey, given away free at Podiobooks.com, which achieved over 13,000 downloads in the first 12 months.  He then produced a more polished audio version for sale on Audible.com.

When not writing, she can be found with her nose in a book or graphic novel, watching Anime, playing video games, or creating beautiful pieces of chain mail and wire jewelry.

Her life has never been boring. Born October 14, 1953 in Canada, she hasn’t died yet, narrowly dancing past the inevitable on hundreds of occasions.  Her last words will be, “Watch this.”  She’s usually on a dirt bike, raft or pair of skis, and if she can’t be found outdoors, she’s probably baking. Carol gave birth to two Zen masters, daughter Whitney and son Mike, and was “como la mama” to forty others.  She believes that raising good children is the most important thing one can do in life. Carol attended Wellesley College, Wesleyan University and received her law degree from Washington University in St. Louis.  She has won multiple awards for her legal work and her writing over the years. Her bags are always packed and sightings of her have been reported in New Zealand, Hawaii and the catecombs under Paris.  She loves languages and makes passable attempts at French, Spanish, Greek and Navajo—not bad for the daughter of a hard-rock miner with a ninth-grade education. “Being friends with her is like getting a new little red wagon every day.”—David Long.", "related": ["B00FH34BKU"], "rank": 4235161, "title": "Fire Drifter 2", "author": "Carol Bellhouse", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

I have no quarrel with such an expose, it’s just not for me. If you are reading this assume you really do want to know About Me, and I want to give you that, from me, so here you go. I write about the Dominant/submissive dynamic, because I am a submissive, and having experienced the thrills and spills that D/s romance offers, I don’t just feel qualified to do so, but I am truly, deeply and wholly passionate about the lifestyle. Every second of every day it’s on my mind and in my heart, which, by the way, has been shattered into a thousand tiny pieces, and made shining and whole and filled with joy. Such are the highs and lows Dominance and submission can bring. Having tried and failed with vanilla relationships, during which I was constantly frustrated and unfulfilled, I came to an understanding and acceptance that vanilla simply doesn’t work for me. If you read my blog you can learn more about the addiction to this lifestyle, and while every interaction is unique, each share one truism. The submissive wants and needs the romantic domination of her man, and the Dominant wants and needs the gift of submission his girl offers.

Annie and Lee are burnt-out bartenders in rural Texas, whose friendship is about all they have good going for them. Everything abruptly changes when Annie gets a phone call from a lawyer who informs her that she's been left property by a distant relative. The property includes the Safe Harbor, a historic hotel in Riverside, Oregon. Annie and Lee decide to ditch their jobs, go up to Oregon, and become innkeepers. What they're not bargaining for is the presence of some rather malign presences in the deserted, yet splendid establishment, which was about to be reopened fifty years before by Annie's distant cousin and her husband, who both disappeared the day before the grand opening.I love nothing more than settling in with a good, old-fashioned haunted house story. The Safe Harbor, by Renna Olsen, is a perfect specimen of the horror genre. Annie and Lee are credible, strong, and resourceful women who throw caution to the wind in setting up house in a very spooky hotel with a decidedly nasty history. The hotel is fabulously large, ornate, and very scary. Olsen makes the reader feel as though they are exploring the basement, tunnels, and attic rooms along with Annie and Lee. This is not the place you want to stay in, or even be alone in, for any amount of time, and there's more than a few reasons why that's true. The Safe Harbor Hotel has a history which is fascinating and deadly, and inhabitants who are evil and menacing, but the reader, unlike Annie and Lee, can enjoy the thrills and chills from a safe distance. Renna Olsen's The Safe Harbor is great fun and very highly recommended.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

It's sequel, \"Klandestine Maneuvers\", was published by the same company in 2005.

Twenty-two years as a military wife has shown KaLyn the world and the men and women who protect us every day. She believes that military wives are so much like their husbands in their resilient fortitude; they do what they have to do to get the job done, because they are the only ones who can. When Daddy’s gone, no one else is going to take out the garbage, replace the light bulb, see that the oil in the car is changed, and hold the crying toddler—or teenager—when the world seems like more than they can handle. Then they go to a cold bed and pray their beloved husband is safe and stays that way. The next day they do it all over again, many while holding down full-time jobs, going to school and volunteering their time. In her stories, KaLyn’s heroines are strong women, like the ones she knows in real life. This is why she dedicates her books to military wives and the men and women who serve. Thirty years in public relations taught her fact can be stranger than fiction and science has moved so far beyond what most people would consider real. She leaves it up to the reader to separate truth from imagination. After writing for corporations, sometimes pushing the fictional line, KaLyn decided to take the leap and began writing romance a few years ago. Her international travels enable her share the smells, tastes and scenery of other countries and cultures with her readers. Finally landing in Eastern Tennessee after nineteen moves, KaLyn lives on what she jokingly refers to as a micro-plantation filled with gardens, cattle, and quail. When she’s not hiding in her basement office writing, she’s often at the shooting range or paddling on the river that flows directly from the Great Smoky Mountains.

On leaving the Army, Joll worked first in investment banking, but the boredom of City life led him to switch careers and become an arms salesman. After ten years of dealing with tin pot dictators in far away countries, he moved into real estate public relations where he had to deal with dictators of an altogether different type. His experiences in the Army and afterwards, involving the famous and the infamous, are related in his yet to be published memoires, Anecdotal Evidence, an account which promises to cause considerable consternation in certain quarters. From his earliest days Joll has written articles, features, short stories and reportage. One such piece of writing led to an early brush with notoriety when an article he had penned anonymously in 1974 for a political journal ended up as front page national news and resulted in a Ministerial inquiry. Most recently, Joll has written the text for Uniquely British: A Year in the Life of the Household Cavalry, an illustrated account of the Household Cavalry from the Royal Wedding to the Diamond Jubilee. Since leaving the Army in 1975, Joll has also been involved in devising and managing major charity fund-raising events. Most recently, he has focused on devising, writing and directing events for military charities. These include the Household Cavalry Pageant, the Royal Hospital Chelsea Pageant, the acclaimed British Military Tournament, an annual show that he writes and directs, and in June 2012, a military tattoo in Hyde Park for the Diamond Jubilee. When not writing, directing or lifting the lid on the cess pits of British history, Joll is an adviser on State ceremonial to Independent Television News.", "related": [], "rank": -1, "title": "", "author": "", "category": "Literature & Fiction", "review_number": 0, "rating_average": 0.0, "rating_total": 0.0}

In his business career, his work involved the development of low-light-level sensors for military and scientific uses. He is one of the co-inventors and developer of the Digicon, the multi-channel photon counting image tubes used in both of the original Hubble Space Telescope spectrographs. He was awarded special recognition for this work by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. His longest career was designing and building industrial versions of the IBM PC. An early project was with Teledyne Ryan, helping with the design of the cockpit data recorder for the Boeing 747. His subsequent work with industry and the military resulted in the use of Microsoft DOS and Windows in a wide variety of non-desktop applications. He was editor-in-chief of the Windows CE Tech Journal, a Miller-Freeman publication. His hobbies have always been airplanes, gardening, cooking, and golf. Writing has been a life-long pursuit, now more for pleasure than for business. Today his books involve cooking, aquaponics, and books intended to induce curiosity and wonder in young people about math, science, and engineering.
